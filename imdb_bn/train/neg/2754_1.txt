My original review of this movie was written only in words * 2000 times. Although it was a very critical criticism, I thought my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress; The expression of his face does not change once in this film, he does not show fear, happiness or depression. His skill in the language of the body is mostly left his eyes left and right, and Jack does not know. He is an impersonator sculptor who I guess has a lot of botox. Filmmaking faces lack of face to face, but due to an unhappy love relationship with a lead actor, which does not seem to shake from anywhere, and within hours of meeting with each other, they fall in love with the beach. The main actor, whose hair sought more attention than him, was moderate and he never once thought that he was actually in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps fierce acting, story and story inaccuracies I have seen tampon advertisements with more composition than this movie. There is no improvement in character, they just think and do something I can never believe. <br /> <br /> <br /> A snake on a plane but it was so hard to flick a serious action that I could not even laugh. I believe that now I have a brain tumor from seeing this film and I think about the different ways that I could use the budget and the CGI team to make it much better. If I buy it in DVD then I will cut the DVD into pieces, then burn it and then melt it hydrochloric acid for better measurements. Do not see this film!
