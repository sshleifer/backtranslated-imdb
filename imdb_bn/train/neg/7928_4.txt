Actually, the film is not terrible nor is it sai-fi. With a very powerful Christian religious theme, this shortlisted content of the movie and there is no doubt. The second-level actors did half the decent work reading their annoying role. Sydney Penny is the only good actress to play the role of her mother ... I will not waste the film, it is either Christ or Anti-Christ. If you do not cover any Christian rituals with universal texts, then avoid showing this film. <br /> <br /> Being non-Christian, I had to force myself to see this movie because I wanted to write this review. It is a sad fact that the science-fiction channel had to bring the film to the final evening.
