Francis Farmer's first film; At 22, he is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is a great voice, but the song is not his best. Martha Roy and Bob Burns are striking, but her comedy, probably the best of her time, is really authentic today. Roy Rogers also features a singing role. If you're a fan of Francis Farmer and perhaps a Bing Crosby fan in my view, it's worth watching.
