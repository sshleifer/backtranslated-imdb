When this ruthless version of Jules Verne's classic "Journey from the Center of the Earth" is spinning in your grave, you can hear the funny words you hear. The center of this world's "headline" journey is the only theme of this 80-minute artwork. Otherwise, this drastic production is not worth all the new and observers. In fact, the director, IMDB.com, writes here that he has just eight minutes to "travel to the center of the world" and "Dalmman" helmet Albert Pine's "studio" with his own "Alien to LA" with Kathy Ireland. Obviously, the producers went out of money and to satisfy foreign contractual obligations, they were paired with Pieun's Siegel director Rastie Lemornde. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ In the center of the world "Hawaii is performed in contemporary times, combining two colleagues, a British grandmother, and dog to live together. Richard (" Blond Date "Paul Carapotos) and his comic book, Wrath Brother Brian (" Viner Science " Elan Mitchell-Smith) is going to discover a cave. The heroine, Christina ("Underworld" Nikola Cowper), 'Nannies and us' Christine's life was long dreamed of when she was a daughter, but she did less to do the work of her grandmother, yet her sympathetic supervisor, Mrs. Ferry (Linda Marshall of "Africa Express") sent her to Hawaii, Christine's new client, Rock Star. Billy Fowl ("Dummedday" by Jeremy Crutchley) who has been able to revive his flagging career.  ষ কনসার্টের সময় নির্ধারণ করছেন, তার নাম বার্নার্ড। ফাউল ক্রিস্টিনা একটি কুকুরের দিন স্পা বার্নার্ড নিতে চায়। ক্রিস্টিনা তার ট্যাক্সিের আগমনের অপেক্ষায় রয়েছেন যখন একজন নিরীহ মোট পরিচারক দুর্ঘটনাক্রমে ঝুড়ি রাখে যা রিচার্ডের জীপে বার্নার্ড লুকিয়ে রাখে। You see, foul has hid his dog in a basket because the motorsil management strictly prohibits pets in their premises. The dog has made the dog incognito like a human child. However, Christina took a cab and instructed the driver to follow Richard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That Richard has returned to his town, but he has other plans. Happily, Christina's sons joined and lost, and then found herself in a lost city of Atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator located in the center of the world. The Atlantis rulers repeatedly informed their citizens that there is no life in the page. Stumble on onto our Atlantis by the hero and heroine accident. Atlantis is similar to a disco and they see everyone like straight out of a punk rock opera. Atlanta's General Reichov (Gentle du Plessis of "Operation Heat Squad") is attacking Clint with the first human race, including Vanda Sankunusem ("Caddy of Essential Opacity"), to attack Atlantis. Probably, General Rikov's tricks failed to rule Atlantis and overthrow the world, and preserve the day of our hero and heroine. <br /> <br /> "The hottest journey to the world" is a hate. The film looks like a comedy despite its ridiculous ridicule about dictatorship. Albert Pine is one of my favorite low budget action directors, but he blew it on this lightweight shambles in a science fiction sea.
