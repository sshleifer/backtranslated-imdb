Nicholas Cage Actor Wicker Man is not a good movie, but I can not honestly say I'm sorry to see it. On the negative aspects of the film, such as horror and lengthy scenes where the girl is looking for a girl, like a misunderstanding, following another hallucination, following a sequence of dreams - with a confusion etc. . But it is not worth the accommodation when it comes to like a movie. Instead, here are five reasons why you want to look bad, though it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It is hard to deny that it has some really vague ideas, only the problem is its chessy, strange fun execution If there is nothing else, this is a movie that can inspire you to watch the original movie of 1973, or read short stories based on it. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheesy horror / thriller, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It is quite clear that instead of using the green screen or broad set, the position was impressed, so we can see some great scenes. There are many nicely designed shots. This is a very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3 Nicholas Cage is not so much actor as he is a power in nature. If you think that you are his fan, it seems impossible to play a "normal guy" in the cage. He always brings curiosity or inferiority in the type of characters he plays, and personally, I always fascinate him in any movie. Whether Nicholas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique strength to play, and he never gets bored. He's a wicker man terrible, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student may possibly write a copy of a paper in this film, because it seems to be a tough anti-feminist film sometimes made. "Look?" You can write, "What happens when women are allowed to run in society!" Also, the harmony between this "Summersisle" society and a bee colony is quite interesting and valuable notices. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read this, you probably have seen a YouTube video that has probably become very popular: a collection of "highlights" collections from the film, of which one is running around a beer-beer and of course, infamous "bad guys" !! " Line. This scene is sunny out of context, and they are still completely funny, when they see the film's fullness. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD used for the Blockbuster for around $ 5 ... When you work on it, it's about every one dollar around the dollar. This is a very good deal. <br /> <br /> Note: It is best to see the version of the movie, and it is better to combine the theatrical version only for its small component, which is a Camio Franco from James.
