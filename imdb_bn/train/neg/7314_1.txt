Anyone who reads my reviews for Uwe Boll's "Allan in the Dark", remembering that I compared your unmarked task with the fragments of human waste so that every hair on your arm is drawn. Well, take the same analogy one step ahead with this parallel garter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your tooth without the new dentist. Do that, and Eli Roth's "cabin fovever" has a general idea of ​​everything. <br /> <br /> I never believe that a film was able to topple the bitterly crazy bowlers. As "the worst movie ever made." But, honestly, I must say "cabin fovere" is very close. This is another tragic excuse for a motion picture that was not a valid reason to fully integrate with any form of theater release. Anyone who has created the single most annoying and strong patchwork of a movie, which I think I have seen throughout life, to claim love for a terrible style like Eli Roth. How do you screw up a story like this? This plot was not bad except for the bad writing, and think of all the unnecessary and unreasonable comedy. A movie working on an extraordinary meat eating virus was much better than what we were out of here for the chariot. This script has failed me so much. And, when I do not doubt the genius of this director, I know that the ball has made a great deal of time in such a way that it can very well rearrange the awful form. <br /> <br /> It's a missed opportunity to say production actually will play a total of words. The amount of blood and unusual special effects can not even save it, and this is an element that I can usually go to. There was nothing really about "cabin fovere" which I could easily recommend to anyone. When three quarters of people walk through the theater, you know that the movie is drowning fast. My best advice for this reading will be to hire only before buying. One was enough for me to see that I would probably not bother it again.
