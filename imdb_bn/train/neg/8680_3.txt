I just end up watching this film and WOW that was bad. Actually the only thing that kept me observant was that it was funny that it was fun. The character of the characters is ridiculous, they hit the shootout in the hip-dramatic way, their incredibly bad performance (bad guys all dragged to the streets, or actually the actors?), The incredibly bad distribution of the line, their unreasonable activities (if you try to enter through a gateway And try to shoot through shoots, but obviously the Duckernb shoots Is !!). This image must break some records for the worst written and distributed lines. <br /> <br /> The camera work was also bad - you can hardly see what's going on in war scenes because of camera angles and shiny switching. <Br> <br /> I voted for "1", without which I liked Chib and Sidekick Su Shehomie, and in some of my scenes there was entertainment: 1) Villen broke his hand so that the bones went out of the skin (2) a drug To eat a brown animal (a monkey ??), a meat clover is eaten by the body through hacking. 3) Soni has chemotherapeutic surgery to a man with some fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually the big fan of Sony Chibo, but this is actually somebody's value. I've seen about 7 or 8 films in it and have come to the conclusion that they are worth watching (and they are awesome!) Street Fighter Series and The Killing Machine I heard the executor and the Golgo 13 heard it. I recommend sticking to those ones
