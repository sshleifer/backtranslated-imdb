If you thought the original to 83 was bad then try this modern day best composition. How could you ask for more bad? Well ... at least first you were jogging Ally Sheedy in a sports bra. Without updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for replay, unfortunately this same tragic story The first one who saw the first can be seen where the next scene / line of the story is fine. And no one can see the first ... Lucky to consider that once you have seen it once. Maybe for another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
