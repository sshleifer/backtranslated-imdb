I admire Glover and Miss Goldberg. I saw the whole family with my family and some friends. I had no idea what the movie was. After many discussions, we all agree that this was not a good effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's very sticky, and there's a little comedy. I'm hoping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See all the movies of Mr. Glover and Miss Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend the evening.
