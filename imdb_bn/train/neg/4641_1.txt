Sometimes I really enjoy violent movies .... Those who sometimes get the results when people (even genius) bring good intentions to create movies and for some reason it can be a disaster. Movies "Killer Tomatoes Attack", "External Place to Plan 9", "Man-Hands of Fat", and "Heaven's Gate" etc. <br /> So, when I heard this movie, "Rachel's Attic" was considered by many people to be the worst movie of a decade, Naturally I just want to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, am I sorry for this decision. This movie is out of the way .... It is so bad that it is not as enjoyable as normal bad movies. Acting, filming, scripting, etc. is worse than the budget movie: The word is utterly horrific, "plot" is completely stagnant, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's everyone's waste time and money. At least porn movies can break the monotony, though this ridiculous nightmare shrinks a leaky apple and a "crazy hunting" tea party. <br /> <br /> The light does not exist. Many "scenes" take place in semi or entire darkness, which are probably the same. "Writer-director" (I use terms conditionally), David Tieber, tried to get weird with the bond scene ... but the results were not so ridiculous, but the results would be ridiculous. There are some nudity, but it is an abnormal quality that it actually works as a sexual suppressor. I can go forever and not be able to judge all the errors and flaws of this truly terrible waste. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid this train destroyment. I know that despite my negative comments (or perhaps due to this), you may still be tempted to see if this part of the trash is really bad ... but believe me it .... than I say Worse, and you absolutely, improper (and spend) profitable experiences, and waste your money if you buy or rent.
