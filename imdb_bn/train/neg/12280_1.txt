I have seen one of the performance at the Denver level and have not been less impressed. The word "waist" says it all. Part of a body. Nothing shy here I can tell my doctor, "My left hand is a little hurt after tennis" or "My vagina is hurting after cycling" with equal or more social commentary. I have heard that it may be "tricept" for all entertainment or fundamentalist comments. Monologues dull but delivered with drama, the subject was old, and I was alternately bored and annoyed. Once I think I laughed but apparently it was not when I was supposed to. Of course this is not really a hit. Oh, and spoilers: There was a lesbian! Oh, wait, maybe not, come to think about it. And inappropriate fondling! And a crack mother! That's the cover about it.
