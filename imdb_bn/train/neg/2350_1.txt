This show was ridiculous. Begin writing, dialog to suck. Craig is not the only person who can work his way out of paper. It was Thursday night, it was definitely great to see the clock with some beers. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> This was a drama / unknown comedy. I did not care what happened to any characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, because they did not reveal what they published, the dialogue around them was terrible, which was terrible. I want to say, the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, the recent scenes that took place were terrible. <br /> So, let's review. Everything sucked all the time. Flashback scenes sucked, played only in the writing, dialogue and Craig's. Although music is ruled.
