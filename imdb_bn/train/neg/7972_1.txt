I love B movie ... but let's ... it was not worth a grade ... the last thing was stupid ... B / C there was no real ending !!! Not to mention that it comes to its own life ... I mean no light storm or crazy demon power ?? Slowly like hell and then they start losing one character after another like a 15-minute period ... and I will not even start the piece of the thing without killing a man without his head .... Still you do with his so-called "new jigsaw puzzle" You can not even wake up .... As long as you do not have anything good to do ... ID ID shows before id ID ID anyone who recommends this movie otherwise ... oh And to make other movie totems better, you can see that the man threw it away from the basement scene based on an animal .. It was funny as a hell and probably the only good part of the film's misuse.
