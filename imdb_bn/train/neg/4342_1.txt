I have to say one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go, but it's worse than messed up. First of all cast all the mistakes, where did that van peeble (shit actor BTW) and Puff came to Dad ??? It seems that Carlito came from the hood, and began to quarrel with some real idiots. This image "Carlitos Way" does not judge anybody. I'm very happy that the "Carlisace Way" section came out first, if I had seen this junk first, then I could not afford the passino version. And anyway, casinos are supposed to read this story, it seems to have been crap and instead of seagulls. Carlito Way: Rise to Power - 1 in 10. Carlito Way - 9 out of 10
