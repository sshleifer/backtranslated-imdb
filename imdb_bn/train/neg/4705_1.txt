This show and the band were my favorite memories when I was assembled with a bunch of my friends who were hateful Nbb and they had a big bonfire and we threw them into a CD and movie DVD and a band of photos and band members in the song and the song Dancing "Ding Dong the Dog Dog" dancing a happy mess around the burning stuff when singing. It was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with this show Coptel God. I hate it very much. Get rid of the painful car. You guys really suck! You really destroy the entire channel! No crime or nothing, but you must have life, I mean, really, who stupid fools listen to singer who can not sing! You really will get a life as horrible words and Hobos or something without Roselina. She is really beautiful But still, you guys!
