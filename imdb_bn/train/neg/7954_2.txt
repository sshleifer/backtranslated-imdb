OK this movie was "unique" we would say. Carey Fisher was the most talented film in the film, although he thought that Koki was in trouble. But he said that he can not think of it a lot. Well his excuses but everyone left ??? I can not imagine all of them had coke problem. Whatever it was not bad at all, I think the plot was right and it was some pretty funny moments. Although the thing that led the man to his head was very violent for my taste. Oh well I guess I was disappointed because the Carrie liner was so awesome and this movie did nothing for him.
