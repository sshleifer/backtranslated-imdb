I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt that I can make it a second time. Lindsey Lohan's physical appearance is largely for entertainment. The fun of Matt Dillon (think of Mariah), and the more serious Michael Heaton's resurrection. It was not a fun romp, it was a bug, but it was worth watching. One of my main disappointments from the film is Herbby, most of the time, R2D2 was developed in antics. In the 30-minute second half, I was bored with the effect of my eyes on the head and the friend Fender Fender repeatedly made the same reaction from me. Watch it with your little ones, that is, "baby brackets", and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
