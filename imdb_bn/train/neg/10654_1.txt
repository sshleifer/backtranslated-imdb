Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant security pin ....... This terrible movie is the best description sound. I love the Chesie horror movie and saw hundreds ... but it's the worst. The plot is thin and humorous, a hated act, the script is completely ridiculous (how best is the police and how the killer ends with it) - The dresses are sick and funny in the same measure, big hair, bounce bounce, men's belts Show the instruments (Men who really wear them !!) And the music is just the synthesizer trash that plays over and over again ... almost every scene is taking trashy music, boobs and paramedics body ... and the gym is still not closed for mourning !! It's a bad movie to make fun of each other, whose only campaign looked back to the disaster of the 80s and the old sunny view of what was worse then.
