: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the lively love of love. I was really waiting a long time to see it, and eventually Holmur got the chance to be re-broadcast on Thursday night. I love the first three "love" movies but it was not something that I think it's going to be. The whole film was sad and depressed, there were many caves, and the editing was very poor - many scenes outside the context I also think that the death of the baby girl soon happened and the film's presence does not seem right. Looks like some actors did not really want to stay there - they were all passionate. There seems to be no interaction between Mrs. and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the author of the book wrote more books. It seems like every film that has been made, which goes far beyond the words of Genet. I want to say in the movie that they did not say anything about mine and two boys or Clark, because it hurt. And I think Missy and Willis responded to Casey's death and heard instead of listening. <br /> <br /> So far in four movies, I would say that the lover of love is my favorite one. I hope the book will be followed further with the next four films and if Clark's character is in them, I hope he has received a greater part and I hope the part is not so soft. I hope Skeet and Cookie and even Marty have more, but the script writer knows what's in the store later.
