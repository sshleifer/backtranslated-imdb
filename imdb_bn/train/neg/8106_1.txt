Seriously, why would the American and French actors say Czech in a fake Russian accent, to speak in perfect English? I'm a man, so I've enjoyed unnecessary nudity - but there will be more of a soft porn flickr, and at least not express its artisticity. <br /> <br /> All the political statements where the painful behavior-director has heard the condemnation? The performance was long and composer, and comic relief was never fun. The letters were very shallow, and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous I am reading a short story (not intense light flexibility), and there is something good about the type of writing (though its themes are a big male fantasy) - I would say the film has not shown any benefit of the Cundar style.
