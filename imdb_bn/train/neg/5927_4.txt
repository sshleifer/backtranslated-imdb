I am very unreasonable right guy, so when I call a sexist, then I actually reduce the leadership of the ladies guests, played by Diana Mulder. Miranda Jones Despite all his supposed brightness and self-control, nothing else inside, but the big, jealous, irrational child, you've got his platform now, even after his tech commercial mercenary, when he tried to kill Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, a shocking anger Outside, but instead it glimpsps first. (You think he could only shut his eyes and enter the room and make the box very easy) before leaving the boys, he took the enterprise out of the galaxy as an irrational place. Well, the ship is stuck in the long, at that time they could contact and talk to a good lady. "A brain with Spock Medusan has been mixed so that we can get home. I mean if you supply our supplies to beetch and want to stay away until you die?" But the true Star Trek Fashion lady is a jealous monster who shakes and fails when the concept is pronounced, even when her Mudusan statue tells her to keep quiet and go with them. So, he forgets to keep a tighter deviation with the spoken spell on his visa, which makes the speech insane. Kirk, naturally, how he did the total noise and he was ashamed to fix his speech with the help of higher telepathic powers. Of course, the Lady and the Meduzan went to the end and everyone was forgiven. You often see President Bat Star Galactica coming out of an aircraft witch for his destructive stunts. But in Star Trek lands, women are allowed to be totally irrational and cruel, but at the same time it seems to have sexual equality. What I mean by this is by sexist
