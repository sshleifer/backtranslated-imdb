I now saw four Bo Derek vehicles operated by her husband John; Of course all is quite awesome, of course, but this certainly poking. Showing normal flimsy plot, bad scripting ?? By the director, naturally ?? And not to mention gratuitous nudity by starring, starring, it relates to losing her husband husband Anthony Quinn (she always took her shotgun suicide by saying he was praised Hemingway!) But those who appeared and continued to speak with him In fact, he wants to return to the other, small body ?? But it is really the end of the scene! Derek is always as lovely, and yet naive game (!) ?? Especially a discrete mid section that followed her by a tenant killer at a spa. Quinn, too, usually big-life (read: hammy) is here, but this easily forms his Nadir; Besides, for most of the time, he worked from a piece of glossy plastic (perhaps a bit advised to stay at Limbo)! Then his 'replacement' is clearly a kind of handsome stud, who does not have the talent or even personality closeness. Also did Hollywood veterans Don Murray (Queen's best friend and b as business advisor) and Julie Niemer (later Queen's guardian angel)? Plus a wonderful camio appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed this in his resume ')! John Derek also said that he did not have his own painters in this movie, that the last achievement was filled with gratefulness for many people involved in the inefficient (and pure) expression of artificial gratitude, and Gahsts could not remove it in the 1990 Razzie Awards Board!
