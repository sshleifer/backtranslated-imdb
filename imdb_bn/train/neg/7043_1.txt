I was ready to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater exam, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers were a lot of bike enthusiasts, and from there decided to make a movie shamelessly. <br /> <br /> This is often unwanted. A lot of footsteps of cyclists walking along the same music round the clock Unfortunately, Rene Harmon is just in the movie. Harmony will probably livened things. Perhaps he had other commitments to greet this image. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikes terrorize a small town. Fights, killings, a coward police, a secret mechanic etc. One of the bikes always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to separate him from another misfortune. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to offer the script. In one scene, one woman assaulted a woman and shouted in the face of the lady, "You are all the same, you are all the same!". We came back to the scene a minute later and he again announced that "you are all the same!". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> We also know that the marriage of medieval mechanical Joe and young Susie was canceled. Susie is going to college, and we have suddenly learned that Joe's marriage is still going on (but with another bride). The end
