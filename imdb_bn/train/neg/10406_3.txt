Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> The author of the first draft is officially out of the ideas. I'm quite good at first filming for a big fan and first two signals direct video. Tremors 4: Legend starts, however, a very dull movie. Where's the Hack Grobod ??? <br /> <br /> Because of the relative lack of groovins in the first 90 minutes, I am sure that this series of series is considered a "study of character". Unfortunately, there is not an attractive character in the film except Billy Dragra, which is given very few lines, rarely and rarely gives very little screen time. How the 2nd and 3rd films were preserved, Michael Gros's presence was like Bart Gammer Whenever there is no action on the screen, then you can be sure that Bart Gammer is going to be very much listening and / or looking good. However, this movie plays Gross Hiram Gammar as a very poor and annoying alternative. <br /> <br /> As well as when the Gobind (The Dart Dragon in this movie) is on screen, they look good but it is as good as it is. <br /> <br /> I was when I saw that the tremors were listed in 4 101 minutes long. Very good for direct video. But after watching this, I'm sure this movie is very good 15 minutes. The dialogue is that annoying that stretches long and is not ahead of any plot. Was there any storm to make this movie? I do not think there may have been more time and should have spent in scripts. <br /> <br /> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 for selling the package .... Tunda !!! I fate to get the free # 1 for luck, # 4 Good after seeing the illusion 4 I think I paid for the original and this mess got free, I can not imagine to give a single dime to imagine. For fans of the series it is better to forget that Semester 4: The legend starts even even in the present. <br /> <br /> Imagination 4: Legend starts 10 out of 3
