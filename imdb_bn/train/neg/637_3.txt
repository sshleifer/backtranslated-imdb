Good Earth is not a great movie in any way, it's a common way. Maybe it was different in the 1930s but who wants to see the life of the peasant. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Louise Renaar and Paul Muni are acting in a wonderful way but the film is dragged too long. I could tell you the first actor to finish this movie. The little Wang Fuun (Muni) is a small farmer who does not want to be like his father. They both love their wives as they live on their bed of death. The film is going to be a whole 360 ​​next to a generation next. There was also no good character actor or funny moments in this photo, it was unrealistic elements about lasting as a farmer during a crisis.
