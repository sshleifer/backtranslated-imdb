When I was a child we were always in the baybet, and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie in the movie. This is one of the films we saw. One of the stupid movies I've ever seen, I think it could be Walt Disney photo photo! A martyr is eliminated in the world, becomes a human, friendships with people and tries to do whatever he can to come back. But he is confused by the wonders of the world. The only good comment I can choose from is the likes of futurist Christopher Lloyd, like Martinique, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Jeff Daniels Team Oahara, Elizabeth Hurley Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah Leigh. But apart from that it is a complete shit. Poor!
