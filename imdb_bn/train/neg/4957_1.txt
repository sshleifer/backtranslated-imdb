It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The entire premises of this event is 'If you can not defeat anyone, there is a big weapon to help you' Batman is not everything about weapon, he uses his wireless and hook and batmobile It's not everybody beat everybody when he comes up with some exciting newcomers, and I do not know where they got the idea for a buttboat or whatever. All the villains have been destroyed Mr. Fridge is a sympathetic scientist from a little criminal criminal who had fallen into some crying things.Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dirty costume.Penguin is now a Nizwa with 50 feet tall top hat.Ventriloquist now The scarface is called the whole centerpiece for the dummy character. They even got a fool idea of ​​making a giant! Wtf? And two b Rap character change, the Joker and the Riddler is that. The Riddler in a gothic / retro teenage freak has changed.
