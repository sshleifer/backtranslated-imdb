This movie was absolutely terrible! I could not fathom how to produce this movie. There is nothing against film throwing, of course, it's the fault of the writing team. You take the old average plots - let us dance our way to be poor and vain - or STEP in this case. But there is no match for this true plot - or at least one that will take care of it. Canadian-speaking actors are supposed to be in an American setting - this picture is very flat. In a positive note, the command was very good and the film was also very good. It seems the production budget was very generous. My only request is that this group goes out alone and looks for real screenlines to help bring live words to movies. The net result - how he is removed how he sucks.
