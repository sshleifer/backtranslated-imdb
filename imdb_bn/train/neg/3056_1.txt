Before I see it, I saw some pretty bad Christmas movies. But once seen, "Jingle All Way Way" "The Godfather" is better than that. "Santa Claus" is a perfect film to help Santa about some children, but it seems to be often a fraud. Santa's Jolly Ho Who Ho is replaced by an evil, devil smile that I am sure that many children have been turned out of Christmas. This genocide plot is very strange, which matches all the performance and dialogue. Santa lives high on Earth in the North Pole where he and the children around the world are ready for Christmas. But there is an enemy named Santa Pitch, or Satan. The pitch tried to destroy Santa Christmas by three boys on the pitch, and made the diversation to remove the chimneys and heat the door. When the pitch gives the reason for attacking Santa, then Santa's helper Pedro and Marlin depend on the wizard to get this sequo out of Santa. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Santa is talking about giving gifts to all the boys and girls, but he thinks that only 5 children are being provided in Mexico. Reindeer whip up toy, and when Rainier smiles, I'm surprised that it will not make the eyes of kids cry ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. In the first 10 minutes, only Santa plays the limbs and sings to the kids. Perhaps one of the strange scenes is that Santa is shooting a pitch with a small-cannon shot and the pitch is walking around with pain. I think the kids are not telling their little kids where the children come from, than showing them. If you can praise the bad movie, it will be laughingly violent. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / **** 85 minutes
