This will be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I had to disagree with another commenter, those special effects were just fine. I found them very bad: it was not just realistic and they were so fake that it is confused simply from the real story. <br /> <br /> I probably did not fully understand the story because of that confusion. Archaeologists are looking for "set". Do not bother telling what sets they set, or what's so special about it that The fact that they searched in California has made it vague, when the role of the movie is held in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you are shooting a movie in the desert, try to actually go to the desert. Start - Ancient Events - It seems like it was shot in the studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> Action level was constantly across the movie, there was no compromise and downs, no climax. It looks small in the movie, and it is definitely a pro for this particular movie.
