This movie is a false film and an extraordinary great distortion that was once gathered by the most shameful lunatics to work on TV movies. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that correctly depicts Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam, and it makes me amazed that anyone associated with this product has got another job in this industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this trash used to attack a person who has been certified by history and their fears that dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan McCarthy left this communist for his work, and the Soviet Union and his' Korets <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never see this image. You are looking for the truth about Sen McCarthy. Read Anne Coulter's book "Treason" for a better look of the truth about Sen McCarthy. <br /> <br /> If you help Senator McCarthy to read what happened, then http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
