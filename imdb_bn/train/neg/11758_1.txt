I saw this movie with low expectations and were not disappointed. It's very bad that it's actually very tragic. <br /> <br /> Gayle is terrible, I mean, he just can not work. Actually, his acting is not his thing. Now his co-stars are very similar, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin can do a better job than that! The director should be ashamed to make his name so ridiculous. In any way I do not think this guy has a card for this Oscars. <br /> <br /> I have never written a comment on IMDB, but this movie was so bad that I was forced to do it. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this picture, 0/10 if not 0
