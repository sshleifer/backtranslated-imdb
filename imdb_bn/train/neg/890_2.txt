I saw this reconstructed pill of Vintage tonight at preview screening and it was straightforward to fly away by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film actually spreads the blind spot in its office. Does love have any black or gay New Yorkers? Say, love the self-involved white people? I know it's not a crash of love's anvil-tastic insertion, but with this fairly common member of society you can not pretend to play New York theater.
