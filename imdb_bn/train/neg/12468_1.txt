Simply put: Movies boring. Cliché is confirmed on Cliché and the story line does not come together. It seems that the director is not sure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent was ordered to kill the oil prince, caught and then warned the prince (why?)) And because of this some elements have been added to make the movie more interesting. So, a child dies, which becomes the "natural" reaction of the father: giving free advice to the person who is unjustly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer is a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why nobody knows. Some children became suicidal terrorists and blow up a ship. Finally, I saw it in several bad films. I was not entertaining or intellectually challenged. I did not laugh or cry, I did not understand, or were forced to learn more or take some reason. It was nothing to me, which could tell me the worst one in my eyes.
