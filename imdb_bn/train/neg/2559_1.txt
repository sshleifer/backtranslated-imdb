Well, this is probably the worst movie, at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They have tried 666 children of Satan for 1000 times against 1000 Christian antagonists, and none of them is good and this is the worst among them. They think that going to be the best movie as they use that fake blood. There is no idea in this movie, actors and filming are just terrible. Even in this movie that make 10 lines out of minium. Nothing really to say but that's just awesome. They can not understand how they can make movies like the right mind. It can not be a Hollywood movie, is not it? Just do not go watch this to use your money more wisely.
