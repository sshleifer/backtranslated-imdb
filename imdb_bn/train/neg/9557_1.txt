I really did not have high expectations and I must admit I was not disappointed. This movie is so awesome that I feel the obligation to register an account here at IMDb to warn others to waste their time. The story is terrible and you ask yourself throughout the movie "Could it be worse?" Yes i can The way they make it worse every minute and you think, "I want to return my 1 hour and 35 minutes!". Anyone will pay for this! <br /> <br /> I dare you to find a movie which is the worst ... <br /> <br /> I was not really high expectations and I must admit that I was not disappointed.
