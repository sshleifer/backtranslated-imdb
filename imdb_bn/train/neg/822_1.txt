This picture really has two sections. First of all, this film has ridiculous proposals that are violent and cannabis, which will almost realize that 'The Simpsons' are described in the troyo macclue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film starts (starting with a title song that is not compatible with the rest of the film), when technically okay, by a blurred, incompatible and disrespectful plot and only letters are not flexible, but The letters that die are not as meaningless as they are. <<br /> <br /> This is especially with Mikey Rooney Spitant, who thought that the whole time was in the plot and part of the 'organization', but what happened when Hackman made an objectionable decision to take him? Break? In this case he will become a completely unnecessary and unnecessary character, which he is still to the end. <br /> <br /> The overall problem of this film is who is behind this conspiracy. It seems that the filmmakers do not have the courage that a particular part of society will be able to create such an organization and instead will be sufficient enough due to lack of explanation and the audience will make their own decisions. <br/> <br /> Simply tell, the film fails at all levels.
