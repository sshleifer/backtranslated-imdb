I saw this movie for the first time on Saturday evening at 12 o'clock. This is truly the perfect time for this one. I have sometimes seen a movie that was actually drenched with more predictable and stereotypes. If you want to watch a thrilling action movie, you will not see it because you lose your desire to go deliberately. However, if you want a good smile, please see it! I even bought the chocolate Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my usable Saturday night. What has hit me especially is that the scenario which is expensive will be prevented from the documentary of the discovery of an old TV-special copy of the United States Army. Besides, I was surprised to see that they did not make a minimal effort to produce the product. Afghanistan, as far as I can remember, that there is nowhere near any ocean and yet with the single click, the deck escapes from the sand-fort of the terrorists with its jet pack, and is taken away by a submarine (perhaps discovery). Later in the movie, Deck shot an Islamic terrorist against a wall. In slow motion you can see the beautiful Korean stanman flap beautiful hair in the air while breaking the wall. It will be love. I recommend you see it with some friends and a good amount of beer, only then you will understand why I was crazy enough to spend 6.99 euros in the box.
