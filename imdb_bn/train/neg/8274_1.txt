Ah this picture was so potential! A good cast of quality B actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... about that! <br /> <br /> I believe there were some people in some unnamed marketing departments. Basically, lawful Blend does a kind of film work, but it does in New York. The possibilities of that bright city, energy and money and where everyone is frustrated, energy / money hungry people. Come Jessica Simpson, Bimbo in the small town, Oven Wilson's brother, and for some reason due to any reason, Andy Dick (for this reason, his image should not be ignored). <br /> <br /> The original story line: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl for NY, followed the girl, cheating the boys, the girl is in New York with the cousin, gets a job under false accusations, fools , Rent another son (Brother Wilson) and save the day together and kiss <br /> <br /> While reflecting this picture, some words seem like, such as terrible, awful, helpless, helpless, and gonofobic br < > <br /> Just this little girl Do not see the horror, you are happy to have a commentator Guantanamo, and I must agree with him. This film provoked shock. And I know what you think ... at least for a while I'll watch Simpson naked or close. It's not going to happen, leave yourself time and YouTube. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this is a cinematic rebellion The maximum punishment is to be given. <br /> <br /> Another question is why Willie Nelson always depicted a kind of father on each Jessica Simpson Flick and why is not Black, Latin, Asian or European? People in this movie?
