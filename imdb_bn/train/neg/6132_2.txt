As a child, my friends and I all believed that the sitcom was the most violent, bloody movie of all time. I'm sure that those rumors begin. It was probably due to the disappointment of the 10-year-old, because it was not allowed to look for one reason or another. A few years after the release of the movie, it became a perennial film of late night only, and as a result, I got ready for a lost time. I have seen scenes from this horrific excuse for more than a dozen pictures and I can always spot it from screen 1-2 seconds. However, in addition to forced attachments of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, harsh dialogue, and unreasonably hard story-line, this movie contains some things. The bad things about the apparently visible movie, the word is quite beautiful. Never before has a punch or so small energy and has landed with so much volume! Kandak Kung-Phu sounds shiny, but gradually the song gets slowly and slowly and the curvature of around 5 minutes is weird. The submerged city, the movement of bloodshed villagers is not really intense as much as it is annoying, and there are enough bad wigs and everyone who looks at the camera and the wave, but this train-ruins make a little fun. Could it lead to religious-classic status? Where is the MST3K when we need it?
