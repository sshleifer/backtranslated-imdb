Before I left my review and the other majority wanted to read other comments before certain rules: This movie is terrible! Non-realistic animations from acting are countless errors. I really hope the flaps will extend to the stretch of imagination (can not extend the flap without the engine). Landing gear can not be reduced if you do not have electricity. The small wand that was going was not enough by any end of the landing gear. I think that one thing was very unusual, when they landed, the rear touched under the wheels and then the nose broke, so the plane was suspended with both tires on the plane. Captain applied left and right brakes in tires without touching the ground? Have they forgotten the spoilers? Director to Sound: Before you try a "flat" movie you can find * all * about the aircraft. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
