If you look for a movie, images of the middle-class vain and annoying existence are caught on the web of non-contact and false ideals, then it's a movie for you. If you're attracted to the movie and want to keep your interest, you probably see elsewhere. There are many movies that make it even better. For example, try some of the dark movies of Bergman. The filmmaker believes that in order to demonstrate the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he must pay tribute to the audience's humiliating and neutral event, until the film finally comes to its oppressor and merciful end. If you value your time, for example, there are many good ways to spend two hours cleaning your house.
