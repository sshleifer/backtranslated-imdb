First look at 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (D-Jim Camerud and Brian Smith): The original classic animated `101 dalmatians have drab and extraordinary supposed sequel. 'Yes, the movie is going on where it was first, but the problem is that it is much more like the original. One of the great things about the original was the story of pissing, which it does not have. Animation is very awesome for Disney and what we've got is going through the same characters through the same story. When Disney is going to disturb us from the Sequels and the Reeves, etc. Etc. Perhaps we can stop renting rentals in the middle of the rent or purchase.
