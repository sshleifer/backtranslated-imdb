Jeff Jarrette to talk about that night Owen Heart and her best friend and second generation wrestler. Jeff first commented, "I literally pushed through the curtain because my original friends had become my past wheel". Debra McMichael (Steve Mondo McMichael's former wife as well as Steve Mondo, former wife of Steve Austin.) <br /> <br /> Oven like a heart failure, a video circulating ring became black, like Blue Blazer (Owen heart preacher) was played. The collapse and the video were never shown on TV, some news photos were posted. When Jim came back from the video editor, Jim Ross Everyone was saying that we shot the masses, the heart blue blazer had fallen and did not look good, Laura returned from the ring, the seat was in the seat, he told Jim that the situation is very complicated paramedics, where he is working hard to revive. And where is the other HHH going where another referee came in when meeting in a private room and told Oven first, wow Calling Harts continuously as an author who knew that they were not true, but both later said that the referee had said it to him, as he mentioned in another post, he yelled for the referee and the ring announcer to move. Brother Bret Heart was going to El Elle on a corner tonight, he could not work on a plane to hear tonight, say one of the captains at home As for the message was sent. When La Eriich arrived in the world he was told what happened, and he was kept on a charter flight in the morgue cancer city, Bret even after Owen's widow Martha stood on the top where she went to the top spot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
