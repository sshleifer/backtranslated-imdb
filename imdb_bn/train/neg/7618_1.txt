This is not the movie. It's not a genius. This is not informative. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. It does not happen either. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says, "Diablo! Cole!" Yes right The only cool thing about this experience was that I did not buy it, but rented it. <br /> <br /> It has been shot as a bad soap opera. Do not wait Soap opera Find least professional ... sorta this? It seems that someone is shot with a camcorder. It's awesome! Wretched! Sux it <br /> <br /> Cinematography is hateful! Anyway who is this director? I do not care enough to see him. He stinks! Performance by these poor vague actors was much better than this shag-fest qualification. <br /> <br /> "B" scale is 2.6 / 10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
