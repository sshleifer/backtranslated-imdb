Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total reduction in acting, direction, sound performance, soundtracks. ... Such performances have been damaged by very good actors. The film did not judge Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps Bollywood's most talented actor. Akshay Kumar is also a rising star who has done a lot of poor work. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? What do you call acting? I want to say that he would praise God's praise that he has his face, otherwise if he wins the Razzie Award in India, then there is no such award from Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but overdoes the bits before that. <br /> <br /> There was a rip off mention of the 1965 Boing Boing that Screenplay was made quite badly. After all, Bollywood people simply can not do anything original. On top of that they do not know how to copy well. Movie jokes were so much, it was painful to sit through them. Priyaara can be a star in the south, but she is not suitable for making suitable Hindi cinema. The sound editing is surprisingly crappy. I can go on and on, but the following line should be shameful for Bollywood to make such a film. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people started to love this movie. Are you guys wrong? Where is Bollywood? Do you know that Bollywood produces more movies than Hollywood each year, but most of the movies are strangers abroad, because of the reasons for movies like this. I am an Indian and I am completely shy to Bollywood for this piece of production. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Shantha were just awesome. They are world-wide movies which are ruthless ... the best of this decade. But garment spices are probably the worst of this century. Duration <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10.
