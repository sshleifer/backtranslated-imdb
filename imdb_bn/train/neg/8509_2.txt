I saw this movie because of the main reasons of Mura Sorvino. With Cast on it it can not be so bad. And it even had some mystery and even Olivier Martinez was his boyfriend and he seems to be quite good in 'unreliable'. The story is set in Spain so it can be an exotic entertainment movie with one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of the same thing, please alert me: this is really a terrible, uncertain, annoying movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They tried to create a slash / thriller by focusing on fascism in Spain but failed terribly. Twists have no credibility and so-called investigation leads somewhere. <br /> <br /> The letter paper is thin! I do not care about anyone. More than that, they are annoying and quite disgusting people. <br /> <br /> The actress is violent. Is Mera wrong with you? Why Mirah? You are an Oscar winner! Keep some dignity! No excuse for such a terrible performance that its character was weak but that. He seems to sleepwalking all the movies long. Come on to worry, I actually think I see her eyes slowly shutting down in some scenes. I think this woman was sexy. Well he's not here. If you look at some skin, try Romi and Michel because there is nothing to see here. And that's the pronunciation? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It's very painful to remember its performance to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I suffer enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is boring! It is such a bad way how it was created. A lazy team produces a lousy script and earns some money on the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
