This budget marked the hungry Italian action / science-fiber hybrid David Warwick as the Miami Reporter, who was chosen by the people of Atlantis by ghosts (!) A bad businessman (Academy Award nominated John Ireland), using a telepathic embryo to rule the planet an asteroid Using spores from Have you got all that? Despite such a loopy plot, this is actually a bore and raiders of Atlantis sneers it with contempt. Sincerely, Harvey Hancock's Beverly Hills Sip Theme is a little recycling for the title of the most open (creatively) creative things about this flickr. Most weirdly creative bits include a view of a lab that is vaguely shown back-to-back twice. Perhaps the director Alberto de Martino wants to get all our ant garders on his carrier evening? I'm going to announce this bad movie in Ireland in Ireland, but then I saw that the Satan Chellders were listed there. I would like to safely announce that I am probably the only person in the history of the world, and this is twice the number of Hitcoak's Vertigo features.
