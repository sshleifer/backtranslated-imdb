Phantasm .... Classes. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Fantas III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> If I want to wait for this photo, I will not be easy enough. The movie seems to be "sold". The first bad symptoms come when there is a trailer for other movies in the beginning of the video (some others do not). There are also many pointless characters, the main example is a child (no crack shot, early fun, but soon you want to die), a woman who uses a cart to fight off the ball (there is no work that does not work or should not work) and Flashing zombie (what they are doing there, other Phatasms have no links to them). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this image looks like a filler between the second and fourth classes because the extra characters end up so that the fourth 4 Heads up with the main <br /> <br /> Overall, very frustrating. 3/10
