It can sometimes be the adaptation of a Broadway musical worst film. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough did not know anything about the theater - lying almost every shot and moment. I want to say, though, it's almost bad to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hairstyle is a significant date. I can not understand how my life can be understood by opening the film with the outside of the theater that is playing "my chorus line". Do we think that these people are auditioning for "a chorus line", in which the audiences have stories? Oh no, the show itself collapses. <br /> <br /> I saw original production, and heard the album several times. Why, oh, why do they do this?
