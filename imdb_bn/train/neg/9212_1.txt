The price of this movie is mainly to ridicule how bad it is. Your average middle school writer gets a low score with a plot that looks good and that works almost as well. Tom was one of the very elementary movies where he probably did not have the pleasure to be the real picky. The film's special effect is made of an incredibly faked rubber giant, a man dressed in a man.
