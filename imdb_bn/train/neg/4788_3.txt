At the third end of the Phantas series, Mike and Regie Tal Mann are 9.2 years old, a black GI. Jane and Mike's dead brother's soul (he died on the original fantasy). Number 3 was a rather frustrating signaled, because the knob and black comedy were at least inspired and romantic as exciting. I think the helplessness of the disease as a relative curiosity and only its impedance as a talent. Humor was much more dry and oppressed in the previous film, which would make such a story better. Also, the settings here are not as MacBook, but the continuous presence of Plus Tall Mann (volcano screws) is not clear ?? There are still plenty of beef but still not happy at this time. By the way, beware for the strictly cut version, it shows the most delightful killings off-screen. The entire Fantasy series is a lifetime achievement in Don Cossackelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes so far? The fifth is being produced. The first is a semi-religious classic, the second gore and the fierce festival of violence and the rest can easily be omitted. At Michael Baldwin came back like a microphone, although James Legrass represented his character better in Phantas II.
