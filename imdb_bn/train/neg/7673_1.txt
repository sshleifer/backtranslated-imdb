I do not know where to start. Before reading in another movie, its red will be stopped. Stephen Doroff thinks he received the inspiration for his character's "Top Gun" Wall Killer. Slack sleepwalks through this drake. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of the gun battle?), Dresses (bulletprints on them muscles), and hey, there are no visible plots. It surprised me that nobody connected with the project stopped and said, "hello friends, this does not make any sense, let's get started". Hopefully, Slacker's career will be removed from this disaster. <br /> <br /> I have seen that the worst movie has been played.
