The story of a young waiter named Darkoff Jose (Sameer Armstrong), who is living a beautiful life until his friend Mary (Tippy Herren) was killed by Veerloff, you see that America is vuruvlov in modern America and even threatens a VERWolf Against the special forces of the police forces led by Detective Steve Turley (Ryan Olsio) Who had worked hard to tell JCI that he really is a pure blooded Verrulef himself and that he wants to associate with the so-called 'dark princess' weoorolf (why the stove) and create a new type of pure blood that will accept or accept something around the world. It is understood that Josie has a hard time believing this, until he sees evidence from his own eyes. Jesse, to save the world and the world, to Waverf's Police Steve, it's ... <br /> <br /> After co-executing and directed by Richard Friedman, I was thinking that DarkWell was a bad budget shot on a digital camcorder horror movie. That's really nothing for me. Jaffrey started with Allan Holly script's script promising to set up a strip club with several nude breasts and then there is a spread of wavelength attacks everywhere, but after this beautiful opening sequence, it is very beautiful under the mountain. I'm scared It's going to slow down at the beginning, it's unimaginable, it's predictable and it's crowded with very annoying characters, who come with a lot of bad conversations and when they get the chance to shoot the verruel, they do stupid things, I have no idea why they rather prefer to stand there instead. The script is stupid and does not explain itself, why did Josue never become a Wyolf ever before? Is he really the only one? Why is not this 'dark princess' finding another woman's wauver? There are many other things that seem to be in little or no sense like an old book, but almost half of the mobile phone is forgotten, but the way you get the idea is completely converted. <br /> <br /> The director is well-lit with director Fredman Ujjal Niyon but he is watching the new and the original and does not really make any progress in the film's development. Exhibition Now let's talk about special effects or their lack because the effect of Darkwall is far away from the special, Weaverlif transformation is achieved using CGI and in the worst showing CGI I have ever seen, a Playstation will be embarrassed about this computer seriously. This is one of the easiest I've ever seen in the VeroLife transit, an American Weowwolf (1981) in London was created more than 25 years ago, but in particular, there are literally discussed years of special effects that can be seen in Darkul, which have been special effects for years? The effect of Animatronic dolls is not much better though at least on the screen some emotional. There is not much of a cow after killing a poor open, there are plenty of blood explosives and corpses but nothing else. Most of Thre's female nudity, if you do not get excited, do not get excited because you want to sit through a terrible movie to see it but is it really valuable? <br /> <br /> Technically Darkwall is OK, except sometimes the worst CGI effect, it has been reasonably well and it seems to have at least production standards. Acting is what you really hope for. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems like going to the funeral is a bit more fun than it is, even when everyone says and works, they are still awesome ...
