I am a huge fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite writer from the field of animal farming at GCSE. I bought DVDs very curiosity, Burton was an actor who was very respectful to me, so when I heard that he played O'Rrien's role, then I'm roaming around. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer in DVD first and set some fears, mostly against the terrible "theme song", Yuriiksk was mechanically listening "1984"! Think of it as bad as over an electronic beat over again. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But this movie is given below where. The film spends time focusing on Winston and Juliere love love, which is not what Orwell wrote. He was writing about a fierce future, how Yangsticks would build a human faith and then scatter them all to love the Big Brother. This book is basically the most important part of the book that is going beyond Winston's life and his position with the world and through O'Brien's re-education. <br /> <br /> <br /> This book is completely wrong in the book. When Wilson visited O'Brien, Julia was not present, they did not make a promise to Goldstein's Brotherhood and did not accept their crime. There are no significant references to Winston's preliminary examples of finding articles with Opportunity, but it has been mentioned in the end, if you do not consider the book to be completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible screenplay, which can not be recovered some excellent acting. Michael Radford seems to have tried to make the point fully airwaves, and the electronic soundtrack is terrible terrible.
