I hate air crash movies ... all of them! Actually, I hate them with passion! First of all, they are looking cheap and have no tech! Secondly, they insult the airlines and tell the audience that all the planes are going to ... bursting out of sky and cross <br /> <br /> <br /> Why am I surprised in such a movie? It can be compared to the victims of this film, and with no bad results compared to the sufferers ... which is the only cool aspect of the airline disaster yoke. I hate this movie because it's like 50,000,000 folly-stunts of an airplane! Freefall Like all others: Closed bangshit is nothing more than annoyance before the dramatic scene. <br /> <br /> First of all, we are stuck in the trap of flying death: The family of Clive-Esquiera three, UP Bastard, and the anxiety of a flight attendant since 1987 scolding anyone who is afraid to be at least bits full with a big blonde hair! <br /> <br /> It should not be a full-length movie in my second grip, but a documentary Air Canada explains everything about the "Cobblestone Glider" incident that "takes safety precautions". /> <br /> My third and final grapes have all the airline movies of this qualification (without unconditional exception) Why did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove the shoes? (I can understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but kissing!) It will be such that more 'F # * kings will make them safer!' If they (travelers) did not know any good at this plane: they knew going to crash the land. Why would you place 100 injured under a rubber slide that could tear the skin and only a debris can affect walking on the field! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> People flutter without shoes and jackets. Etc. 1975 same old shit from the airport! Fryfle was so much like an air accident that I saw in Charlton Heathon or Peter's graves that the accidental burst into the cabin, at what moment we could at least see how these bad things went back to normal, delighted in the tragedy in front of people. ? The Moroccan Lifetime Movie! Cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> "The Director of Freefall" should be with the white middle-aged women to create movies with drug addicts who are drug addicts and marital problems. For suspicion ... let the professionals ... you hack! The airport is wannabe rehash why we will sit through half an hour over the audience. I do not have flat crashes movies like this because they hope. If it's like "lost" in the ABC series, it will be something to see. But this is something nasty and then something. "Airport 1975" Turns Off Every Plane Disaster Movie! This is not "airport", it is my time's cheap cruel waste. I would not recommend the air disaster film for this movie or any made TV, even my worst enemies.
