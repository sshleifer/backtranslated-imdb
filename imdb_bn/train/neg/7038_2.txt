Ah yes in the 1980s, a remote jungle of Regnomics and Sly, Chalk and another action star has been hidden, which goes away. At that time, I could not believe how Rambo, Action and Mission Valor (and who can forget the ridiculous red dive?), How the box office has made money, how they are right-wing agenda and they have a very bad date. Trumah's warrior takes a tongue of cheeks into such movies, but you have to first ask yourself what is the need for spoofing them first? Of course not. Trumas Wyar lacks any kind of sophistication - even though it determines that there is no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wings - and sometimes more than sending, Grade J seems more like a movie. Was it that?
