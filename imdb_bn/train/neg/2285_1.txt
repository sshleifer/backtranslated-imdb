Well, 90 minutes of my life I will not go back. This movie looks like TIV TV show "California Dreams" is "almost famous". The acting was horror and the story was unreal. Even in my first part of this story, do not start in the original band, lam song, look etc. You have to believe that they were one of the most popular bands of the country and there was not enough fornication. Accept that one in the world. The songwriter sees as a heroin user, I do not blame him, if I am playing around old Padma Band with old songs and wood acting, I would also like to inject the horse. <br /> <br /> Remotely avoid music at all costs, seriously.
