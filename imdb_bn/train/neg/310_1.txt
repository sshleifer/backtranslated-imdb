I never heard of Adam Sandler on this blockbuster wall. I used to hire this because Adam Sandler was a fan at that time. Formally I can only see 30 minutes It's about It was very terrible. Do whatever it takes to protect it from the public's hand. I sincerely hope this movie will soon go to OPI, and I hope it will run as it is!
