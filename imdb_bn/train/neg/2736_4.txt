The only reason I am commenting is because of the end. Although we probably realized this at the same time this week, but Dr. Cox was very cool because they showed these episodes in a different order than their images. The last episode is when our dear serious, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts died. Of course, for some strange reasons they have been shown to unknown and they have constantly forgotten increasingly. Shame, for scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I think Eliot Scott is trying to meet with the resultant and his hair wet 2 seconds before the water hits. I tried not to notice this thing, but my favorite show needed it to step.
