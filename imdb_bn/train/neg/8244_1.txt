I was supposed to be disappointed in this movie. But this is the only way that's really frustrating, how frustrating it is to be ... and simply. It's a half hour. More than the audience of movie characters (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I like (usually) horror-movies, I have no problem with violence against such a movie, but all the violence in this movie does not end any work. It is simply extraordinary that any other spectator. <br /> <br /> About this movie The worst thing is (if you eat enough at the top It is trying to copy Blair Whitch. The project is filmed with a hand-held camera, but (again, this too) does no end work. "Blair" is sure enough, there is an explanation, such as They are looking for their blair witch with a camera. There is no further explanation in this picture: "Hey we want to see this like Blair Whit ..." The film's word is somewhat frustrating. The girls are so violently screaming that many times you can not create what you are saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> My suggestion: do not see it in any case.
