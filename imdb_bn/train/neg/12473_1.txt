This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything about it is weak and incompatible. Acting strange, the dress even crummier and the stories exist. This 'poverty line' sword and adventure movie was "Bistmaster" and "Canaan" to achieve some success, but it does not give us any reason to follow. The lead character is pure and dull, he can not even fight with the sword and the sword from the 16th century. All verb sequences are such as slow and unrealistic, such as the accidental music when traveling around the castle and the horse's horse. Do not even bother with this shit.
