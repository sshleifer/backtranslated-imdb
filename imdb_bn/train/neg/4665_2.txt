I really wanted to choose the pillow book. The impressive story, outline the attractive character, completely exalted exclusively by Ian McGregor Unfortunately, I hate it every minute. Greenway uniquely represents the movie, not with the benefit of the film. I can not even play the disgrace of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You are confused with the story about 4 billion mini windows and the algorithm which shows the songs of the music playing under the screen. It seems that he presents a true story and the plot has lost sight of development, and is confused by the foo-foo embellishments that do nothing. "Grandma loves me!" It's a little bit like presenting the portrait of John Janczargent in an impressive hallmark frame. Big sparkly letters <br /> <br /> The arrogance of this movie director Eutour seems like a casualties - instead of what it might be - boring and terrific beautiful. In the hands of another director (Junet? Coppola?), It could be a wonderful composition. In the hands of Greenway, it is best managed for the best arts classes that take ourselves very seriously.
