Chinese Ghost Story III is completely irrelevant to the two excellent fantasy films. The film provides spell-casting special effects that anyone can expect but fails painfully all other fronts. The actors play all the highly silly caricatures. You still have to remain in the diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and development is sometimes uncertain and often slow. At the end, the film begins to resemble the older Gudijila films, in which Shabbi has a special effect on the larger life and with a head (Good, yet another) Bhutta. Maybe I hope to camp if I was shocked. <br /> <br /> It was astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans should do - in this case some thought that they could save a little extra money. Successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: The cash cow has died as a dodo.
