Eat How can they create such a beauty movie, but they are so bad. I mean, even if Uwe bowed, this is not a shit like this. There is even a hint of a decent story, multi-level character, or attraction. This is a random sequence of unmatched chatter together to create a 'movie'. I think kids can enjoy it until the age of 3, because the world is so overwhelming and this story is so intolerable, that any old person would be bothered by it. But then again, it is very scary for anyone under the age of 6, perhaps there is no one to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little girl can make better stories, and although she is probably not able to paint this beautiful picture, her stories are more audible. And in the name of whom you believe, do not reveal your children in this part of ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10 and this is especially graphic, because the story and the character development are so awful that they deserve negative ratings. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see it, remember that I've warned you.
