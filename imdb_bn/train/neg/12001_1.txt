My sincere advice to everyone: Do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Where the movie is going, do not go to the theater too! Even it's a glare bad for health. Serious No joke 3.30 in the morning And I return to this overwhelming movie of this universe. Sleep four hours !!! I'm proud that I survived it after all! This is called survival. <br /> <br /> I am extremely disappointed. Bothered. Frustrated It was merely a waste of time! Money was lost! No plot I hope to wake up tomorrow morning and there is no memory of this night! Rabindra Movie <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to and All :)
