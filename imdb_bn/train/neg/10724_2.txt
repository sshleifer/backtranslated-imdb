This is the perfect example of something which is going very bad ... So, can I advise anyone to visit it? Well, I was convinced with such firmness that I was still in competition (I still can not believe it won) .. and I'm finally because the director was for a question and a division but that was also interesting but .. What? The good first half (worth of a philosophy) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official. The first two lie about their profession. But the third is liar. The second half includes some old breasts and heavy drinks (some do not damage .. otherwise a good evening). But you will see it completely different ... did the Tiff jury (they drink vodka?)
