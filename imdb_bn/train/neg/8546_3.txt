Extremely incredible, incredible, and unclear about Spanish production ... Well, I can see how much I can get. The film killed a girl by killing one of her cats. Then she begs her lover to take her somewhere on her vacation. He worked and claimed that he lost his holiday time and he said that he would pay for this. What does this relevance to someone's guess at the end of the film, because a man, a selfish photographer, the queen of the Spanish horror movie spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, and closes her bikini moment so that she can print a picture. For his lunch, and then for his appointment to the Witch's Mountain - the reasons we never once hide. Before they go, Patty will stop the house and loudly, chanting "eerie" echoes in the ears of our hero. Again, this is not explained. The film is moving towards a toilets with these two friends, going to the hill, and finally realized why the mountain is known as the 'vichchy mountain'. You know, this movie has different aspects that make it better than a bad movie. It contains some atmosphere, some character actors are really quite good (especially deaf serviets and old ladies), Leads are minimal enough and Claymax - although it does not give absolutely no idea - it's literally dancer) with witches in white brassieres and long black hair. It does not make any sense though, and that's a huge opposition for me. I could see the film ten more times and after seeing the first I do not know anything else yet. That's a major problem. Witchches Mountain is a decade blanket that is a weird film from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror films. If you can get more than I do, you have better power.
