<br /> <br /> I was forced to review this image, but I am here. <br /> <br /> I'm reviewing it, because recently I have a look at R.C. There is a chance to be resurrected. On the New York stage, Sheriff's play "Journeys End", Belasco Theater, Hugh Darcy, Boyd Joyce, Jefferson Mason and others, is being directed by David Grindley as well. <br /> <br /> Theater isolated. I did not exaggerate, I was flabbergasted. During World War I, Somey (I think), lived with the painting of the soldier's life for about one and a half hours, and lived with the art of painting very clastropobic painting, by everyone involved, I came out of the theater. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I am a stage actor and a director, so I have some effects, both mentally, as well as psychology Bikabhabe, is being pressed to achieve some effects. <br /> <br /> But what I saw came so much for life <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only plus of the film, the airy battle scene, which looks at the date of their special effects compared to today's standards, but it is still a very valid flying strategy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If there was a "German" view on something Wanted to choose such things. <br /> <br /> The "Journeys" medal is simply on the other side, and it's a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not too much <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The sky war between the old timers, then it's a picture for you. But instead I would recommend "von Richthophen and Brown" as an alternative, although this is also a wrong movie. <br /> <br /> For those who love good acting and drama, I'll leave this one out. Buy the game If you get a decent resurgence near it, check out the game, but keep it off adaptation. <br /> <br /> This is a war film, given, but the weakest I've seen in my life all the time. <br /> <br /> There is only one weakness in the presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Raymond, Richard Johnson and John Gilgood, because they are very weak and rarely seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and firm direction. <br /> <br /> There are many spaces between them, and earlier said, it puts itself at suspicious end. Confused because in the original game, we can not recognize any kind of man and sympathize, live alive. They are all killed in a deadly and vain mission. All of them die in the movie for any other day than Malcolm McDowell, as the winner of the unfortunate group, the other three pilots may fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The last dark of the game is to leave a bare stage. You just hear Canon roar, machine gun rattle, and grenades impact across the entire theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The screen comes. Light. And here they all are. Stand upright and hard, up line. Applied corpse ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> If I have money and communication, then I will play the game and develop it. Here and there to add some action scenes, the men involved are almost running "exotic" horror and barn running in "vasty field of France", but then, strictly concentrate on what's happening, just <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
