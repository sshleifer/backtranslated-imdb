Generally, there is a lot better with my time than writing my reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour to register with IMDB to touch my chest. <br /> <br /> You might think a movie like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spasier could be a bankrupt beta ... Well, this movie was just terrible. It "suspends unbelief" near disbelief; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just let me go. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should be with the song, no horrible performance - there is no presence as an actor, no character. Everything can not be blamed on Justin: The film also boasts an awesome plot and bad time editing; It's definitely a "F". After watching this, I'm really encouraging the actors. I mean, sure Morgan actually read the script before participating. Did he not see how poor it was? So what can motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting performs a lot of time with whom you meet instead of quality quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He gets more screen time than Freeman or Spesy in this film and struggled to resign with really poor script. Meanwhile, the audience goes away: "What's going on here? Are you expecting me to believe this shit?" <br /> <br /> In short, except for Justin executed a great lineup badly - very frustrating.
