I ended up finishing watching even this movie even through the review of a woman, even through reviews. Just outside of curiosity, I thought, there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite surprised to find long and positive reviews on this website, which gives me the conclusion that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as my opinion is concerned, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers disturbing or doing? Do they think that the audience is disabled? The film is so tortuous and I'm not talking about stories or presentations. <br /> <br /> So, these clans plus one girl (main actress) constitute a music band; Guitar constant attendance estimates it is supposed to be a rock band. Nominate, when the dancer starts to become part of a rock band; However, accept me as a-rock-band-bollywood-version-bollywood-version, but in fact these two gyestarists are doing all kinds of great "rock gosters" and I think I'm playing the instrument, the guitar word was completely absent !!! I just do not understand the folly measure here only. <br /> <br /> I'm going to end here because there is no other film in the movie. It seems that Bollywood managers are not ashamed !!!!!!!!
