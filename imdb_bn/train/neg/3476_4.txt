I liked it, I really did. Please do not feel that I am a fool but I must admit that I enjoyed this movie. I thought it could be painful, it was crap, but sometimes it is cool and ok to see a crappy film that you do not have to focus too much? I do not expect any secret money or body, and there is no one, but it does not matter because I only saw it for entertainment and it gave me life-long entertainment. There are jobs such as Ben Steillers ('There is some about Mary' forfeiture) and Vince Vaughs (but you make her last name, I will not be bothered to check). Unless you expect too much from it, it's ok to show a shit movie and I'll stand for a while, probably run, but do not drive because I do not have a car, a blockbuster video, or even a favorite, and this toilet humored film Rent a bunch and stay them watching one night. You better read the readers. P. If you did not say that this comment helped you, I do not like you, if you say it helps, God will bless you, you will go to heaven.
