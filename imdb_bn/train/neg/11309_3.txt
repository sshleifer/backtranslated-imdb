Bad plot (though good for a B-movie), fast swift battle scenes more than 5 out of 10 But I am always annoyed about this movie: do not talk to Harisa on Morisa? In the TV version, he shared some close moments with Jeff Spacman, even kissing a garden. Yet in the regular version (video), most of his scenes are cut and he never speaks. It bothers me because it does not come out of the point of view of a female (though clipped) film, it considers the final shot to be obscure. It was good to keep this picture in view, because at least one of those scenes was a personality that speaks to the speaker.
