As a spiritual and non-Christian. I thought I was actually going to hang on my beliefs, but what I meant. I thought the film would have great arguments, but got the only mutual views from atheists and Jews ??? And those people who are interviewing these streets do not know their hands from their heads. Where the right theologian and pastor and stuff he might have got the arguments from. Those who did not write books, and did not retire their notes in the 1970s. Personally this DVD was wasted time and I should not believe or believe if my exact time is right or wrong, because the antichrist told me to do so. Please feel free to think that he had decided not to seek God because his own arrogance and demons made him better. I did not say that the atheists were not too stupid to read about this, that it felt good about themselves. But if you really want to show the world you are not concerned about us, who believe in Christ, their poor souls do not beat us from drums.
