Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she is related to Bruce), the first film killer, her old technique is again. She is one of the Camping Rolling Hills consultants. As long as girls are beautiful in camps and stay away from sex, drugs and oath are good. But a few steps on the line and Angela kill them - they crack all the bad jokes. <br /> <br /> The original "Slipway Camp" was a harmful and nasty splatter movie, but it had some good aspects. It is very nasty and nasty but it has no good points. The plot was completed with death and it added nothing new to the formula. There has been a large number of incidents of killing (people have been burnt alive, head washed, molten screams), but obviously the net of all beasts has actually become ridiculous. This is the smallest amount of cameras I've ever seen and virtually everyone is very old for their role (especially Higgins). Expected female nudity (Excellent, promptly provided by Valerie Hartman) and compulsory good girl / good boy team (Renes Aventave and Tony Higgins) expected. The only exception to Springsteen and Higgins is acting shy - even slash movie standards. This movie also has a cruel edge that a character sinks in a character! Boring and sick plot, sick with nude nudity and bad gore. leave it.
