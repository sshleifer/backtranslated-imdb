Do not pay attention to comments behind the screen! Positive comments about this movie are mostly taking royalty. It's an awesome movie in every way. Kids have no money in high school and there is no idea of ​​creating a slash / comedy video of humor. They get a D for this. College kids will be asked to get an F or leave school. Since these professionals were created by "professionals", I believe that there should be a time-or-film screening in prison. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Cinema 9 to External Space" but this thing does not fall into that category. Scripts, acting, sounds, and directions are so bad that it is virtually unwanted. If you see bad sticky bad comics with ad wood, blacksplash, or horror movies of the 1970s, then enjoy it. After seeing it you feel that you have lost one and a half hour of your life.
