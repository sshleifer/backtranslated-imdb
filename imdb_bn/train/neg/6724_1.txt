When you choose a movie, I hope that one thing you will consider, can the movie actors influence the moral fabric of our society by using their good name positive or negative? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue which affects society. When a comedy / actor hates sex and racist comments about teen and his dad, we should ask ourselves (I want to support that behavior)? In this case, Mr Fox's behavior tears toward the social fabric, which teaches our youth from the wrong, good behavior that is better than the love-loving hatred. Mr. Fox should keep in mind that he only has plenty of entertainment and there is plenty to choose from us. Sorry to stop him hooking off. It will not hurt our bad behavior or eliminate bad behavior to spread our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to turn it on a fan. They will not see any part of it. We can not change them but we can stop the reputation we give them.
