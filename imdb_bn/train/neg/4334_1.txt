This movie was potential and I was ready to try it, but many deadline problems are so obvious - it is very difficult to treat like such a fool. <br /> <br /> Power-to-Wright In Set In the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid-seventeenth century. If you want to make this film realistic, then fifty years will be set in fifty years. <br /> <br /> There is no trace of Gayle to Power to Power (Penelope Anne Miller), Kleinfelde has no trace, Carlotta thinks that no sign of Rollandro ran in his "Hey-Day". None of the original characters of the original movie were in this movie. We believe that Carlito has met all these people for years. <br /> <br /> Carlitova is walking on the beach and talking about the retirement of Paradise, which he wanted to do, the original movie. Also, pre-quoil creates Rocco and Earl characters - what can happen to them because of not being clearly on the way to Carlito? It's also hard to understand how Carlito sees the Rise to Power program in his original film, how it can understand the relationship with the Italianians. Where is Tigiluuki in this movie? Probably seven years in two movies and he spent five in jail. It is trying to put a square plug in a round hole. It is obvious that someone was not interested in telling good stories and they were interested in making some money by creating an average gangster movie. And cast a character named Carlito Brigant in the story. The film had some good moments but I think they wanted to stand by themselves instead of trying to preview this film with Carlito. <br /> <br /> If you are convinced to watch this movie, the only advice I can give is that the movie will not be considered like a linear pre-koil. Think of something like Spaghetti Westerns with Clint Eastwood's people, in other words, the two characters have the same character but are not connected to each other.
