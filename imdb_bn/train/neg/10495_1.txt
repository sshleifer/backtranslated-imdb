I think Croke Hunter is a cool cool guy! I know that I will not be even nervous even 5 feet away from a crotch. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is nothing bad at all. Jokes jatta, man eating, and curiosity about the president always make the film one of the worst. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie that you have to stay away from. All the "joke" is so child that you make yourself ridiculous because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that if you are a 4 year old photographer, you will be surprised. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Krok Hunter saw this spider and did not want to eat it.
