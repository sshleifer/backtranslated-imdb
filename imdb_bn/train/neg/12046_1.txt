I had high hopes for Troy and I was very frustrated. The film was so badly directed that it made my stomach hurt. Pacing is so slow, comical, and film - in addition to a wonderful fight scene between Achilles (pit) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow. <br /> <br /> and why, oh why? Hollywood has always emphasized on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. The train did not die early on, the war lasted for 10 years, and Achilles in Paris were killed by arrows next to a tight wall! It disturbs me that such a classic story turns out to be a soap. <br /> <br /> and do not start with me about 'lack of chemistry' between Helen and Paris. He was fighting to fight women and they did not even look at even caring for a big deal about the other two. No sparks, no emotions, no hope <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Photo defense Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Brien have a Performed very well with bad script but it is not enough to save. This terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me about 200 million pounds of budget? Maybe in all the trees they used for funeral pyres - where did they get all the trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so frustrated that it hurts.
