Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or taiwani movie? Perhaps for a reason This is one of the really annoying one, even though there are explosions people from internal with black magic and thousands of eels including dry body. <br /> <br /> To read the thoughts of other people, I was looking forward to some violence and got a lot, but there is not much else. Some blood ponds and other hair components, if you are waiting for graphic graphs or have a great effect, you will be disappointed. They clearly do not use Yale blasts and other things in their greatest strength. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie; A single character that was completely blue and some OK just did not spell black magical, like Yale one. The plot was confusing and annoying. The letters were thin and annoying, with the main character. The horror aspect does not work at all, the most awesome thing was an Albino girl (not really that scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
