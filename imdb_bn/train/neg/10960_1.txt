Seek! C. come. They do not come much worse than Luis's favorite adaptation of this novel. The adaptation is very true for the novel, the role is only horrific and it is equal to playing in the school on a set and special effects scale. I was impressed with the budget for these mininers that the BBC was the biggest ever that paid, but it certainly looks like it could scraped a little more than $ 2. The worst effect is Mr. Beaver. I know that the computer's effects were not effective enough or even at an effective time, but the clothing shopman was afraid to see the suit. I do not like to play the character from the film! Avoid this at all costs.
