This movie may seem frightening in advertisements, but the reason for the actual film was vomiting. It is below the bottom (even less) and there is no plot. I mean every house can fear you and make sure a dead Japanese woman disperse from you, but what? Create a movie that appeals to the audience and do not show images of only terrible people and some hair (dead Japanese women). Can you say "The Ripper of the Ring?" Do not start with me "dead baby" Not even that awesome! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! Just save the poor zombies guilty and some lives that are unlikely to be damaged by forgiveness! 1/10! Isha! >. <
