It seemed like the movie might be good at the beginning, but its expectations never ended. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (usually Asian directors), but it does not know how to make or say a good story to go along with. The story has been broken and seems to be moving across different parts of the whole film, there is no solid, explanatory, interesting connotation found. Basically, the movie will not fit the interpretation on the press release. The performance was very good, however. All actors gave good performances, and Jude Law has always been as outstanding as he was outstanding. He was so weak that he chose such a weak film.
