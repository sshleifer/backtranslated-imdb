Television years ago, after watching the censor version of this film, I was interested to see an unwanted version. I was surprised that it was more credible and better acting than to remember, but one thing was really standing. I think other critics have also mentioned this, for example, what is the nature and motivation of the role of Chris Sardon? Has he been raped before another victim? Is he a complete psychologist or an "average" socialism? How did he expect a little sister to attack him? Is this character all credible, or does it require more background? She is almost too busy to be an uncomfortable credible character, and be able to actually put on a teaching job that keeps her in touch with young, weak girls. It seems to be the biggest complaint to the general audience. There is nothing to do with his performance, which is incredibly believable. The film is merely a source of insensitivity and disproportionate condition among half the serious medical treatments, in no case, without settling. The worst movie never made, but not all that is good, either.
