This is a film in them which is a great video box but camera work and unknowingly actors have woken up to talk with bad conversations. It is so dark to kill that you can not see it and it's hard to understand plus. Only star Wenc Sanchez of WCW (Tygres in WCW before folded it) and she is a good actress. I like the special budgets of low budget movies which have errors because they make fun but they are not one of them indispensably. It's okay to see this movie that you like Voodoo and Shattered heads but this is not a blockbuster but if you need something new then see Fuel Rentals.
