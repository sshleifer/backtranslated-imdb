This film was made for fans of Danny (and film cradle). I'm not one of them. I think he is an imitator riding black metal bandwagon (still, I'm not usually a fan of black metal). But I was carrying this money for this DVD case, I believed myself that some of the less authentic try to be credible. So I think I'm a Rubber Gore roller-coaster round and spread it with a terrible background. Now, what I like is <br /> <br /> <br /> I returned home. I have patience for 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and discoloring quality. And then that was (2002), it seems to be shot using a Hi8 camcorder. I leave it to look. A beautiful evening with beer and Bmovies will create a beautiful setting for this ... pictures. <br /> <br /> I returned a few months later (in the mentioned environment) and saw half. Then the specified direction only disturbed me. Introducing my dislike. I saw how ridiculous (1,65 meter, 5'5 "height) of his platform shoes were in different hugs, there is no sense, I still did not finish it, so I was not positive. <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, yes, it took me 5,5 years.) So - actually the Devil Shane / Mansion / Super-illegal-man The helper was funny and did not understand the movie Why do I think that he is very bad, very bad, they are both pretty and they are quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> Some of our short stories have been contributed by Danny, who is a man who is Keeping one's leg because he wants to use it on his own, yes, okay. <br /> <br /> Actor's Rock Button, CGI is the worst and, son, Stinger's CGI Baid). E. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that can keep you observer is that unmotivated violence and violence, blood and nuts are made quite well, why you can see that the film was raised there and then Gone (For example - Dani 'The Man' takes a stuff cat from the Firth - which can be fake - and it decreases ... and then eat what has happened, why? We do not know, we know that this cat is certainly illegal, Her heart is almost half-sized.) <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is so bad but it's good, it's bad. Filth fans can add 3 points to crazy. I add one for Gore.
