Blank Check is a TV that I have seen on TV one day and they do not like most movies at TV block checks. The first person I never met was seen empty check, and this includes people who grew up in the 90's. Also the black check in 2002 will not be remembered that it will be shaded by Pixar films. I do not call Blank Check a bad film but it's really really entertaining. The empty check is not an entertainment movie (or not at least for anyone aged 6 years old), because nothing about it is not realistic. Everything lets you go "What have I not seen before?" Closing empty check rips, trying to cash out the home from Richi Rich (which is both Macaulay Kulkina enough). Blank check is not a bad movie, but it is worth the fade in ambiguity.
