Yowza! Anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can see this movie and love it, you are a better person than me! This movie honors the efforts made by 'Emulators' Lorl and Hardy's appearance, words and routines, even as a film of substance. I blame Larry Herman. The dialogue is torn from the old L + H film and is planted unreasonably, the plot mixes with the absurd character of other illogical co-stars, Pinchot's pronunciation was intensified for Stan and did excellent work with the pronunciation of Sartain Oli, he also tried hard. It is difficult to create that wonderful mix. Where was a (good) musical number? The editing is sticky, hard to play, lines are scary, physics-communicable - (Perhaps they're trying to give a sense of the cheaper sets?), And it's terrible thing to testify as a whole. More painful than ATOLL, where the legendary two managed their last film in the 1950s and in the horror films of the world. Do yourself good and see as soon as you can see the original lorrels and hardies, and learn how to do things. Do you know what a magnet, is not it? Stan Laurel has not answered with half-Moroccan quips for each sentence forever. <br /> <br /> I think it was a perfect update / honor for the boys. Where did the classic theme song ?! Why destroy 'another fine mess' here? Why avoid any "wise"? Why was the co-star a uninterrupted cheating?! Why Miza from Oz's Wizards ???? Why will be the unlawful lottery unlawful? Why buzz! And what has helped channel funds funded? <br /> <br /> I really mean to say For God's fame, fart jokes <br /> <br /> Fate JOKES.
