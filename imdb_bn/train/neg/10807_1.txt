This movie has been successfully proven that all of us know before, professional basket ball players suck everything as well as play basket and ball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even start to describe how badly bad this movie is. After all, is it only me, or the one that you ever saw the most vulnerable children? I mean, his teeth can be used as a canopener. Second, why does a genie want to continue her career in the music industry, even though she has magical powers, yet she is terribly lost in making music? Third, I read the Bible. In any way the shape or form said it made Jesus genies. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that acne-laden nurse with a computer can have a better effect than that. Fifth, why end up suck so bad? What is a design? And finally, anyone who created nightmares, known as Qajam, needs to be dropped into a flat and eiffel tower, because the film takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
