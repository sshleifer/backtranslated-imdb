I think I saw this movie, but do not quote me, because I used to fall asleep while watching it because it does not capture my "excitement and imagination." At least I know I have seen it enough so that I will not see it again. Or never <br /> <br /> <br /> Speak about Liam ... really hair. Completely hair It will not even appeal to six years old. It basically had no appropriate dramatic effect. Zilch Nada Just turned turned into rock drake. Comedy? Was it supposed to be a comedy? <br /> <br /> <br /> Now if the aliens were uninterrupted like "Kriters", then we could have done a little deeper human character. Excessive sunny cutesy ones ... like screaming and screaming and running for their lives so they can not be eaten so much to be more exciting than seeing the paint paint dry. <br /> <br /> Do not bother watching this. It's not worth the effort. You can make something more interesting The paint is like dry watching. Or sleep asleep.
