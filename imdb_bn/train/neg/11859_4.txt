Well, if you want that you are comfortable with this comfortable, blue, and insect flicker, about a middle-aged widow, little better than her young adult or old girl. Set in Tunis, mother's poodle around the flat, gets antisi, and unwittingly (she can not help herself), decides to dress and dance in a local cabinet. Meanwhile, her daughter is sending dancing. The general denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This image is full, so I have watched DVDs on x2 and read subtitles, they are fast moving through very simple dancing and walking walks (they are everywhere), and for walking and x4 only for plain flying, though this annoying, uneventful, low budget Some of the flick has garnered how some pretty good critical plaudits. Go figure (C)
