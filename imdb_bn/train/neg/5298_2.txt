I rented this movie because I'm browsing through the horror movie section of those movies which nobody can hear and could be a possible gem. I saw it and, since I am a victim of violence and pride, I found it. This has received an EM rating which means: Very mature. This rare and high rating was completely meant for violence and everything else, I got it. Box alert says: extreme violence, extreme lingas and nudity. My fancy hit "extreme violence" The movie ended up being a fantastic sheer slasher flick. It was one or two poor scenes but I saw a PG-13 movie worse. Of course, the amount of Gore in a movie is not that all count, right? You have plots. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing really special about it. Do not hire it I tell the truth. I can not imagine how anyone can enjoy it, where they say: "I'll rent it again." It was the moment where it kept you going but I'm not going to see that film again.
