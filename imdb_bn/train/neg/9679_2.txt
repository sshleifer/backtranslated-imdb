This movie was horrible in the worst way: you just do not care. You do not care what happened to the plot; You do not care about letters. Everyone's heart was vain. I used to walk in about 45 minutes because I just did not want to do more to my mind. There is too much sex in the film. Sex can be right; It can even create movies (so a formative formula), but here the sex was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Do not see these pictures.
