This movie also strikes me more about the number of people who love this movie, that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I am very acclaimed. Leeds was absolutely no chemistry. For a second I can not believe that there was something deeper than desire in them. The story is not just true rings. Add that stilted conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow plot which basically leads somewhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. The naked scenes of the KEN LANZ may be suitable for those seeking a decent rent, but otherwise it is a huge waste of time. When I saw the movie, I thought it was better than the title of "Chess".
