Like most people, when I heard the idea of ​​the film, especially after the "filmmakers have been attacked", it seems to be strong, this film seems to be strong, what is the picture behind a ragged picture on the filmmakers? Then, to watch and discover the film, oh, what did "the attack on filmmakers" mean that some children threw stones in a sign and most people complained loudly and said, "Somebody Should they kill those two kids. "The film was like a cover," back "? Total fabrication. Manipulation is understood to make sense with more money and time, which I think relates to the theme of the film, the liars and the fools. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how much truth the audience should take. Away from this film. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger and Mie", but if "Roger and Me" Murray Flint is mocked. It is completely misdirected and completely insane. How nice! Can you believe that people affected by the yoke of communalism will be interested in the market full market? What a quarrel! And it is not so much, "See the effects of capitalism and the effects of Allah on the eyes of the god of the Western world", because the competitors in their counterfeit market did not have comparative value, it was that many people in the movie say that the price was oddly low, someone mentions that they know it It was fake about how much a fake was charged for. That does not prove anything other than the poor people, go to the store at a lower price, Brovo Falas, go to the bottom to get away with the people. <br /> <br /> The way to play a stupid, practical joke is to help older people. You should be very proud. For your next movie you will create a documentary about Iraq and how will people be really excited about the house without the bullet holes, and then say, "Oh no! There is no room! You are so stupid and BE <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
