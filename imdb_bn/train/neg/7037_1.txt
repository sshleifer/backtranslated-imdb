It's really a terrible movie and 2 hours of your life waste. It is soft and objectionable at the same time with nudity and lots and violence. However, nudity is not that exciting, and violence is repetitive and annoying. Also, this plot is best spread, the characters are unrealistic and persuasive, and the act that I've seen is the worst. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie seems to be funny, but not so. I smile once I see it, even I do not crack a smile. The makers of this movie tried to unify a comedy film with an action movie and they failed in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some poorly made movies are fun because they are very bad, but this is not one of them.
