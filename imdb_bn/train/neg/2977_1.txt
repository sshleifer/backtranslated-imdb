Title: Jumbo 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Director: Most Lucio Fluchi, but Claudio Fragaso and Bruno Matteo <br /> <br /> Cast: Otaviano Delacquo, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Daren Sarafin < br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this Flickr and get some good backgrounds, I will start from the beginning. And in the beginning this really dead George Romeros Dawn. When Don came out in 79, Lucio Fulci made an indirect signal on him and decided to call it 2 Jumbo. That movie is known as plain ol jabbar. You know zombie fight with sharks! OK, after that flashlight (naming the Jumbo 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge portion of cash, Italian decided, hack. Let's make some more junky flicks! These things are raging! So Zoom 3 was born. Still confused? The story of this story is actually a rehears of stories before many American zombie flicks we have seen, which is the best comparison between deaths and deaths. Let's see ... the government is experimenting with a specific toxic gas which will turn people into jumbo. Generic population and canister was released in Shibganj! We get loaded zombies for human flesh. People start running away from a bunch zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Gore's favorite godfather is sick from Italy Lucio Fulci has been So he could not really finish the film as it wanted. Then the film was handed over to two low-level directors Bruno Matte (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragas (Jumbeia 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was not already good. Phulki himself saw that this flicker had no heart and soul. She was disenchanted with it. He shook the producers and basically said: "Whatever you want to do it!" And God loves them, they did. <br /> <br /> That's why women and mentors have such a painful zombie flick with our great director as "director". The main problem of my opinion is so uninterrupted bore! There is no substance in it! In the first few minutes some terrorists steal poisonous gas and accidentally free it, the rest is only a bunch of empty words that are running with a personality with a personality. Now in some cases it may be fun, if # 1 creates a zombie and zombie action is really good and fun and # 2 there is so much involved and involved. <br /> <br /> We are not here! Well there are some inspired moments, for example, when some are infected by eagle gas and they start attacking humans. It was awesome. A flying zombie head (which denies all the logic and explanation), and a scene with a view to get out of the abandoned hotel pool and throw a foot of a poor girl. But away from him ... the rest fell flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> Continuous scenes on endless scenes, which do not junk to remove non-existent plots already. That was my main strap with this flick. Incomplete set of set and industrial aspects are actually existential. Everything looks so disgusting when I hate it! I like my B-movie, but it really went down! If you ask me around G-level Flick <br /> <br /> Jumpy up? Pure shit Zombies are all Asian actors (filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies. But since the film was set in the Philippines, it is not a big problem. The look of zombies that it really sucks! They all died due to the same cloth. And to make the key for zombie here is a bunch of black make-up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two bodies had to make a little more complicated, but it still was not good enough to affect. In front of the actors face a bunch of powders. So this flick slowly paced but zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead people! Anyhows, whistle flick for those who expect normal coolness it probably mostly flick someone else because it does not come in expectation. And those two involved (Mathias and Fragasso) did not really hold there heart and soul there. In fact, when you see extra in the DVD, you will find that Fragas do not take it seriously when asked about its memorabilia and its feelings. You can say that he was ashamed of him and in many cases he said, "There was only one job and they did it." And that's my friends, this flick ends nail. There is no love, and there is no heart to make this image. Therefore you get half ass, crappy zombie flick. <br /> <br /> only to see the full or whoever has ever seen or zombie flick. Everyone else, do not even bother! Ratings: 5 out 1
