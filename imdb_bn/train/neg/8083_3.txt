Richard C. Notified by Surfian, this disaster pushed Japanese theaters before the arrival of the US and Japan immediately before the video, in which Turner Networks did not meet again until they needed anything other than infra-chemicals to meet their 3 to 6 slots. Their bin the following tape. Smith's name should be used when the studio movie is so badly hacked that the director does not want to associate his name. But I'm scared that Sarfyan can not blame this studio completely. Actor, most recent graduate "Overweight 101", provides a Cornell line after another. The plot is convoluted. Special effects are unimpressive. The part that is not ridiculous is just plain rare. Script or book should be good - why would Pauline, Mattason, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this naughty? But some pages have been seriously wrong on the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not good enough to be bad- it's good not to be bad.
