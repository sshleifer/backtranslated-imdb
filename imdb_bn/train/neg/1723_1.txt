Man, what turned this turned into a bribe! Because it was not good (since I did not really expect anything from it), but I was confused by the DVD Slave, because Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill unknowingly paraded their "star". Of course, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the film, the rest were very few among them! As it turned out, the only movie that connects these three actors together is unclear LAS VEGAS Lady (1975) ?? But what does one have to do with Crater Lake MÃ¶ntter? Even when I paid $ 1.50 for her rent and I was in the mood of a giant-movie, I was chosen to watch the movie regardless of it, and yes, it's Stank! In addition to its anonymity and an anonymous crew, an illogical amateur sky was visible from miles away and what I can do with it is the jurisdiction-like persecutions and deliberately, both deadly layabouts - including co-owners of the boat's antics who frequently bumused Squabble among themselves with the local Sheriff. The animal itself ?? Pleiosaur like half-dinosaur / half-fish ?? Incredibly unraveled (naturally), but as seen in Giant Cloud (1957), I have also seen it, as soon as they can make movie makers as soon as it does not seem to disturb others. Especially the second half of the movie!
