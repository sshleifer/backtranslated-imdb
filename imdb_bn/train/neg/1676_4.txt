Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, tough performance Josh Lucas, tough performance. Modest acting three very compelling actors The problem is, who knows about the plot? John Holes Despite the Eds deal, a good man, a drug addict, and a man who is going on adult films does not just make a playful character. <br /> <br /> and after a deadly massacre in Los Angeles in the late 80's, with which Holes was involved, was charged with the arrest and murder, and was eventually dropped. Just as in OJ case, regardless of the result, regardless of crime, "he did it" was quite high in the region. <br /> <br /> There is no sympathizer in this film, everyone is a self-serving criminal. There is nothing interesting in the distance here.
