That might be a bit rigid for me, but sadly in his career career so far its true. She has a look at what far so far. They just made it 3 stars. <br /> <br /> Why did I see this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance carries the whole movie. I hope he gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into a big league of actors, he's definitely skillful. Greg was not so impressive, usually TV acting style. <br /> <br /> The movie is classified as surprisingly horror. The only "deadly" small flashbacks, and lasting 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. I personally call it a "play / thriller". <br /> <br /> However, the story is funny, bad instruction, editing and acting (Lucy from Apple). You will not get any real connections with actors, in a story that is important. You just sit watching watching nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... I think TV soap will be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Stay away from this movie ... or better but Michael is involved with Hurst to stay away from anything.
