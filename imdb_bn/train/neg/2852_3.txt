This is a thoroughly unpleasant, if made slickly, movie. I tried because it's about Richard Dreffas and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors and plot lines - a public brain is going to be released from an emotional institution - it's committed. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. We have an ongoing continuation of the shots - if you are a bit exaggerated, internally, shooting each other - while talking about obfuscation and mysterious dialogue, head, stomach, knee, foot, heart (no part is avoiding posture, seems like) with some permission Post-modern methods are supposed to be ridiculous. Goldmember's dialogue for the whole movie can be fit in 3x5 cards, and he has a facial expression - a Sardine Green - across. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are the best they can do. Birt Reynolds is not a Camio. Credit list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I miss them anyway (their best move in their part) The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and helpless; An heir, I doubt the style of 'Paul Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Motherland Killers' style. If you like it, you probably like it.
