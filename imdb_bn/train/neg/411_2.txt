My inspiration does not seem much to comment on any movies I usually love, but in one such case I have to say something. This movie is terrible, irrational, and stupid. There are so many errors in the story that I am not even obliged to elaborate because the time has come to remove from my experience. But the most annoying thing is that at any time in the movie, the inspiration for the characterization of Bacon's character gives no explanation because of the trip to the body or the physical response to his condition. <br /> <br /> Specially given effects are impressive, and Paul Verhoeven has done some good things in the past (Robocop's director's cut on DVD is great). However, this movie does not come near to stupid and generally to explain the point or technical aspect of the subject and instead stays for the expected steps without any benefit. <br /> <br /> In short, many other reviews tell here (if I used to read them earlier ...) - Stay away from this film!
