The film was a good idea, but the execution was not effective. <br /> <br /> What is this idea? Well, according to the story, it fills "Dirty Harry" "M". A child killer started a city terror. The lead detective (Dennis Hooper and Frederick Forest) did not ever face the serial killer. The mayor and the police chief, frustrated, seizing the things secretly to hire local people ... to go to places and do something that the police can not finish this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image can really give some good things. <br /> <br /> In addition to the idea, I saw the secret of the killers. Norman Bates has her basement. This guy has an eerie sewer. In some shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflection on the walls; Often these scenes provide an amazing, dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good. Dennis Hooper is one of the actors who gets better with age. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The path is very fast. Both teams seem very rushed as opposed to complex and impressive feelings of actual investigation process. It can be modified in two ways: the film can be longer or it can spend a lot of concubines. None of these can give more time for real mystery. <br /> <br /> How bad it is, for example, an important signal that only helps the right suspects in zero. This: At one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet store ... it's right ... I'm totally serious here. It seems that they have been pointing to ZK (suspect) from point B (first formula) and avoided all "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> then there are letters. I really liked two pick-pockets that you fill in almost half way through the movie. They remember the minor character, I want a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the corners of the crowd. This gets me the most because this is why I uploaded $ 3 to buy the DVD first place. I mean, what a hook! In the last 10-15 years, the serial killer was completely sticky on Flickr <br /> <br /> <br /> I said the methods of gangsters were brutal, but at the same time fun and thrilling. ; Like a vigilante movie or something ... they will probably even throw in some heist movie elements. After all, we are talking to criminals. Instead, we are given some of the most annoying protagonists committed to celluloid. Intelligence questions are witnesses. What does the crowd do? They ask and kill them. It is not that even like these witnesses are even worse. I actually found the criminals less loved than the hunter killer. <br /> <br /> As long as I've mentioned the good points are enough for your interest, I'd say it's a miss. Maybe some days, they will reuse the same story idea and it will be right. I hope so too. I hate to see such a good idea to waste waste.
