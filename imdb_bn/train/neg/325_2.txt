Shortly before, Billy Bob Thornton ("Sling Blad", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Was WAT Drama"), it was inevitable that there would be a weird Turkey there. However, I did not understand, this could be bad. I'll think of how incredibly poor you think this idea - the most interesting conversations are: "Who's the guy", "who's there?", "Big Stunning Man", "Big Sting Man Who?", "Big Puffy Man - Are You ! ". Yes folks, it's really bad that. Billy Bob for just two minutes (I think his career was necessary at the time), and the rest of the film is painful. Although for some reason, although it is definitely terrible but I do not hate it. Perhaps because I do not save my budget for special effects such as a high budget, special effects like "The Fast and the Furious" and a "budget" flick like me. 2/10 a push.
