This is not a terrible trick around, but it is very Dulle. It's just no smile, and it spoils its remarkable production value. There is an awkward moment in the end, when Fu Mancha gives a "dose" of his Illnesser's "generosity" and tells him, "You have become my competitor and I can start again". However, the scene, along with Bar√ßa Kwouk's funny cameo in the beginning, is the only memorable part of the film. (* 1/2)
