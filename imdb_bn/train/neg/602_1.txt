Yet another example of waste waste from UK money laundering. Just show how this film proved commercial. The film council, who financed this unfortunate rubbish, in one of the London Underground Unused Stations, committed to film this clinched, digital sample, to watch half the mutant made of all the horror films, the film council saw and felt favorable in the simulation, most notably the dodolain . There are quite obvious failures to make remotely remorseful of the lead character until the final finale in his many sins. It's a little late! Of course all the development officers of the UK Film Council could observe this at the stage of the script. Add to this terrible acting and funny look of animals and you get a prime example of how to fear.
