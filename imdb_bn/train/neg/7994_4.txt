Most of the television movies have a pretty worthless movie that follows the killer insect script. Ants turned into mysterious killer ants near a hotel. I think the hotel's kitchen soyaas dry up on the bed due to the hotel's food. This movie lacks the mystery and it is not scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Destroys his bulldozer and huge tissue colonies.This hotel disturbs millions of ants and traps. <br /> <br /> End spoilers, overall, this movie is highly lame. I do not understand why it got a DVD release None of the eligible movies . My only guess is that Susan Summers DVD release of the film. This is a movie to avoid.
