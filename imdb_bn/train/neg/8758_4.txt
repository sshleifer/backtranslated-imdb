Not a film, but part of the British Invitation was a compilation collection of performances from the activities that followed the dynamic entry path of the world beetles. Some of these works did not create a big splash on this side of the pond, but many of them did it. The featured are: Harman's Hermes, Billy Jay. Crumar and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycomb, Nashville Tins, Animals, and of course, Beatles. <br /> <br /> It is so young they honed and polished their work.
