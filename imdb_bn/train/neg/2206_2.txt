A scientist on an island expressed deep sorrow over the death of his son, who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not make my dead boy a hamsterhead. Well, who will not? It's a Hamerhead shark that kills everybody, it's hard to be known as continuously known as "Paul". Also, William Forget's lack of credibility as a hero like McGoward-Kik-Ass-Bamboo. On the other hand, there are some hot girls who really look at the screen, when the sharks wish for another's death. Actually I found bad B-movies very funny. But for my taste, if it was made to reduce Rs 1000000, it became a better movie. Then it may have been fun.
