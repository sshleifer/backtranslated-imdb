It seems that the shining part of Shadow Rhimes outsourced this offshore writing somewhere, perhaps in Medicral? "PP" reminds me of a lot of tiresome, which is initially committed, but in the 1st episode it is conjectural between David Kelly Flicks (PicTay Bera, Alley MacBlue and now Boston Legal). They are so lazy to get crazy in case, they just raise sympathy or sadness. And it really stops good medical dramas - you're afraid of dramatic situations, "It might be me" feeling They're not funny. <br /> <br /> Actors are pretty good, but the lines of plot die and can not be brought back to life. I am a therapist, and I tell you - Amy Brevin plays the most incredibly inefficient, immoral, unrestrained therapist. Anyone wrote his stuff flunked ethics and transfer / counter-transfer courses in Stanford. Someone will have to give a code of ethics (part of the nose-bleeding wife and its therapist) to study them. There is no therapist that is bad. <br /> <br /> Fanning for women who have been growing - have died, we all graduated "gender and city". Addison likes him for his youthful aggression - it is so irrelevant that over 40 years of age is too irrelevant, and otherwise the talented actress does not believe in herself and does not give it very well. The only successful / tragic development is the decision to go to Addison LA and fight with "Voodoo Dr." and his barricades with widows. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a whole new writing team.
