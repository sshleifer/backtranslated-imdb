I'm not sure if users should be allowed to sit through halfway and then review movies, I'm afraid that I can not wait for another minute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ How to dare to try a (second rate) director and authors something bold that they are definitely unsupported delivering. What did they think? Where to start? <br /> <br />: I thought I was getting a part of America's BitSite America. What I found was the slapstick executed with no clich√© remaining weakly brutal. Fool hippie? Check out. Stupid fat police? Check out. Contribution to the horrific plot? Check out. Embarrassing female letter written? Re-evaluation Are you trying to illustrate the total neglect of the story? <br /> <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you see is a soap and this is not a very good text. Scenes with Knoxville. Scene with pre-girlfriend The scene with Knoxville has moved a lot in that. The scene with the former girlfriend was a little like the one in the past. And so ... <br /> Instructions: My friends and I decided, after considering anything, saw it as a bad episode of the Kwin, or perhaps the poor ducks of Hajjard. How that direction was bad Awesome jump cut, awesome camera work, clunky ins and outs from the scene. God, it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered that the director is an Irishman who is the most notable recent work, really wonderful BBC Sunday night drama known as Glen's empire. (Believe, this is the lowest common denimator TV). And then it all senses ... <br /> <br /> ACTING: We are now so critical that he decides to play some random guy on TV, if he is not too bad he is frustrated, we appreciate his efforts ? About managing just Knoxville get through each scene. There is no luck at the poor Christina. Its performance is a car crash (even though you do with that line, I do not know). 'Hippie' on the go: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. We did not go away from Chechen and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go, but I think you get my drift. What I'm saying is that, as mentioned in another review, none of the film gives a flying hostile fight for Bayward, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They did not know anything about American road movies and they definitely gave a curse about trying to do something with a fairly beautiful story from rock legend. This film was shallow, some failed to explore and the jaw starting from the beginning was suddenly strange ... Oh wait, I did not finish it till finally. And I recommend you stay away too.
