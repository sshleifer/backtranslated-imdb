Under the dense green glup of computer graphics, Ichikwa Sagro awakened the wondrous industry and skills. Alas: All lost. Scenes of Old Edo - Courtesy, Flowing on Sumida, Practicing and Acting in Nakamura-Ja - All were interesting and engaging, which has brought you back in an interesting and prosperous era. Kabuki stage action, which excels excels and excites Segoro, following that was more rich than that weird high denim. The audacity, the power of the audience, the colors of the set, the plot and the performance were much more satisfying than all the nonsense. What an incomplete opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors living, and he is lost in the drake.
