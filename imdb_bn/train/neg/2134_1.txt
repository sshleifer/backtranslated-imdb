With this cast and budget, you would expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cassack created a big movie on the strange border, is still working. No, he, his sister, and Sir Bane could save some of this garbage in poorly written junk. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than a sighted and poor series. The plot never goes anywhere, the development of writing, the stupid characters and the thin pages. If you consider the movie to be three dimensional, where stories and characters come in depth, the stinger steamboat comes flat on Mickey. <br /> <br /> The look of Dan Octa is a really terrible movie, but it's nothing but the problem of 1991, remembering the other memories. Actually, this movie is a project that kills a career and exposes agents.
