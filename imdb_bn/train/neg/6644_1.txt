Yes, that! ... No, Pintili does not like to wear her actors' clothes and show their privacy publicly. Pintilie is the naked "emperor" - so say ... <br /> <br /> It's time to tell someone the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat close in the body of an old man. There is no artistic validation of its abundance of naked scenes. It is 100% visual distortion: The actor gets his kick by creating the bush and creating his bills. And if he did this in front of the audience, he could get a hard-on-the-ear! Did you know that on the set of "Nicky Ardilien", he would embarrass the poor Coca Bloss by telling him: "Oh, coca, how do I want to **** you!" She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became ambiguously shy - her tiny satisfaction! And, as an alarming alarms about the lack of obscenity and lack of education in Romanian listeners, many people are so stupid to announce this impressive "work of art"! Can anyone express its authenticity?
