Warning Speaker ***** A group of Italian young travelers is a real stupid movie about which to find a armor of legendary warrior with a giant soul. One of them wore it and was overwhelmed by a demon spirit. It's wasting time and some of his friends are dying to revive the monster dead under his blade. <br /> <br /> The time wasted for the audience, when the fairytale youngsters of the film left their clothes, Gore is the best fancy, and acting terrible, perfect pairing for such a bad script <br /> <br />
