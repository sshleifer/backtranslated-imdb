Holy @ #% and this movie was warm and juicy from the still made pill. I tried looking down this pillow of waste but it was easier to slash my wrists and make the shooter shooter more comfortable than half the length of my screen. I've got the bottom part of the film or TV any time I've seen it, and some say. I once witnessed a cow whip in a field. I saw a half hour steaming pill, who knows ... it could be moved or something. Well that was nice time spent watching this tripe. Acting existed, this plot was somewhere else. I think, I have seen that a platform which escapes for the first time and goes back to Portland to become a Steven King Shire, roams the background in the backside of the old pickup truck. Please tell me the director is drinking medicines for such a medication. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medicines and I want to stand in front of the money required for his lobotomy reversal. Wow ... I can not give the full story of this review because none of the painful words can ever do justice in typed words. Just ask me if you are looking for a flick for some time and you see this Chilton in the rack, go to your car, turn on the engine, then straighten your fist in the fan so that you do not feel your bones and vibrations. Make sure the hand is your handle since whatever you waste your cash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He dint come on, he was too. What was worse is that he had to see this $% & @ thing TWICE! I've heard of their wedding now and she gets her ball visits once a month. I hope this was because of this picture.
