This movie is SL-O-WA. Most of the movie is waiting for it to 'get started'. <br /> <br /> The setting was silent, the script was suddenly, the cinematography was silent, the plot was frustrating, the budget was low, low budget movies were bad, but it was not a freedom fighter). <br /> <br /> This plot was more corrosive with a harmful, less harmful hunter than the actual Wendigo, which gives a very brief look at the end. Movie This was frustrating itself as this 'Wendigo' was only an odd mixture of a tree and a kid. Everything about the movie was reluctant. <br /> <br /> The little boy's parents get separated and sometimes they are completely separated from their son. I'm not sure whether it was bad acting or bad script, but it only boosted my frustration and boring levels. <br /> <br /> There was nothing to worry about, there was nothing to be interested in. Without any real conspiracy or chill factor, this film is so painful, you are not taking less care than what has happened in the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Trying hard, but coming as crazy and annoying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to see it again. I just hope that the terrible might end up being something interesting ... but it did not.
