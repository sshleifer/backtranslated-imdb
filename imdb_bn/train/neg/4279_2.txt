I found a DVD of $ 1.00 Bint "I Dream of Jeii" on Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was "Story of Stephen Foster", being a musician and music teacher, I had to see it. It was not mentioned in the cover for the rebuilding of the "Sivani River" of 1932 that I had no idea what a year it was created. Bill Sherily's painting screenplay is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. People have no testosterone and are a wimp through a way! Steven Foster believed that I have a hard time publishing the music of his music and giving him any benefit ... without paying him for them! Along with that ridiculous idea, Ray Middleton and his black face "Crisie Minerstell" were difficult to show Steven Foster's songs in about 20 minutes, which at least meant to say. I believe that anyone who considers fit to revive this film in our present time. This is an embarrassing and forgotten one. Fortunately, the song of Stephen Foster will never be forgotten .... Also, the screenplay of Jilli's Aileen Christian must be the highest point in the lowest point in Hollywood history.
