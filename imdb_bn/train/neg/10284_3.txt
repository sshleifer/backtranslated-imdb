I saw men behind the sun, I suppose I hope for an evolution in style and technique to match the larger measurements of this film. I was very interested to see the incident-based fantasy account that was severely hit by someone who happened during the most notorious period of Japan's torture, but it is not. It's a mid-mid-stage European Nazi exploitation in the 1970s - like this. SS test camps (probably like exiles in special categories). It is estimated that this is going to be a great opportunity and many people are near, but it is very cheap and resorts to many cheap and silent devices in vain device, which falls on the sound of a fake gun and sometimes weakly executed 'shock' sequence. The horrific documentary footage of confessions is almost splinterous in the scene so Hackneynid is that even these real images hide much of their power. See Channel 4's 'The Holocaust' (Recently Broadcasted), Number 1, 006) for a really annoying documentary on the evil of war (see the unique feature of the actual footage). Awesome treatment of this kind of Nanjing, this hackneyed absorption is not garbage (it was good to reduce a good execution movie on the stock footage disrespectful but it is not a very good exploitation film again). Ratings: 3 (As per 5 absorption, 1 treatment as 1).
