Spoiler !! I love Branagh, love Helena Bonham-Carter, love them together in "Frankie Steinstein of Mary Shelley" - but this - I can extend an actor's desire to avoid romantic stereotype. . Well, they, but really - droned scripts, Bonham-Carter's clothes were sticky, and sometimes a "madcap" sequence, in a Beatles movie, or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh- <br /> <br /> I never got the point - other commentators say that the character of Brangha was a dreamer. I have not felt that. He was not a damaged, and very bright, and certainly not respectable. The trade watch with the bank robbery camouflage was painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, with his height above a hill, was buried under his aircraft monstrosity was very scrubbed. Was there an angel of the angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Take something with a classics or backbone and take a pressure on it. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
