I'm listing the AFI's list of the top 100 comedy, and I must say it's really the worst. The list I saw only has 90 movies, but I have seen any movie. Drunks are never funny, Dudley is not. Liza makes it almost perfect, but alas ... if you want her to see something good, just watch the watch be arrested. Frankly, doodle smile and drinking seem fun? I would recommend another movie for more humor than FIFA's top 100 comedies. If you want to see a fun "drunk", try Thin Man. Normally in the movie of Fannier, no Marx Brothers will hit the movie (especially if you are drunk as Arthur).
