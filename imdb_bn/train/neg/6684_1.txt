It should be re-titled "Unfair filmmakers curiously presenting a mistake of a non-horrific graduation as a shock movie." It's a long, annoying story of annoying hazing, a gag so transparent that even Flounder from Delta House could see it through. At the time of payment, an actor Jeff East could be forgiven for taking any work. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously played for cinematic heavyweight like George Lucas and Sam Pikinpah. Once taped is available but, thanks, not out of the DVD. Such a junk rubbish is not a landfill and elsewhere.
