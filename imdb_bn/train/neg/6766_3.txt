You've probably come to this movie probably you heard this phrase ?? "Harbie: Fully loaded with shit" and yes it's true. This movie is really awesome and completely hair. <br /> <br /> This is going to be Linsey's second worst movie. The only good thing about this movie seems to be more gifted, which is much better than movies and the only sold point of film. I do not see how this respected actor like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, did not he read that awesome screenplay before signing it? <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this movie, is how incredible power and imagination like climbing on the wall and it can go faster than a racing car after just a bitelin. I know it's a children's movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just got more stupid than entertaining. Little realism is needed and the plus story is very predictable. Final words: Until the children actually are 5 - 12 years old, I doubt that anyone can enjoy this stupid movie. What is my money I feel like cheating <br /> <br /> Ratings: 3/10 (grade: f)
