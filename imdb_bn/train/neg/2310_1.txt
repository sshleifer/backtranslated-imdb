It was a truly penetrated film. The third rate of performance, and the dialogue stilted so much that it just seems to have rolled over and died. My reason for renting it was simple: Find a movie with writing scripts. I needed a visual help for my presentation, so I figured why I did not use a clip? Boy i was wrong After searching my local video store, I came here, where the suspiciously "Starstrak" was the title. I thought, "what hey", and it decided to try one. Well, I was very dissatisfied with my outcome. Perhaps I could have used a scene, and in the meantime, I fell asleep due to Flickr's continuousity. So ... I took it back and picked up Ed Wood. As an example I have a movie I can use. Then again, "Starfucker" will be something that is presenter than drivel.
