The first movie is quite good. This one is very bad. <br /> <br /> Reimits many footage from Criminally Insane (including opening credits and last titles). The new footage, the video shot, really sticks out really badly. The scene lacks the correct light, the word is often switched, even the glitches like the photo continue to be like the picture. <br /> <br /> Like all bad signals, it basically repeats the story of the first. Ethel will kill everyone who share her living space, often due to their need to get in the way of the food they want. <br /> <br /> At least it is the DVD only for the first one, which also includes the same director's film Devil Black Wedding. Very bad it is not included in Death Nurses movie though.
