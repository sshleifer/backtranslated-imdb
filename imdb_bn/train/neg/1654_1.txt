Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible visual explosive (but who carries) *** Yes, okay: zero. And I rarely give 1. Even at the very least of the film, I look for a good speed topic for music, cinematography, imagination, its humor, and even as much as possible scores. It's its own general or subgenera looking for it. But absolutely nothing is released here. I can not remember another time when a movie actually sent me to the room up and down when it was over. I finally had the only reason to create it because I could not change the channel - I was just sitting there, I saw humiliating a little bit later. It was like a snake watching a rabbit digestion. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and pull this baby out, what are we After all, there is no technical work about "Whipped" which works. The visual is all sitcom style. All right pictures on the street street traffic over the cut-scene streets. Music and scores do not contribute anything to the movies - it's objectionable. There is nothing to contribute anyway, though not mentioned. The acting goes as it is like the cardboard and it goes to Amanda Pete (obviously "star" which destroys this train in green light). These guys, there are no supposedly good friends, no chemistry or purpose, unless director Peter M. Cohen rides them in a few minutes bus station before shooting. <br /> <br /> From the creative side, her body is a bone bone. It has no imagination. It does not show us that we have not seen it many times. The whole compound of this movie, or "turn", is based on male rebellion and "concept" that an emissary woman can play "just as they played". Anyone, because this way a packing seems or in no way originally launched a TV before. Roll up, shallow women are common. Male-bashing ideal It is not particularly stolen from anything, it's bad: it is stolen from clich√©s. I can not imagine making a film that is based on the echocardiology of other women and portrayed with this trend of humiliation. Want to rent me in the "Man of company" - or better, "There's something about Mary". This movie wants to be a "version" version of "There is something about Mary", so you can see sweat. <br /> <br /> There is no insight on women, men, dating, gender, or this picture. Cohen only content to reinforce the legends that are inspired from other sex movies. On the other hand, the film does not work as a mockery, but it can be seen as "satirical" although it is superbly convincing, but the reality does not implement the truth that is needed. It does not even know what satirizing. Then the dialogue, which screaming obscenities to each other, is a little more in character. Example: Character 1: "F ** You" Character 2: "Oh yeah, good F ** you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the following line, which can excuse all others Discretion: There are lots of movies without plots, without good acting, confused conversation with morally unfavorable character and obscenity which was fun and so good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skill or time. The circumstances are completely foolish, not based on any chain of truth, especially enough to reduce us. All the characters have been drawn broadly so that they can be related to the lowest minimum common indicator. Just look at the "Marquee scene", "Classical classic" hair gel scene. One of our left anti-heroes opens a medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peat)'s vibrator. For some reason she found the holy grail she shines down. I do not know why Cohen thinks the brothers are reacting this way. When he torn himself, he threw it into the toilet and then tried to catch it with his bare hands, oh my, Mena roams on it. Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But surprisingly, people really like this movie. Of course, people like "friends" and reality dating shows, so I should not be surprised. All of these have a common thread though. "Whipped" is a big proof to me that there is a huge pockets of people in America that will only laugh at any joke due to sex. They will love a show or movie (or they will like it) because it is about dating or relationship. There is no lack of quality in this quality. For example, white tooth and thin body inspires people to sell broth and weight loss programs, they are also motivated to embrace the darkness of dating / relationship related to the sale of cheap, empty, easy TV, movies and any of the products. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />
