My wife and I found this film extremely dissatisfied. When you leave the theater, this plot is interested in you and is busy thinking, there are only several loose edges that do not understand in any sense. (Expulsion) Christopher Plummer, a very wealthy head of a NY bank has a terrific secret secret. Profitable from WWII, relating to the nazis and secret loot stolen from the Jews, he kept his credentials in the bank's security deposit box (with diamonds and documents alongside Nazi socialists). Why? If he never disclosed, why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago? And diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why not put them to settle them? How does the bank robbers find his secret? How did they know this security deposit box in # 232? SS Detective Washington Washington has also discovered bank records for SD Boxes No. 231 and 233, but # 232. Weird He sincerely found the time to somehow make a tiring inquiry to bank records in order to discover this one strange reality. All the time with the threat of starting a red hot hostage situation and bank executions execute them temporarily with the robbers. How nice! Talk about super power for a detective. <br /> <br /> The bank robbers left the loose vault with millions of dollars in loose currency. They only accept the contents of the SD box # 232, probably due to the blackmail of the bank. It denies any reasonable effort as a logical mastermind, or in a logical explanation illustrated for its pregnancy with a low brain. <br /> <br /> While using JD Foster, his political connections with NYC mayor, the majority of the robbers of bank robberies under the control of the bank have been granted permission. He proposed a contract to return the documents to the main bank's robbery, but he is not interested. So what is his point (if any?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My wife is proud of all players, Christopher Gammer (President of the bank), Denzel Washington (secret detective), and Jodie Foster Disappointed. Shooter for high-power problems. <br /> <br /> I saw the last Jodi Foster film, "Flight Plan", which had not been understood in any sense by the hole also. I think I liked Jodie Foster, but perhaps I could avoid his future films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can very rarely inspire my wife to go to the movies. I can not agree with her ... "Earn money, and time a WASTE." Be forewarned. Writing a well filmed film, fine actor, lousy script
