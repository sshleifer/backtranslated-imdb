This is the first Ian McGregor movie I've ever seen outside Star Wars. Since then, I have become a fan of Ian McGregor, but I still can not forgive the existence of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> My sister has always become a fan of Zen Austin and because of this I have under the classic variety, Emma is one of them. I've always considered them irritating, stupid and annoying. However, after seeing this terrible presentation, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delicious and pleasant. After Frank Churchill hacked and hacked, Ian McGregor did not work for any purpose in this movie. Gainesha Paltrow is ridiculous in a ridiculous character and the rest is disrespectful and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation for anyone who is interested in English dramatically ... see the original. If you're a fan of Ian McGregor ... Believe me this film, you have not missed anything jointly for five minutes because of a harmless hat and bad hair.
