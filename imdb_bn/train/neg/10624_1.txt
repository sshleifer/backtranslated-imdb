Otherwise better review, loleralacartelort7890 says "True, Americans use a secret anti-aluminum anti-radiation-alloy. It is not well known and the exact specifications are a secret. And why it is a secret: Well, why would they reveal it? If they A space is in racing but it will be very foolish to reveal to them that they have new technology which is against the crew Who can protect. "This is totally wrong. Apollo has no "secret" protection (and was) in radiation protection. The design and construction of the Apollo Command module has long been published. It uses a lightweight "honeycomb" aluminum and stainless steel. The entire surface of the outer surface (of course, behind the window) is covered with a foamy resin made heat shield, intensively close to re-entry. These materials are actually * better * than the lead (charged particles) which prevents our radiation from blocking, which is suitable for closing ionizing photos like X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation due to the risk of large solar flares * Long-term * Space is a specific problem for flight. But it was not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. Command modules gave them quite good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) transit through the Van Allen belt. They all carry the dosimeter so that we know how many radiations they have received: more than 1.5 and generally lower amounts. Of the 24 men traveling to the moon (12 of which are permanent), 18 are still alive. Only two have died from cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigort (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attack, pancreatitis (Rosa), and motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are now pretty good figures for a group of men (Shepard 86) in the late 70's.
