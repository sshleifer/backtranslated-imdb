This movie is a hatred, and should be considered as a capital offense made of it. <br /> <br /> Why has none of the great mysteries of film making ever adapted to this wonderful mystery film? It's really a secret mystery, nice old romance, and a story of dry English humor. Why the makers of the Scottish Yard Police had to change Richard Gordon into an amateur detective, introduced his stupid role and congratulations to the Englishman's staff, the main story of the murder charges and the situation of Gordon's struggle to defend the accused. , Etc., etc.? These producers and directors, who always believe that they can create better stories than books, should write their original script and should not rape another person's product.
