A noble effort, I guess, but eventually a poor one. Before watching this picture, I felt "Lands, The Scrivener" was impossible. After watching this, I still do. Unfortunately, I think those who are going to read the story will understand and they will be annoyed with the inappropriate review of the film (Update from 1850 to 1970, from New York to London). Even Paul could not rescue Scofield's fantastic divines in any way that I liked, but mistaken efforts of Melville's spiritual classic film.
