I saw this movie right now, when it was released and congratulated Israel as the best picture of the year here. And now to fix everything, I'll just say: this is not a good movie. It is the second feature film of Drawing Saul, and I must admit that his first and TV drama he made before this picture is very good. Much more, it's his first attempt at managing a drama. The first act was comedy, and was fun and effective. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, you must firstly inform: the formation of the state of Israel by hating the 21st century Israel kibbutz and the values ​​it represents. The real condition of Kibutzim is very scary, and some of them have become one after the other. The Kibbutz, Hebrew word is a collective, only a village for the members, where the quality of equality and socialism was a daily life conflict. With the change of social values ​​over time, it seems now that Kibbutuj is a place where human spirit was buried, without any ticket, was locked in ethics. In the '90s, capitalist values ​​and the gateway to life made it very difficult for Kibutzim to survive. The movie's crazy mother is the central metaphor for her. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to have nothing to do with Nostalgia for the old days of Kibbutz. Once, it dreams of living each young couple in a Kibbutz and raising children in this beautiful and beautiful environment. But the film shows the opposite. It was with Kibbutz, his socialist contradiction, a man of madness, like crazy ideas, which jointly weakened the freedom of each person. Post centralized philosophy of modern capitalism: Your personality is the most important thing. You have to set yourself up in the center, and no one else but you matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is the four sins that are followed in the script and its direction. The film has no real visual text and there is no shot to remember anything. It is very "fine", a subtlety that is not more than an artist to stimulate emotions, which is not a film, but not a sponsor, not with the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Perhaps it shows that Israel hates the socialist, and human values, in line with the rest of the world? Or maybe it shows that Israel does not provide a "fine" place, atheism and fanatism? We are essentially very human and good people, emotions, especially when they are fake, just like capitalism would be ours? Or could it be a reason to tell Israel's biggest lies in recent years, a lie that supports the existence of a Jewish state? The answer does not matter, it's not a good one. Not for the world, not for human value, and not for the Jews.
