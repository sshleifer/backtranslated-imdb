In the early 90s, many "Quikie" and "Off-Bits" came with independent films, with a special sub-section semi-spiritual desert crime film. Others on the note are "Wild at Heart", "Dus Teal Do Don", and in particular "Natural Motherland Killer". "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this vaguely exaggerated anti-composition "Under the Hula Moon". It is a comedy that targets a particular emotional voice, achieves it, but goes to the blazing point. The spirit of the desert-world-wide quest and the idea of ​​Chris Pen welding, the film is not too bad or difficult for good criminal films and does not pay enough attention to laugh. . I did not hit the end, but just say it would be bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of General Cancer. This is the dregs of India-Mania.
