At first glance, everything in this film wants a psychology: a "18-year-old" ban, which includes violence, drugs, sex, sex (including lesbian sex), vampire stories, some religious tongues, and even gay necropolis policemen! But then, this movie is a bad story (so thin), bad acting - you inherited a ridiculous English accent, you see a bad Monty Python - bad music ('80's hard rock), this video is awful. , The last one is a real shame ... plus the scenery scene is ridiculous, not very impressive. And those vampires reflect a mirror, and even do not fear the light of day! You are very frustrated, unless you see it as "Space Rebel" or "Troll 2". I hope the bloodstream will reach 100 by one day, because it's its real place. <br /> <br /> I would say it's fun to see if you have a friend and have enough beer. <br /> </ br> 3/10
