This movie is now my gage with which all other movies will be compared ... as it was, "Was it stupid as Revolver?" I was in the audience of the Toronto International Film Festival yesterday, where more than 2000 people filled with silence silently, quietly silently, quietly silently, quietly silently, quietly silently, quietly silently, quietly quietly quietly silently remained silently. It was amazing if Jason Stratham had only one purpose. In the first 10 minutes, he has given an offer by Andrei 3000 and Big Pussy (Promotional Fame) that does not make everyone a sensation! Then there are some shooting and then Ray Liota has been wearing a bizarre embarrassment briefly, then there are some animations, Ray Leota's naked butt, lots of shooting, shaving of teeth, art house pretenses and much more of the embarrassing body of Leota that shows the sunny. What I was not sure was the reaction that he was seeking ... which is not 5 times. Everyone in this movie thinks they are more efficient than average beer and Guy Richie thinks he's the incarnation of Yogi Bear. The story line did not go anywhere, but there were eyes outside the posting! If this movie can be bad, then Madonna herself is the only way.
