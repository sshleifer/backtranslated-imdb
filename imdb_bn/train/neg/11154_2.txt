This step was televised last night. I guess as a time filling, because it sucked worse! The film is an excuse to start a little while and a little bit of ass and ass (Though not bad tits and ass). But the story is very ridiculous for the words. "Wolf", if you can call it, but rarely its teeth are stored. When it is fully visible, you can clearly see that some of their terrorists are working on CGI because they are running in a treadmill as fleeing to the wolf, and it seems like the CGI animal is all shiny :) <br /> < The filling of beef and blood, and you can easily identify it that anyone who dies / will be eaten later. Even if you like these splatter movies you'll be disappointed, they did not work well. <br /> <br /> Do not even let me start with actors ... Girls scream everything about every 5 seconds But again, if someone tells me to do some bad money, then hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Overall boring and ridiculously awful.
