I was supposed to review it for a website, and I saw it with optimism that it would probably stop at least a delicious but entertaining rib, and it did not do well enough. "666: The Child" Perhaps I saw one of the worst supernatural thrillers (worse than "Godsend") scenes that shouted from "Omen" without shame. In the end, "omens" is very similar to the end. <br /> <br /> The acting, writing, and the stories that are all okay. If these movies make money, then I can see where the asylum is going. It's shameful.
