This picture was wasted time, even for DVD rentals. If the camera shots are faster than it gets faster, we can pay 20 rupees to get the lanromat, get popcorn and see the Dryer Spin. Jet Lee is much better than this. Only hope that he can not make a clip-ridden movie like The One at any time. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie, it is "one".
