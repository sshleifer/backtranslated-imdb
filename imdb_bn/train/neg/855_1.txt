Not the best movie to show nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about shining and it was expected to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but there was no story here. Fear was not a moment. I hope to find it in a scary thriller movie, but there was no horrible no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was the time of the change scene showing the "Wednesday" section. I have lots of pieces in the movie. Most things are nothing to link to it. The story is not about women or other scenes that are shown to us. The 80s might be a good movie to watch, but not for the 21st century.
