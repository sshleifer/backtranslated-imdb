Is a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent. It requires some reliance on something. <br /> <br /> This completely unfortunate film deals with the interaction between Irish people. Are they trying to imitate the extraordinary movie "crash"? If so, then this image is completely upset. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on here, running a little more bets and throwing stones in buses and cars, which probably lead to Mahab. <br /> <br /> The film work is very sticky. After 14 years, a woman loses her husband, when her younger sister is thrown out of a case. It turns the eastern sister into a bitter vault and wanders around the clothes of faith. Big sisters also became frightened but soon found romance. <br /> <br /> Then, we have 3 people who bought a mask for looting banks. Obviously, robbery becomes scary but there is no punishment for the crew. Probably, the writers should have been punished for the failure to create a harmonious film.
