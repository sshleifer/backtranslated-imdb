So do not even think of renting out of the store, because it's a bad movie. You think JJ Abraham has written this movie. Basically, a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back. Whole horror "Shake" can enjoy, but "Wallace and Gromit" fans will probably come back from hatred. Also, why do they do it in plastic or soil? I mean, CGI animation ?? For an Armman movie ?? !! Obviously, while the doorworks do the whole thing, the fireman wanders around. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every single character is awful, without that weird frog guy, ok for a movie villain. But there is something else about the movie, Dul, Dul, Dul !!! I almost slept with boring watching this movie. No, wait, in fact, I fell asleep with the annoyance of watching this movie. It's just terrible. But grateful, it's not as bad as "shake".
