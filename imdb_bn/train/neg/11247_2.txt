This movie was way-hyped. Many viewers, who considered this "amazing", would become old school movies, because the whole film was set in the past. At first I think the film is being shown from the past, so I hope that the light of characters will be forgotten like an enlightened dream, but it's going to be okay. Basically it was a movie trying to blend the past with the past, and 2 will not mix well in this film, even with special effects. You could actually see blue screens that were working with the actors. There are so many movies about what exactly this movie has done, so critics say that "this is sometimes the best film of all time" because there is no reason to promote the film. It's just shit on a stick. It does not help that the story line was sooo crappy I did not understand why Hollywood agreed to make this film, and I do not understand how actors / actresses are willing to stay in this movie. Almost everyone read the script as well and forgot to read the fine print ... "It will be done on a computer". It was a movie that was in the movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very sad with myself to pay the money to see this. Whatever you do, today or tomorrow, do not waste your time and money on this movie.
