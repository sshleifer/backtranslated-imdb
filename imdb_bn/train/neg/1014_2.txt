Timberlake performance almost invades the screen. It was not bad at all, I think the role of journalists was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL CoolJe generally played the role of Rapper, played around the most difficult, worst person. I do not think a smile has gone out in the whole movie, even while proposing her girlfriend <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is the high point of the movie There were some funny scenes. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacy was not good at the "there". <br /> <br /> Overall it is a dust movie. Bad plot Many of the actors have bad acting or wrong roles.
