Since the beginning of the film, the director gives the impression that the director is trying to portray something, I want to say that instead of the story, how the story should be changed, he changed the story, he went on the opposite path, the kind of step he wanted to make, and the suit Wrote the story. And he failed very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. In any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. He knows the media he is working on while crediting the director, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen a bad movie. Here at least the director knows to maintain consistency in the movie. And the actors have given a decent performance.
