This movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen without any doubt. And it seems to be a lot, like I saw Danone of Paradise, lovers' lane, and bloody murders (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and you can tell from my user name, it's really a stick out. There is nothing more enjoyable than a badly-made slasher flick at the time. For this movie, the scene of any scene where a woman becomes frozen in a cooling booth, there seems to be no impact on a film, especially since the movie tells you that this event happened two years before the rest of the year. The acting is unclear, and most of the camera shots are shrunk wrapped in spandex. Policeman was the monotone actor, facing most stones I've ever seen. But the best / worst part of this movie will be the killing weapon. A giant security pin?! What did they think? Who is the killer? An unhappy "Huggies" employee? I would give a complete grading of this movie, but if I did not have an explosion watching it darned
