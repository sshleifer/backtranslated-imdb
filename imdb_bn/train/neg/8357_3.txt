Oh man A piece of coincidence film making! But I hate to admit it despite being convicted of my child. They always watch this movie on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (on the right side of the Kapartino border), we had The G Channel at our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie once and again and again. Wonder Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love with love and young Brooke Shields and in the 1940s, I liked Dopi events in the Grand Canyon. The script almost does not understand, the part is poor, some highlight Henry Fonda creates an appearance, many conversations are so bad that it plays well on the end credits and a wonderful carol king song. Maybe you will really be the stone to enjoy this flick. Oh, everyone knows there is no gold in Grand Canyon!
