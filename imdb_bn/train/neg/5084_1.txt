I have seen this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm a movie / theater director and I know what I say. This is not Romania, but the incident is happening simultaneously with the incident from September 11. No story, no plot, nothing No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty pictures. <br /> <br /> Most of the Romans do not know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that the reality of Romania Also for teenagers Pintilie should stop making movies. I really do not know if we can call this movie, maybe horrible :) and we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. It was a reality, but is no longer there. One of my best friends from the British Embassy said, "You have no idea that the Romanians have been running a long way from Kuesusu".
