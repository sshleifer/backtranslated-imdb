Chris Katan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but perhaps he will not leave the film industry alone until he gets some kind of creative control. She is an annoying peppy character who is largely silently retarded and comes off as speed. Want to know just the fun part? They are previewed stuff. Yes, its presentation on me is funny. There is nothing else. Especially when you can say that he is working hard to become a physical comedian, which he will not have to try one by one. And yet, its 'Vet's Office Destroy' bits come cringingly as bad as it comes off. This movie has made me develop an eyeball. Avoid it at all costs, and keep watching SNL.
