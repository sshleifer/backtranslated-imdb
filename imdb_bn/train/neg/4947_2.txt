Dieter Bohelen, Germany's infamous Pop Heater and producer of a little trash pop hit, "You feel my heart, you need to tell my soul" to his story - and he has decided to recruit a ghost writer impressively. The result was a fun book in his life. Well, it's less or less a Fiji image. She does not deny that she is a selfish asshole but the whole story is to fit her own image. He probably beat his ex-wife and he has no words at the end of the hospital. But it was a fun style and a huge success after his presence as a jury member of the German version of "American Idol" - especially his remarkable comment. <br /> <br /> This story should end - really. Anyone known as "Duelland at Dan Superstar" (short dsds) must have come up with the terrible idea of ​​making a movie of the movie, in the promotion of the mentioned "Idol" TV show. As a result, "Deutter-Dar Film" <br /> <br /> I've rarely seen a movie that tried so hard to be funny and completely failed. Gag really hits someone dot. Although Naddel's voice and style of speech got straight on my nerves, Verona's voice should work more that though. Clear, child, anticipated and taller Gaga, this film spoils any motivation to look at the end in a few minutes. The theme of the film is adaptation of a silently recorded film by a ghost writer, based on Bollon's drunken ideological memory. They could use this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a mockery, but they failed. The story is completely unintentional and the background voice is that Bohlen himself guarantees that there is nothing satirical in the whole film. <br /> <br /> It is no surprise that it was considered bad for publishing a movie. The current season of DSDS turned into a mediocre success when some possibilities of this thing becoming weak in some archives were very recent. There are some programs in the frustrating situation for "Friendly" support from Germany's biggest yellow newspaper "Build" and TV station RTL, but still unreasonable show "Vetten Das ...?" The movie continues in Channel 2 till the end of the movie - unfortunately <br /> <br /> The time to watch this movie wasted - there are more interesting cartoons and it is actually worth watching. <br /> <br /> Therefore, 2/10
