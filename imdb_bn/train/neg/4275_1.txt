I do not understand why so many people appreciate this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most annoying titles in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen 1 episode of all the season and watching Season 2 episode 1. Only I can not take this show <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the creator in the criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> Seasonal agent Cooper threw stones in a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? While referring to the supernatural power given by Tibet's dream, he wants to identify the killers by making this 'joke'. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are many unnecessary scenes on this show. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a 'funny' scene, which is a stupid old man working on a cup of milk with a cup of milk in the cooper and cooper floor. (He threw the gun in his belly.) This old man is doing nothing by making a silent comment. <br /> <br /> <br /> This scene is really annoying and even long (3 minutes 30 seconds .... it's like Hell. <br /> <br /> <br /> This show More.
