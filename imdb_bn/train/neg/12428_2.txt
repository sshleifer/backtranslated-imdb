I liked the first two films, but this movie was a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I still wonder why I made this terrible movie. The things with plastic gun and toy car, that can go to another house is ridiculous. Joe Pacey and Daniel Storon were so funny in the first two films, but these terrorists are not so stupid and funny. Believe this movie is just a waste of time.
