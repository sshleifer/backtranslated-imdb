A cheap exploitation film about mom who searches for her daughter, who made up sketch films, kidnapped them. The train leads parents across Europe when she searches for her child and we struggle to sleep among the audiences. <br /> <br /> This is one of the backward soft-core sled movies that are made for people to provoke pornography with scandals or dangers shown above their credit card bill. Personally I want that miserliness because these movies are more interesting and honest than we are watching. It is not supposed to be a sexy thriller but its. Most people are talking about things in their place and walking far away from the place and moving towards leadership. Occasionally, many people wear clothes through film and everything is more than the S & M's touch. Violence and fetish material is rather awkward or even excited to stimulate smiles than tensions, it's all so incredibly fake. It's not bad to keep it interesting even nudity. (Basically the difference for course course for these movies) <br /> <br /> You will forgive my lack of detail, but it is simply a completely annoying film that I hope to be last, somewhat remote, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was that blonde-haired villainess with huge shoulders and a boiling-sized nose. I saw her as a little girl and wondered if she had plastic surgery, no matter what kind of thing you are thinking of a girl-thriller. Avoid <br /> <br />
