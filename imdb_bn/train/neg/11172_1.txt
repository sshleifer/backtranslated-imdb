The unexpected popular "I Love the 80's" of 2002 was a show of a crazy, stupid, offensive, and infamous crippled culture, which was the first ever show of a long line of television programs that ultimately ended the VH1, which was the only true music-based Channel went to TV! Until spring or winter I lived till VH1, what I can forget now, when the garbage starts appearing for a reason like 2002. From the perfect morazed curiosity (I guess what you would say) I decided that I would go ahead and it was shown first on the first show, though the ads seemed to be completely convincing. At least I can honestly say that I was not disappointed by it because my expectations were probably below the basement level below. In the first 5 minutes, it was seen that the emphasis on the show was low in every decade of the 1980s and was not significant or popular in the culture (which I wanted to see), but instead of an incomplete platform, in fact, the God-fearing real. No number of comrades are likely to appear more than what they think their curiosity is. I give you ... ... if you ask me like it! No one ever heard of this idiots before being present in this show, why not listen to it anymore because they are so curious and so-called "humor" that they can feel their gut feeling that each other after each other fired each other with a one-fishing boat Knot! Together, there is no problem telling me that the "love of the 80" was the lowest index trash and I'm not one of the main reasons since I do not see nearly VH1.
