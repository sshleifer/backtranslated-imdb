First a technical review. The script is so slow, the 25-minute story shows up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Dialogue is so flat and really one dimensional. "Acting" sad, they seem to lift up to school students in class to really read a few lines from a stupid board. The entire "point" of the story, such as "war is bad" (oh, a shock!) Really does not exist. Get out of the "Shock" and get great publicity "Anyone in the scene will be talking about this film. It is so bad that I really think what a better thing can be than how this thing can be used, believe me, I saw bad "emperor's new clothes" film, but at least I could say what I said for them, they were well shot and well-formed when the camera was two The scenes were haphazard! Read all the other reviews - Avoid all costs and do not talk about it.
