Please forget me Please Please This bad movie was unfortunate for me to watch sometimes. I have seen this movie sit down on both sides of my film's insults and side by side. I still have to see what damage my power has done to fulfill my sight and sentence. What a garbage junk !! And do not start me with acting ... Someone help me forget !! "Strange science" - come back !! All things have been forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am proud of being the first one in IMDB, "I am proud" ... and I voted for hundreds of movies ... many of them are ** p but this So bad I can not believe it. Did anyone really come up with the idea and thought it was worth a film? Has anyone really read the script and decided to make the film? Anyone reading the script and auditioned for it? Did anyone see the movie and not keep it for a shelf for collecting dust forever? * This * question I want to answer. The philosophical question about the tree is not good and you know ...
