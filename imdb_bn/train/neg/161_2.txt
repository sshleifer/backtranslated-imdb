Imagine Mikey Mouse like New York Street Pump or you can imagine John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you can believe that Pat Boone is considering a teenager in his uncle's farm in Kekki, and you can probably enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This picture is so stupid that it is not even a campeople for the love story in the mid-1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood played the character of Pat Bono that his wife refused to kiss his wife on screen before the release that the audience knew that she would not kiss Sheryl Jones so that you could not make a preview for "screen consensus". Their love. This is a Western observer who does not have guns of type. <br /> <br /> The story is in vain. Even the title song is sung with sad exhilaration. <br /> <br /> April is the love of Esther, as well as the outside of the worst movie on the door and plans from outer space 9.
