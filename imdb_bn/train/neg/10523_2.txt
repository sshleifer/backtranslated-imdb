For the first forty minutes, the empire really shapes itself up: it seems to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At that time, I did not know why I was good - but now I do. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this movie is that it is completely and completely annoying. I do not think of movies with psycho and things, to prove a point - hold Jackie Brown, for example - but all of them are so shallow, but it is obviously thrown out for entertainment. You literally feel a knot tension in your stomach. Another major problem is dramatic. He smug, arrogant, yet - wicked enough - that's not bad. She does not seem strong enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. In fact, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. Not shy, not tricky, just dust, and nonsense- This huge mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * ***** (1 out of 5)
