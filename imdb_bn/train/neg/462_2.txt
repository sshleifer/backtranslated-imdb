It has to go down almost as one of the worst movies of all time. Terrible acting, terrible scripts ... and they were good points! Definitely miss one! The joke, so predictable as if you can call them, was so emotional. Pamela Anderson is still dependent on her body that her acting is plastic! I was willing to give it a chance, hope that it's going to improve, well, it did not! If it is a choice between a book and a book, but I recommend sticking you for a better reading! I love Dennis Richards, that's why I let this movie go, but why he did not allow himself to enter this film!
