Whether this film was really bad whether you accept it as a scary movie or even a comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was clear that the giant was added to the closet because living head was not always scary - it was also beautiful And they thought that they needed something more impressive; They also failed here (rather than the end of 50, the funny thing is also terrible.) <br /> <br /> Why does this picture clearly show that director Joseph Green's career was never implemented as an author; He was both really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />
