A few years ago the same person who created Paris, Jettime, which was incomplete but very enjoyable (my rating was 7), New York City created this trash. <br /> <br /> I love you (J'time) created a feeling for Paris and it was made in many parts of Paris. <br /> <br /> In this present movie I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel. I was in my birth town. <br /> <br /> There are 5 bars in New York, bronze or queen scenes, a view of Brooklyn (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in the Times Square or Greenwich Village / beautiful hotel or theater. It is a big cast, mostly actors were not even stereotypes, they were the caricatures of the lowest types. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments are all sexual or very insulting. New Yorkers that we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Some films nominated for the 'Razzie' awards were much better . <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4)) 20 points (out of 100) IMDB 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I think the title was <br /> <br /> <br /> In New York, I hate you.
