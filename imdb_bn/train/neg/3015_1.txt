This is a bad movie. Funny is not one of the worst ones. This is a lousy bad one. It was painful to see. The side was terrible, with many joints and green and yellow colors used throughout the film, the characters look sick. Keira was not very confident as a nightmare, and I could not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey R. signed the celluloid for this criminal waste. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. If you do not see it, do not. You are not missing anything and you will see this drift for two hours of your life. I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed their due to their flaws. This one time only waste.
