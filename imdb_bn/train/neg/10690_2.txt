I probably think it's seen worse movie, but it's a real sting! The plot is ineffective but it is not the worst. No guide around where you would expect from Andy Ching. He was able to do well but failed to drag this film together. <br /> <br /> Following the assassination of Angie Hormone, a female journalist, who was behind the assassination of a President, he wasted the real role. There was no chemistry with good wishes, it was flat and wooden, and on this movie he wore 5-inch Spike Hill. This outlet for Harmon puts it firmly under the "B" list. <br /> <br /> What was the idea of ​​Cuban ??? He has done a lot of outstanding performances in his achievements, but we were far below what we could expect from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Wood and Burt Reynolds. The poor poor poor poor
