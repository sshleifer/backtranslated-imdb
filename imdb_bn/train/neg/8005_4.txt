Goimul (host) - A variable animal goes to the streets due to pollution in the Han River. The smallest member of the park family is hijacked by animals and it can find its family before it becomes the last food of its animal. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like giant movies: mutated beer, extra size algorithm, packs to destroy the comodro dragon, a lot more. My favorite type of animal feature is Horror Film. So, I really wanted to choose host, but it could not be. <br /> <br /> There were three major problems with it: <br /> <br /> The first IMDB page can be viewed faster <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sai-fi / thriller <br /> <br /> Many enemy styles It took itself very seriously to be a comedy and still has a real message (though it seems to be trying to make a statement.) Contrary to pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The play was divided into confusing and mixed with all other styles. Second, after the initial giant attack, nothing happened for almost the whole movie. If the government of Korea and America apparently did nothing, the central family would be looking for one among themselves. And this, they often combine, sometimes with each other, probably for comedy releases. The lack of this work surrounded my attention and apparently did the same as the director, because the whole plot threads were not resolved (a mystery pole discovered by the evil Americans completely forgot and never solved). <br /> <and / or the end, the film is a little political. It portrays Americans stupid and evil, but does not give us any American characters compared to a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most intelligent fools vs. American versus Korean moments. To the Assistant Assistant in the Korean morg, his boss, the performer did not pour chemical substances into the Han River. The American doers ordered everyone to order the carrying assistant. As well as racist, it is made of lazy film-making and there is no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> plus a mix of giant good, irregular and deep rising. Some movement effects are quite cool, and the primary giant chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are some nice shots in the film. Some of these remind me, like firefighters, the picture of the firefight (taking the camera out from the focus shot). At the end there is a wonderful scene, where the hero and little boy have saved him sitting in his family. Mobile food stalls The cold air is giving light in the night, but warm gloves are coming out from the food stove. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was frustrated by this picture. I was looking for a decent animal flick, and instead I got some pseudo-political, horror comedy lights. I can not help but look at the IMDB comment, but it seems that if it was in the United States it would have been. Just because it is a foreign flick it does not mean any good. In recent years there have been some great movies outside of Korea (for example, revenge quarterly and Brotherhood), but it is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Once I'm on remakes. Hold down the instruction, improve the scripting and it can be a beautiful movie. Since it's not worth a few hours of someone's time.
