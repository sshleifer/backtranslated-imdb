I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 minutes in the morning. It's raining, and do not want to wait at Port AUTHORTY. So I went to the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad that I chose to watch and watch the whole movie, since I still can not see anything bad. Year was 69, so call me crazy. I'm just because I can not believe it .........
