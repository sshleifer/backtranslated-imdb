I usually like to see Bert Lancaster's films - especially when there is a need to go with the appearance of the screen displayed in its random gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, sometimes his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed something. And it lacks the lack that really prevents Rainmaker. Now I realize that his character was like Shomone, but how Catherine Hepburn falls under his spell is completely ineligible. She seems to be smart but does not seem like when Lancaster's cast about Blarney screen! Besides, the story is probably one of the most scary movies I've seen and it is very clear that it is a movie based on a movie. It seems to have been portrayed on a sound stage as it was supposed to replace most of the wide open web. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very impressive movie.
