"Look, I know this may be a suck at the moment, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever, you'll burn it all the time and thousands of years in celluloid." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was initially a movie for Steven Spielberg, the director was employing several screenlines to adjust the screenplay so that its themes are more appropriate. And so we have an unsuccessful family that has recently been threatened by the terrible monster as a release of Robert De Niro from prison. Similar to the "Jurassic Park", "Potterjeeist" and "War of the Worlds", the defective family band together to defeat the lame, a lawyer who created the father of the father who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In typical Spilberg fashion, the father kills a giant that causes harm to the family and then his immediate absence of sin. Like Oscar Scandler, Robin Williams, Sam Wheel, Tom Cruise, and Spielberg, almost every "father" picture of the father, like father, enjoys Spielberg so much that he retains his parental responsibilities in Bitrsweet code. <br /> <br /> Spielberg finally left the picture and instead of Martin Skarsis, who came to the project, who then tried to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is logically the worst movie in the Scandinav film, and, surprisingly, its most illuminated <br /> <br /> The failure or disagreement of an artist is often expressed, reveals the internal activities of their industry. When the story does not work, the letters do not connect or look for the images, we leave ourselves with an internal core. this ?? Remaining bodies - which is about the director's movie. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an independent film, so we did not get a theatrical connection with the rest of Scorrhoe ("You've Already Done!" De Niro Yells, but the movie theme cookie cutter of Catholic redemption). However, how the film expresses the language that relies on its film. How Scorsese's camera whips back tightly, how to tone and screams for all the loud and attention to its emphasis on how to zoom in on an effort dorknobs and windows frantically over zooms. But more importantly, see that the film does not create any spatial senses. A procession in a boat at the end of the movie takes place in a clear sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and it does not take place in a larger perspective and the family house does not seem particularly special. The image does not have any geographical notions, Scorsese space is unable to film or can create a local environment. The reason for this is because Scorise's camera should always lock its central character, To understand the world around the character, its camera must focus on the character. Renaissance can take you closer to a French hotel, Wales and Hitchcock can dance down the street and under a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can restor the city's future in the future, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most of the others Space concept by coordinating "space up-mid-shot-wide shots" by the director's textbook Airi can do, but can not find skorisa. There is no poem in his poetry, there is no clear place. She is all about the character. The Titress that breaks you, leave the boxing ring, the tax cab, you look away from De Niro and break everything. He does not refrain from shooting only this documentary style, which is a way, a prerequisite for making movies. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with "Gang of New York", where the places and sets become central character, but this self-consciously localized test was also damaged by the magnitude of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor Scorsese's camera Like a moth, he is depicted as a moth unjustified. <br /> <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B-movie, it's an ugly, rude looking movie. Look at matte painting, tireless effort at tension, silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown Yet, to us, Robert De Niro has opted for this addiction. De Niro, who gave his body to Skarkies like tattooed Christ, gave the picture its only great view. In a romantic sequence with a Juliette Lewis young man, he sticks his thumb in his mouth and kisses her. One kind of symbolic rape, the girl escapes, both are stimulated and upset by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, above so naturally, can not be simply imitated by Scorsese. To do this, you need operative tone and barracks like De Palma. But Scorise? No, <br /> <br /> <br />
