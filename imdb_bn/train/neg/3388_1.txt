I acknowledge being a fan of production at the main level. I've never seen the movie version on Cable alone, and I have looked forward to seeing my memories alive, because I enjoyed the main show. Imagine my frustration <br /> <br /> This image will sometimes be the worst translation of Broadway show. They changed the story, they changed the song, lost the soul. I was expecting a trip down memory lane, unusually sensitive music and a mirror, belt a, and hello barley, hello teens. No! They did not only harm the music in an irrational point, but they spoiled the story, the songs and exotic platinum (hello caseie and Michael Douglas) did not appear in the original language and "drama" gave injection where it was not necessary. The original had its own enough stone. If you are a fan of the original Broadway show, do not bother. I'm sorry, I've wasted my time, and diluted my memories, watching this tripe.
