I usually check out MTV Movie Awards to see a diverse, entertaining show that provides a unique prize show (Chabakka won an award for life time as an example). So this year was no different. Although I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, San William Scott has always been funny-the album became stupid. I laugh at both American Pie film Stefler, even in Dude I enjoyed her where? But the MTV Movie Award was simply terrible. Nothing was collective, ridiculous, or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should sing and dance; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gallery's last year's performance was extremely fun (only ring parody Lord was eligible to see the whole show), but this year was completely different. Did someone know Timberlake's comments related to Leak Wilson and Kate Hodson ("They roam movie together, but never seen them here ...") Where was the trick? Kate and Luke just went to their crippled dialogue, did not mention Timberlake's "joke". And San was completely destroyed as a genius, even not smile to me, yet laughing alone. And what was the point of a lanarine of Harrison Ford? Do they have any ideas? Perhaps MTV writers recognize young viewers Ford, Honey Solo, Indian Jones, or Ford Fighter from the Air Force One. I'm bored. Anyone else will make me deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this man and how old is he thinking? The guy looks 30, 19 is trying to work again ... Leave it, show some classes (like your best actor Academy Award speech) and you work age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star four out, just for the best visual performance due to the lecture of Belam. It was a very creative, very good thing, and created the only true laugh of the whole evening.
