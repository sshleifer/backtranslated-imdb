"The second coming of Suzanne" is still one of those miracle movies, which tries to be very sophisticated, but it lets all visitors sleep. Like other such films, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is very interested in the shots of the visual aesthetic. However, cinematography has become frustrating so there is nothing to maintain your attention. <br /> <br /> In the video box it has been said that this movie is "one of the most exciting visual events ever seen in movies." Yes, of course. It's okay to see such stimulating events as a melting bucket or a turtle for a mile. 1/10
