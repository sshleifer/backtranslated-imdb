After being bitten by a cave bat, a doctor named John Beck left a man's bat change in an acceleration in animals. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, because it is just rabies or anti-rabby drugs because local police thinks that John is responsible for several violent murders. The "Bat People" by Jerry James is a hell of a horror movie. This script is deadly neutral and no rust or nudity. So it is a bit annoying that after you suffer through it you will dig the head in total disbelief. Even a young Stann Winston man designed a bat bat animal is completely pained and disrespectful.
