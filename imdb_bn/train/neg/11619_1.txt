I watched the whole movie, waiting and actually waiting for something to happen. Perhaps it is my fault and psychology rather than for terrifying hope? What is odd saying of ODipal mythology: I want to kill my parents and want to marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I did not understand why specific plot elements were also present: why the construction was upstairs, why there was no one that if no person is in a place suitable for their destroying, then indeed nobody can do it, why so many of the scenes when working with father There is a nice kitchen, if you are just going to eat the takeout, why the boy wants to get baptized and the parents are different Wants to oppose I can see very good reviews for this movie ... 70 seconds B-movies and old taste have been tainted with my taste?
