This movie is the worst movie of my life that I have seen throughout my life. I'm not even kidding. It was created badly and the actor could not work. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could stay with myself. The case came in the movie definitely a mask. There is nothing in front of the movie. It seems that the director or make-up artist has kept only the black eye palace under someone's eyes, which is called a zombie. At the beginning of the film, the credit movie takes about 20 minutes. Which was the best part of the credit observer movie. It was honestly a horror film and I could not believe how badly it got together. The scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes you were "what's up?" The audio was terrible and action shots looked like a joke of two for creating a fake war scene. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or purchasing this movie then I would suggest you to look at the trailer at least, show how terrible it is. I would have seen it before I rented it.
