I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow, it became confused, or I would say, "just plain fool." Another example of this old humor is the example. It was fun in the 1940s, but still does not ... even stop. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interested to see She started switching from her adult face and she liked him especially from the old Barclay musical instruments where he was mature and heard it. <br /> <br /> He was good as "Jimmy McDonald", but the rest played Casteless characters only, the master of Maxford House Coffee Company (Raymond Wallburn) is the worst, who has always shouted nothing. He was brutal to listen and was a big loss for the film.
