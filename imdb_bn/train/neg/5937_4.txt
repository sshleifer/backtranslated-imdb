Sure, if you ask a mother of the most beautiful baby on earth, she will tell you that her son is the most amazing child in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, well, tell me more? I'll break it for those who do not want those easy deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can only keep a few buggy MTV videos together and it can call a movie. <br /> <br /> Big Angel Bassett played the big wedding mother. Life looks like a dog in life. <br /> <br /> I thought why he called himself big. Big body small dick? Big face small words? Big fat small eyes? Disclaimer: I'm a man of color. So keep your racist comments yourself.
