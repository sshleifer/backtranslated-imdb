This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's a synthetic story, that combines all kinds of things together in any sense. It just seems to be a mistake test. Secondly, actors can not play in a realistic way. They can not speak as an actor. Why can I buy this movie? And now what I have to do with it?
