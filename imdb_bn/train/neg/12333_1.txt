Un-bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look at her usual pert lovable self, which usually makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick. Hard to believe he was this dog producer. Plus Kevin Kine: What kind of suicide trip has her career? Hug ... BANJAI !!! Finally, did this man point to Big Chill? Jonestown will be a replay - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
