A totally disgusting adaptation of the wonderful children's books. It is totally inappropriate for children to be uncomfortable and inappropriate humor, some scary part, and a sick side story about a mother's boyfriend, to send the boy out of the way to the military because it probably wants to see it because the book (3-8) years old. Do not waste your money, your time, or your good judgment.
