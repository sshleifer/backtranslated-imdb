If you want to see the real 'quality' movie you can catch the Eden Formula. To make this wonderful film must cost $ 50. It's a wafer slim script, harmful bad set, light and camera work, and a stop motion, a ping-dale monster that is totally ridiculous (it seems that they sometimes use a guy for a rubber suit and / or a glove doll Giant - but all were equally horrible). <br /> <br /> The actors are talking about their lines so that they have never seen them before and read the telepromp. The way beyond special effects lousy. And the only tragedy is that they really downgraded the Nifty original title 'TiRnasaurus Wrecks' to exactly what you got for exactly 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The barrel is so hard that you break through that crud. <br /> <br /> I like it every minute.
