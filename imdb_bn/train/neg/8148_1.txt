Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" was the first novel in Brooklyn's everything. Everything except stories, smiles, black humor, political conspiracies, character, plot, and sense have some similarities. <br /> <br /> Spoolers; <br /> <br /> <br /> Start the end. They made a joke of plot, they were romance in Parballan and a policeman, and what was all of that, Dr. Slater was portrayed as an enamel, and was considered to be Anatus Crosby? <br /> <br /> It looks like they adapted for three hours, then cut it for 90 minutes. (Even though 90 minutes were going on forever.) Please, please do not do this with any of the Brookmres books, (especially "the country of the blind.")
