This piece of bands, since I can not call it a movie, can be summed up by the following. Stereotypical Black Crisis With Black Midget Partner Get Black Criminal Blame - Blake Midget pretends to be a child Fully developed adult face, with body hair and genitalia-Blade Midget mistakes (anyway) A male and female child The child wants to be a child - black leftist rather than doing physical and sexual violence, wherever he sees white people, and more crimes happen - Happy end <br /> <br /> If this is true Agnyutbhabe is not managed, and it is such a talented star's busy, but it could be a great irony.
