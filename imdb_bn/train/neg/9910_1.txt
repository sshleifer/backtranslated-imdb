One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. If we could walk with sadness, we could see many famous old actors, work alone. Lead female Nancy Young can not work. Terrible direction Sub-par with bad tv movie Sometimes the weak jokes fall flat. There is no concept even on the basic premises of the film. Somehow they are supposed to stop being a wedding but there is no logic behind their actions. Gradually pansing off my wife watching but I have suffered it. Old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny, but the fun comes off of unfortunate instead. How do they get this money even?
