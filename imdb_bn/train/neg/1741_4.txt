Dear Darshan / Paresh Rawal Combo has become golden like Hira Ferry and Huangama, so I went to Mumbai (Indian Multiplex), especially after the publicity of Chattka. Unfortunately, like the flutter, before this movie was frustrating. <br /> <br /> Others have argued that the film's initiality, which was before it began, is extended without any development or extra level After a while, you just want to finish the movie so you can go home (if I saw this house then it was very easy to spend my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is the best of all time and John Abraham should never try to comedy again. The overall comedy direction was quite a week. I only remember riggling like double the whole movie. Definitely a favorable belly smile that makes me frighten or even eat less amounts of crazy madness in AWARA. Paresh Rawal was in some of his anticipated classic moments, but overall, because his role and character did not give much space to grow, he did not have much impact in this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who showed only one appearance in the movie, watched while on screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the inaugural and closed songs of the ADA and KISSM Babi. Otherwise, you just better off this movie.
