I know that movies are not supposed to be mirrored in reality, but it falls on my nerves. It sets unconscious tendencies about "psychological injury" and mental illness. The "Psycho Mom" ​​thing has been done long before (and generally better done) and most of the rest is far beyond. Acting was not terrible, but she had nothing to say about it. <br /> <br /> One bright one: I was a longtime fan of general hospital, and this was a role of former GH regular star performer. Lindstrom <br /> <br /> However, if you can ignore its stupid psychological part, likewise a person might have to postpone the reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this film may be endorsement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
