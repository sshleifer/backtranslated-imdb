I usually talk about the plot in the first part of my review but there is nothing to talk about in this movie. Just another FAR is a mish-mash of good epic and magical epic. Rampant run as lacking in the lack of inconsistency. Even the main villains refused to wear another dress, yet Lenkolot is quite boring because most of them have a little boy chest. Very rarely disagree with it and it gets badly bored at the worst times. Lucio Fulli is scraping down the barrel here and it shows. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Poster and Stills Gallery; Lucio Fulci Bio; And the United States and international theater trailers <br /> <br /> Candy: Sabrina Saiyi is helpless in life (something that might be interesting, I do not); Various additions are helpless as well
