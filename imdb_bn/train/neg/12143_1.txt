First, a little summary. This reporter, Torch, is basically trying to find out the story of a zombie prevalence, and the military and government find him a sensor. Excellent message, government censorship and all of them, but let me explain how the movie they made in movies. <br /> <br /> This film exceeds the description. George Romero is committed to the mental institution for reviewing the idea that someone holds it in something higher than anything else. This script is tortured on its own, as it was written by 6th grade. For special effects, I realize that independent movies have low budget and some dominant effects seem to be acceptable, but if you want to see the scene of fire here is a tip: buy some nonflammable components, prepare a shooter ready, and a fire going! Do not add it digitally and it looks like a blast from a Nintendo 64 game. Acting, let's make this way of good. In my summer theater program, the script is a cold reading, compared to The Godfather. I do not even have to go into inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it also sends a cooler to my spine thinking about it, Someone thinks that it was good enough for the release of the DVD. This is not DVD quality. This sci-fi channel is not quality. Hell, this is not even film school quality. If you want to submit it to a film school project, you will get an F., even more like an F, an F. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my meaning now, and I do not want to think about what I'm doing about it. I have faced some broad, unexpected plans of legal theft and I do not feel good that I went to the right, after 28 days, with a memorable memento, I saw only a film Ed Wood and will say, "I do not care much about it." This picture was the single most horrible movie I saw. I have not seen anything by Ed Wood, but I trust this is bad. If you are looking for a serious movie, you probably have a bad headache within ten feet of it. If not, I still recommend you enter the director personally and ask how to sleep at night. However, if you are a person who smiles really bad things, then I recommend you check it out. You will not be disappointed.
