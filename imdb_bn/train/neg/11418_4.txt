Joel Schumaker has a group of Georgetown grads that he indicates written script and faces aging life situations. The story line is a scrambled mess, but some scenes are actually good. There are lots of spoiled talents and time here. More captivating than cast movies. Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Jude Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ale Shady and Murray Winningham featured. McCarthy and Moore are most notable. Lowe is quite objectionable. The coming of age is not so easy.
