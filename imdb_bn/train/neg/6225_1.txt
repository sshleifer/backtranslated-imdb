I doubt this will ever be a civilized film. I was sure to confirm the gram person and I did not expect much from this film and even got less. What was clever and moving was the camp. It produced gamma and overtook the music that was more full than the cheap dog food. There was no background on gram or colored people of that era. I did not know about the characters that I saw in Gram's fans and all the "later living" versions. Rock and roll are full of stories, better ones but they should be taken with a grain of salt. Though they are exaggerated, they can be great stories. However, this movie took a good story and turned tripe. There should never be a dull story of stealing a dead body and the upcoming impact, but they are absolutely shameless. I am tempted to steal every copy of the Grand Theft Person, head in the desert and burn them all.
