Without a doubt, the single worst movie ever made. There is no debate here. This is At the end of the story. The story is teenage and laughing, it seems fascinated by a three-year-old dinosaur. The whole idea is just plain stupid. Some may become so stupid and think about how it was entertaining. Junk is also completely hairy. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your funny curiosity is bad about this movie, please do not describe it to me. This movie can not be completely frightened. It's not as bad as bad movies. Even those who have respect, are not worth the entertainment. this. . . this. . . Esse! Think of the worst story in 5000 and increase the level of badness, and you still do not come close to how bad this movie is. After giving Pokemon movie one point, this movie seems to be nothing short of charity to provide a point. That's how bad it is. Producers and directors even take the film classes? Because it's a perfect example of not making a movie. It looks like some slim slim amateur makes this film. If you rent it, please return it and ask for a refund. And do not worry about renting it again.
