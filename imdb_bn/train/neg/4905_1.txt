I am generally disappointed by the network cinema. The flix that attracts even big name actors are usually destroyed by TV people. However, it is the worst. The screenplay is weak and acting, especially the Tracey Pollan that is hateful. I've trudged off watching my kids' high school plays and have been treated well. He's reading scripts as he says. When he tries to express fear, anger or sadness, then it is very cheating. Because of the overall quality of production, I think it is difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to dare this one just be prepared for a big disappointment. Dreadful things will not make you scared, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not warm you and vague, and you will be worried that I have come to see the end. "First Murray" says a lot about this movie.
