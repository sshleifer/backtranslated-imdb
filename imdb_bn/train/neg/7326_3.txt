There is an interesting plot in this movie, but the performance is poor and the script is poor. I was very frustrated. The moral contradiction in front of the main character is a curious subject, but due to poor writing and looting it due to this potential winner's premises. 4 of the other 4 theaters in the theater left 45 minutes and the other two smiled and said, how bad the movie was. I kept it in the end, but I must admit that I could bear the last 30 minutes of playing blackjack on my cellphone.
