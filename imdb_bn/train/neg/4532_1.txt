For my husband, I bought my father's old school and Street DVD, and I have to say, I do not see new episodes on TV, because I have found all the characters boring. Baby Bear and Tele? How can anybody think about Omgosh, how are you and vain Blabber for their 'skits'? Elmo? Do not just relax, every child likes him, again, annoying and does not teach anything to my child. Mr. Noodle? What a rejection I think once I've started the 'new' program for him, he and I were dived earlier than before. The show definitely made a mistake. I think all the great educational skits in the episodes, Chemistry Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dallas, Memphon the Magician, Bart and Arne, the Greater Theater, the Old School SS Asmend Street, were directly hit by anger and stupidity. Jim Henson Passing in 1990 This show is not used in educational, fun and interactive ski. The new version is simply full of helplessly annoying and vain non-educational Blabber. Ss Producers / writers have another cartoon that shows non-creative, non-exercise children sit in front of parents so that they get out of their hair. I recommend you tap out the old muppets and taping the similar sesame street content: per producer / writer. Lord knows I'm not sure that my child is talking like a baby or Elmo.
