Dave (Devon Saya) and his friends are leaning towards their path through the college of Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronar). When weird Ethan (Jason Schwarzman) discovered their secret information, he blackmailed them to score with their beautiful, heartwarming student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Stupid and disagreeable "comedy" - much less smile than smile and less. The film tries to appeal to the audience with its intense gog - but their job is to do any. What's more, it is full of vain, unexpected characters - and Schwartzman's character is so annoying he's a major counter-shutdown. The film also tries to use 50/60's sex / actress Mummy Van Dorren in the film's most disrespectful view. Yuck !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Out of my ten.
