What is the Indonesian musical movie? I have never seen Indonesian musical films like Bollywood. They miss the story's spirit and they are known as a poetic line. <br /> <br /> After two years of change, there are two children who love this story again. Special Comments. It's a simple story plot (though it's quite interesting) with 'lines to' story lines of musical instruments here and there. <br /> <br /> Ignore the confusing characters which should be preserved by brilliant acting. The main actress can try to survive the character, but what she can do is for her the best. For casting, I do not necessarily need to keep a student in the story, and of course, this is not just unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> Strange matter, why do I want to see this movie? Maybe because of the Amazon ...
