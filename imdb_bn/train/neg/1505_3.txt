Italo-Western, lack of stupid stories and logic, some middle actors, dirty settings, huge fights and people have died in huge form. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to do with Django. At least not to mention German language DVD, this German DVD release is called "Adyas Companerosus" and Macho Callaghan has been fighting against Butcher Cacheody and Ironhead because their gang killed her (she is the only survivor). Then your boycott Cassidy and Ironhead fight each other because they split and gang split. And all of you have an IroHed war because it's just like the biggest and most greedy donkey. Yeah, that's not a tale in the story, hey. <br /> <br /> Claus Kinsky's role as a Revend cotton is remarkable (so I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tried to beat two men and cried out, "I love!" And in another scene, he won a competition in Horsesh throw and got brown for one second - <br /> <br /> It is extraordinary that JOE d'AMATO has been raised by Aristad Massachusese cinematography - I love this master's unforeseen exploitation-thrash, so it's for me "Ahh" was there.
