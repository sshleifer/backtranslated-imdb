Inspector GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Starred: Matthew Broaderick, Rupert Everett, Jolie Fisher, Andy Dick, Dobney Coleman Director: David Kellagg 80 minutes RG Pee <br /> <br /> Black French <br /> <br /> Disney's new film, "Inspector Gadget", is a police member named John who survived a major accident and was rescued by an industrial experimental activity, So become an agent. All kinds of tools and contractions made in his group, when he "goes," only called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The genre of the real film itself is like the body of the inspector gadget. It combines a bunch of noise, split, energetic, and half-hearted contractions that can create something that is not more common in the present. The film is originally a sequel to Johnny Action Sequences, which is stuck together with letters and a common story, which will only enjoy children aged 6-9. <br /> <br /> The drama that is dramatically restored is that. Directed by "Mathew Broderick" until "Inspector Gadget", who successfully achieved success with films like "Election". Inspired by the clash with Willyn, the heavy handover of the film, Clo, his character has become Inspector Gadget. He played by Rupert Everett, who had this year's disaster experience with "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night Dream" this year's horror. <br /> <br /> There is a romantic theorem in this movie, as well as a large number of scenes of Inspector Gadget's sloppy body parts and process components. This is Gage and Clo's striking character Brenda, who drew on an attractive character played by Jolie Fisher for her appearance and knowledge of a specific discovery made by her dead father, which previously killed Cloqua. Competition became a cause for war scenes and many events in the film. A big character is also a gadget motile, a life like self-life, made for Inspector gadget. It is L. "The Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I think is quite bad. I know, I am not the right target of filmmakers, but my ten-year-old relative is also in the film, "Hugely" Dislike the movie, the individual is full of errors and obvious problems. I can not find myself caring about the characters, using the original cartoon clips are more open. There is no development without opening credits of bad mood, even the worst film of 1997, "Mr. Magu ". This comedy is not too much to ask about the same thing - which is rarely funny and sometimes credible. The overall production design is nothing but an incomplete sight and it has a joke: the bumpling group of the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In these movies, audience wishes for borders - help to find out what can happen and what can not There is no limit on "Inspector Gadget." For those real actors, party time is more than that, which surly was a lot of fun. I was released a few years ago, another success story called "Kandman", which once again has a lot of influence and energy, and the actor must Spends time with all the gigs and promos, but there is no need for every movie: audience participation <br /> <br /> The character that I found is far apart from the gadget's girl, who at the end of the film, I still do not understand what her name was. She is only used as a Plot Device - and I ask how much the plot is. Used to increase. The film comes to nothing relevant or productive for its presence. We did not know the responses of his father's operation or accident. So, this one can completely leave and can not influence the movie. To stop <br /> <br />, I want to say that "inspector gadget" is a horror, inadequate excuse for a children's comedy. And believe, I've seen myself filming the film "Blade" for the last few years with violent and very anti-young audience action pictures. I say again that I have a movie where everything can happen. "Inspector Gadget" was going too much for it at the same time, it literally troubled me. <br /> <br />
