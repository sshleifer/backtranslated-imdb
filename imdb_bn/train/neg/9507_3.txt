I always get frustrated by the films that have been written explicitly by a penis. Especially when they are not clearly enough to research, nothing just rings the truth, but the ring gradually lies. <br /> <br /> The scene that I think is one of the bathrooms, where Jack's coworker Danny was pregnant with her football team. Any guy getting a pregnant girl in high school, shape, or form a guy will never be happy with another guy. He is interested in sex with Cheerleader Hits but I can also be sure that the first football team heard about it that it will not be in a urine. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie 'do not take yourself very seriously, and it was not bad at all, but let's go!'
