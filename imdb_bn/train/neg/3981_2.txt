This movie really has no start or end. And it's really very incredible. Mary and Ashley are believed to be working in a mailing room for the Italian fashion company. However, for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (easily located across the city from Coliseum) and the interactions they work with are just as unusual models-looking. What I found in this movie is one thing that does not end up with pairs. I tried to make them a little bit of their usual intrigue. Good try
