A romance without feeling, a drama of problems without point (drama) .... This movie is supposed to be all this and fails on every account, as it is not tried. Or the director / editor / script writer team is not really trying. Actors capable - they need better support. <br /> <br /> Score is not a factor which fails to score by George Delarue. Beautiful and moving What a shyness to be attached to this film. A good movie actor improves the sound and movement and music synchronization and effects. This editor plastered on the music with no respect for dialogue and movement. The love scene is specially suppressing this honor: paying tribute to the main actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in this picture that works: Location Photography. The Grand Central Station is a significant moment. I guess what's going to happen in advance; But how it was illustrated in this setting was exciting. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this board mentioned the fact that during the years of Maccathar's horror, the criminal Nazi scientists have gathered together. At the moment of starting the film with the importance of the film in American society, it changes to conventional romance; Since the feeling of a human being can move us, it is far away from a (expected) 'thriller' walks. <br /> <br /> As the actors disrespect the genius of actors, the same things that are worthless (and failing) <br /> <br /> You will be warned.
