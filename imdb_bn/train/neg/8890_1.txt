For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did for the best game. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with a good bit, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors need to pull it together. <br /> <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are you still dead Romeo? The actor could not read his line with a guru, not only in wood and metal. He was completely out of focus, Juliet in the face was in difficulty even to see, and he absolutely no grace with that given line Anyone responsible for his conviction. Juliet is almost passable, but she does not give any depth to her character, and seems to fully communicate with the game. Mercutio was incredibly vague and out of full character for the completeness of her conversations. Benvenolio was helpless and neatly sticky with his line. <br /> <br /> I was forced to bear half a baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing to confuse. I have seen kindergarten doll shows with more effort among them. I could only have rated this movie zero rating.
