The movie was watchable when Nicholson was on screen. However, depending on Marry Strip, when I had to fight against getting out of trouble, to carry the scene without Jack; She was as soft as she could. The relation between the characters was nothing special; This character has been portrayed before - and much better. It has been felt like a basic-real-life in the most extreme sense: 90% of daily life is annoying and is not worth writing or viewing about it. Why Afroan had to write his life and relationship with Karl Bernstein soon enough to write about me to run away. Perhaps he wrote it as therapy - many authors, cathering a section from their lives is cathartic. Well: But why does anyone in Hollywood feel valuable to evaluate this picture and keep a secret to me.
