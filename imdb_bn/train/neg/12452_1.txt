This movie is so bad that I can not even start to describe it. Is the burning pit wrong with writer, producer and director? On earth how did they get funding for this hatred? The plot is ridiculous, the best of acting, the story ... what is the story? The first battle of this movie is okay but then you do not want to stop it until it keeps repeating. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest disappointment to stop this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and for 30 seconds ... <br /> <br /> I can give 1 out of 10 because it can offer the lowest grade IMDB. <br /> <br /> Do a favor on yourself: Instead of watching the Uwell Bol movie ... ... it's more time in your life.
