These bogus journeys ever came closer together with the courage and craziness of great courage to take these guys their first movies. This risk tries to move away from Mix's preview for some new blood capture, but it goes wrong and the tours are not interesting or fun anywhere. Here are about half an hour being shown, people are doing a rock concert (and watching a lot of people watching "Free TV" - as it happens when?) the script writer could have done something more creative; See how all the random elements of the first film were combined together by combining them into science presentations. Not that in the film, Bill and Ted franchise which ended a lot. The curiosity ended. <br /> <br /> Grim ripper goes into the mix, whatever. Like the whole plot, this wave is done badly and there is a lack of spark for comedy or audience involvement. There are no ZZ top impressions, hammered for no reason. There are light, smoke, mirrors, words. But not really creative or fun. <br /> <br /> Avoid this stupid thing.
