I'm pretty sure of Jack Blacks's mind that Liberty's character is absolutely sunny but not so. You can say oliv jack in a whale for a while, a wrestler, slimy Mexican friar hammin up it with a dream to become a wrestler, but almost every section of this movie is a total misfire. Most of the movies are just sitting there "It's supposed to be fun" and "People from the Tennesses D Right?". There is nothing to offer this film true to the truth. These! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really played naff and direction. You'll see endless moments where you think some interesting things are going to happen, but that's not right. But although I was stupid bored in about 10 minutes it must take course. It's not After 90 minutes I tried to become very boring. It was painful. It seems that, when you see something with your fancy actors on a few years ago, even some of them were famous before they were the first petals, and you really congratulate that the actors actually had a load of plopes. Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed something like the Shelo Hall before Jack Black and I'm really looking forward to seeing Peak of Destiny but come to the people. If you do this again with us, then Jack will have to come around and you have to make a hammer or a knee. At least you have a serious talk. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√© but it's one of the worst movies I've seen and for many reasons ....
