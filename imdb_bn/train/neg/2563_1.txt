This movie was on TV the other day, and I did not enjoy it. Jungle's first George was a good comedy, but Siegel ... is totally awkward. The main actors and actresses could not play the main role, their original actor (Brendan Frieser) and the lead actress (I forgot her name), so the movie got 0 out of ten ratings, not one you can sit and watch and enjoy A movie, a film that lets you move to another channel or take it back when you buy it or buy it. It was good to look behind the Ape, but it was not as fun as the first one should have been George George's eldest son, and still with Brodn and his (what was his face) film, it was a little better then.
