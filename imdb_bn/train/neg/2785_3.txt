I know that some films (I mean: European film), which is considered to be a very bad film by some "critics", because they are non-American. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score of this movie and noticed that it is being selected for some big festivals. Do not let this fool you! Unless you're a man who likes these kind of fantasy films and later it is a great art, remove it! This picture has a ridiculous view after another (a similar, Italian, the movie has popped into my mind, the terrible Priscasco Ael Romero del Mar (I like the word of the sea). The problems of these movies are that they are not just boring, like other strangely acclaimed movies, but they play almost like a camp. I mean, let's face it, the action is horrible (I mean: Opera's level), the story was not surprising (it has been endlessly before being associated with many stories: little CUTS, Magnolia, only playing with the heart, only Much better), not a realistic character in it (look at some really scary care, along with the road, look at the sunny zombie-like girl), and many more Ichu. <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, the film is 135 minutes. (Count it!), And ultimately the director can do her sensitivity. After such a series of hilarious bad dialogues and scenes in a movie that has ridiculed public on the screen of the screen, well ... it's an insult to the movie, and only gets high ratings because it happens in "other" language, in this case Spanish We live in a strange world ... 3/10
