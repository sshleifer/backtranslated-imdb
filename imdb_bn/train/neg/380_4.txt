I wonder if there is no sense in this movie senses. This is a big joke. Good .. it's entertaining .. you'll see the most stupid plot played in a very serious form in the form of a film .. I'm surprised that this audience group is basically targeted. <br /> <br /> Priety (a pros) is a happy couple Salman / Queen who wants a child but can not play for a surrogate mom. I wonder how this drama will take away real life from the real couple's life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Queen is happy to have another beautiful lady in her house, who came to make a child. For him and Salman. She thinks for Priya and tries to push her husband Salman into practice so that they may have some romance. When visitors are annoyed with Salman's eyes, <br /> <br /> <br /> In a good past, this movie is intolerable. Absurd
