Unrecognizable stupid, unnecessary and offensive off "Elm street nightmares" - Serious! Part 6 is incompetent that the director Rachel Talalya intentionally wanted to make Wes Cranven's premises as a big bad and flavorful joke. This "Elm Street" Saga is not just the worst entry; This is one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it consistently humiliates fans of the genre! Stories stupid, drawing character funny, all messy and structured ?? Mostly ?? Special and visual effects like Tom and Jerry cartoons Freddie Kruger killed his victims, the order is endless and very selfish. When Freddie was trapped in a video game-character and in Pogo, around a cell wall, was we scared to hug him? The story takes us back to Sprintwood and it seems Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged girl. Do you think he would mention one of his previous events, but not ?? Sprintwood's only teenage survivor and Kruger used her to communicate with her long lost girl. Another reason why this final installment is so terrible is the completely irrational structure. John Door-son was presented as the main character, but suddenly he died and the plot continued on two adults! How about: Freddy Kr√ºger, who spent five whole films, is not murdered except for adolescents, after all three adults are wearing 3-glasses! The whole essence of sort of ruins, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Elm Street Nightmares" has always been a terrific overdue series but until now, even the weakest entries were at least some of the release elements. "Freddy Dead", however, is simply inconsistent and nobody can waste his precious time while watching it.
