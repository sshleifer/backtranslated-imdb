This is a complete hack ... <br /> <br /> The film is clearly shot in the state of northwestern Indian states. See Chase Scenes - Vehicles are Indian; All written Hindi - language used in India. Through this, there is a busy Jaipur road. The palace is also in America - 10 miles away from Rajasthan, Jaipur. DVD Bonas filmmakers call themselves the term (about film) that they risked shooting around Kabul. Almost all their action scenes were shot in India. Seeing a group singing around the fire, the scene was so fake that they could not even think of changing the language of Afghan songs. They just recorded Rajasthani folk songs. How do I know this because I traveled extensively in that area. They're okay with the band-wagon to make this issue bigger. I challenge filmmakers to deny it.
