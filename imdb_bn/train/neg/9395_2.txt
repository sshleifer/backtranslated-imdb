This serial is interesting to watch as a MST3 feature, but it's all for today's viewers. I was really surprised to see the year I created in 1952. Considering this fact, is it a difficult (low?) 2 in my book? Used cars do not even look contemporary, they look like stuff from 30's. It is basically cody (talking about the shame of the rest of the world, talking about the shame of the rest of the camp), however it enjoys two curiosity * ss henchman who handles handguns and a regular ray gun, the beautiful lump of his own right, in case he suits his nipple ring grubber and Deli. . If you really want to see a good serial, look at Flash Gordon, it rockets that attack each other and fill a good evil goodness and good looking woman, it does not have any of it. And Flash is made 15 or so years before this punk so you can give it some slack. Something created in 1952, this is bad, a claim 2. Nuff said. If it is a 6 watching it as a MST3K episode, those guys have some good fun; Here tweak a nipple, a tweak and I'm flying! And now as a bonus added, I can bring you the comedy Kodi theme song by Juan and his two characters, Tom Tom Sro and Crow, which is on the love satellite for the episode of the April Planet: <br /> (<br /> <br /> Singing); <br /> <br /> (Your Tom Soro Singing) Your Watching Commander Kodi .... He is the new character from the publisher, <br /> <br /> He goes into every troglag week ... but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Packet <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .. and CODY should fix it UP, <br /> <br /> She drowns her T. Al Caf√© ... and then wares together <br /> <br /> She has a hook with a hook and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> The end of that commander code theme end ... so right back with a circle of GRITITE, <br /> <br /> and see section eight, because that energy planet
