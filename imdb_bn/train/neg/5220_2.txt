Genetics is a young basketball player professor who uses human fetuses, doing research in genetic sequence. She hopes to be able to find a cure for the growth of all diseases and old age. He did not pressurize him to finish his studies because he did not publish, so the university was facing difficulties for financing him. (I think) <br /> <br /> <br /> He did a test injection of a monkey that died rapidly. Then he tried on himself. She is starting a relationship with a very annoying young boy's single mother; She is one of those who are demanding results from the study. <br /> <br /> Initially, he seems to have no effect from injection, without some new power. Then he realized that some of his memory was reduced and he started to remember what was happening. In addition, she begins to appear very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has been named in transit, it eventually changes to something else. Do not believe in your own eyes - The actor is wearing a completely vague dress to portray what he or she has done. Incredibly, there are more changes in the store - the end of the film is really really weird <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> See a video box for the form. Perhaps it may have some electronics even once, perhaps the eyes can be enlightened (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green in the film). The copy I saw was a box that showed only a holes where the plastic glue glue was removed. The novelty boxer, if it was still, was the only reason I would be holding onto this movie; I obviously got rid of it.
