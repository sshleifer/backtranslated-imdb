As some other comments show, this movie can get you scared, when you are a little child. (And perhaps it's good for it.) <br /> <br /> However, if you are older, then this movie only does one thing: mainly make a suck - and by what I say acting Do not want soundtracks, cutting or s.th. That's the way I'm just talking about "plots" (if you can call it) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> spoilers more than necessary (if after reading this, you really want to see this movie) but If you graduate from any school, this is your intelligence only a big shame. When I saw this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The United Nations (an evil United Nations-Association) <br /> <br /> -> We are supposed to just believe it bad. Is it so bad? If so: Why is it evil? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why are they doing hell (intended to pun)? <br /> <br /> - Just giving your heart back to Christ as a lip service <br /> -> Nobody has anyone, because there is never a "true Christian" in this film, as well as that stupid prayer Saying. So ... just say that prayer before the rapture and you saved - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> So rating 1/10
