The original movie (19th date?) Did not show any "monster", it is only "awesome" things recommended. <br /> <br /> Although this version shows an aspect of "sick psychic ghosts", unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery" presented in the original movie was the most horrifying part: the only strange thing is that nobody knows what's going on. By showing the "old man" face, this monitor completely disappears. Even worse: Special effects (tears of wooden children's tears) are ridiculous. It's a stupid repetition, even scary as even realistic, even very obvious sightseeing
