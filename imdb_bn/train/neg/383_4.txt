No sleeping plot line is bad idea, and the topic is very interesting. But, while watching this film, we shouted, "These filmmakers are finding good position, good light, makeup and hair good ... why so bad is bad?" The sound of the film was echo, the proud and most of the conversations were obsolete. <br /> <br /> There are some good performances in this movie and I think Jim Thalaman is really a good actor. This story was, with some actors, able to work as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> If I do not have a limited budget, then I will devote more to the good words. As much as a film as a sound image, and doing it right. Has achieved a 6.
