I want to say that curiosity got my best. If I only saw a trailer, then I would be able to tell you the whole plot of this movie; I could save myself for an hour and 40 minutes in my lifetime, and about twenty dollars This movie was waiting for the disaster, and it's embarrassing for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a strange ignorance of reality. For example, these children's remote control races go everywhere in the vehicle and even enter this house. It is even covered with cloth. Is it not advisable to send a signal in remote conditions? Hollywood definitely did not believe so. General reasoning and the idea of ​​electronics reversed; I suspect racing cars could reach even the streets, alone in a house across the street. Another illogical feature is the lack of possession of criminals. Why are these criminals rocket scientist until these detainees are eight years old? The child is considered to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in the Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and "accidentally" takes up a plastic pistol; Apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; Then there is another sense of sight. The trap is as well as unrealistic; If any of them actually work, criminals will die. However, Hollywood would like to "laugh" in the "funny" results of our trap. I do not smile; I washed my eyes and started pulling eyes. <br /> <br /> However, I think anyone who thinks that they have seen really bad movies; Citizens will feel more like a movie than they saw. Otherwise, leave this one for your pride. Single alone raises a question of 3. We are all Alex D. Linz is the star of this movie, but did he also write?
