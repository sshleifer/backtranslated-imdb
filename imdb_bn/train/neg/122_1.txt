I will put it on top of my movie list in the Unknown Trash Division! There are such movies which are bad, but the worst types are those which are obsolete but you seem to like them because they seem to be good for you! Sexual order, so frustrating in his days, can not even raise a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The sound of the film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense. Photography is a strict grainy black and white. Some scenes are taken out of focus or from the wrong angle. Even the word is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
