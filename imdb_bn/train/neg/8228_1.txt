The problem with this movie is that it is shot in the worst camera and the film is vague and great. Maybe it was not that anyone who was holding the camera could not even stop because they were detained or something. There is too much stupidity and vomiting in this film. Someone reverse every twenty minutes and it seems to me that something is made by bulgice or something. It was boring. There's a boring high screaming screaming that does not stop until then and on and on and leave the credit roll. I did not like when all his friends were shot (or I do not know), and he goes to the van and keeps the band's supporters. That was a movie that was really really stupid. How much gas can a person siphon get in a van? It should definitely be complete because they do not have gas for the rest of the film. This was a terrible movie and I would never recommend it to you ever show it.
