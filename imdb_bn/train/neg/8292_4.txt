This is a common practice for a movie about style and tone in a bit of muted repression. In encouraging restraint and narcolepsy among the audience members, though, there is a difference. Campbell Scott and Hope Davis performer "The Secret Lives of the Day", director Alan Rudolph plays as close to the risk as possible, resulting in a film that does not amount to more than being transformed into a metaphor of metaphor for marriage. <br /> <br / > <br /> Scott made a great performance in the role of Doctor Heart, a dentist who married Davist. Rudolph quickly sets the dynamics of their relationship - he is completely absorbed in his daily duties of being a parent, he quietly discourages his terrible family life - and Scott increases his tension when his wife does not have any other witnesses. At this moment, the movie is watching his wife, Wenya, her possible adultery, or whether she will kill him and leave him for good. As a former patient acting with Davis Lari (Brad Pitt's "Fight Club" taking a lot of loan from Tyler Durden), David is seen from a legendary "friend". <br /> <br /> <br /> If there is enough uncertainty about Dana's betrayal and David's warrant test instability, the last two-thirds of the film is shamefully empty. Instead, Rudolph has created a nasty fever drama that travels slowly through the Harist family, which visits the hospital continuously in climax. This movie never indicates how David will be able to do so if he is not so much devoted to his family; It does not spend much time looking at the uncertainty of grains in the family life and its other, more complete ambitions. <br /> <br /> Rudolph is killed by expressing concern over the cost of spending most of the film. <br /> The speed of his film Fifth member of the family shows sweat and illness, the film uses all good ingredient in the well-measured performance of the scoot. David and Dana end up recovering their steps until the end of the catharic end. With the creation of some of the last hours, the conclusion is strange and the stomach-on looks. The "secret life of teeth" takes a common theme and does nothing to improve. Together, a frustrating, unimaginative film.
