*** Comments contain spoilers *** I was just holding this show when I started annoying music under each show, while Don Aps was almost a shooting average in every case, very nasally Diane Farr was probably pregnant (but we did not notice) and When Colby came from ***** G Triple Agent. But now, tonight, in this episode, David is trapped with a paranod, knot job, with a gun, an elevator on the elevator and .... he can not deny him. A trained, experienced field agent who has been through the door repeatedly and experienced in the fight to save himself from the hand, he can not do a free job. The brown job does not seem to burn, the head is bad, the eyes closed. For 20 seconds, he looked at the fiber optic cable shoulder around the roof like a pole stripper, but he did not see it. <br /> <br /> When I came to the scene that I could learn as much cruel, frumpish but very impressive Charles Epps and his sexy lateral / love interest Amita, my Friday night would be well-appointed otherwise good. Don dubbed the term "tragic", which is the code for "S ** going to go"; David is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, start the brown work, and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The naughty guy ended up with two guns, David finished the shot. <br /> <br /> I've finished Hope NUMB3RS is fun
