I went to spot this flick under "new releases" and it was very interesting to pass the concept of a hip-hop zombie flick. The way it was billed in the box, anyway, and I thought to myself, "What a great idea!" Plus there is a sign on the "Sign In Oakland" sign, too. How can I resist? Unfortunately, part of the hip hop just lasted for as long as the opening theme. There was a lot of hip-hop music and hip-hop culture in the movie. While at Auckland, I know that there are many aspiring hip hop artists, so there was no excuse for not having a suitable soundtrack in this low budget budget. Any number of struggling artists who had the opportunity to contribute to this glow. Why the Queiroz Brothers did not accept this facility is not beyond me. <br /> <br /> Once the film was rolling, it was a completely normal zombie movie with a Cast as a completely black and Latino. You might think that it will give you abnormal slots in the movie ... but it did not. Somehow, the "urban culture" kiosks were shot to play in the Brothers' viewpoint and dropped a bomb bomb on every line in the movie. The fastest use of the word "fuck" is probably the most distinctive feature of this movie. There was a single line that contained three or four times the word, and no line contained it at least once. I was not arbitrarily inclined to swear in any movie, but there was a feeling that it was the reason for the lack of ideas of the authors (also the Quiroz Brothers), and the script was generally very poor. <</ br> <br /> The picture was generally frustrating. It was indeed interesting to see "urban culture" Jimmy Flick, but "Living Dead Hood" does not give this count. The characters of the film can easily be white or eskimo or something else. The movie had no distinct smell. Bad acting, humorous writing, amateur direction, blue painting, a cheap soundtrack and nothing to recommend it.
