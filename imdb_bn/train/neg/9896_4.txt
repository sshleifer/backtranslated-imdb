There are 2 episodes in the DVD version, Caesar's Parrisside is Structured. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. So, reviewing the depth of this movie is difficult for me because I did not understand what I said. Cleopatra is a historical icon, it is very difficult and I have found it for a new generation, Leonor's playing just fine. He is a strong-willed but very helpful, humble soul mate. Thimothi Dalton as Caesar is perfect and the main theme of the first episode of their romance. So, it's not really a documentary, not a leopard but a great love story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, I saw the second episode, and their tragic fate was not very strong. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, deliciously arranged; Moroccan live location exotic and wardrobes are fantastic. There is a lot of money to ensure the producers, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, spins) that make it fun. Finally, I would like to hear it in French or English to give a strong opinion about these two films.
