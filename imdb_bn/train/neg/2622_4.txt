102 Dalmatians (2000, D. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> To believe in healing, Cruella de Vil (closed) is released from prison and set out for a new beginning of life. The things for the crew who are busy helping to stop homeless dogs off the road are going well. When the clock strikes on the big Ben, things turned bad. Hypatic healing is reversed and Croll comes back, and this time he is determined to create the spotted quote that he always wanted. <br /> <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reiterated her role as Cruella de Ville and again highlighted the film. Every scene with it is worth seeing at this dull seagull, which, in spite of a new story, is more likely to repeat the previous movie. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Why Shepard (Ion Graffudd)
