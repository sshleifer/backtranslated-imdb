Please stop Ben Stiller from playing a movie. Enter the studio, write the hell, even your local congressman. I've got more fun laughs going on a funeral then I've been watching a starter flick. Jack Black tried to do something about the comedy about the loss of a dog's whip, and perhaps the greatest actor of his generation, Christopher Walken, was simply embarrassed. Stilller is his illogical spirit, but now someone who proves to be hostage to him, that he is as frustrated as the sunny. It is no surprise that why the movie is dragging badly, and after just a few weeks the dollar was available for movie theater. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, do not see this flash, it's terrible, the worst after Gothic (personally, I never thought I'd say it), the worst plan 9, the worst estr Bad then golden children Please leave Hollywood to Ben Steiler in your movies, it's not funny, he's a terrible actor and he's bringing others with him. The following movie got 1st place because no negative score is allowed, so when the board says, I'll give it a zero.
