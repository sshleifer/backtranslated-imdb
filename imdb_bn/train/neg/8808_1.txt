The "Astonishing" scandal of the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have given this explanation an audacious piece that really got published. This image is surrounded by a number of girls, who have a disease that forces them to be cancerous and kill innocent people to stay alive. Throughout life, their skin gets torn, we can see the feet, head, etc. often as believable as a set of Halloween breaks. There are many terrible things to talk about, people's cooking and some strange zombie hunter chap, who detonate the victims of stomach skin scourge before heading them, torn them into bits ... <br /> <br /> You get pictures . It seems that there is no acting talent in the competition, and cow's humorous unrealistic, what is the point of this whole blog?

Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you have to be a member of religion. Do they keep your wages in pocket? Do they let you see other family members? They do not force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films until you think he is the best director of Hitkoc? Say ... it sounds like a special panorama to me. And say hello to the critics of LA when you come back to your colony, is not it? 0/10
