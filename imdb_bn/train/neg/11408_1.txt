This was just plain terrible. I read this book for school, I made it as test all, and see this like this! My teacher forced me and 20 to see it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, from Plan 9 and Hudson Haq was gathered from the outside. This movie makes such a terrible thing that there were enough reasons to kill yourself. After all, it was made in Hallwork. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was too bad I asked to forgive myself. Basically, I would like to see Basic Institute 2 than this clock. Take my advice, do not see this film. Nobody wants to see this. It was awesome. Awesome!
