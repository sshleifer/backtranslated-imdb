I will admit that I like the first, and really looked at the real. <br /> <br /> I left. Sure the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not reliable looking. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I like the 80% footprint - but fight with Mr. Smith? It was very animated very clearly. <br /> <br /> I can accept it all. I was part of the non-action action that I can not accept. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that I was in a speech that went on forever and nothing was meant. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the little plan I was frustrated with. Did this movie tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (without the existence of the matrix). This movie was a little like the Dallas episode where you found that the whole previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ow! I want my $ 7.00 back!
