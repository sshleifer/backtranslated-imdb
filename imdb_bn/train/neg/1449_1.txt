First, before reading further, you must understand that I am not a nagali, I just try to understand Hitler correctly that no one like him can take power again. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the series and found it terrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to see, but is it real? I searched the answers and found one: absolutely not First of all, Hitler was not angry at all his life, the series shows a mad Hitler, even though he was a child too. Secondly, Hitler did not want to abuse his daughter, in fact, Hitler was actually homosexual and had fought all his life for the secret awakening. Thirdly, people will hate me, but this is true: Hitler was impressive. Do you think that if you were so despicable and ugly you managed to get the power? Because he was charming. This is a common point I found in interviews with people close to or near him (Of course, not Jews) <br /> <br /> This series was horrific because if you think that Hitler was just busy with anger, ugly, and of course, Not charming, you are wrong. If you think that you will allow him to take power in the country like you and you do not want it. If you really understand how Hitler came to power and thought that he was just awful, you would be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, he was elected) and close the theme before it's too late. Life is important to protect. <BR> <br /> This series is just awful to show the truth, if we look like Hitler, the other will be just like the first one.
