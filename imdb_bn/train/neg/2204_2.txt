I love sharks. And mutants And explosions. Theoretically, with those parameters of mind, Humade: Shark Frenzy should never have been the best movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It seems right that if the manufacturers are not proud of its design then it seems. It is to say that for a man a large rubber suit / action / cspy / horror flick can benefit from some mysteries, skark gets much more time. Approved, it is generally shaky and uncertain. I think you want to assume that the camera has become scary inside people. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person to eat, the camera goes shark. The camera goes back to the person after feeding, only now they are screaming and unhappy. And so <br /> <br /> <br /> Dressing is bad, acting poor, and special effects are sub-par, but the worst of writing. Things will happen completely randomly so that more people eat, or so may explode some. Because I'll tell you, those who made this film have definitely gone with more explosions = better psychology. Character has to shoot the vehicle and have a huge explosion. They shot helicopters, there is a huge explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, they all explode, so scary sharks that are so explosive even last. Not talking about how crazy a person is, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who is making a terrible shark man, a giant half-man will try to have sex with women in half shark It's hard to think. That is, this person is not crazy scientist in this movie. The worst thing is that the movie is so random (and sometimes boring) even its badness is not enough. Prolonged interest in the person This could be a good one for your friends with MST3K, but in the past, if you're catching this bad boy, please change the channel on your own.
