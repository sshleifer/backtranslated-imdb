There is no option to post less than 1 sign of how sad it is I saw this fragment and just could not believe what I saw. Every part of the film was horrific. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, everything just I actually saw myself laughing loudly at different places of the film. I especially like the bit where our hero gets hit by the speed of soft focus and closes the clipboard from the nurse, because .......... good. Just because. Product space? Crucifix (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian provocative and very easily satisfied you can choose this movie. If you like this movie then you have to get even more.
