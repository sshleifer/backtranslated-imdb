There are two types of musical instruments from the 1950s. First you have to produce shiny MGM with big names and great music. And then there are minor leagues with your less famous cast, less famous music and second rate managers. 'The girl can not help it' belongs to the next section. Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brienau also did not become famous and Jenny Mansfield was famous for her ... well, do not remember. It seems that there are divisions of Bo Derex or Pamela Anderson in every decade. The plot is thin as a razorblood, and it is suspected that it is an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others of Rock Act of 1950, which is shown in the film. If you are watching that price of music that is worth this. If not, do not bother.
