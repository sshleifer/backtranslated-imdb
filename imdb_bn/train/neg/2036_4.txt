The film is about a young man who is caring for the elderly. One day he decided to kill some of his relatives. At about the same time, he decided to designate his assassination model after 60's Russian killer. He contacted the author of a book about the killer of Russians and they formed friendships. Michael has a gun (obviously the only gun, it seems in the hands of other actors, not only pictured as the same gun.) And he goes out of a killin. Original <br /> <br /> If you like B movie, it's a great movie. I thought the film was good, but the performance and acting really drowned the plot. I thought that 'blood' was very fake, the light was a bit awkward, and the dialogue was very standard. The movie was shot on the video, which is fine, but the editing of the movie has been made for some strange 'Plan 9' scenes. B-movie is not a bad movie for fans of the genre, but if you want something with more polish then go to something else.
