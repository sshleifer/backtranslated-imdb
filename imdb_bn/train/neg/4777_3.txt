The idea behind these pictures was a good one. Too bad it was not well written. Casting Sydney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. Tom Beringer, on the other hand, knows most of his movies, an emotion in anger. Carsti Eli's character can be a great one and even some chances are possible, but the authors really keep her role mostly as helpless women. It was strongly inconsistent with the independent character. I do not care anymore for the performance of Allie. The film should have been about fifteen minutes to finish it as soon as it was. Before the incredible final step the director cows dried up. I would only put this in my collection as an example of Poitier's performance.
