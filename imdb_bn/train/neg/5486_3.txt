The first film really starts from a mobile phone note: A 10 year old girl walks in a moving car, decides that her mother's eyes cover her hand, and then a terrible accident happens to kill her .... .... I'm sorry, that's a fool 10 years old positively. The rest of the movie is not much better. After the death of the 10-year-old master of the planet, the father transferred his family to Geneva, Italy, where he studied at the local university, but the clinic here: he does not speak Italian words! Then the little girl's mother ("she killed") "outlook" and is often a nightmare of fear that always holds the father and makes fun of him. Then this family is constantly lost and later found, and then embraced and then lost by crying and then found (of course, more tragic and crying) that I really want for any kind of natural disaster, this is just the buzz, the world's unaware People removed. Do not make me wrong, because I love indies, but the senses about fools (and I mean really fooling) are just ridiculous and meaningless. It is indeed a shame that this film was based on uninterrupted characters which entered into such a disaster, because the locale was interesting.
