Serum is a crazy doctor who finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead, it creates some monsters that need to eat human flesh and brain. Crazy Doc creates some zombies outside the cadavers and there are some problems. As well as being familiar with the character, there is a very long lead in many scenes. The crazy doctor's nephew falls in a car accident and crazy doctor tries to use his new serum on the boy. The result is not good. It's okay acting with a class c movie but some problem guides and some series of errors. There is not a lot of zombie action in this one and effect, when sufficient, there is nothing special. You can move fast through slower sections and get some fun in action scenes. Watch for some nudity and bad language.
