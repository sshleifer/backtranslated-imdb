Most of the stories or stories in the story are similar to Lyon, but other parts have felt like any other movie, I do not know, but there is a familiar feeling on the whole movie. It was kind of nice to look at, but it has been fantastic! If the story has been more original. The theme is a little girl, a bad killer from Lyon, just a little tweaked. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's weird that people who want to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem is to remember that Leon was part of Nikita and if they are from the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, this is a good movie. If you like this movie then I can recommend Leone. <br /> <br /> Best Honor / Rick
