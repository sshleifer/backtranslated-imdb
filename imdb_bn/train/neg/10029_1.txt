I did not know what the film was before because it was the only teaser trailer in Teeson when it was being broadcasted. So I asked my friends if they knew something about it and they said, "This is Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the exhibition of Dhoom1 and 2 and Ibrahim, son of Saif Ali Khan, played him in this film, his flashback is a child ". <br /> <br /> After watching this, I realized why they did not have the right trailer because the movie did not show anything. The story was very slow and even a 10 year old child could bring a good storyline. There was no move, and the camera was reduced to every possible corner and nobody was known to anyone. Also the actions were daft and unrealistic as such. With handguns, 1 person killed almost 100 people with machine guns. <br /> <br /> When I was watching Tasan, it reminded me of three movies: <br /> <br /> Sina City: during the first feat <br /> <br /> Kaila: Kaila's Amil Kapoor is terrible English <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zoom Barbarr is a ridiculous funny joke which is not funny. <br /> <I have heard the budget of 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. If you do not like Smoke 2, there is no chance that Tasan likes. Race was hot on heels and it's a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only two good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya and both songs in Greece are shot at good position but what is the use of garbage film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English could not save this dissonance.
