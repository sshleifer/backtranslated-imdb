I really did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the camp, and we are not bothered about it, we laugh at it. Of course, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole film idea is terrible (I know now it was based on a book I did not read, but I hope the book was better than that, because really, I I thought that this movie was very bad and annoying). As I said, I went to a group of people from the camp and we were excited to be there, and I got a caffeinated drink, but still, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that holds me up (after my waking up, there was no other than the fear of embarrassment) was a gun battle, which was quite a dot. I really do not like it.
