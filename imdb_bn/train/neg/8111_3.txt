Costa-Govaras is another great movie. This is a big representation of Latin American politics in Latin America and the United States. Although the facts may or may not be true, it is a fact that the United States was deeply involved in the coup and Latin American dictatorship. <br /> <br /> While the spirit of this movie is generally followed by the leftist / communist, the Cold War era campaign. Costa-Govoras is a well-known Communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he represents U.S. activities as cruel and inhuman, when Tupmorus represents extremist activities positively. <br /> <br /> It was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America. Get involved. Europe is filled with poorer Eastern European prostitutes. As in most Eastern European countries, poor Uruguayan girls or girls in Chile do not fall asleep. The US was fighting a dirty war and God has blessed our Soviet Communists to defeat all the giants. The United States was unfortunate that what Latin America (and somewhere else) did, but sometimes you have to play dirty. Costa-Gavras and Materazzi do not believe in this idealistic world. In Latin America, another Latin American resident in Montmoruss was in Uruguay. <br /> <br /> All of these pictures follow the corrupt and left-wing leftist ideology of the past and try to pass it ideologically and morally. Correct.
