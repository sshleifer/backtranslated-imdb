I am amazed by the number of commentators acclaimed in this movie. It was frustrating to me, especially in the historical events, imagination and the original character of the internal turmoil was not in sync (Vongut's book Slaughterhouse Five and even George Roe Hill's adaptation to the screen). Reliability is often overstretched. There are many questions left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to clarify the lines that probably connect the dots? <br /> <br /> One boy got up in Campbell, Junior, New York. At home, his father has many technical trade papers and a book. It contains dead hanging photos. The boy found the page through the book, his father did not like his work. What would this tell me? The family moved from New York to Berlin. Momentarily It is a married man in 1938, son Berlin and a theater drama. What kind of drama do he write? In which language Did he succeed? His wife looks an actress and glamorous. Parents go back to the United States and invite their son to do the same. He is not Why? Does Germany feel more than Americans because it is growing in Germany? Because he is successful? Because of his wife? Because he likes his life? Because he likes Nazi? Because he just does not like lazy lazy and change? Do not ask me <br /> <br /> Probably, people just do not take care, not interested in politics, an existential one. He said that he deeply fell in love with his wife. He is talking about his two republics (ie he and his wife). There is no evidence to prove his love for his wife in the film, it seems much more than a republic. <br /> <br /> America's agent, Campbell, agrees to make anti-Semitic broadcasts at the request of junior. American audiences hate to hate campaigning to send encrypted messages to read in lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on the Berlin Park bench is short, overwhelming and anti-climatic, the decision to play without any explanation comes easily, the rise of the broadcaster seems unknowingly and visually fast. <br /> <br /> Now we are presenting ourselves in the air like Campbell, Junior, last wind. The plan to send a secret message is fairly realistic and exciting - although Campbell, Junior is astonishingly wondering what happened when it really happened and honestly arbitrarily, hikkupup etc. (Messages spread horribly). However, the Nazis lose, the wife dies (during the trip to Crimea for German troops - I have never heard WWII happened in the second German line lines), Campbell, Junior, she went to the Russian Front but did not say, who was caught by an American soldier Mogh (how come?) Recognizes that Auschwitz is dragged on a tour of visitor philosophy, then it is called the New York City Co Thao is released with the help of a criminal agent and reinstated. <br /> <br /> And this is where the story really starts <br /> <br /> Bang. From now on it is like a small story in Paul Oster. In 1961, Campbell, Junior lived in New York's Tenement and expressed condolences for losing his wife. Nobody really thinks - or are they? Yes, anyway, and its neighbors offer some confusion. Auschwitz Survive. Painters Some American supremacist ?? "Discovery and want to be known to him, they even find his supposed deceased wife for him, or he is his wife? Nevertheless, at last Cambridge, Junior, called at the Consulate of Israel, and they obliged him to provide criminal treatment to Big War, He was surrounded by Eichmann, he wrote his life story, and once finished, the typewriter's bundle While I could see that there was a problem of crime and loss, I felt that the main character is a person who is always indifferent to everything and for some rarely It is painful for the losers to express condolences for their losses, oddly, many critics call his position as the hero of his potential war. Cass, who has maintained his fame for playing the last of the free Americans, I think it is very courageous accordingly. As a matter of fact, the film recommends that Campbell has made himself a win-win situation for himself, because he safely Whether there is a political security, there is no reason to win the war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, everything that explains the story. But still it fails to make a point, initially, I suspect, because the love relationship of the two republic is completely flat. This is a sad, especially if you consider that the wife Sheryl Lee, who played by a talented, versatile and sensitive actress. She has very little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. In another way the neglected aspect of different texts (confession, broadcast and hidden messages), but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I will give a chance to book
