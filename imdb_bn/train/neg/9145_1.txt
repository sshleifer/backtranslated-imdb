First of all, enjoy watching bad movies. It is quite funny how some of these films leave a lasting impression than the real goodies. This film is a boring malicious way bad. This car is not just the limitless unqualified limit for Sam Morovich's confusing ego, it has redefined a lot of the meaning. This will always be the barometer for bad movies. Sort the Mendoza line for the photo. Mr. Morovich struggles for marital equality, such as writer, director and starry Arthur Silas, rebellious wife and evil Christian force, because he and his partner Ben "died behind the eye" the title. As a liberal I believe that marriage should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do homophobes to do more harm because of that than an army. All the Christian scriptures are so ugly and invasive, trademark mordovies, that you probably can not take them seriously. Arthur Brother Victor, the Bible beats Jesus Fikak, so horribly poor / proud gay that you have to wonder how the role was played in this role. That's because Sam "Multitasking" Mraovich was also the caster's director. It's the worst Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think that the leading people come to feel sticky words, balding, and whip? Sam also delivers line like Domino's Pizza, Cold and Normally Wrong. Final tile: You can write, dictate, act and weld. Ed Wood Quad Crown. Congratulations you're a terrible little man.
