This film certainly proves that good Americans can do very well. No questions are being asked, no comment is being made on abuse of power or police terrorism, when James Stewart always resolves all the dealings in dealing with at least 5th column as a firm and firm believer. June Alison accepts family values ​​as her regular love interest and E.J. Hoover Executive Producer. And children or non-guilty gentlemen never get hurt, when professionals are effective. Do not talk about civil rights, which never breaks or homes, which are never confused. And if the FBI service is not enough, Steward also gives life to his son in WWII's second country. Completely made, you do not know well ....
