First of all, I was a huge fan of Madeleine Louangle and so excited that one of my favorite books was made for a movie Wrinkle In Time. This movie, however, spoils that tension for me. I'm sorry, but the mega was described in the book as rash carl and glasses and it was considered very unusual. In the film, there is no direct hair and no glasses, and it is "sporty" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeline L'angle illustrates Mega. Actually, Meg was based on Madeleine's character, and he illustrated how he felt when he was young. How the book and movie differ. So I would say, if you want to see it for recreational purposes, then see it, but if you are a fan of Medellin Law Engels and Time series, then I would suggest to exclude this movie.
