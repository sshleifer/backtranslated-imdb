I agree with the previous comment, the movie is very good, and you're scared about what's going on ... ... that's nothing. All open story lines are open; Those two characters who first thought that they might have gone out of the picture with something seriously, save for 1 or 2 very small scenes. I forget if Elias just did not like to leave them .... As one remaining letter, nothing is done with him. He has visited only some God-awful places, and suddenly the film is no more about him, but some of the Zerichian dictiones who make dolls from their day bread, drink homemade vadka and apparently sparkle each other. Some might say that the film looks increasingly like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it's just a bad taste, bad camera-work, a lousy script and horribly bad aspects. I can not be generous as my predecessor for grading: 1!
