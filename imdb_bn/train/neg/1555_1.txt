When I decided to show Barbarians, the two pairs played bodybuilder, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be bad because the film was directed by Raggero DeDoto, who earned fame for making Sylgery films but made good pictures. Well, Barbarians are exceptionally crassy action / adventure movies that want to be another Canaan Germanian, and fail at every stage. The look of the picture is all wrong. Some scenes were good shots but clothes and hair are equipped with human tones and schintzy, strong "disco" look, even with no ideas for whatever a low budget flick, like this. <br /> <br> Richard Lynch looks like an elderly woman with those ridiculous hair dress and costume. She is supposed to be tragic but she comes across as a buffoon. And one of my mother's children, Eva Laru Kahahan is ridiculous to watch, in her first movie, Scampy Fu wanders in Bikini. I am sure that the world will disappear from the earth! The so-called Barbarian pairs are just like those of the muscles surrounding the muscles but it is almost impossible to make proper criticism of their performance because their roles are really sick like all other things in this mess. The only way to try to isolate one twin from one another is to wear a pair that covers his ass, while the other twin Lincoth joins his muscle powders. I'm not kidding! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this trashy flick of his frustration is perfectly reflected. It's just bad.
