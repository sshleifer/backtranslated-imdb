Ironically, although he can "split", Thamas is completely tough as an actor. <br /> <br /> This picture has moved into my memory, since I have ever seen one of the most sour sugar and incompetent movies. For example, I really like it. However, the only reason for having multiple stars is that Thomas is a bigger figure, and his younger, muscular body is astonishing to see the wonderful shape of the stones and the gymnastical skills of the scattered pole. In addition to the East European country, Thomas used to plant trees on his legs in the face of many insane villagers, with a size of the size of the infamous "pomel horse" size in the middle of the village). But the poor man could try to open his mouth and start debuting, and any confusion that he might have a film carrier, was immediately dashed into the bits. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least this excuse that he was not actually an actor. Everyone else in the film - actor, director, editor, camera boys etc. at least bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So you may think as Kurt does not stop quite badly. <br /> <br /> I hope the poor cart running with money. If someone asks you to act again in the film of martial arts, then I believe that Thomas will face the person in front of him.
