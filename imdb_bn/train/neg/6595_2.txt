In the morning we were going home, because I packed all their toys, I put this hotel in the hotel room. (Toddlers do not want to see "Regis and Kathi Lee" or "see.") My four-year-old scene is funny, but the rest of me told it "very silly." This is a four year old, folks. Anyone who says over age, nine people want to kill his own television instead of killing this television. <br /> <br /> It was a little wrong to say that the movie was bad. There is no sound for this "film" really ridiculous and utterly terrible. The acting is bad, the plot stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. As it is supposed to be a comedy, it does make you even worse because you can not laugh at the film's badness. Brunson "Bulki" Pinchot is the worst, with some weird fake act (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Kunkney-Kajun I can say), but all the characters are horrifying. I did not see a real Laurel and Hardie film at the age, but I know that they wanted to be better than that. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo ... This <br /> <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Derivative garbage. Avoid all the costs until you get some weird Brunson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
