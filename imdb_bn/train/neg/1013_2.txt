If you have seen this movie then why I know "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I smiled and said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I hire this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spasi were present here in the background, while Timberlake and the LG Cool J screen kept. Timberlake in the WTF? Congratulations! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a lot of good! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believed that I'm not a big fan of him ... but I really like an actor, this Android is not called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and boring as hell. When I was popped both streets happy <br /> <br /> The story was just and I think Dylan Mac Dermot is very good at the role of his bad guy. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake destroyed it all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />. I think this is something wrong for the police movie. Perhaps they wanted to create MTV video clips for Timberlake.
