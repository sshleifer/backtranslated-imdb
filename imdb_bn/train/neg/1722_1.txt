It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it is extremely annoying with some annoying dialogues and some very annoying characters and a ridiculous looking animal. The only reason I saw this piece of trash was because it was a set of 8 disc set horror. The plot is ultimately finalized as the plot is preposterous and completely stupid. There is no blood on the animal except some bloody signs, and some bloody gunfight wounds. Unbelievable acting !! Richard Cardella Sheriff was as terrible and quite ridiculous as her character was boring. Glenn Roberts was not the comic relief and all the fun! Mark Siegel was very annoying and fun! Bob Hyman is decent then but much more. Richard Garrison was a boring and no chemistry with Casey Cob. Kacey Cobb So there was no chemistry with Richard and so here. Overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! 5 of the BMMB.
