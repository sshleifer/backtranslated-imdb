Well, the storyline of the story 'Striototyped' of Indians is simply a mistake. I agree that Elvis is seeing something good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change over time. I was thinking, okay, ... he was never in real life. It's the most obvious brown 'Indian' makeup that has ever seen. It's bad like 'Indians' in the old west of Hollywood, which is played by Jewish and Italian American actors and actual real Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is okay, but it is usually like a short story and medieval song, next to Elvis's next movie. He just did his job because Kerner Parker was associated with long-term movie contacts as far as possible from Avis! After I got out of this movie, I think that 'thanks to God' about abruptly stopped closing the movies. It's great to see character actor Jonny Blondell, Katy Zarado, LK. While Jones, Henry Jones, and Barge's Meridith are in this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < What are the filmmakers thinking? Mr. Meridith only doing this for money or what? Although I love some LVIs movies, though. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Gelhaus Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas' I can stand with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change of Habit' to see her film, where Elvis is an intermediate doctor who plays. <br /> <br /> Well well, at least Elvis has made some good films, but medieval and bad people suppress decent and good people. <br /> <br /> I will always love LVIIS! Thank you very much!
