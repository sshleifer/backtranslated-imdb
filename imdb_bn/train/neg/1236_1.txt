One of the most innovative and brilliant stories of our time ever happened? Well, he created such a summer action sheet which could be guided by any person found in the film school ... and in fact, perhaps they did a good job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> (gasp!) Except this time, apes have groan-worthy conversations, nonsensical conspiracies, and special effects that make me firmly strong in mind that this money has kept about 10 independent films' <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Wimpy Roth's outstanding performance, as well as his performance as a great actor, Thad is also a strong form of contentment and heavy breathing. Fortunately, makeup for him helps him to maintain some dignity as an actor, and most of his cone-dialogue hides behind his dirt and sniffles. <br /> <br /> And yes, accepting men always leads to reliable heritage and female and hooking them at the end without any relationship development or reason. And "Yeah, we're so cute, is not it?" The way that intermills the references in this one from the main ribbon of Hollywood. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of watching it, spend the night and call some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Skysands', 'Batman' or even a little 'sleeping'. Holl ', and remind the time when Tim Burton was an attitude and fundamentalist ... not shame and mockery.
