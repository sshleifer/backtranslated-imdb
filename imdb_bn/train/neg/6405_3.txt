It has no real plot, only a series of short comedians performing a series. I have a lot of chagrin once or twice a day, chocolate. But in more than 73 minutes, this movie is welcomed long ago and becomes old and tedious (some nudge to wake you up here and sprinkle there). It's a bad comedy (and it's pretty), it's a comedic jewel compared to most of Hron Selstars and Jason Friedberg's (date film, Epic Movie, combined with Spartans). Also the song is sadly an interesting sad way. <br /> <br /> Candy: 11 pairs of pairs, 3 bush, 3 ass <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extra: Original for this film Trailer; And "The Bind the Door", "Dead Pitt", "Farmer", "Ansated Ones", "Power Play", "Solo Survivor" and "Walkie Taxi"
