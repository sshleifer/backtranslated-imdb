I decided to watch this one because it was nominated for the Oscars this year. I guess many people here, I really wanted to like this movie, but I got annoyed and frustrated. The first scene was okay but the "rest of the film" shock handheld camera mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I guess the main reason for making such a film and nomination for the Oscars is: <br /> <br /> American "military machine" (People, who make money in war) urgently war crimes in Iraq Need to seize or confiscate some sort of confiscation. <br /> <br /> To direct the "heroic" listeners of the director and main character to the "loving war-like-drug" audience with the idea of? Oh, please come! What a flood! <br /> <br /> See how much of this film Academy will be reduced to see ...
