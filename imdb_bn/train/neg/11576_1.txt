The roll of UCSB saw this at the festival and it was * disappointed that it won the Golden Reel Awards. Considering the mixed mix of the reaction to the audience, I was not alone. I had many more good flicks there, but then I learned that judges were fundamentally rooted in film theories and other artsy shit areas. Although cinematography and editing are similar to many shorts, the story is nothing but pieces of your average student. Although it seems that "serious" students need to be included in one of these films: gender, interconnected struggle, and last suicide - Nick and Kate include police and three. Please, be more real! <br /> <br /> Oh, and it may be my outside opinion, but Montneto makes a man a little fake. Is anyone else doing so?
