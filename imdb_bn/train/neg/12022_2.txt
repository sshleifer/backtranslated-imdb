The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, let's execute. <br /> <br /> There is no motion for the movie. It should be an exciting journey, but it is more slowly and slightly more annoying than it is. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly on screenplay and editing. There is not enough barriers to right to suspense and there is no reversal and the scenes are not really removing the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> The producers should be seen on this screen and a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also a writer and director, it certainly will not happen. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting seems flat, and it puts the director down - all the actors have been quite skilled at other projects. <br /> <br /> This is shameful because with good writing, editing and directing, it can really be a good thriller.
