You can get 5 movies for 20 rupees out of the block that came out of Blockbuster. I would say that this one got my money price. I was expecting awesome dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. Well, said Mitlof, two to three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad, though I have seen some pictures not bad. Or maybe I've seen a lot less budget movies. Recently I've lost my focus. Some bit acting was cruel terrible, but in most cases it is the level of high school play. <br /> <br /> CG is probably the second worst part of this film for the movie's Saskatcheck. When I saw the first one, I thought (and another critic agreed with me) was that a man was better in a lawsuit case. Looks good with Clunky stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> So you can ask why I call CG as the second most bad part. The worst part is because of the sound effects of the movie. They are high, annoying, and constant. I'm camping, I know what pest control sounds like in the night, and when they are loud and loud, this movie is not a whack of deafness. Usually when "background" sinks to the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but I was not much missing from what I found about this movie's conversation. <br /> <br /> The action was incomplete and boring. The tension was in existence, as there was no sense of sympathy with the characters. Speaking of letters, they were all cookie-cutter and soft. It was only a mildly biped-up ... In fact, I could not remember anything. There was a line or two that made me smile a laugh, but it was it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was good, one or two steps on what you usually see in a movie. However, it still was the quality of "Home Movie" which you get through pocket modifications and movies made on a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and go out of the sparkling style of budget and you see it in dollar bine, then consider grab it. Otherwise, stay away from all costs.
