Detective Tony Roma (Frank Sinatra) returned to the screen in the first episode of his debut, this time it is a film that erm ?? The laughs are played for. At the time of a diving trip, Rome found a blonde beauty body beneath the sea, on her legs you can expect, it is cemented. Rome in this case only after renting Man Mountain Waldo Granski Rome has risked himself because he has to investigate some mafia types, launch the table on him and find himself as the main suspect, he will have to move on and hope to solve the case only. Portal Sinatra strives hard to sell us link jokes and we believe that he does not refer to a good detective, and ironical Rachel Velach's sexual intuition, but he failed unfortunately in this Ham Fiscal Vanity project. The ridiculous ridiculous conflict that surrounds every woman is quite surprising, every woman in the film is a head who likes to jump in front of the camera, director Douglas is forced to zoom in his ass's cracks. Their next muscle flex. There is a ridiculous camera gay character of beggars' beliefs, it was a film made by "true men", which is a shameful act to review their own flagged sexuality.
