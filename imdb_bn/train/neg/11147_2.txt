I do not have any comments on this movie. It is so bad that I had to give some feedback to some viewers to save some time and instead of seeing some "movies" I had to first comment on the IMDB website ... to do something, even look at the wall and look good. <br /> <br /> and write the minimum 10 lines of my writing, I would say that you have a low budget movie, bad acting, a name actor, a fool fool, etc. ... the story does not bring anything new , Special effects are made in the 80's style. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as "Megalda". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (Not watching this movie)
