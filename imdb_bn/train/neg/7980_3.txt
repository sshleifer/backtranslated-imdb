This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (Joan Drury's brother and the next annual host of The Hollywood Square) and Humming as Tommy Nunan 'New Levies and Martin' is a shocking embarrassment: some random view goggles are inserted, everyone talks Quick and nothing works well - there is a scene where the angry and angry officers and politicians grenade nick Screwing; They are about five feet away, Nunan is throwing them in, and the total response is that everyone flinches. <br /> <br /> There is only one horror in the delusion by Jelly Niemar, some of the brightness moments: Marshal and Nunan are involved in duel talk and controversy, and their time is near perfect - they were obviously a well-respected comedy pair. <br /> <br /> This is not enough to save this turkey, lazy.
