This is likely to be the worst "budget hit movie" in order to credit the dinosaur genre. The film is so convincing that you can go away, cook your dinner, answer the phone or whatever, and when you come back, just tell me what happened. Special effects are so poor that you used lego bricks and "extremely fast" dinosaurs were so harmless that it shows a pet dog as a super-hunter. The acting is cooked. They work so hard, but there is not enough character behind them to get as characters and scientists ... Yes, OK, we know what's happening to the blonde dogs in glasses. Stereotype was made for movies like this. If you want to watch this movie I'm not seeing you as a serious mood because Cast and crew were obviously. And if you really are in dinosaurs and know everything about them in the world but do not see it, you can break the screen - the events are far away.
