Oh people are bad in this movie. It's terrible flowing. The story is about a race car driver who loves himself, and then a chicken has to promote fast food discipline and does not love herself while doing it. He tries to ensue beyond contract and terrifying, painfully unfunny gags. Jim Nobers thinks he is asleep, not acting. This stinker observer will not miss such kind of burt sidekicks as Duma Deluge and Jerry Reid. Lonnie Anderson's hair is suddenly scary, proves that thousands of pieces are not fragmented. Or perhaps that was a wig. Not saying, in this film, Burst's wig was not bad. Her worst "Wiegday" was "Smoky and Bandit 2". However, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie, sometimes with the "cannonball run 2" on the right. The original "Smoky" and "Canonball" (and "Hooper", which was not consistent with gratitude) are great, funny movies. This is not the one. Even a great actor, who took Beatty, stinks. Those who love to hate you will be long for a Jackie Gleason type villain. And remember, these bags are one of those fun movies. It's shy, pure and easy. Even the outtakes in the end were tedious and annoying, and all the bad, unfunny. And at least I forgot, after a few years of her "Stroke S", like "Twelve Nights" before another movie called "Boogie Knights", there was one of the first heavy nails to seal birt's coffin, which shows that the man can work before Quite well when he has a decent platform for doing so.
