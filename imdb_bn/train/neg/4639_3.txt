The Wavefluff Eyes (1999) is a really bad movie. The compound was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. I want filmmakers to take time with this project instead of producing them. Some blind parents get some new eyes, the bad things are they belong to an average age barrier. Nasty things begin to happen as diverse as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. Can he find a remedy before finding his hot girlfriend? That's a weird little trick who helps him and what is that lady do with the police? If you really want to know, see the eyes of Wearluff! <br /> <br /> There is no bad idea for which movie. I just wish the filmmakers will spend a lot of time before pre-production time before deciding to shoot the film.
