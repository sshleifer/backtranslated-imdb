Sheriff Robert Lopez After discovering an old box, the small town of Diablo City is having a mysterious death. According to Legend, this box contains the 16th century Mexican monster named Azer. FBI agent Gil Wegge was sent to investigate and join forces to fight against the sheriff's daughter, Dominic and Mary, the evil and bloody-headed monster. "The Legend of Diablo" is a complete trash. The film is terrible and there is a lack of cow, acting amateur and the side is bad. I enjoyed the only animation aspect of the movie. I'm the big fan of Indy Harr and Flickr, for example I like "torched", "live feed", "bone illness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "Diablo's legend" avoids a huge Misfire.Definitely one.
