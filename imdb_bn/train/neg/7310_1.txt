** SPOILERS FOLLOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Faawar has requested me for the best movie of the year ... which I saw. This movie straightforward garbage! There are so many mistakes with the movie that you can not help but be surprised at how bad it really is. This movie was so much better to be good, but eventually it did not create anything. Characters were stupid as one could be; For the whole movie you are asking yourself "Why do you do this?" Or "What is your point of doing this?" ... how unimaginable these letters are and fools We do not get any background in them, so naturally you do not give them a rat as a fate about $ ... you can only laugh at their stupid ones. <br /> <br /> - For example 'whore' (Mercy) ... does she hear that she was asleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no indication of this .... It is almost like an excuse for filmmakers to give their virus! Disgust <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really go into the woods and will not drink water from the cabin call? <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? From the beginning? The way the movie ended ... as well as how they killed him. <br /> <br /> - It took so long to finally leave the cabin, even if they walk? 'No, I will wait until my 2 friends are infected (one gets away from death) and finally chose to go there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was Paul's attempt to try? Outside the body of Hermit, only to read the contaminated reservoir and get the virus infected? Pure fastness! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, very rarely known to these cats. I never think a movie has a bad end. Initially, the kids asked for the cache of the Hick Store's rifle, and he replied that it was 'for the niggers'. At the end of the film, 3 young blacks (wearing a baggy cloth, one of them is not a low-rug) stores go to find out that the cashier is cleaning it for their use. For the victims. Then, he gives them all the pounds and handshakes and surround them with them as they are his hometown. <br /> <br /> Well, what was that point of good?!?!?!? How foolish can the moviemakers think about the movie? I was offended by a black man's initial primary 'nigger' comment. It was a spoiled, stupid comment. My question to filmmakers: What was the end of black kids? Did it make me forget about the early racist remarks? To make things smoother with Black Viewers, it creates a joke through it? Well, for one, I do not find that merciful effort at least bit ridiculous. The whole movie was a joke ... a patchy effort to film making that should not be given during the day. Peter Jackson really thought that this image is good? What was he looking for film? <br /> <br /> Zero * **** from the star .... If I could give it a low rating. Please do not waste your life 1/2 hours in your precious life, by fellow IMDB, watching this hate movie. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
