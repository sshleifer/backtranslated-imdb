What would you say about this movie. Well it's about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and those who sell bad drugs to criminal students. Those two people have adverse effects because a poisonous Avenger becomes a type of typing and their girlfriend threw down some of the animals that grew in the basics of the school. It has almost all and they extend it for 84 minutes. This movie is quite bad and should be locked away forever. Although it is not fair, some people like Trom√≥r movies and they can see it if they want it. Although for me the Troma movie, there are the worst movies there. I just saw this one of the morbid curiosity.
