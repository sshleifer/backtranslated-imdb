I saw last week after picking up this DVD cheap. I wanted to see it for ages, find the outline of the plot very fascinating. So my despair was, at least to say I was very flat on lead actors. Such a section needed a performance like Jonny Depp, which was at the ninth gate (in which it was almost completely closed), but I think TV budgets do not always extend such acting capacity. <br /> <br /> I was also thinking that the direction was confused and dull, only to remind me that the carpenter did not work in a suitable movie on the Madness of Muun. For the story - well, I was frustrated as well! There was no way to fulfill my expectations, but I felt that the salary and explanation were poor, and eventually the film was found to be anti-climatic for at least speaking. <br /> <br /> It's a AICN's main contributor, and you can say that he loves his movie, but I liked good results from such a good initial generation. <br /> <br /> I returned the DVD to the store. The same day!
