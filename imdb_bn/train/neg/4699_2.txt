Wow, the naked Brothers band. What should i say I sucks I can say this show Number one: They have no talent, they probably can not even play machines. Number 2: Traders said that they were famous, but till then there was no one listening to their sleep list. Look, I do not hate it badly, I want to give it 4 out of 10, but what bothers me that everyone says that they have such a great talent and NAT writes so deep and deep songs. My ass deep She talks about hardcore wrestlers with internal feelings. Wow, I could read what I said on the wall in the bathroom and it would be even more deeper. And they are not famous by themselves, they want to be famous celebrities and their kids so they create a bad show. I have a feeling that will be canceled soon.
