Well, there is no real plot to speak here, it is an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and illogical sex (which can sometimes be fun), but this is not the case. What else can I say about this? When the action is happening, it is innovative and there is a cool scene where two letters fall from the skyscraper (which can be several miles high), but there is nothing to recommend "kites" as a whole. If you want to see it, but if you leave it then you are not much ...
