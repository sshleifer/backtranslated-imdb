Even in the 1980s, it is a merciful for Kakin. I do not understand why anyone wants celluloid, time, effort, money, and audience to make such cells in the brain cells. If you are going to make a comedy, make it fun. If you want to film in the trash, keep it with yourself. If you are going to publish it as a joke like this: do not do it !!! I mean, was it fun? Please let me say this a joke to me. Please
