(Above all, please excuse my bad english). Of course, a film starring Jessica Simpson can be a serious mistake. I'm a Norwegian and I'm offended and did not take the time to threaten the creators of this movie to make this American / Norwegian film. Research Even if information about this country is available, Wikipedia is more accurate. <br /> <br /> So I am posting my amendment to my frustration: - The country is not Norway, nor Norway. - "Photos" Russian, nor Norwegian. - Norwegian priests do not use those black papers for neck because the protesters are so influenced by the church, so really, a local heritage group (we only use twice a year) but its team movies are more like a German outfit. - I did not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica was not making any sense .. "Norwegian Pastor" <br /> <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can recognize is the Norwegian flag ( And the Viking hats, but the people who are thinking of Norwow have so much stereotype - Vikings !: O Gosh) <br /> Well, I think the people who made this movie will not read this comment. But at least I cleaned up some things and got rid of some of the frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and I love if the United States is less stereootic and more accurate. When they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was all .. Lane Leve Norge! ; p &
