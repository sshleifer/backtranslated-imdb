Weak entry of the Bulldog drum series with John Howard in the introduction. General fun banners and antics, but many plot. To do something as Barimo's inspector, jumped into the disguise to follow Drummond, Algie and Tenny, to rescue the poor fish in the wild Holous Chase (most often in circles, perhaps the budget was severe compared to normal), the drum rescued by those who were captured Want to nurture the ruins. For those who keep these scores, they are planning to ask Drummer to marry FÃ©lis, and Ally is worried about her child's name being omitted. Algie and Tenny The Angels are keen to look like fishermen to rest, but some of them come up on silence.
