This may be the worst movie ever produced, and perhaps that reason is probably worth seeing. Streisand is ridiculous as a young woman, as a young woman to study Judaism, ridiculous. The soundtrack illustrates some of the least weaknesses to portray the tyrant, Barbara belting. And even do not let me start the plot. You will actually get more chocolate out of this movie than many comedy because it is very unreasonable. Straussand's arrogant arrogance, it seemed that he could raise this stinger on Oscars' height, leading the disaster. I am sure the novelist, Isaac Basewish Singh, hated the film and did not forgive Straussand. I can not blame him. This film appears to be a breakdown of a car for two hours with the soundtrack of 'Sound of Music' acting behind an old turntable. It's really bad that. I am surprised that anyone who enjoyed this movie in Staceand enjoyed the level.
