This version is quite vague, I'm scared Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and he has been from childhood, but William Hart's exhausted acting style looks completely indispensable for the brave emotion of Edward Rochester, and poor Charlotte looks like an indecisive, petulant teenage dentist bracelet! I can not believe that at the end of the book, they removed the view of Edward's great wedding proposal, one of the most moving moments in literature. I am surprised that they are finally using a young, ordinary woman to play in the game, which is considered to be 18 worldwide, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the personality and feelings of the novel, please see George C Scott and Susanaha York's 70th Edition. York was very tall, tall and beautiful, but Jane did not touch the character of Rochester in any way.
