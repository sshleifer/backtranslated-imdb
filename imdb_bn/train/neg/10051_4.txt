I gave these 4 stars because there are many interesting themes here that have been mentioned here. From domestic violence, a lot of sexuality and taboos there. Outside of Gore, I do not really say this terrible word as much as I do science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is frustrating, depressing and hopeless. Although I do not think anything less than a delightful end, I'm really tired of the "tired people" clip, which is central to every film. I know that today you will not be able to achieve the degree of liberal arts without changing self-hatred as a member of mankind, but how can we say that as a writer / director we are no different than everyone in the pack. Notice that human revolutionaries are violent! Right now, if you read it and believe that humanity has the ability to die, then get out, find a lake and 'your arms are tired. In this way you will not be able to manage the next image or write the next book, because I'm dying to stay alive. It's not silly, thoughtful, and annoying.
