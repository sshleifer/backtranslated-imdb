I could not help but could not help thinking behind the mask: The emergence of Leslie Vernon (massively more amazing film) when it was due to a realistic feeling as well as the great innovative concept. It could be a great film. Acting ... some actors are right from From others ... it's cruel, horrible. <br /> <br /> The concept is absolutely great and the format is great. The story is quite good, although the logical mind often suffers from major injury. <br /> <br /> <br /> All right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can not really blame the mind behind the movie for this) It is probably made in the shoes string budget. And Fx really hit the overall film. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... if you did something good and swap out for a little better FX. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote it though should continue, great idea here.
