I stopped myself annoyingly or just shut down this Turkish, but I decided to keep it for the reason that I could do something *. This is an author / producer / director / special FX, Kenneth Heart job, who wants to make a statement about environmental damage during the making of giant films. Anyway, he wanted to. This is what happened to many acting, little hammy or just old and without much talent, and the scenes that seem to repeat itself as giant ATTACKS in the river water (oh, and what fate, a woman just happens to be naked in it ... even though it's already disposable Have been!) <br /> <br /> This is just a dishonest element, but I think it is not harmful; It is not very annoying at least and once or twice, we are Brazilian "culture" (which is walking in the other part of the tiger with the father in the flock or in the city, this is not America!). But the director, who was hoping to cast Mitchem or Carradine, was the best pedestrian, and most drowned in a stupid and stupid conversation. It eventually happens that "action" that does not help when we get some of the monsters and a good look, it staged very stupidly and with only sleazy application. Generally I'm sorry for a filmmaker, who has many problems to finish a special picture - in this case it was passed in the mid-70s - but it's Monstride or Monster or whatever ... .... <Br /> <br /> If you've got the Lvivir DVD-2 feature (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, do not forget to exclude it. Until then, you can not help yourself to hear Elvisor's death and hear his delightful commentary. Personally, I'd like to get Joel or Mike Nelson with this robot robot from mystery science theater on Turkey.
