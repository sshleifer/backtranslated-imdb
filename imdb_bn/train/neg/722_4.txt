One scene has shown the mentality of "Terminator Woman": Karen Shepard and another woman are trying to escape from Villene's camp. Karen runs across an armed guard, who points his gun to him, but threw it after a few seconds and challenged him in the war. Because he throws him in the ball, he takes away the gun! Then, when a movie is run by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of your family, you know that you should not expect too much. If Karen Shepard and Jerry Trimbaal start off at the beginning of some fun benters and are more focused on their love-hate relationships, then the film might be better. But after about 20 minutes they separated, and the crab reduced the film, even occasionally making the fight scene vivid, there is a lack of excitement. Finnley is fighting a quarry inside a gaith and is fighting against Shepard Garvano-a-Varchuno against Ashley Hayden in Spipboat, but the battles break their flow and prevent them from doing so by reducing their value. Positive, to the costly department to give Keane an opportunity to showcase the spectacular Clavaz across the film! (* 1/2)
