Not one of Keaton's best efforts, perhaps it was a rude attempt to revenge his family - Talmadge. A Polish / English language barrier and coincidence are a major Irish woman, who (with her grandfather and brothers) marry, lead to Buster in a marriage ceremony with her until she believes that she can be the heir to a fate. Incorrect identification here is a great deal - gags have been set up but fail to pay major money. <br /> <br /> There are at least two real laughs in this metro shortcut - the basic ignorance of the wall and his adopted family literally rolling towards dinner due to the use of the calendar with the skill of the booster, literally bring the meat of his plate. The other is a family photo, where the whole team is gradually collapsing on the floor because the camera triangle loses its stability. <br /> <br /> Yeast beer overflow can be catalyzed to create a huge series. On Gags, but closes the development (for all the buildup). <br /> <br /> Kino's print is crisp and clear and one of the score for player piano, drums and sound effects. One of Buster's best attempts, but few smiles are worth.
