Yes! ... I think. It's hard to tell It is difficult to have a passion about a movie that has no emotion. This movie disinfection as a surgeon's scale. For a deployment it has some stone pillars, some stone seats, a few cross stones and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing to save this film is a great written piece of Hamlet and Hamlet literature. Dubbing really was not that bad at all though. This voice proved to be the absolutist, dull, indifferent, lifestyles that proved the atmosphere. I saw this version of Hamlet 3,000 times 3 times in the mystery science theater, and three to three, I was on the skeleton to stop the TV, even though it was MSST 3K. <br /> <br /> To produce a lift in a drama that is so good.
