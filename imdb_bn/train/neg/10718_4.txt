Come to Tina Fai, you can do it better. As soon as the movie started I knew how it would end. It was sure it was fun at times. Even the loud funny smile But there is not enough smile to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. Most I recommend to rent it but all that. The baby's mum has some funny scenes but it is predictable and it's failing to impress hearty. <br /> <br /> Tina Fai and I have created a good team of Pohler. Average girls are one of my favorite movies. Both Tina Fai and Amir Pohla have done so well and they work well in this. But this is not good. The mother of the baby was throwing a great support. Dunn Cook, Sigouri Weaver and Steve Martin are associated with the climb. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy cinema has hit the world of the movie. After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average than. Knocked Up and Juno Hilarious, have hearty and ending that leave you with a smile on your face. The baby uncle's last was strange and neutral. <br /> <br /> The child mama was not the best comedy of the year and it does not try to do. I recommend it but it does not hope to be completely joyful. Hope an average comedy does not give a great mental angle that tries to do it. I am close to my parents ... <br /> <br /> 4/10
