Just terrible! Why do not you use real actors? Look, this will stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent through these low budget movies ... please use real actors for God's love! Most will work for free ... Take advantage of that! Now back to my comment ... However, the quiz was less than the bathroom diversity and no level was fun. For quality ... The scene pictured on a public transport bus in a scene ... could you see the crew reflection ... guess what? It was like what Sony Camcoder was and probably not too much. Well, I think the only audience for this movie is a pregnant idol ... and it was not even a good cow.
