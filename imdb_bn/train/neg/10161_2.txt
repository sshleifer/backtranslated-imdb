I did not expect much from seeing this movie because of the Parkersburg WV people, which I live in, acting on it. This town is dull and so this film. There were some decent glory in the film, but I was confused by all the harmful landmarks by creating a point to show. Although the film is played in real movies, this movie can be good but there is no one. If you are interested in Parkersburg and see what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. The conversation will allow you to sleep, the actress will tear you and Steven Soderberg will lose some credibility after such shooting. A prediction movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and touring without a statement of 73-minute West Virginia and Belp Ohio.
