OMG is one of the worst movies ever seen and I have seen a lot I am a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie in this movie? Does he need money badly? I love this one and saw almost everything I saw, so I saw these two closed. It was bad SOO! Not even bad bad, bad bad. It was a little bit of 1 or 2 fun but it was all bad wasted waste 101. I did not even say it was good to say goodbye to AJ because he did not. If you do not wait for Romeo and Juliet again, the plot is not predictable. All rounds are frustrating. Maybe your 12 if it could be a good film otherwise I do not really recommend it.
