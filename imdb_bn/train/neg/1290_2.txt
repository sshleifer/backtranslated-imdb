This movie had two and a quarter boring hours. Anyone please tell me that the point was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It can be a rugat group of Confederate Bushwalkar (Terrorist?) At the Missouri-Kansas border, retaliation against all north sympathizers and elimination during the American Civil War. But alongside neutral violence, there was not much of a dime in this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? Is war is nothing more than vain violence? That was the point if it was a good job, but I did not think that was the point. I think the producers really think that they are making a decent movie here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of plots. Looks like I've come to see a paperback novel, like looking at letters like what you can see in the covers of novels. <br /> <br /> This film must be burned with some of the gang's cities!
