As the "Bramma of Panama" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: Casting, acting, script, story, editing, motion, music, psychological impact, etc.) After extensive entertainment by the performance of Brosnan. , I anticipated this film enthusiastically. I was extremely disappointed. This is not a script, it is not a movie, illogical for indecent, disrespectful, "Panamanian Pot" is rich and bankrupt for satisfaction. Screen writing and guidance blame it. I sat in the theater and waited for "good part"; It never came. I laughed and did not cry, though one line of the dialogue made me laugh. Price 7 dollars? Hardly
