Two days after seeing this thing, I still suffer from Having. It is very bad, you will be surprised how anyone can write this trip, let it be different from the general public. Acting steady, he is a close person who looks asleep and is feeling embarrassed by Alison Eastwood. The action is a sign of low budget film, which means it is painful. The volume? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you wrote this movie. Simple, idealistic, and just plain lam.
