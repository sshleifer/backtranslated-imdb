I was in China in this movie. I chose the screen name Sheba Alhani because I was a time model in Italy and they could not properly pronounce my real name, so I liked Ceba and if Alhani was added, it was like a whistle. <br /> <br /> I've never played before (and it shows), but it was a lot of fun for the movie. They gave me "acting lessons" (which was obviously not useful) every morning. They are my voice (thanks to the good niss). <br /> <br /> David and Peter set explosions, good humor and full of fun. This picture was not taken seriously, it was closed to write a tax according to internal data. <br /> <br /> I can give it 1 because I have a sense of humor, but there were 10 "acting" for fun.
