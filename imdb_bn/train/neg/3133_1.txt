Some people, who read or saw some of the angels coming to earth, decided to ignore what they heard about morons, humans and angels being older than normal people. Reinventing them as a mythical giant that was 40 feet tall, is ridiculous crossing. There were some historical references to housing and furnishings in some parts of the world, which were much larger than required for the criteria. They were probably created on a scale that lends itself to 10 to 14 feet of people supporting the story of "David and Goliath" from the Bible. There is no mention in any historical reference that buildings or artifacts that support the concept of 40 feet long. If I rate this movie on my own scale, then it has a negative value instead ...
