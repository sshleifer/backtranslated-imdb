Freddie's dead: Freddie Kruger (Robert Englund) as a dream giant ends up dreaming of a teenager (Shawn Greenbelt) of Springbirth, who is himself or why he is there. Local police took him and took him to a youth center where child psychologist Maggie Burrows (Lisa Zen) interviewed him, he spent a newspaper in his pocket, which took two Springbirds to Elm Street, where they know that no child lives there and so is Freddy No victim to kill anyone. It all proves that this is a comprehensive plan for Freddie to find out her daughter and use her to escape from Sprund. Maggie realized that what Freddy did to him, and some children once wanted to kill Freddy and everyone ... <br /> <br /> This final nightmare directed by Rachel Talal was created with the intention of a nightmare. The Elm Street film has reached five by this time, certainly a horror movie fan knows that money can be earned from a franchise or character, there is no way to die in Hell: Final nightmare ends, of course, it was not. The frightening of a nightmare in the Elm Street series has reduced, as the movies have dropped down qualitatively until we have come here until the death of Freddy's series: The Final Nightmare is probably the worst among them for my money. The film comes at a reasonable speed and it is rarely boring, but it's too stupid, kid, and some harmful set pieces look like some live-action cartoons with horror scenes that seem to be suspicious and effective from 80 to ten million miles of Wes Craven. . In a video game directed by Frandy, Stoner Spencer is trapped on his own. But then our body shots are moving from the wall to the wall and from the floor to the ceiling. I've seen it in a while, or maybe the early scenes when John Doe kids fall flat on the plane of the runner's runner cartoon, like the cartoon character of the Quote or in the strange view of the Friedrichs, Deaf Carlos. Pin that he wished to make a high sound from the floor or when he finally killed him by scraping his knife across a blackboard. You can not take it seriously and I was just sitting there which I did not see. In the end, when they tried to kill Freddy, the hero was given a secret powerful weapon, yes it was a pair of cardboard 3D glasses! The character is poor, the conversation is poor and the plot is confusing, it is not actually consistent with Elm Street continuity and overall the movie is a mess, I can tell about it the best thing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> Being Critical is Plain Full Flat There is not much gore in it, some fingers have been cut, there are some holes, some nails fall on the bed and it's about it. The body is extremely rare here with only three deaths. The final twenty minutes or so minutes of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was actually shot in 3-D, although this version was presented as usual in the version I have seen, so I can not comment on how good it is Do not explicitly see the shot that is seen in 3-D, which takes advantage of the process. Special effects change, others are terrible and others have terrible horrors and Freddie's burn make-up looks quite poor at this time. <br /> <br /> This was probably a budget of around $ 5,000,000 (box office at an opening weekend of $ 12,000,000), and the film has some nice visual touches and gags, which makes the item look more cartoon than it. Tom Arnard and Roshan, Johnny Depp and Ricker Alice Cooper, along with some strange quotes, though the act is really very poor. <br /> <br /> Dead of Freddie: The Final Nightmare is probably the worst worst series & there is not much to suggest from the unexpected smiles or to differ from the standards. Supporters of the series probably will like it and defend it but for me it is as much as it is from Wes Craven's original classic shocker. New Nightmare followers (1994) tried to take Freddy Kruger and series from new and different points.
