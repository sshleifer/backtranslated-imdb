Compared to a good cast golf this is unexpectedly wasted in slow and weirdly connived comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard to do something here, but the result is a pivot belt which misses all the correct frustration, which can be spectacular. Regardless of the comments here, this film is awful. Badly managed Badly edited. Acting badly. Writing badly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How he is out of loneliness and credibility (he learns his computer skills overnight reading some papers and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Marley to go to South America and steal his identity). <br /> <br /> Side plot, Ustinov romance colleague Lone Maggie Smith, who became his secretary after getting a flat in his house. While sharing the sex scenes going to any place in Bob NewHeet, he has finally shared a bit, while Ostinv tried to make a bit of money and went on to step ahead of Neighth and Carl Malden. He then married Smith and they are going to Brazil, almost every British Copper comedy's final end has been finalized (to run uns unsorted a wand?) <br /> <br /> <br /> More ridiculous than everything that came before In the end, I was thinking that my Robert should be stopped for holding such drills like me. Even Caesar Romero did not help it in a camio. I've never seen it, and of course, one of the most unfunny, badly-paced 'comedies' of the worst cruelty. Do not waste your time. If you love you will see a better movie.
