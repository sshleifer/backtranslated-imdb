Five-year-old Michael is murdered by his disciplined father "Highwayman," who suicides himself after death, and then suicides himself. "Mike" (Gopan Curie, Puppet Master 4 and 5) Raised "20 Years Later" to invite his seven grandfathers to his private grandparent's house to "master his own fear" at Mike Halloween Night Costume Party. A wooden wooden doll, kept in the atom by an Indian surgeon, was overwhelmed by the soul of the dead father and used to kill them by using phobias. Characters are thrown out of a window, drowning in a toilet, eating fat, blowing, etc. Drunk dads and trees make morphs, walk around and make fools. After cutting a girl and stuffing in a cardboard box, the characters live at home, are happy, have fun and have sex. <br /> <br /> Martine Design is good and Batis Palmer (Mrs Bhurish is the original Friday 13th) is surprisingly delightful as grandmother, but this thing is more stupid and misleading and misleading than false, bad acting, dead brain characters, repeat flashbacks Footage and annoying distorted camera-full of work. Besides, only two minority characters (Indian and semi-black girl) are the first to die. Bad words!
