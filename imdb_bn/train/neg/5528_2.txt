This movie is only 61 minutes running and on television nothing good, I decided to pop the DVD to rebel rebels in order to pass the time. Even after realizing the time of coming from, I was very disappointed. It starts with surprisingly started score (key - no bruding music?) And then gradually the opening sequence. Hugh, I've been filming a movie about Jumbo in the 1930s - it will have some coolness (with White Jumba, Bela Lugosiera), but none of it. Zero. It was rarely dramatic (to indicate some mildness in some moments by the shining eyes of the film). Like the equally shameless King of Zombies, this movie owner can be an interesting curiosity, but nothing more.
