I really do not have anything new to add but I felt like commenting on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Shocking I am again going through my MSST 3D DVD collection and I've seen Hogglins for about 10 times. It's really, really painful but it was next on the list ... you can see that there is a small version of an actual movie that "Hoggoblin's" was buried under all the cones but it could not just go out. Everything about this movie is 4th rate. Story, acting, impact, woman, "action scene", ... Ahh forget it. I saw the pieces of the over over over over over over over over with very little bad effect. (Actually I like it - this month should be TCM- October, 2009) But "HogGoblins" is a complete 'document call'. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it is about 12 hours after the film ended, I had a very good night sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medicines, and still ersatz "New Wave" dance music that Em, Red Shorts, and Larryne Newman were frolicking in the living room, still running through my head. This pain will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, is not it?
