"Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow" (an unusually incomplete title) is simply a bad movie; It has no heart, no deep sense, nothing special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds seem to be interesting, but the whole thing is shot in a boring soft focus. In addition, the movie uses the same way as the song, "Gilgon Island" or the Scuba-Du cartoons - it does not stop. Horrendously, only terrible. There are no new ideas for bits taken from old movies and serials, just singing and singing and singing ... and so on. There are no gates here, the film seems to be okay because it can. Save your money and your time. Not always entertained
