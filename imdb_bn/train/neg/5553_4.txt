This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but much worse than the original. It was even better than D2 that the bad guy has changed and Durant has not been restored. As well as the bad people's family and the Darkman came to himself, there were some indications of the character's development. This has softened my heart and I give this flick 4/10, eg ** / *****.
