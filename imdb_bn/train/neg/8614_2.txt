I'm never a fan of Rodney Danffield. Indeed, from me he "no respect." I just saw it because my wife wanted to see it, and I found exactly what I hope: a stupid story without any real humor It plans to build a completely ridiculous plot, a ski resort in Utah, a funny joke and a developer (Dangerfield), which did not attract my attention. This movie played a weak cast star, including the Andrew Dice Clay and the junior junior on Hill Hill (I do not know that he was still around him. Saw his name for this achievement). <br /> <br /> This is really a Dangerfire disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
