I enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride' and I was thrilled to see a movie version. A woman frames a police lover for her own murder, and her friend, a former police journalist, looks for the deceased woman's crazy female friends, trying to clear her name. It is fortunate that the movie script is plotting the evil plot of Mrs. Atwood's plot to focus on the story of these two men who are involved in scamming women ... <br /> <br /> Oh. All right, you got me. If these guys mention in the book, and I'm sure they are completely ready for the movie, I would like to take my hardback copy dust cover. Apparently, the three major female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the film. If the genera manipulation is not attractive, we do not see him meet a man, and a person's life is lost. Rose, Chorus, and Tony are telling their stories - a man. This is not important because if someone does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I like the letters of the book. It hurts to see a man pushing from side to side for the story. I usually do not look for feminist corners in the media and I tried to enjoy the movie. If I could not read the book, I might have enjoyed many more. So if you like the police and the former police and you want to read more about them, then you will be out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy subtly layered delightful prose and charity through a plot. This is the same plot: The film has been excavated, it has iron, and it has excited the male. It's like the revenge of Margaret Atwood.
