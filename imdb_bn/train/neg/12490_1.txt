I own this movie. I bought it for a bit of "indie" type movie research at roughly $ 3.99 for big video retailer, since I've finished my feature and am editing it. Now when I feel about my skills for the first time. Just sit in the cookies plate and sit down. Within a few minutes I feel very good !!! <br /> <br /> I hate another filmmaker, so I use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. Time. It really helps. 2. After shooting the video, your scenes light up and then darken the post on the computer. 3. Close ups for video are good. 4. When an actor enters a scene, <b> <br /> to talk to them so that we know what is going on and who is speaking 5. When we open a door, we can never wait for it. $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> The Real Horror reviews have been set in IMDB and you have to pay these loans ... They distribute.
