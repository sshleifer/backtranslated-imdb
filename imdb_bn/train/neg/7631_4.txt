I'm not going to force TLPS's clear Peterbagnavichian errors. Instead, I would look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has been able to create a film that can be fully tolerated. This incident alone highlights the movie and is at the top of its cripple film. <br /> <br /> 2. Bagdanovitch showed how some lucky lover could be a wonderful liberal friend, sharing the incredible body of Cyber ​​Shepherd (his then) and his male audience - not just one but two events. Brava,! Uncertainty highlights in this cinematic Festa del Sista <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has barely just a view of the dodling stereotypical country music in the background. (Peter tries to make a clear point set up in America's deep south (such as it was not clearly bloody), so he asked that the point and hammered on and over ...), how could it be an advantage? Well, when the film ends and the monotonous country music stops sending you tired ear drums, you start to feel a strange pleasure: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> 4. The movie Clarence Leachman gives all the ladies as expected. Hopefully, they too can be a little too short and perhaps a lovely boyfriend to snatch. <br /> <br /> 5. Clarice Lichmann's biography (which I think is not technically part of TLPS) hopes for all those women to see that they can one day win the Miss Chicago beauty patronage. (But there is enough money for juris to bribe them.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm so kidding Cloris to win the beautiful beauty, so? Check her bye and then we'll see who is the last smile. .) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which attracted the attention of Clarice Lichmann in our original, natural non-glory.
