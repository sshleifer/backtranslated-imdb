This movie was made to be created, so considering that, I will not work as hard as any feature film. The script is sub-par, but it succeeds in gently smiling at the spot, whether it should be or not. Acting is mostly the top, but it is true for low budget movies. <br /> <br /> The attitude of this movie that I really hated was 90-95% of the shot in the film, but in random places, the footage was shot on the video where 5-10 seconds were there. You can say that there is less diversity, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is definitely 24 frames per second, in 30 frames per second. It was not sure whether these scenes should be shot later and at that time they did not have the money in the film (I think for this reason, however, anyway, anyway), but it is disrespectful and really cleans up the film. <br /> < However, I certainly saw more bad movies, but I certainly would not say that I enjoyed this movie and I can not recommend anyone watching it.
