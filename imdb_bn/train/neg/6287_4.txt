I read about this movie in a magazine and I was plotting. A woman, who one day drives herself in her car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but not so. First, the title. Broken? Broken ... what? What is broken Oh, wait ... I get it, the title itself is "broken"! Wow, clever! Unfortunately, this is really the only thing that's going on for it. <br /> <br /> Its foundation is not bad, but I think that Kiefer Soodland has done a great deal of 'Mirror'. A cross between body graduation and mirror attacks, and that is rather a mediator. The more appropriate title will be 'boring', because it sets out every single scene for bloody ages. Or perhaps 'misleading', because it does not explain anything in description or story, bad copies and in some cases only some vague ideas, which are used in cheap fear and death in the scene, but nothing is not real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , I still feel unhappy, can be a little confused, and neither E.E.Po or Stephen King are in the way. Do yourself a favor, and do not watch this one. Simply put, there's a good thriller.
