Okay, the story does not give any sense, the characters lack a dimensionally lacking, the best conversation is the ad-film for the low-quality movie, the film's image is frustrating, and only the editing preserves some of the deviations, but Sam "Pekinpah does not run the film in any way, its direction This movie is frustrating for those who appreciate pecanpah and its great work <br /> <br /> The film's reaction is directed by San Pacinpah, James Kane, Robert Duval, Bart Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill and even Gig Young. Come up with their work. See this awesome world.
