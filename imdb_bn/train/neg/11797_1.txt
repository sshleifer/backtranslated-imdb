It was the biggest waste of my life while watching this movie and 2 taka for rent If there is no catastrophe before my death, it will be the biggest regret in my life. Who has ever thought about this movie, or is worthy of money, because they are thinking of creating this movie. It's about an overweight guy who is romantic in despair, and tries to pass the pass as a poem that inspires the drill that he wrote. She joined the friend in a trip to his beach. Where they meet the girls and where. Only fat guy will not get a girl. Skin flick does not bother me, I accept it for face value. But the film tries to be more than the sparkling skin of the film. It is looking for some Fat guy's love for girls, but then she meets Silicon Girl, another bikini who enjoys her poet. He invented his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and affects the woman, only he is his lady. The dialogue is too terrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereootypes, not a character development, it is a proud porn movie, without any porn in it. Never see this movie.
