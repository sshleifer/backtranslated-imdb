Little Mosque One of the most annoying CBC Comedy I have ever seen. They are the easiest way to easily create the simplest comedy programming for the agitated audience, which means 85 years of farmer in Saskatchewan. Curiosity is all expected and so death hair I can not believe it. The performance is very hammy and has been played, but I do not blame the actor because one kind of stereotyped character probably wants to know and claim CBC. The worst jokes were shown to be very controversial, but they were less controversial than the other annoying CBC curiosity, The Hour Yes 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Fars and Rick Mercer's report.
