This will be short. I must first inform myself that I am not particularly crazy about Nirvana and xtians, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary was a tone of some teenage anger for her xtian mother did not give angry video games. I just can not take it seriously. How did Charles Manson think that he was the Christ that represented the point that racism could breed evil? I did not know it was just cheap and boyish - the opposition felt unaware of the opposition. Moreover, the narrator was only a father-in-law and persuaded. The delivery was completely overkill. I can not take this documentary seriously. His drunken teenager could upload PC3D, because he did not allow him to play video games.
