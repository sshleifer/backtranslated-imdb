My friends and I went after 15 minutes, and we are not the first. Later, we tried to get our money back. The movie theater management does not allow it, but they allow us to see another movie. The only time for us to work for Dickie Roberts: The former child star. You can say, this is not a memorable night. Probably one of the worst movies of my night. I'd be second to close the second domestic hassle and saw a double headrest. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please do not see the order.
