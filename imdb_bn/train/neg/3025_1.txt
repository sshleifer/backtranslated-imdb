This picture is really bad ....... I really mean really bad. Tony Scott is an awesome director. Among the films he has made, I just like the enemy of the state, yet he is one of the worst directors of all time. Richard Kelly (Director of Donny DÃ¡rkor) has plotted this about which made me most anxious. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but he has learned his lessons hoping to be involved in this issue. <br /> <br /> Now I love Mikey Rouke's new role, but I do not like him for a terrible reason. The story and look at it. Do not make me mistake I still love Mickey Rouke but he has made some allegations during his time and it is one of them. I do not know what Kitty has to say about knightly, I think she's a little too imposing. I just can not feel in the picture for him. <br /> <br /> All of these pictures are bad. This is ......... 1/10 ....... J. D. Sitton
