Below the Earth / (2001) * (in fours) <br /> <br /> Black French: <br /> <br /> Such a confusing and amazing humorous story "Down to Earth" is based on Chris Rock standup -Comedy Act Scarves Like Heaven Speaking of Heaven, this film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait". It was a good film and it is good to show how a group of aspiring screenslines can take beautiful elements and it can turn into rubbish. Director Chris and Paul Wets miss every goal around. From the story of the concept, "down to earth" unfortunately fails; This is an incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a humorous standout comedian both in this movie and his role in real life. He manages Lance Burton, whose manager, (Frankie Fyson), even in the local theater, amused the person when he disappeared from the stage at night. Soon after the establishment of his lack of scripts in his talent, the character is killed by a dynamic truck. Death, played by Eugene Levi, made a mistake, took the lance before making up her number. God's Assistant (Chase Palmintry) is very angry and decided to make Lance the rest of his time on earth while accepting the only 60-year-old white millionaire company. <br /> <br /> Old man's name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has a relationship with her assistant (Gregg Gurney) who looted her money. But it's just as Mr. Lancing inside Wellington, a young man named Soni fell in love with a black woman. (Regina King.) Meanwhile, Lance, Lance is trying to get a good body to kill Wellington, and is facing the confusing feelings of Sony, about the circumstances surrounding the Wellington's hospitalization. <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a futile and helpless love story filled with surprises and recycled material. This is the biggest problem in which we see Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the popularity and actor with the promotion, so he is not going to be missing from most of this movie; All the characters see the new lance as Mr Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. Convenient for this love story; We believe that a young girl will fall for lance, but in reality, she is actually the old, gray-haired Giza. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the story goes through humor when letters conflict without their knowledge. Just see "There's something about Mary." Characters are open with strange experience in funny scenes and are not in their will. Here, Lance knows that she is in an old man's body and things do not normally do old men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The body does not know when we were originally like. To stop everything, Chris Rock will be concentrated here, and makes Rock-like characters too much. She recites the simple standup routine joke that is tedious and painful; His dialogue is so clear, wood and straightforward. I hate the ideas of sunny film. There are many strange jokes and horrible comic situations. It is Chris Rock, Chris Rock, who is not a character in a film. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the positive aspects of "Earth to Earth". Mark Eddy does not do anything worse than "Vivo Rock Vegas's Flintstones". Eugene Levi and Chase Polymerine cast well, but they have the mercy of a scalped script. All the good qualities I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to remember me, I probably will not be coming back.
