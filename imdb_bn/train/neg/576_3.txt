Hi folks <br /> <br /> forget that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as a credit executive producer. Van Joiv never played and never played and FX is a joke. <br /> <br /> The first vampire was good ... and it was the only vampire. This thing just got the same name here. <br /> <br /> Just seems to waste time <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Scorpio
