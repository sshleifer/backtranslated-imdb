Once I saw this movie I could not believe my eyes. Then there is no reason for blood and violence. Like other scary movies that were grave and it meant only killing the film's blood, gore, and each other. This film is not very interesting, there is no meaningful plot or story line, it is not an idea at all. Blood is very fake and overall this movie looks dumb, Do not waste your time even with it. It's an hour or two of ruthless violence. There are so many bloody scenes that are scary, but not just general rebellion. This is the worst horror movie I've ever seen out all the horror films that I've ever seen.
