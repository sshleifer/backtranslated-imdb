I rent this movie, it looks like it's a fantastic delightful historical piece. What I got was a piece of authentic trash. This movie was confusing to most of the spots, it is sticky in almost all places and terrifying among all the spots. Mira Sorvino was a best-depressing best illustration of a queen playing a young man scholar. Ben Kingsley should have snatched his knighthood to consider the film as one of his projects. Phoenia Shaw must be playing Petronia Darcele; At least Harry Potter films are more entertaining than the movie. This cinematography looks like a class in some college cinematography 101 and unfortunately fails. Almost every scene in the film is cut to some effect; Of course the end result is the cheesiest bit of editing I've ever seen. Jade Radan was almost as good as August; Too bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachel Sterling waits for her almost helpless lady Finally, I'm really willing to return the blockbuster video. I'm very glad I do not spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco at the theater. Since the 18th century they have been performing this Marivox game, it makes me amazed how many people were at their best graduation during this time of work. If I were there, they could not hear the game on Snowy. Thanks for the museum for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip past the annoying or horrific scenes. This means that I only saw the beginning and the end!
