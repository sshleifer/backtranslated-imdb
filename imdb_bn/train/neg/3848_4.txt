The victims of the murder of the film accused Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters are guilty of murder. After the trial, with dire prejudice, two women left the NY for California to open songs and dance studios for girls and girls in the temple. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, it has become clear that Reynolds had mistaken it with California's Winters. Winters plays a deeply religious women who seem to be moving off his rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters even worse, those who live together, got the phone calls on their minds. Reynolds, who puts on a blonde wig, is soon gripped by one of his student's wealthy father, nicely played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> <br /> One of her last movies, Agnes Moorehead is briefly seen, sister Alma, who is a trusted audience of Winters. <br /> <br /> This image is really related to Shell Winters. He started doing his work here heavy and heavy. Winterers have always worked well in testing their nerves. <br /> <br /> Can the last one forget about Vintor in Macbreir and Piano, with a completely insane look?
