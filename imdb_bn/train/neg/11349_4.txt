In fact, it was a false, Shake 3-D actually actually the first 3D animated movie. I bought it at DVD almost 3 years ago. Did the bug's life also be? I think it was in the tree design, so before I go there and use it as a logo. Also, there was a speed simulator in Shakek 3D Universal Studio. They should still consider it as a movie, it appeared a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least a little fly. I like IQ. I agree with the animator, they simply did an out-and-back adventure which has worked out a movie of something out of a movie. I recommend it to family and kids
