A Miss Call, Another Asian Awesome Based on Cell Phone I recently hired a Korean horror movie based on a cell phone called "Pon". One was annoying as one that missed the call. Maybe the phone is not just scary or anything, but this step was dull and shit. No excitement or thrills for me, and the final giant was frustrating cheesy and unscary. The film was dragged quite a bit in different parts, and was very much felt. I did not care. It seems like phones are tough to make horror, it's like trying to create a pop vending machine eerie And it's ridiculous to compare with "The Ring", it seems like every Asian movie has been compared to it, and so far I have not seen any measurements. Awesome Directors - Turn off the hook phone as a horoscope device.
