This rare, this annoying and this annoying film covers me rarely. It is without any doubt that I have ever seen the worst movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it is not confused with a confusing and silly shiny performance, is ridiculous. Why did the Damino become so worried-donkey difficult? Because when he was a child his gold fish had died, and this "panic" had scattered him mentally and hated everyone. When the dialogue is not clipped or ballast, it is associated with comedic lines: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else". At one point, some people of monster hunters are bound behind their bus, with a tattooed number in his arm. Due to a confusing mobile phone call, instead of reading his slip rolling and just reading the number, he closed his hand with a shotgun. On the other hand, demon hunters throw a bomb at a meeting organized by the mafia and do not threaten to stop the bomb until the mafia lets them go! Obviously going to the meeting was not very easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley has been helpless and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's earlier films, True Romance is one, but while enjoying this draw, I could remember that it could certainly be made by a complete fool.
