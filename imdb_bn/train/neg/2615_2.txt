I do not know why, but for some sick reasons, I think I've come to Disney Siegel, so I decided to go ahead and see 102 demulsions. Glenn Close, like Carlell D. Veil, appears to be a sure hit in the rebuilding of Disney Cartoon Classic, but it was just a bomb. I do not think why these movies do not work, because 101 Dalmatians, the original was a cartoon, it did just fine and was more attractive for the kids as well as adults. It was not really funny because it is trying to act like cartoons rather than real people, I have come to realize that they are trying to ensure that the children are appealing, but in the mockery of how these actors behave. And the story of 102 Dalmation is not really good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />! But his reputation is now damaged as a puppy, but he bought a man's dog shelter and everyone suddenly loved everyone and it seems that he has changed. But when he sees his probation officer's dalmatian, he becomes mad and starts to see the scars, and he loses it. She returned for a revenge for the puppy and she is convinced to get the dammation quote that she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Chloe is an extraordinary actress who has received very few ratings, but she's taking the crew, she's good, but let's face it, this movie makes funny villains only in a fool-nut case. Also, as beautiful as a dog, it works even more for animation, it seems stupid, but it is not as reliable as the combination of cartoon and their personality. I do not really recommend 102 Dammalas, okay, but if you agree that the first movie was only wasted time, it is the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
