All right, let's see now. Was the first movie fun? I know, people with funny accents, people fall into the water, crude boat crashes and funny comments in between two groups. In this movie, they did not have access to the upper part, no good. Many people are pouring water for uncertain reasons, there is no good. Boats, check. Funny comments among the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, the personality they follow in this film is also there. Is not this picture happening on the water, not the land? I'm sorry that far away from the fun part and the film sponsors are most exploited. Not good Everything, I have some interesting part since I give ten to four.
