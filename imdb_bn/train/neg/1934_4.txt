Following the general formula for a new recruitment - at this time, the African-American (Cuba Gooding) President Truman separates the Armed Forces - through the US Navy's deep sea diver training program, which is a racist johhot (Robert DeNiro). If the program is not bad enough, it should be located in New Jersey Bayonne. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performance. Robert De Niro activates his southern activation and screams out loud. Cuba gooding, raised by a harsh father as a poor black farm boy in the south, is the expected pollen of precision. Girls - No one can call their women - Charges Theron and Lonat Mackay They have minor roles and they mostly argue that their men should apply common sense. Other decent actors - Power booths and Hal Halbrook - have even more sophisticated role. <br /> <br /> About it. Almost everything can be combined by computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro home salute, open. After the brutal assault on the staff of the hospital, he was transferred from his or her outfit instead of barbarism. Some shouted, "I am here" in the early 1950's. (Perhaps it was a common expression at the time.) If so, "I am bad.") They address each other in the army, "Lieutenant", "Boatswein's Mate", "Commander". Navy is restrained by the simple "Mr." (if an officer) or their last name (if listed). I was not bothered to check whether there was a term titled "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> There is a hard row of Cuba Gooding. It seems that all the Navy hates Negroes without a single person in Wisconsin. He stutters and his class is held contempt by others. This is like the scene of "animal resources", where a relative's brother is asked to wait for a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a dungeon. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a listed man, the second-tier officer of the second class. She married a beautiful woman, who graduated from the medical school only. One of their arguments he pleads with her. She just wanted to be a doctor and she had to join her, have to move away from the Navy and live a quiet life. "And just let life pass by you?", He retorts. Yes Yes, just be a doctor's wife and let life pass you. You can enter it from the gothic golf course. <br /> <br /> Such flickers were common in World War II. "Bombardier," "Airy Gunner," that sort of thing. They often were as cheap, they had some educational features. You've learned something about being a bomb attack or a gunman. Here, the technical details have been omitted, perhaps the author did not know anything about them (except for Boyle Law, which we learned from high school Chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what was happening sometime. There is no state of emergency without any such film. I guess I correctly because I got the right to the mechanical problem. There is no help in the direction. The film can be lost in a lot of close ups, which they can have any dramatic effects. And emergency situations are confusing because they are sick. <br /> <br /> Why? Want to see a good example of this kind of movie? Almost everyone - probably "GI Jane", in which heroes abusing heroes Try training camp scenes in "Young Lions". The victim is a Jew. Or try "eternity from here", in which no easy sympathy button is pushed, and the victim is an old man who denies conflict and is able to bring conflict, such as "Cool Hand Look". Easy excuses are very easy because no easy excuse is given. <br /> <br /> is completely formula, and not good.
