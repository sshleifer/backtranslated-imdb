Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This Sunday afternoon came at 3:00 and I could not believe what they saw. Thanks to God, I was frustrated if my son was outdoors or looking after soft / medium porn! Are the people who make the film not concerned about whether they are criminals or corrupt? Can the children be watching after church and that they show ??? !!! The performance was good and I enjoyed the mystery but the GEE! There were violence and bad guys but it would be expected in a western film. His role in Randy Travis was really good. Writer, director and producers want to become so straitened for sexual scenes. What will they get out of that direction? Where can I complain?
