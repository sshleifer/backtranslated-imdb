Seriously - avoid any cost to this movie. I just saw this my first "sneak preview" and although I paid non-refundable for it, I just left the movie after 15 minutes. Which will not have to be included in my 2 minutes discussion among my friends already. The first time I got out of the movie. And I lived through some pretty bad things. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has been dubbed (and badly) though it has been shown in its original language. It depends on the oldest, most simple and humorous joke of the book. The military ("What do we do after reaching the battlefield?" - "You get out of the car and die"); In fact, the way it is distributed in the film, it is much more fun to read here), drugs (a guy uses some "space cookie" Eats, really stupid and does not remember or miss more than his marriage - all badly written and performed), women in the army ("Why we Rubel will trumpet our guns were promised! "-" It's the way it will be done ") ... Argh. All right, you can actually find this really ridiculous, but in that case you'll be horrified to me. <br /> <br /> I also saw good acting on soft pornographic films you received on TV late in the night on TV. So it was the joke of the hair (poorly distributed), low average performance, lack of speed, was badly dubbed and edited ?? It just did not work. At least not a level movie is used as a measurement. <br /> <br /> I said that this glance proves that there are people who can be very funny ji j German. And if you like something stereotypes like saying something (Which I do not do, but I like to play with them, even if someone thinks that I am not a PC) <br /> <br /> Instead of looking at this picture, do something useful. Try to teach crotch to the butterfly, really paint your tannels in your annoying color, separate your bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, go back to different religions - actually, go and "last Christmas" by ham! Continuous repeat over. Do not see anything, but this terrible flick.
