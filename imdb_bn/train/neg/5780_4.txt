I really wanted to like this movie and saw it all the way through thinking better. Do not make me wrong, it is not the worst flash ever, but it never ends till its feasibility. The foundation is good, Cast is superb (I was especially pumped to get back David Knut) and love God, you can talk about their best efforts. It just fell short on and over again. "Brutal Hasakre" should serve as a constant reminder of filmmakers that Christopher's guest can do Christopher guest movies and, although it can make it easy, you should try to do so. Noughton and Brian O'Haleran are fantastic about this topic and they should see more often ... because they get 4 to me because they get. If you are going to get the "Spin Tap" of horror, but doubt that you want the guy who has created "spine tap", to help it ... just to think deeply there.
