The dialogue was quite horrible. The plot does not actually inspire beyond the clear twist that it represents. Visible is not stunning. At times apparently annoying. If you keep one finger on the fast forward button, you can definitely finish one of these movies. If you can see it for free, there is absolutely no other option at the moment and you are really digging to see a little poultrystist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you, but no one else will be able to think at this moment.
