I'm a huge fan of David Lynch. But this picture was quite frustrating. As well as from family music ?? Which really sets the mood of the film ?? I lack almost all the qualities to join Lynch's work. Visuals are less, at least, and the dialog is ambiguous and unified for individual interest. <br /> <br /> It works like a film student, and trying to film a movie with a painstaking act. An experienced director I've seen many cameras-work, scenery, sounds and many amateur movies including scripts. This film lacks almost all the artistic qualities. I think seeing one of Davids' home videos, though, was produced during some weekends with some friends.
