It is almost time we see a movie that is biased towards this old Indian tradition. Most of the 'doctor' Cherlans make it clear that they are lying about how they do not charge their clients. They are wearing their gold watch, 'donation' box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a few people who are getting 'healing' in a number of cases. <br /> <br /> Remember that the onion that is toxic is not poisonous and the lowest Indian bank note 5. Rupees, Average salary in India is 1,700 Russian / Month.
