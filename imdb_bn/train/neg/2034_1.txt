Really, really bad. How is this made of a bad film? I'm waiting for some plumbing points, interesting camera work, or at least some void nudity but I got nothing. I just saw the cabin footer and I thought it was a train debris (without nudity and pancake) but it seems to be brilliant than this draw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I'm just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Esse! I am very happy that I only paid 5 dollars for it and soon it will end in land land.
