Underground comedy film is probably one of the worst comedy I've ever seen. I should know that it is going to get worse when the box was written on "sure confirmation" ... that filmmakers are going to pay more attention to earning more than you laugh. <br /> <br> This movie is an amateur entertainment of childhood squiles, bad characters and bad jokes ... from the painful bat-man sketch of the painful unwanted Arnold Shevolenpicker skate, they're not just funny. A little funny skit that is very low and far away - Mitchell plays a gay maiden at Clark Duncan, for example - but they go on for a long time and get rid of the dishonesty of the Vince Offer in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep underground comedy movie underground ... kill it!
