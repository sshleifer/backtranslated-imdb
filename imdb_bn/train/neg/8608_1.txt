This movie has two favorite actors in Kilmer and Donny. It boasts always enjoyable Larry Miller in a very small part. Despite this I found it almost unwatchable. Michelle Monaghan may be nice, but she is almost free of costumes and is not understood in terms of the story of the film's presentation or how it depicts Doni's emotional character with her character. The last seems to be scary and although the intention seems to involve the audience and Vinich film, but unable to bring us to the side of our hero, we are reluctant or unable to do this. The film's supporters say that those who disagree easily "do not get it" I do not think so at this. The plot was not complex or beyond understanding. It was simply uninvolving and clumsily and probably created. I did not like it. "I just did not like it." Poor "" I Went Down "and Guy Ritchie's" Snatch "and" Locks, Stocks and Two Smoking Barrels "are a very good example of filmmakers who fail to achieve the director Shane Black <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but I do not have any relation with her credits (mostly as a screenwriter) Who wants to disassociate himself from a connection.
