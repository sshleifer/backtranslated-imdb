This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it in the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew very little about John Lennon and even said in the premiere. This is a drama, but people were happy all the time, how much was the film Chessi. That's not a good sign. Dominic Monghan and Jason Leonard were the only preserved Greece as the roommates / bandmates of the Levine. They were funny, the rest of the movie was thought very seriously. The delicious drop of the Beatles song was just weird. The soundtrack was fantastic, but was probably the best part of the film. Unless you are one of those crazy, intense Dominican monaghan fans, do not get annoyed at all.
