"Houseboat Horror" is often made and described as the worst Australian film, which has been described as a general slash film, which can be seen in the 'Watch a movie that can not get the Academy Award'. An underground disco band member started to die slash while trying to shoot a music video in a remote lake in Australian Outback burned while killing the deadly mortality. Slashar flick is composed and written in writing with void and annoying characters. It certainly distributes the Goro: Head with head is divided into half, beef is cut and a woman is killed with a rider. If you like Chess Smashar, you can try it but you have been warned. At least it's "better" than Swedish. 4 out of 10
