"CIA Codex: Alexa" is a completely awesome rip of "Lo Femin Nikita" (1990), by Lus Bean's classic film "La Fame." This movie is basically a woman who is trained and trained by the CIA and has a secret mission to do. (Mostly the same structure as the framework of the same story), Lorenzo Lama and O.J. Acting combo Simpson is probably the worst movie history. Lamas' "acting" simply a bad Steven Segal disguise. This is an extraordinary experience of viewing the Orenthal Act in this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in this movie is so poor that it is ridiculous. There are many action movies "Conventions" in the movie which are ridiculous: flying people through unnecessary car explosions, glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytail etc. Music Score is similar to David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990). Which brings forth Steven Segal's theme in this movie. The film has lots of martial arts and it is good for American production of low budget. Do not give up on stupid action and top acting, and I must admit I was gently entertaining. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lama had an action star in the early 90's but she is not an action star, so she is sub-operations and not action blockbuster. I recommend that you skip "CIA code name: Alexa" and instead check "Nikita" in La Fame.
