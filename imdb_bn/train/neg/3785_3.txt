Talk like a real tough high ganga. The story is not worse than a gangster flickr, but sometimes does not confuse the movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas.

I was looking forward to seeing Abraham and Loggia, but their steenky flirt spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Ah, this script is not too hot. Don Corleone will disappear after five minutes to meet him, patting him behind the sunny and all the time.
