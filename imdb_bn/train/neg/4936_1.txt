I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. It will be the worst new show. If they give a reward that shows that this suction should sweep in a section. The acting is poor and storyline is concreved. Now the dinosaurs were a bit diverse but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons of the show and finally scraped. This new show based on an insurance company commercial, is not funny and is really nothing going for it. Probably the original advertisement and how often they are repeated, and still, what is wrong with this show? It just came to the TV and we are already tired of seeing the "cave" character.
