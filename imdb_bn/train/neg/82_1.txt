This movie sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The act was torture, the plot was completely impossible. Long, short story short, these people become "terrorists" by this cruel "mad killers", but they fail to fight completely. And it's not a gear on camping trip, and is already seen on campusite and is fully stocked with food and clothes and the girls' headphones. In addition, after missing their boat, they are afraid that they are trapped in the jungle, but then they show lover of girls and they do not apparently ever consider that they can grow even more like wood to them. I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Your girlfriend does not talk to you about seeing it.
