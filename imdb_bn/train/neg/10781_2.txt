Actually, it was not. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to revive the 1940s sculble comedy. What an empty shambles! None of these come near Kerry Grant, Spencer Tracy, Catherine Hepburn, and however, today's audience is not acceptable as this great mack. Writing is trivial Hackneyed plot razor is thin and obvious. Chemistry in leading characters existed Julia Roberts believes that she is a rising star from "the golden age of Hollywood" when it seems that it can be a resurgence. It's the failure of the failure of the runner's brush to succeed again with Richard Gere.
