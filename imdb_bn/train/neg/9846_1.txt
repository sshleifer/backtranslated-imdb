You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Selsar is present in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most stupid films ever made. I look forward to some interesting events, but I have not seen anything interesting in this movie. Even the film industry acknowledged that it was a very weak film and even tried to promote it. This is a wonderful thing that it was ever put into the video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of deal was made by vendors due to this type of movie. I was surprised why people responsible for this movie were allowed to create other bad movies. Certainly this film was a waste of the money used to make it, and its time wasted while watching. Certainly high school students who are able to write / produce a film as a plot.
