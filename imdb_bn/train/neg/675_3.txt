City girl Meg Tilly received a scary phone call from her mother and realized that her family's hometown was back home, only one mystery could be encountered: Why are all the residents living in strange and uncertain ways? In reality, living in the small town of Radiation Thriller in real life with realistic environment, (laughingly) looking at each other with the desire of the public, and team mathasan received oral attention from the girl in an office bench. The picture is too stupid for the word, it is likely that it can not possibly be withdrawn by the intensity of the tilly and the quiet intensity of the trash when compelled yourself to the corner. Thomas Dorth Ruth's cinematography is some good (especially set in the order of a fire inside a garage), though he is frustrated by scrapie editing - and a fairly painful finish. Simple screenplay is a wonder that nary does not have a wrapped up roots on its elemental roots. * **** to 1/2
