Due to the casting of Cannes and Danes, I have seen the movie "The Flock" and the summary of the story seems interesting. It was one of the longest films I've ever seen (and I saw some Turkey.) I have never posted before online, but the movie was so horrible that I had to do it. I think the problem started with the script, which was so incredible to be incredible. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so annoying it's annoying. Poor Gere, he deserved much better. Due to horrible writing, for screen matching / dancing, the character does not believe for a single minute. I want to tell Geyer goodbye that something that could go back negative, was possible. I am not ashamed to see the talent looks so bad, I did not mention that I could come back two hours ago. (I know what you think I'm really feeling?)
