This Italian film is essentially a soap opera with skin. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Modernity gives a lot of knowledge because there is a small scene at the end which is frustrating. Even in the dark, you can show all the sexuality of this person to Dutch actress Mercedes Determes - and yes, you can see her sex in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time that the "main line actress" did such a thing on the screen. <br /> <br /> The detectors were walking around the nude on different scenes, but his face was better than his body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly .... A real waste of time and of course is not recommended despite the appearance of Determers.
