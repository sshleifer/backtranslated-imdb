This apocalypse jumbo film tries to be harmful and disgusting; But walking on the street, like the dead body of several dead bodies, becomes paralyzed to eat meat. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as Lazar Virus is being played by government-run newspaper and television stations. Some of the brave people in Channel 5 TV News, but the fool, the spirit feels that his audience gave false hopes and no real danger. An interested reporter (Rachel Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of Military Operations (Patrick Cohen), risks presenting a 'live' broadcast to show the risk of life and organ. Do yourself a favor and do not see. This thing definitely comes across with a very low budget and a high school game seems to have gone bad. Acting is harmful and harmful about meat hungry zombies. Also included are: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. Massage feeding should be hungry.
