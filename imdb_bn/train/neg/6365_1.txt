Wow, I knew this film is going to be bad but this is not bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, his son, the Armed Forces returned from "Special Occasions" and because he "sees things" - mentioning something about his past, his teeth are being painted down and painted. One time when cleaning a piper and his dead son (who killed a bad boy) and his son, while cleaning the other people's streets. <br /> <br /> Oh, the interest of love is that there is no reason that a good young woman who decides that she wants to lap a former army explosion bone. It occurs within about 2 minutes of 1 scene. <br /> <br /> This movie can save this movie but it's worse than story and acting. It has been done all before, it has all been much better (a main example of the Oong-Buck). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I saw Waterwork twice. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is HORR (spelling mistakes for the US) and the tag line "Builds on Bluetooth and Kickboxer" - see director David Worth's other films and you can quickly understand why they are 10 Why do they keep these two movies even though they are older? These classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megglondon" - it's really true. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this picture, I'll give you Â£ 10. <br /> <br /> - apologies for not knowing the name of the character, even though you say something.
