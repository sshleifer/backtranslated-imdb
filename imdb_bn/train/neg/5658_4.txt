"Smiley, Clown Hash", released in 1928, titled Legendary Lone Chanie, a circus couple named Tito. Tito has raised an adult (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) and named her Simonet. She has raised the girl in circus life, and she has become a successful balirina. Although Chaney gives his usual superb performance, so, at the middle of the middle of nowadays, Simontet has the hots for the youth. Although he is not his biological father, he has raised him as a girl. That kind of "ick" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes with the love of Samantar with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Neil Asther). The symantates are definitely for the young, but feel guilty about abandoning Tito (outside of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole court of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito that she is a stupid fool (until she expresses herself). This film is notable only for Loretta Young, who will be going to build a great career. Although I found the brightness of Chanir as the actor, this whole film seemed to me and was just amazingly vague.
