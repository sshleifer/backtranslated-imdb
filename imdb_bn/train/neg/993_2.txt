I'm going to write about this movie and I'm going to write about "unbroken" (in this) famous scene. If you do not see the movie yet, you will be warned. This is my thought, why do I think the movie fails (ultimately - deliberately). <br /> <br /> According to the roles, Rogerio Dawson is really good and portrayed by a man about a decade old). The villain is good, but at the end his "bad" loses touch. If he does not really change why would he close up a woman? She did not have time, Then we have the Burter / 2nd Rape Dude. Actually I do not need you to do it. Not at least for second rape, but more about that later. Let's republish the story of <br /> <br />. The role of Rosario can be sexually insecure, even lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). This was not deliberate, like Rosario himself, but they have sexual tension. Rosario's character fills a person who is a sexual predator among all the bad senses. But he made an impression on her. <br /> <br /> Rosario commented on a boyfriend before his comments. I want to be different. Because she works, as she is her first boyfriend, who also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother, here's another problem. After the first rape, Rosario did not tell the story of what happened. His relationship with his mother seems very intimate, nothing is discovered after him. If Rosario's character does not call his soil again or will behave astonishing, then the mother will be worried by crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend: We see her in the party, it is clear that there is something going on and "Boom" she has gone. <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost intolerable to see. But think like a pinch, when you compare it to the end (rape), which seems like you get hit with a sledge hammer! Not after rape. 1 We find the very expanded view. Thread is opened (such as its construction work is a hint that he may be gay, as if a man tried to hit him ...), but left open. No real social contact is established, if you leave the Bartender guy, who is involved in the second and last rape scene. It is clear that he is a "beautiful" guy and fleshed out a bit of his character. But when Rosario's character is again merged with the class, then his film seems meaningless. We found the point that Rosario was not the same as the character, he "went bad" and was able to hit the man. (Too many scenes are just that, except his passion, doing drugs and other things only). Rapaport # 1, who cheated by testing, they were caught by Rosario's character and they decided to hang out again (actually?). That sounds like stupid, the man met him, we did not see him before, with another girl (probably he raped him, although we did not see it fortunately) and his football career Good career is a stretch and he is bullied. It's an attempt to give some depth to its character and it works around, but it's very close to being with you again. So the Rapist submits # 1 Rosario letter ... Why exactly? Because he promised, had his day? Again, really? Such a person never lose control, especially the woman with whom he was raped before ... I guess he is stupid to us. Bartender worked like a man who could hit him or her something, but letting him submit it, it seems just wrong. Another possibility is that his drink has a drug. <br /> <br /> So get rapist # 1 undresses and blindfolded and Rosario's character tie him on a bed ...., that's just crazy! But what comes up goes even crazier. At first he talked to him, then he "shut him down" and imposed a thing in him. This rape scenario is difficult to see as one. Not only is this guy eligible, it is only intense. And of course that they were aiming. Now after he "completed" Bartender came and raped ... rapist # 1. If it really should work as a revenge movie, then Rosario's character is doing all "revenge" itself, then it was good. A Hechenchenman is working, everything that was built is taken away. <br /> <br /> It seems not to be entertaining / enjoyable, it is a solid clock and it is an art house. But 10 minutes (I did not count) Finally the rape scene, everything was shocked. Rosarios character is watching more or less, only what is happening. Which brought me the biggest disappointment. <br /> <br /> Exaggeration: The scene of "irreversible" rape, but the movie continued (even back to back). Rosario is finally looking into the camera and says something about having to get over this. First of all, it is too late, which she calls after initial rape. And secondly and most importantly, the Art-house film should come from here. It was also more interesting that Rosario's character would follow the second rape scene and how he would deal with it. But then again, he did not physically do it (see above) ... a broken letter cut off the movie ... <br /> <br /> Good intent (worked before Talia and Rosario) but fail to publish most things They (if they mean they can understand what they mean, otherwise it will not work) even ... they do not mention the big rape scenes ...
