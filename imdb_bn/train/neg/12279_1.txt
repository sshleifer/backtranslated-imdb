Although it seems like an old show (2002), I saw my first episode last night and I have been told it will be the worst show. . . <br /> <br /> I'm not the one to comment but I was so shocked that there might be a show that tries to fold slowly, and I only think that it's millions of visitors, young people under the age of 12 Or less people than average IQ <br /> <br /> There are many controversial story lines on the last night of the event I have organized, every potential plot is imaginative and tried to include all of the time while trying to promote friendship, family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The basic story they covered in episode: The Fraser House hedge has made a mistake with too much alcohol - Death wants Senator to be a boy, who wants to investigate the FBI. Death is actually the killer by peanut allergy. Senator thinks that it can be the best friend of his sworn enemy and childhood, because the senator was taking money to vote for his vote, but finally got conscience and 'no' means the meaning of the militarian. All are suspects but everyone is alibi (former girlfriend student lied to a false married teacher, disgraced a false student, who actually experienced life changing, Senator enemies did not pay a cruel student to kill an enemy enemy, he freely gives money to broken students). All the time, the heroine of this drubbing has kept her nephew 'at that age' and is lying on the boy, who finally got the courage to talk with her aunt, but only saying that she is not good enough for dumping her and she wants to stay with him Pushing. Do not worry, he returned with the child after learning about the truth and the life 'in' girls throw him, ayantio explains that God is the only One who can truly (and I was sick this time around) <br /> <br / > <br /> This play is even better when Su and his FBI team finds the murderer. . . You will laugh at this, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> এটি ফ্র্যাটের ছেলেদের মধ্যে একজন, যিনি এক বছর আগে আবিষ্কার করেছিলেন যে তিনি গৃহীত হয়েছিল এবং তার আসল বাবা একজন আন্তর্জাতিক সন্ত্রাসী এবং তিনি ছেলেকে হত্যা করে এবং অন্ত্যেষ্টিক্রিয়া শেষে বোমা লাগিয়ে প্রকৃত বাবাকে চিত্তাকর্ষক করার চেষ্টা করছেন । . . . . . . /> <br /> The cardboard characters <br, acting is a continuation of cardboard, cardboard cardboard story, saying that anyone who loves this show /> <br /> This is the writer for the brain cardboard why there <br? The show tries to pack up every incident of the event, which means they do not explicitly believe in character development or the power of actors to carry a common plot line. This show was shown as 'Last Action Hero', Arne chooses her tooth, killing 5000 people, besides Arnie, a good actor (Wow, never thought that would be the day I would say !!) <br /> Simpson's favorite character is a comic book man. . . . <br /> <br /> Best TV Shows . . . . Never
