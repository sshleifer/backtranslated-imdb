Somewhere nearby is real. It is bringing something new to the story of quite accurate copies. But the instruction is very poor. Basinger weak - without good instructions. Compared to McQueen, only one second league is Beldwin. I just saw it from curiosity, as the greatest fan of Packinpah, and I got what I thought. Nearly a B movie with the second rate of acting and directing. I was not even frustrated, I just do not know what they're trying to do. This does not try to play with the repetition of the original element, it is not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actors in its era. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of a bad Xerox copy of amazing photographs. <<br /> <br /> It's a waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or see the original (again :))
