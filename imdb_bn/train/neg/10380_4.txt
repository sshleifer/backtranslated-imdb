I do not think anyone who is sitting in to watch this movie would expect something like a classic ghost story, but if you were ever scared you would have to finish it. It does not really work on that level, but Cast tried hard and the film did not work in any of those happy endings. The story is about American American couple who traveled to Kyoto in Japan, so Ted Flurer (Edward Albert) could write a book and he brought along with his wife Laurea (Susan George) and their daughter Emmy (Emmy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) helps those who work at the American consulate to live a house and finds that he is a haunted. Almost 140 years ago, a Samurai saw his wife cheating on the same house and he killed both of them and then committed suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when Flatter arrives, strange things do not take much time before it starts happening. <br /> <br /> ***** Spylar Alert ***** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes the demons live in Fletcher's body and start working like the Japanese people, and Laura Alex begins to have skin disease. Lead a matter. Meanwhile, Ted started to behave more rigorously and after dropping the soup down the Amy's throat he went to ask a monk to help. Unfortunately for the demons, Ted, Laura and Alex were seen to play their death scenes 140 years ago, <br /> <br /> This picture was directed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good television director but he Before creating horror and science fiction films and some of them had worked with McClure. Although it does not come near scary or developing environments, it has two things in it. First of all, there is none of these naughty endings where couples embrace after defeating the monster. Instead, it ends in a very bloody war, where everyone lean towards the demons' temple. Secondly, it is Susan George throwing! Although he was mostly present in Skilak, I was always his fan, but his performance is always the most authentic. He also plays here in two separate scenes which seems to be nude and when he does not have classic features, he has a unique pose like that and why it was so popular was one reason. But after appearing in such stupid movies I think it is coming out of the business or just working in disguise. This is not a bad film, but it is never believable, and when the monks give an abstraction, they almost roam around in ghosts. The bottom line is this silly and I decide to resume his career in George.
