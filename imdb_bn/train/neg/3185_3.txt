This movie was just hacked by MST3K and for good reason. First and foremost because it is a "Cop" movie starring Joe Dawn Baker, we all know that Michael Jackson as a police actress is a native West singer. <br /> <br /> All the ordinary police movie plot devices behind their bad heads, bar fights, shoot out children's bomb, bad acting, lama police chief, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless gangsters, and of course, bad acting. Do not see it without a MST3K filter folks.
