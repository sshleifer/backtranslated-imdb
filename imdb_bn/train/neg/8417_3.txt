Any fan of broadway games is as much as possible, as well as expected to release the film. I wait and read the review for the month of award winning performance. I am speaking with the power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Fox, Baines Nolis, Danny Glover ... this movie can not be 4 or less than 4, is not it? Wrong! I was frustrated by the products I am sure. The film did not match the publicity of the publicity and was the only archive of Eddie Morphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hodson. <br /> <br /> When Eddie Morphy James Brownesc performs this hit, the film recovers and forces the lulls and Jennifer Hodson to pay attention to the screen every time. The only time I was able to perform "I'm Aam Telling You" was that I felt that the promotion was worthwhile. Cringed to you as you allege no good man for him in his party and in his life. Many critics have said that he stole the movie from more experienced actors and was able to achieve the achievements of this performance. Anika Noni Rose had a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jamie Fox and Biance Knolls travel through their performances. Fox's performance skills for this film predicts his remarkable "judgment" performance, and Beyonce Knowles raises an enhanced fashion photo shoot or video, raises his way through the film and tricks Its performance was not strong enough to care for your character at any time in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie was very popular, 30 minutes and 1 song (the "heartbreaking" of the biennial "Junkie Fox" alone) is very long <br /> <br /> Dr. - Vancouver, WA
