All right, I like B movie ... I know what movies should be represented. But this is just awful. I am surprised that it got a decent overall score. This membrane is the only reducing properties (mostly) marginal splatter effects. Do not blame me, this has risen heavily in the flash - but some of my effects really leaned toward me (like the rectangle "probe" ... which was great!). <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was pictured on a camcorder. Common - At least a hike, I have seen pornography with good production quality (and well played). <br /> <br /> acting - suck! But tromba or flower is not on the moon sorting. <br /> <br /> Story - Transformed! But that's what you get from the movie like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> My 16 year old brother makes Halloween a more broad set for our home. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - sucked! Terrible voice acting (I can not even speak) and all other words "S ** t" or "F ** K". <br /> <br /> There are many good classic and B ratings flawless / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track. Do not do yourself a favor without spoiling this bad time!
