Exactly what you would expect from a B-movie. Derivative, gratuitous nudity, part-boring, ridiculous grape and sugar special effects. Of course it can be good, well played (defintly) good writing, guided, etc. But then I guess it was not a B movie. The actor sucked quite a bit, indeed this seems like an episode of calf vampire slayer or something other than most blood, atrocity and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be singled out. She is the queen of the whole new millennium screaming. Acting in this movie is not really important, but he was better than any other actor. He is also hot smoky, plastic jumbo suit that he wore for the whole movie - Wow! Her next venture is absolutely stunning in that, I can help her turn it around every single time but mean her check out. And at the end of the film, the viewer was fully rewarded seeing Nikk. <br /> <br /> So if you have an isolated B-movie Horror Buff (like me), check it out. If not, you should probably avoid all costs.
