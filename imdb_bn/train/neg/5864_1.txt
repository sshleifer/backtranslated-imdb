I'm sure that it was the worst movie ever made. If you do not laugh a 13-year-old boy with a stupid smile, you can leave the comedy forever. Unfortunately the Joan River is differently selected. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them racist) and very funny joke Particularly memorable scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit is dead and he is pregnant (I can not believe it, that it was actually a movie scene). The man pushed a dead rabbit on the doctor's table and tried to face face. ROTFLMAO! No! "I knew I was at the top of the punch line that could tell you what's bad about this movie." Haha haha ​​hah ha ..........
