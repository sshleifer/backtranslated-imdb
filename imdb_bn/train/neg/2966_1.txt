I do not understand all the hype about this movie. All right, if you like cheap Split, you would love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not see it. Personally I do not really like the actor of this movie, they are hiring a straight road. The dialog is completely flat and you always know what's coming next. The overall quality of this film is very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all thought that this film was made by some people who wanted to do this work, to graduate only to a film school - with minimal effort. Another thing that really reduces the whole experience is that bad cam (very vibration) and bad sound, seems to be reinstated by the whole movie with a single microphone.
