I look back at the release of the movie's first theater, right in the theater. Do not believe it after watching the film for decades, it's still stick in my mind as the worst movie of all time; Or at least the worst that I will allow myself to see. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the first shock of unbelief, we laugh for a while because every scene hit new people. But after a while, even woke off that suspicious pleasure and it got to be really really sad.
