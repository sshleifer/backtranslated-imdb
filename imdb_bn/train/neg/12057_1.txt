Charles Birston continued his frustration of 80, which probably could not be his worst movie of the decade. In this he plays a detective who has kidnapped an Asian girl and is now going to a huge length to track a pimpa that is selling him at the highest door. It's an embarrassing endeavor of action and probably probably the most boring movie ever made. Many think Death Wish Seagels Brunson's worst movie. Death Wish Seagels are not great movies, but are mostly made and very visible. Kinjite is a completely dull thriller which is punctuated by intermittent racism and child temptation. It's really a refrenable film and it's all bad that it tries to promote a "law and justice" mentality which is saying really nothing really bad. Indeed, this movie starts with Underwood sex with Broonjon and then rape brutally with Pododifil with a Dido. In the Chicago theater, I saw this gas only in the pain of this scene, in this film, the victim is victimized only by the rape victim's pain. It does not have any other point than exploitation, and in fact it is not written well enough to rise above the level of exploitation and supply something that works well enough. Bronson seems more in things but is clearly very unfavorable to save up to this. I want to think that Charles Branson is never the best actor, but this effort is his worst. Action sequences are also poor. <br /> <br /> between 1/2 * 4-- (terrible)
