This is a UK version of the show which is less outstanding than the US version. The concerned person will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and they are thankful for what they've got. The American version of this event is reality TV which should not be. Instead of improving the house, residents can not afford or the whole room can not be rebuilt themselves. I do not know if this show is trying to show whether there is a lazy welfare system in the US, or if you work hard enough, you will get it. Especially performed by Sears, rather, rather bad product placements, are also unsalled for. Instead of protecting a family of potential millionaires from the deprived areas, the family will be better than helping the whole family, instead of spending thousands of dollars in one home, create something for the whole community ... Perhaps a place where DIY and power equipment can be borrowed And can be returned with building materials so that everyone can benefit. This can cause a lot of resentment among the residuals of the local community, who still live in the same Rand House.
