The first one was different and funny. This effort should not have left the studio. This movie does not make you smile. It's a humble attempt to humor fairly. Exposes current and old movies on mobile phones. This time jokes seem to be used and overdone. The audience that I saw it only played the Hanib dinner scene and was otherwise sleeping.
