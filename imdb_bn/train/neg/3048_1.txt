Santa Claus is perhaps committed to any media, perhaps it's a book, a photo, or a movie. Santa looks like a parow that observes children, and isolated story to help Marilyn to defeat Satan's smallest loss, pitch, which does not do anything well. It is ridiculous to say with the worst effect of the 1959 criteria. If a child sees this movie, then he sees the nightmares and never wants to show Santa. They will be scarred for life. Imagine the children "a Christmas story" when Santa began crying after holding the fold. How to see if kids see this movie.
