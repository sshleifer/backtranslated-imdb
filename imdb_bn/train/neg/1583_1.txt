I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I like running man. So perhaps I was very excited that anyone made a movie of it. And when showing a local network film, I was in heaven. I was ready for a fun night <br /> <br /> The first indicator was something wrong when I noticed that someone threw Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man famous for the film 'A' shooter 'A' could play a more intelligent part as described in the book. I was still sure that this would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some secret talent? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I soon learned that he had no reason to be of anyone to some of his or her friends. Yup, it was an ideal Arnold-film: The hero has gone wrong, the hero solves the problem by flexing his powerful muscles and scars away all and gets the hero girl. <br /> <br /> I was surprised. This book does not say at all. I know that books can not be literally on the screen, but there was no relationship with the book. Stephen King must have had to look for any relationship with the film and he should have been banned by using the title of the title of the title for this shameless film. I do not say often, but this image is BAD. If I was not at home, I would have tomatoes throw the tomato on the screen. Again: Bad. (Remember that I've used 'somebody' much, I did it because I'm sure many people are ashamed to do this work and I do not want them to be named their shame even more)
