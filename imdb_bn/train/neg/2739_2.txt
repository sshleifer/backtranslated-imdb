I have no idea what this shot was but you can certainly say that they have no budget. Bad acting, awesome cinematography, and lunatic plot and some decent special effects do not have a good movie. WFF style cinemagery will cry to you ... Where is the tripped? The filmmakers aim high, but sorely miss their mark.
