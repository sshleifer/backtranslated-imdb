Based on a friend's recommendation, I and my wife invited another couple to this movie. I really wanted to apologize to them - we all hated 4 people and spent the whole time waiting to watch our clocks eventually. Half of the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes in Paris - for example, I was waiting to see some of the Latin Quarter pictures, but I did not really recognize anything. Most of the scenes were inside a bar. Nobody laughs at the theater, or has not responded in any way. If you like annoying, provocative, disguised-intellectual films, do not miss it. If you are down on earth like me, you will be sorry to see it.
