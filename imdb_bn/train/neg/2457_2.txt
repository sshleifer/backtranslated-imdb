Some people do not like animations. Personally, I think the animation was great when the film was completed. There are many older cartoons I like. My problem with this movie is not an animation, but it was originally built. Characters are all right ... well, stupid. And for this movie, they do not have to be. Apparently, LOTR's a limping problem for everyone (for beginners.) The way they usually have played normally. My two sisters and I had to smile through this movie mostly. I think many people saw this when they saw it but they did not go away. I'm glad I hired this and did not buy it. Some movies that give me headache. It's one of them. However, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, though it's up there. Or below, depending on your view.
