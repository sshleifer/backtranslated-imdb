William Cook and Paul Talbot, the three directors / writer credits sharing the boys with their horror magazines for the lively low budget movie for camping in the wild. The flames burst in front of the fire and the schoolblog ... and the trump in a sculpture town named Ralph (Hansen of the famous leather version) ... and has traded in four stories of fire warming instead of food. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of a story, "The hook" is an old mask, two boys of lover's lane attacked by a foolish killer in the hand. Another story has a couple of towels needed to score some weed. They glimpsed on a man who knew a person that he was # When they smoke some of their bags, their skin becomes gray and green and the bubbles begin. One of the best stories is an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother's death and enjoys talking to Satan Claus's nephew and nephew. The story of the fourth campfire is like a greedy sailor, which is washed barely in the pain of the chest and moving through the sea by the jambis. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, the Campfrey Televise points can be found and really very bad. A bit corny, but perhaps fun to see without the sailor's story. Acting is not understandable. Cast members include: Trace Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ryan York, Johnny Tamblin, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Denen, David Avin and Paul Coffman.
