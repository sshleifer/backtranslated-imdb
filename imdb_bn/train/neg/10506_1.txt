When the camper goes on a trip to a camp van, there are many clinics that you can guarantee. <br /> <br /> 1) Teenagers will be alerted where they are going crazy locals. Dan Van Hussein operates with ridiculous exposures about deadly cyrus. What, who, why and why is managed in an almost obsolete explosion. 2) The van will be broken. 3) Participation will be shared in search of help and they will choose one after another by warning any demon. 4) They will find a house in the madhouse, they will catch them. 5) The cell will have a phone but it will not work, it will be annoyed, neon lights, spiders and maggots will be shaken. 6) Insanity will catch them, because they will try to run in a car that will not start here (here the high speed gateway should be constructed on the tractor). 7) Drugs may die due to poor, poor fear of returning from the dead and then properly killed. 8) Only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9) Finally there will be an unnecessary turn. <br /> <br /> Connect these elements to nude senses (despite the characters that show them should fall in with them, despite the reaction to the amazing reaction in different ways), the lip is running out and the body is being pulled halfway and your one Twelve year old boys have something similar to a dream movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's just fair to say my opinion about the director and his previous work. As soon as possible, I'm glad that Bordeaux has some fun elements and a great improvement in its previous film Darkhunter's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Occasionally cinematography is very good, music and editing on its earlier films, and some other low budget horror movies. I have heard that it was acquired with one-third of the expenditure on the previous monetary expenditure. However, the worst things in this movie can not be found in the body of the film, it is finally a continuously disconnected film that has been reenacted time and time but in addition to DVD extras. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie, I request you to comment on the director, it is beyond belief. The film itself is more about this than to say. A great part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is the lead of the film because it was an earlier idea. She said, it is all deliberate attempt to use deliberately and openly if she "get it out of the man" if she is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was afraid to say that if it seems to be the essence of the past films and wonderful film poses, but it is not very well written, it is played properly. Tone not operated with enough style to work. If this image is ordered then it asks me a question; "What was the point?" The daredevil that only leaks to the right of the horror film cannon, no effort to do something clever or different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Film format. They accurately indicate that digital is often synonymous with ease and ease of use. However, when the best moment of the conversation comes, they are shocked that when Michael Man creates a film in a format, he is branded as a dreamer. There is a simple difference made here; Manna is a talented director who uses the format to fit her stories and style, Roberts is the hello hack who uses it to create shelf images below. I think the differences are obvious and comparisons are not just arrogant but unfortunate. <br /> <br /> The best time is reserved for Robert's comments, who took the time to review his previous movie. Those who do not like it are made as 'giks' and even give women the opinion of nerve to give their opinion to the specific people, which encourages them to do so. I must admit that I was not frustrated solely for his frustration. The group's joke about Norwegian critics became even more intense, with the utterance of 'Hellenic' it is fully understood that people born from Norway simply do not know a good movie. Always say more about these types of comments than those who notice them, they simply think of the director and his friends' unconsciousness. <br /> <br /> How the package is rounded with a delicious feature of how the serences are made. Robert's voice is crying in the dark, 'I did not want to make a movie like Baywatch', as we shed tears and audiences audiences and walked around the ground. There is a rich, self-motivated documentary about creating Darkhunters, among which a critique of Robert claimed that Forest "British Film of the Year". I do not know who he is trying to please. At one point in the commentary track, Robert's funny talk is, "I can tell people sitting in the house", it's not uncommon, but its hundred is not wrong.
