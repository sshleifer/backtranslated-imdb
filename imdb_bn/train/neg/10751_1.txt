Why do I waste my money on Sundance the last day? I want a refund ... can I get my $ 16 back? Although I was watching this picture I was waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew what was even supposed about it was that the plot was reading, which was not really like film. Why did the director zoom in with their easy cam and then zoom out? It was not very artistic. Director Ken Lulu show for fifteen minutes of his nails? Why did they try to act like they played? Or was that the point? I felt that there was no story of Phantom Love, and since I was honest, I had more entertainment than the entertainment of my friends, like the holiday videos.
