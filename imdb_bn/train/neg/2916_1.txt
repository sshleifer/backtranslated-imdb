This is the worst movie of my life. The plot and the message are horrific. There are many mistakes in this movie that it is impossible to keep. I do not understand that this movie can be nominated for a nomination, let alone alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee gives angry or unreasonable intelligence to his father due to frustration. Prose: He's angry. Cons: In the explanation scene, he can not express the grief / frustration of his father. The crying scene was very fake and it seems that she literally shook tears from the angle of her eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect to the movie title, there was too much or a dog's sound. Scenic view and rape scenes, which are completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewers. I understand that it is supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but it's just so stupid! 3) Why does hectore kill the killers? Head what's wrong with this movie When the killer started stabbing an officer, shot him. He's already dead! What's the hack? There were many opportunities to kill the killer, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During the scene, the girl hit her leg. Apparently, it was very clear that the left leg of the girls was hit by foot, so how does the head of the next scene lend all her weight on her left foot? And this actress nominated as the best actor? WTF? 5) Synopsis of the film's words are closed. <br /> <br /> 6) I think this movie is trying to bring awareness of cruelty and violence among children in South-East Asia, so why is the bad guy? When the police became victorious, joined the war? 7) The film is very violent, without a purpose. Police are beating the CI and they cooperate if they give marijuana and coke? This overall worst movie. I really believe that the person who wrote this movie is a sad and sick person. I have not seen a more disgusting movie in my whole life. The best movie ever!
