I will not mention any plots, because although it will be very predictable, a significant plot twist will be given away everywhere, in movie comments, here in the plot summary and even on my netflix envelope. If I did not know it, I enjoyed it more. may be. This movie is a delusional good cast, many of which have played outstanding portions in limited parts including Donald Switterland, Leslie Anne Warren and Tia Carrer and Rosemary Dance more. It was impossible to choose William McCannamah, but it was clear by design. And there was a quick nude view of the Kolpijien Lenno Jane. But some of this brought little recommendation from me. Which of these subtle actors actually does not read these scripts before signing in?
