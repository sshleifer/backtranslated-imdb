What do you get when you mix any clips with a directionless pacing and a group of characters and you're not careful about any and failing to create a striking visual style and even a hug and humorous feeling of humor and even an attractive visual style? And a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most incredibly unwatchable movies ever made! I'm definitely talking in Domino. <br /> <br /> People can say something while watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Oh, wow, according to the story order, it has been said that it was not done one billion times and much more than this movie Expertise. <br /> <br /> "Wow, all the flashing lights and great movie textures and descriptions. Conversion! The director is trying so hard to see things and create visual styles! It is very bad that none of these effects adds anything to a movie or they understand the scenes they understand and it is very bad <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> "If this movie is supposed to be <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> "How long is this thing? I think I have four pounds I have seen it by taking it. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea, I do not even know what happened, but especially I am not interested in trying to find it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, "I have to stop my friendship with the interlocutor of this movie. "<br /> <br /> In short, this film is almost a failure of all aspects. Avoid avoiding this cost if your house is burnt to the fire and the movie is playing in the only room that is not shining, but you should seriously consider burning alive. <br /> <br /> (If I say a bitter word, because I've just spent more than two hours watching this movie, oh, I did not enjoy it much.)
