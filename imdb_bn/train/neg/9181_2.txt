When I criticize the movie, I usually try to be professional and constructive, but my God !!! This was the worst movie I ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad scripts, everything bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, when the group When they come, they all find an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to determine what happened to the party leaders-workers, the group closed a mission through a zombie-oppressed forest. During this Crusades, they have the right number of weapons to give each child that they receive assistance from a police chick and a sea captain. They meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survival. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of bad guided action sequences with a long shotout outside of "the house of the dead". This war was complete with Hollywood Hollywood violence, unexpected clips from the hot video games and the Plate Matrix-ESK camera rolling. To sacrifice self to protect others between character and even volunteers. Why? Because he was not very brave and brave, because after being disabled, after losing the long life, the face of his face became worried by the acid! I'm sorry for this guy ?! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no point to see this image, unless you want to see yourself as deadly. The theater that I was in was more dead than the dead body on the screen, and I am sure that the meaning of the sh * t that I was wasting on this part can easily cover its cost. Grade: F.
