A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go forever and a day. "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality" is not as frightening as the mind, but by no means means any means, sense or form. The worst rhyming fabric ever features. Most, if it is not objectionable to anyone, is most knowledgeable or politically correct. This is the worst song parody of all time, sometimes in full Arnold disguise (only the worst of any film in the film, literally the worst). There is no source of Karen Black, Michael Clarke Duncan, or Slash on this star (why I saw it at first sight). The only thing that was fun was Dickman. In conclusion, I will not recommend this picture to anyone, but those who achieve their goal in this blog to achieve this in 250, they are unfortunate. Make some significant things with you guys. If the truth is true, then Church of Science hates him, he can not be bad. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
