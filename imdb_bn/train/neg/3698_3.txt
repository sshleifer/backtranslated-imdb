Other reviews do not require the details of what others have written - here is the summary: <br /> <br /> * Most of the nested animations are perfect - the colors are awesome - it would be a good thing to work as silk <br /> <br /> * The story and the death penalty are completely graduate - it was very difficult to keep awake sometimes <br /> <br /> If you are a Fine Art student of Medieval Coolgraph, the primary religion and so on - there it is. This is a film for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> There are horns on the road ...
