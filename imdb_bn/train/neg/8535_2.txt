I said, the book was good and if Melissa Gilbert's lead rolls are so awesome and unbelievable it could be a good movie. What kind of pronunciation might that be? Another movie that I saw him was the same word as his awesome Russian accent. Every time he opened his mouth, I cringed. Before I was able to see the whole movie taking 3 tried. Brad Johnson was as good as the other lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked the location of beach location. They added some needed brightness to take off your mind to depressing illustrations of Melissa Gilberts. I think they could use more San Francisco views to their advantage. Looks like night scenes were actually SF, but I could have been wrong. I do not recall the character of this book being sad. <br /> <br /> Please pronounce Melissa Gilbert for a future movie!
