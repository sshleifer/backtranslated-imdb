This was a bit painful by a barely watchable film. No section is good, but at least the first was silently funny and the middle was somewhat fantastic. The final one was simply dull, and after sitting through two poor comic shorts, the third one was really painful to watch. Even with the low quality of the national Lampuna film, it seems to be particularly annoying and fun.
