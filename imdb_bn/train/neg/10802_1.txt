Let me give a quick overview of this movie: A weak, rude kid named Max is on a radio, including Kazam: a raping gene. Like all Genius, he gives 3 greetings, but he helps McKay in good nature, personal life, because he is mixed with bullies and organized crime of parents and mothers. All these times, Kasam rocks from time to time, (Shake's neutral rap skill shows). <br /> <br /> This movie proves to be what we know: Athletes will have to stop in sports. I admit that it is not like an Oscar-worthy movie, but everything about the film's waste is horrible. The characters are probably unlikely or stupid, the plot is not significant, the dialogue is a joke and shake only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington acted in Kazam, this movie would be a joke. I know that the movie only created AndyDaddy because Shock was so big at this time (no intention). I can not really think of a positive thing to say about the waste of this time. The branch should have used this film for free while practicing.
