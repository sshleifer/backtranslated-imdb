I went to one of my relatives a few days ago, and we popped in a theater, so we thought we'd go inside and let the film go. What is wrong These pictures are horrifying in every section. I have never heard of the movie before, and literally not everyone still has it. No wonder, as it gets in the rank. It's a comedy, so it's a fun thing, it's a filmmaker's director or its lack. To be very close to Christmas, the title of this title should be titled: How to cook under-cooking for about one and a half hours - or as long as I go. At the end of the film, you feel poisonous toxic toxic on Turkey and you are sorry that you waste your time on such a drill. Who knows why it creates such things. Some people came out of the theater before the end of the film, and I did not blame myself before walking a long time ago. It really bothers me that you pay good money to look good and see what you see and see, a bad TV movie that should show at 2am, in fact it is bad, it should not show TV in the daytime. What else can say ... Probably can not judge the bad word.
