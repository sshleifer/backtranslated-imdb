. . . And this is a bad thing because at least if it was a trombay movie, it was a big feeling of cruelty and abandonment, which made my rating a bit more. <br /> <br /> Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) So what we instead have a very tame (Rated PG), barely hidden, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director) Wannabe almost exclaimed flat humorus, little Greeneans have done so well - fantasy logic or not, no mystery, no sense of courage and no violence or nudity can be made for it. <br /> <br /> While I'm sure the problems of film are included in the script - let's face it, no one can give this joke so that they can be fun - it seems that its biggest mistake will be to enter the director Betapina Hirsch. With a more efficient hand, the stage can be entertaining. After all, it starts like a great adventure movie. An archaeological excavator in Simon Waterman (Harvey Karamon) and his son Paul (Charles Stratan) Peru. Simon is a bit of a scavenging archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connection between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he can see laser cutting evidence on ancient terracotta. So they are in Machu Picchut when they come to a secret chamber, looking for more evidence of Simon's theory. Inside they quickly found the animal, after which they were known as "Arnold". <br /> <br /> They take Arnold to their small California desert city. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien creature, must go to a fellow worker's speech, and he plans to tell the colleague that he finally got a great sample. Paul and his very intelligent girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine van der Wahend), is in charge of Arnold, but they did not see each other with each other, leaving the unpublished leave when they left the ship. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (played by Carmen in a dual role), interested in buying a successful food company, Simon's house and land, are on their side. Simon does not want to sell, so the Cecil has hit a scheme to steal all the sticks. Slowly spiral out of control, and the pucker, an average streak to go along with their cravings for those junk foods, start overrun the city. <br /> <br /> It's a summary better than the screen that runs on it. The best shots in the movie are with the natural landscapes of the background, such as when the desert runs the characters outside the city. Apart from Seychel's home, the interior is weakly furnished, cheaper set and more importantly shows that they are not very efficient in blocking Hirosh and setting up shots. Surprisingly, due to the lack of overall production design, Sicil's house was quite beautiful, the style of 1980 was dropped into a small size and the push of the cecilia, Dude (John Stafford), was a fun counting point. Very bad, then, he got out of the film so fast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately, . Seycele, physically separated by a ridiculous wing and facial hair, is not the "evil capitalist" of this film, he is one of the classic incompatible, barbarous characters of the Cromwell - one of its features, the Carroll Burnett Show "(1967) skits." The Carroll Burnett Show " On the contrary, those who managed to succeed because the director Clark Jones and Dave Powers simply pushed the arrows of chaos He researched on an experimental method, Hirosh has reinforced Karamena from a long distance, and the character of Sicil is not correct. <br /> <br /> There are many director-related issues, of which at least none is notorious pissing and editing, which is possible from the film Suspense or outstanding dramatic effects. Scenes that were shoe to confiscate the drama - for example, when the stage is on the street Harassing the old lady - many of them are combined with each other to influence. <br /> <br /> It has serious logical problems with the story as it stands. Where does the stage of Machu Picchu come from? The trailer of the film seems to answer , But it was edited from the final cut. The more serious problem is that, unlike Grimlines, there are no obvious reasons to go from menacing monsters to cute, cuddly furballs. That's right. Furthermore, because the pledges were kept in PG, and the violence continues, when animals are at their giant stage, they never face any threat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a surprise to Gremlins and more purposes as countless rip-offs in her world. The only problem with this is that the film is not funny, although I've been chocolate several times. Percent percent of a wonderful high joke is bland. The remaining elements contain many non-signals. Given bad times to Hirsch, it all fell flat. There was the possibility of creating a movie that was a satire, both funny and terrible, ridiculous and annoying, Chessy and suspicious, at the same time, the Alter Killer Clowns Out of Space (1988). Very bad, then, that does not come near that munchies nearby.
