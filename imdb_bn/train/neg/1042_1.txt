Above all, write a script on a bachelor's degree. Who needs more than that? After all we do not have a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then get amateur actors. It would be good for the promotion of the festival. After all, who needs to spend years honoring their crafts? Then, hire a cinematographer who does not know lightly. If you see, if it is published well, it will not look "real" and the festival will not like it. However professional photography is needed? Then hire a ten-year-old who did not have a camera to be your operator. This will make your film entirely amateur touch that festoons will make mistakes for "reality" and guarantee that even though you will vacate the seat of a small sliver of the original guy, the critic and the audience, although over intellectuals will shout "talent" because <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br> Woe to waste.
