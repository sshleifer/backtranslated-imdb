Isabella Hupert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianeste" understands this issue, the viewer is happy to see Hupert's face for a long time and see it. Huppert is not an animated actor - he registers his emotions with a small embrace of a fetus or a smile. <br /> <br /> There is nothing other than enjoying acting an experienced actor in his profession. This movie wants me to recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-separation, seduction, and bizarre behavior, "La Pianost" can work for you. All the strange objects have a true kernel that is participating in high level competitions - musical, sporty, whatever - starts as a weird man and competes Ulaka environment in the shape of the newborns are. <br /> <br /> There is no movie theater, travel expenses, released this life lesson. <br /> <br />
