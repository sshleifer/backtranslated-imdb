This movie was wonderful. It is beyond irrational. I often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horror movies to see their comedic value. My friend proposed this, but we saw it, people started to give up. I really wanted to finish it, just so I can say that I was, but I could not. It's that bad. Awesome running gags, played in lam. The main characters are a boring dinosaur clut and Huipi Goldberg. I have seen the postman postman again and again as compared to seeing this movie's fraction. I think they are trying to deal with the problems of some dinosaur discrimination, but the part of the movie has really stood, which dinosaurs constantly damage things by its tail, and then there is a mistake about it. It hurts. If you are an aspiring masochist see it, otherwise, leave this one alone.
