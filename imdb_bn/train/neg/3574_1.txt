I just could not finish this movie. After congratulating me for the most prudent effort of sexual counseling, I congratulate: Picnic Pia Zadora is a scene that wants two boys. One (good boy) pleads for her to see her way wrong. The other (bad boy) just like a hot dog, then he asks if he is holding for him. Crotch stages. I hope I'm not wasting anything to get her face back, and laugh with a hot dog. Just kinder
