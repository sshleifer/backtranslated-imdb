If the movies like Gaussis stop the Grimmins Rip, then the hubglin glyz-like rubbish is stuck and the new people are drowned. In this bare-animated form there are some types of schemes to fill imaginations (which mainly involve the sexual dreams of the Groot charts - oh, joy), but somebody guess what to do with anybody, except the director his Inktica. They show it in the 8th Circle of Hell, a suspect. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" And humorous efforts and a light effort to watch the audience.
