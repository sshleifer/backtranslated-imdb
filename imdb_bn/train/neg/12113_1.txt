The tuage was the most lazy movie I ever saw, and I saw Blair Witch movie (Part One and Two). It seems to be confused what it wants to be. It's not funny for the sake of comedies, it's not sad enough for the theater, it's not enough bloody for the horror and it's not good enough to see it. It is caring a person's view of "slapstick / bloody" so that I think the film will contain poisonous avengers and street trash veins. Then it leaps without a warning, in a missing girl, a drama about a disabled (mentally handicapped) woman and a believing mother. Then it just reduces itself to the only good part of the film, which seems to be set up like sitcom without a smile track. The part I'm saying is a lonely towier who is so lonely, he got a rolling body comfort. That movie was my only feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, to show how Cruuel Wayne has a documentary to have fun with Toby (Star) at the end of Wayne (director) film. It made me sick. Although the murderer Nerd and Kailor Nerd's Wife (two other Owen films) are not the best, but at least they think you can enjoy up to the last credit. I even liked Nader, the killer, even though I used a few lines these days. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like covered films and if you want to see your feet, they are a rest, you do not like the tannins! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> <br />
