I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this has the right. Speaking of any plot, it's one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera. I just wanted to snatch that little girl because, all right, tell me that she is really suspicious with the movie. The monsters running around wearing some bling were fun. I saw a little "silent heel" there. And I read that this work was done, and a Finnish metal band, Lords saw. So it makes no sense that it makes many sense. It seems to be a vehicle for band promotion and more. FX is very good, the look of the film, the monsters and even the acting is also good. But the story and saying it is not just there.
