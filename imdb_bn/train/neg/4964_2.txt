This movie is a Farce! Names are fairly misleading and the plot explodes in something which is irrational and damaged by a literary enthusiast. And they have cheeks to give to Boulfool a ridiculous Canon / Crossbow weapon. Do not need arms like a boy! In poetry, he threw the hand of the grandsle with his bare hands! And I can not believe that writers did something like that. The way though Grendel illustrated the image. That's the only positive point of cast and cast feature. My English teacher would go mad if he saw this hatred. Unless you are a mortal fan of epic poetry "Bauful", then you can avoid the cost of this movie. And even then, I would not recommend it.
