Vick (Richard Dreyfus) is a mass protest, leaving an emotional organization, gangster returns to his world. Richard Dreyfas, Alan Barkin, Jeff Goldlam, Deane Lane (very gorgeous), Gabriel Byron, Gregory Hines, Kyle McLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol, and when the time was lost, how could a director be cast? This movie is a comedy which is not funny, there is a collection in Cast. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Mister-in-law!' ('Joy of killing you!') <br /> <br />
