I grabbed this image on the AZN scandal. It seems to be a good film, a Japanese "green card". I can not say that I never dislike an Asian movie, on the contrary. There are always incredible horror films some Japanese and Korean, and I am very fond of John and Hong Kong films. I'm not in contrast with light-hearted films like the Tampopo or Chung King Express (my favorite two), so I thought I'd love it. Well, I would rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood and never see this rugged, poorly-played film. <br /> <br /> I think the director Steven Okazaki will raise the water with Quaidus, because someone was a figure of this picture. And when a character tries to work in the DID, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly mesh. I do not honestly think that someone has ever played before ... only the person who said genuine Brenda Ooki I think it's wonderful that it has been circulated as a comedy, because I once smiled. Even more surprising that the CBS morning news is called "a refreshing breath of comedy". It was not refreshing, not a comedy. And the finishing was very predictable, the previous critic would be a fool to think of these things. <br /> <br /> Leave this movie if you want to watch the annoying plot line and wood acting. I really think "BensonHost Spike" is a better acting film than this ... and I crossed half way through that movie!
