This movie is horror God This movie is not one quality. You would think that cow would be good but it sucks worse. The effect is bad and you can play acting if you've played the worst I've ever seen. This film was shot in Camcoder and it was run in a budget of around $ 500. If you want to see a better Zombie movie than watch the death Dawn or watch the dead day. If you want to see a better cheap shot knowing video life but it is a good way to look at Rodney Jamie. Please avoid all costs of this movie. It's unwatchable and dotted. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
