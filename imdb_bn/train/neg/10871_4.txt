I've read a lot of good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel ... so my expectations have been erased. But they are crushed more than they should be expected. If I could not read the novel earlier, then the movie was a decent film, which probably destroyed it for me. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they changed the tollen labor camp into full ships. Lane slaves. Bishop Myrale's view was fine. Actually, except for the Galileo, things were alive until the Fannin was dismissed. Because we do not want to do bad things to a good woman, she will not cut her hair, do not sell her teeth, or prostitute. She runs in the worst mayor office and spit on her face. Bamatabois is completely eradicated. Even children should not speak outside the marriage ceremony, because Thalomias is a dead sister of Phantine than an irresponsible altar. Prior to the honor of Champagneur, Valencia was able to bring the casket for the fantantine, so they reunited happily, but there is another change. Then comes the convent, which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up. Thankfully, it was saved. After this three-minute precision, the film again started to hit the classic novel's slaughtering. <br /> <br /> Wandering through the coset and Valencia Park, they are giving a speech to Mirios in a meeting. About reform of fishermen. When he comes out fliers from Valjean and Cossette, he sets up a line in the movie set which screaming me at the TV set. "We are not revolutionaries." I could hear the frustration in Victor Hugo's grave. Of course they are revolutionaries! They want to rebel against the pseudo-monarchy that is on behalf of another republic, you are the boxer's boxer! This is a historic event that revolted against the government in 1832. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... not eponin. Or at least not the eponymous book. This seems to be a sensitive woman secretary working for prison reformers (who is working from Cafe Universal, who is opposing coffee muesen). The audience is not mentioned that thanks to her non-time, low-cut, tight-fitting dress and her graduate approach she was disliked. <br /> <br /> The prison reformers (the weakest story under the leadership of Angolrass) that I have ever seen) decide that the handover to the magazines is no longer good. So they're going to build barricades. I do not know about you, but I've never heard of reform movements on the street and the construction of bikes and attacks on government forces. About three hundred people (it was not supposed to be so much) National Guard invades and builds a bunch of barricades, etc. Die for Europeans Mariusen, grateful. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is correct, otherwise Javar's suicide seems difficult to understand at the time of his small school and the interpretation of strange character. The film ended with Walsh in the River Jawar River. Valjean will never be given the Javert dive because it is wrong again. He had saved the man before, now why let him die? Then his identity, his deterioration, and his death with Marius and Kosettes, his acquaintance of ransom, was completely excluded from maluasas. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can blame most of the scripts for problems. Although I'm glad that Angelolas and Eponin were at least present in the movie, they completely misunderstood as a full barricade scene. The elimination of the anguish of Fantine prevents us from feeling too much for her. That coset messes a good deal from Valjean's past plot since the beginning. I did not even see Trenadier and MaMake. Thenardier had only a few seconds of screen time. The same with Gavrooche I like the interpretation of Wallisan's interpretation of Frederick March, however, there was one of the release features of the film. On the other hand, Charles Loughton seems to have missed the mark with Javier, for all his performances in other films. Lip vibrations, unnecessary screams, and generally all of its acting felt very wrong. I also saw many javarts, not looking at all kinds of brains, there is a need for character. <br /> <br /> Again, if I did not read this book, I would love to be better. Although I would not suggest purists book it,. I would say that this movie was a good adaptation, which had not emerged from the infamous French version a year ago.
