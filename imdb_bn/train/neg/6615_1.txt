Within a short period of Indian cinema, a movie like Sholay changes the way the viewers show a good movie. And sometime (hopefully) we have a RGB key that breaks all values ​​and creates its own. A value is so low, it can not be broken. Ram Gopal Varma's talent takes a melted pot and manages to make a dish so stale it you can smell from a distance. Take a classic like Shole and kill it completely unforgiving and I do not believe he is called RGV what Sholay movie is about. Though Shole was the title of many people in it, the film defines the character as the only character that defines the fact that they live forever. What aag do not take these characters and mess them up so bad you will need a competition to pick the worst. The element of reality is completely absent and what the film ultimately provides is a bunch of "platforms" and a bunch of parading with a set of related events relatively rarely. A star for this photo is a ridiculous waste of votes. To highlight the reality of its failure, highlight the "different" plot that can be classified under RGB time and film.
