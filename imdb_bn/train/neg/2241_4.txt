I rather enjoyed this few years ago but it is coming again, I wonder why. I think it always looks good and girls are not rather good but let men rather rather let down. Why is so much about English films about sex, why are there such unworthy men as well as our beautiful girls? It starts more like a similar sexual relationship from the shadow of the Confessions film, but about one-third of the way is going on (when we start enjoying the beautiful Mi My Lie), the film begins to accept it. Seriously. Not only that, central rock clubs and cannabis sequences are very forced and only humble. In short it does not seem to be the intention of foolishly or deliberately serious as it is neutral. Richard and Sullivan may have helped such a central figure, but I could be one of his worst performances. Just value it for women.
