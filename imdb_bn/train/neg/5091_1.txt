My comments were named for the Russian version of Space Race on 10-13-13, 2006, Russia's first channel, entitled Bitwa Jaa Koms (Battle for Space). Bad translation can destroy some details but I doubt it. The number of theoretical errors is that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first phase (the development of the first missiles). Even half of the US has multiple errors and errors. The listener does not tell any V-2 / A4 launch in the United States, the same serial number 'EE' boasts three different Jupiter C rockets on the board. Apollo 1 will be launched in the moon, etc. In the Russian half, each person is ridiculous. Dreaded for fear of the Curelive NKVD, Glusco Sabetor and traitor, Minesh alcoholism etc. Works as a male; No motivation, no life Uniform and decorations horror. Gagarin sings a great song waiting for the launch (I think it has been specially added for the Russian version).
