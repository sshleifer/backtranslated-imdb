Zina has torn up in her Dopplenzer apartment and found her picture with her father. He is involved in a head on the drive and collision away. Then mysteriously his boyfriend is not the same; Friends are not easy to be the right family and to trust her. Jina is beside herself? Is he a parallel world?
