I saw the DVD (called Black Widow in USA) and later felt that it was a terrible movie. But they certainly could have cut a bit from the original, or I missed a lot. In sex scene there was very little obscenity and there was no nudity (not even a breasts), but I read some other comments by mentioning obscurity on IMDb.com and a tampon. I did not see anything, a bad, annoying movie with an impossible character and a comedy, the Sophomore plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the face up or gloss Botoxed, and nary touched her face in an expression. And his name reminds me of a super-salty beverage of Taco Bell: "My cola will be grand!" It was really funny that it was very bad, I was in mystery science theater 3000, as Duffar skin is too big for her face. It's really stupid!
