Apart from what else you can say about this movie, it is easily awkward. Why Tina Lewis and Adam West want to see these reasons, but that is, but their talents have been broken in this stack. I think they used to double the scenes of Adam, as it is, so you can not see his face. If Adam Jumbo feels embarrassed in the nightmare, but think about how he felt about being present ??? It was earlier or later, but I'm not sure, however, still, compared to Zombie Zombie Nightmare, a classic (see the first and latest version of the science theater version 3 of Mysteries). This gang is very boring and plays more by some. The actor Of course Marlon Brando has played the role of a wildlife rifle. Tina looks surprising though I hope he and Adam will be paid well !! Pass!
