Another film that absorbs nonchalant frontal male nudity; Terrible acting, plus, lovemaking scenes I've ever seen the most non-sexy (and I have become homosexual, do not link the idea of ​​loving these two young people). <br /> <br /> Again, as Mill Mills de Paz, Julian Hernandez has played an incredibly inspired film with a story that makes enough logic for a small film about five minutes, but it is managed to create 2 hours of film ... and This time, even in the Mexico gay community can not talk about racism and commutation! Allah is Merciful to us!
