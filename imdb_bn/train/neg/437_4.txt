(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very interested in seeing this picture, I heard that it was tricky and malicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Two people living in a big city can experience. The whole picture dislikes me two things. <br /> <br /> First, the film was so down-to-earth that a couple should be resolved which should resolve a couple of days. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the overall mismanagement of production, did not understand slightly with dialogue. <br /> <br /> Very bad.
