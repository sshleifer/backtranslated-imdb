Last night saw on TV. Yes, I can hear what you can say about this. It can be classified as one of the stereo-ideal TV soap series. In all fairness, this is a fine twist on the line of the story, and you might say, "Well, what I hope is not." However, as a film, it is not easy to spot a redeeming material well. Acting, acting, camera work, carriage, costume, setting, script, no, no congratulations. Best no Oh, that scene. Did we need it? This is a movie you can see and even then forget that you even saw it. And what was the title again?
