The fact that I do not like music, it is a very personal opinion, not historical innacuracies. I understand that this is not an opera and documentary, but some important aspects are absent, obviously if others make false accusations because of it. <br /> <br /> Abu Abbas was the masterman of this operation, which was organized and reconstructed due to the discovery of the ship to rescue 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kantar, a serious terrorist whose Google was "Clingfahf Samir "And can find out. Abu Abbas is responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never placed the foot of Aichi Lauro. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is almost atoned for terrorist activities and responses. They may have survived the fear, constantly working and ambitious how much Israelis have done to hurt them. However, the Palestinians never hit the striking of Israelis. The movie uses horror images (terrible !!!), and it is generally not believed that it was Israel who was responsible for using horror images of the Sabra and the intricacies, they never kept the Lebanese army's army occupied seriously <br/> <br /> It was very bad, but I think what can be expected from opera singers? <br /> <br /> I am amazed at how a person can forgive the terrorists in another note. A hostage assault because the hostage tried to strengthen 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists, and added that the person should not feel sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how disrespectful his wife was, shot her husband dead, and threw her body in the sea. I hope nobody in the world is as cruel as her.
