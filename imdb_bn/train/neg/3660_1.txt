I have recently seen this little magmus amassette, one of these dollars DVDs that seems to be everywhere nowadays, and it has been removed so much that I can not contain myself. Those who have not seen this mildly unhappy Mexican import, and want to look at it unbiased by someone else's junky comments, then, undoubtedly, how badly they are harmed. So if you are one of those desperate people, stop reading at once and go and see it for yourself. If you get enough drunk in advance, you may be lucky enough before it ends. <br /> <br /> After bitten by a haired start with the evidence that a man could become a useless. None of the film explains how this kind of cross-screen implantation can happen, and the rest of the film is more hopelessly offensive. But insert yourself another glass of wine (or drinking) and go ahead. <br /> <br /> <br /> Only the dentist provided novocaine supplies for cheap whiskey, and since then it has been drunk. (Is not he lucky?) The face of the dance never changes, inside or outside the makeup, and apparently no one has given him coaching to work like Varanewal. Sometimes he tries to imitate Lone Chaney Jr., but most of the time he only wanders on black black mafia shirts, as the other cooler dude, with too much face hair. To be fair, makeup is actually better than its inside actors, but continuity is infinite bad. Naschy's Verbose is the only one that I can think of changing the shirt twice in the middle of the change. He shines the red shirt from the black shirt, then back to the black, then the red back, then back to the black, all one single, frenzied night. Interestingly enough, he did chaney crawl while wearing a red shirt and cool dude was walking while wearing a black shirt. And whenever he was wearing a red shirt we saw most of the anger mentioned in the headline. There is probably something about the red shirt that just shows the animal in it. <br /> <br /> So, after being intercepted by cross-pollination Hei, the poor scheme brought back his wife from Tibet and came to know that his wife is sleeping together with her student. Two illegitimate lovers adjusted the breaks in his car and tried to kill him. She survived the ruins, and makes it right at home for a full moon. Then, after his wife and his lover's chin, he wanders again, and managed to get him electrocuted in any way. But enough that? Can they enjoy peace in this suffering? There is no chance. She is resurrected by the supposed female scientist with a hardcore S / M fetish, otherwise known as "doctor" (and of course the doctor who does not have a new incarnation). He pokes him with his strange cartel, takes him to the dungeon, pushes him towards the wall, and he feels very good. Perhaps a string of such anger should be enough to give a little anger in a violman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> to find a way out. (And who can blame him?) During his horror, he was accompanied by a man wearing a medieval armor, opera camouflage (probably the father of the doctor), and the partner cadre of the tough girlfriend das. <br /> <br /> For all this, one might ask a reasonable question? There is a blurred impression that it has something to do with the control of the mind, and involves something called "chemotrodes" to the doctor. (Best guess: There is really no idea how it was made, if there are such things.) Gracious, the test fails and most importantly, it ends ... before it is time to close your own foot. <br /> <br /> Of course, no such feeling can be expected from any such film, but at least it should be good for the laugh. This is not the one. Forget it, friend. Such anarchy combined with this film, its patched together, the tortillary cinematography of Tacilia-Dracit Embianys and the impressive musical score denies the most common effort that can laugh at an MST3K type. If that's not good for it, then what's good for it? If Montageumar revenge could remotely remaster and make DVDs, it must have been seen like this movie.
