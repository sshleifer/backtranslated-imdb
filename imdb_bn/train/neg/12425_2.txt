I do not know what you're doing inhaling, but please stop. This movie was a complete trash. <br /> <br /> Like McKlister Macquarie Macaulay, Kulkina was loving, beautiful, sweet, loving, and very interesting to see. At the same time he was innocent but at the same time, he was strong as well. <br /> <br /> This new baby, Alex? All boring as annoying! Trying to match Kulkina's charm and grace, only an intelligent replay, which unfortunately fails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were curious, they were funny, and just think what a good villain you want to basically root for more kulkines. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, are absolutely perfect for those roles. On the other hand, in between 3, we have 4 new idiots that only curse and again, try to make Karlin and Curiosity of the first villain impressive. They say they were not awesome, but they were not even memorable that they were really entertaining. In fact, a little bit nearby. <br /> <br /> Then we got the original movie. Part 1 and 2, classic. Memorable. Clock around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and is perfect for bringing out so many emotions. It falls in love with the story and takes care of the characters. Just be memorable and masterpieces being closed. Part 3? Shit Masterpiece I said enough <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know why people like this. I think people do not know what a good movie and what It's another strange deception and a fool's new protagonist, which I think robbers will lose at least shit. A Crappy Siegel Rip Off with him <br /> <br /> Run away from this garbage. And even lets not start with 4 parts!
