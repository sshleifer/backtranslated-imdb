Man, I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Armin is more fun than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A great throw is lost (Kenneth Mangal, Allan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Murita , Louis Naoye) with this amateur script <br /> <br /> 3) The film is suffering from terrible pacing. It jumps around through a jumbled, confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story does not even have the knowledge. Why does he want to break football strokes? What about stupid violin music? It is no explanation. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It tried to embarrass like a bunch of accountants, saying, "Look at me! Look, I'm funny!" <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's movie, but people have failed here. I could not wait for the credit roll. Horribly frustrated
