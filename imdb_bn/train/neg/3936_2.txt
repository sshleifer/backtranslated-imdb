How nice. I thought it might be vague but I wanted to imagine! Sometimes I like to see a good "Car Crash" movie: They are so bad that you do not look away because you might want to see how bad they might get. This is the only reason I can leave television - Morbid fascination. It was not so much that it was only moderately or slightly worse than this cast, but that compound and plot that never saw the light of day. Scripts, too, jealousy. For cinemmatography, did anyone else notice that they used an "screen drawing" segue device like an old 50s TV show ... but without fornication? At first I thought they were having fun but the movie took it very seriously for use in the tongue-in-cheek method. Do not even ask me about scores ... The only high point is the final song, Mourcheba. I think they wanted to leave the people with something for their 8 dollars ... happy I saw on TV !!!!! Just silly! Why did Tithi Hatton get hard to find many work recently? I guess if you do not expect too much and would like to see an unselfish thriller, your tenels in the evening will be better than clipping, it's a perfect fit for 2.
