Looking for Sandra Lock about Christ's Second Coming as Hippie and Elbino. Until the end of "Suzanne's second coming", you have no idea what is happening on the screen with the theme song "Susan" running throughout the movie over until you forget the whole thing <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The movie maker Logan, Jared Martin, is planning to make this century film in this off-the-wall armor, but it is so illogical and objectionable in any country of banking. Rakalpa funding. After planning his own logan, the couple ran in a seafront cafe and the young woman Susanne was fascinated with Sandra Lock, whom she knew in other life, whom she reminded: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> Logan's assistant and the surrounding group Clavius, Richard Dreyfas, received a loan of $ 740,000.00 from the bank for the masterpieces of Logan. She started working in Suzanne and acted in her role as an actress in order to be interested in her film. It not only leaves Suzan his boyfriend Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon becomes so depressed and feels alone and takes a gun near his mouth and leaves his brain out. A little irrelevant sub-plot, among which a young autistic girl Dorothy, Curie Avalus, who cured her autism by Sijen, did not succeed in her psychiatric hospital after the other. Failed with It is not really known what is actually happening in Suzanne hospital, but she seems to be somewhat disciplined or voluntary there; Did this mean that we wanted to see in our audience that he could make the sick ill miraculously, like Jesus? <br /> <br /> This newspaper columnist and big business dealer Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who thinks going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or seeing a biblical vision that has changed his life forever. Sinclair was searching for the meaning of life in the way of life and wanted to know why this world was so much like this movie, and Suzanne kept her eyes when she thought she had received the answer for the first time. Sinclair also got some ideas when his personal Chaufid David, Mark Rasmuss, who was sick and tired of his strange and crazy spooky, almost stabbed him on driving in the Pacific Coast on a comic. <br /> <Brazil's "The Second Coming of Susan" has added a number of incomplete sequences, perhaps by the director and film editor for some time to fill up or pad and then move towards the final scene of crucifixion like Christ. Logan has rolling all the cameras in a hill as well. It shows that the insane logo carries with its superiority so far that since he tried to replicate, bound helplessly and sujanne, about 2,000 years ago, the actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> "Sujon's second coming", almost and almost impossible, you are going through the same torture by Susan Logan and filmmaker. The film tries to be aarti, but it is an excuse to cover only the brainless and non-existent story, and it has made terrible and amateur acting worse than everyone else.
