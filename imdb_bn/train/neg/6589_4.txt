I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. In addition to some saving graces, there is nothing to write about it at home. <br /> <br /> Jay-Harr has been accumulating for the past five-six years, but the films were repetitive and carbon copy of the previous success in more than one account. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> It's basically a supernatural slash movie. Initially, a morgue is promised a cool scene where a dead girl stitches her eyes graphically, but quickly opens them. However, after that, it is quickly enthusiastic for this flashing. <br /> <br /> Please start with what I like about "cow". Plus, the visuals are weird and the film looks great for its kind. For those who want their horror movies, there are some nicely executed killings (for no punitive purposes) for murder scenes. We also got some good piece / set piece of mystery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie, the plot skips and jump ahead time and behind with a dangerous intensity. Generally it is not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same, no matter how old they are, I was confused at more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> Actually I'm guessing when you do not know the language a little hard to say), but feel a little harder. And for a horror movie, I do not think it's scary enough. I was quite annoyed for a while. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Geo movies, I was expecting a lot from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was very disappointed.
