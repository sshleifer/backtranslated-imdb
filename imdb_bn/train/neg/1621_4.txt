'Fox and the Child' French director Lus Jacket's new movie, who brought us the Oscar winning documentary 'March of the Penguins'. It's a young girl (surprisingly acting by Bartel Noyle Bruno) and focusing on his growing friendship with Fox. <br /> <br /> Here are some really funny moments; Badgers jumped, chasing the fox with forests through junking. Especially in a scene when the fox is tormented by foxes, it is quite intense and sometimes even horrific. However, only enough of them are not enough. <br /> <br /> Shoot nicely; Cinematography fantastic The kind of bubbles of the film are wonderful. It's arguably a very nice production. <br /> <br /> The English version was narrated by Kate Winslet, but there have already been very few conversations dubbed. The score is too fluffy, or at least it is for my favorite; And the screenplay, when delicate, seemingly jumped from one scenario to another, eventually bothered me. <br /> <br /> The film has a moral morality and Nile-Bruneau is a pretty, real star fox. The fascinating moments of focusing only around our furry little friends are extraordinary. However, again, only they do not have enough. <br /> <br /> - To keep up to date with the latest in the movie, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray. com.au
