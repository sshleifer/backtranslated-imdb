It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen without any doubt. The only thing that is striking in this movie is that some great genre directors and the presence of Camio by the King himself. The film has a great courtroom, but the story lasts about 15 minutes. I gave Madenan Amic's opinion in this film and thought he would be very good at the film.
