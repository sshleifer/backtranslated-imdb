Above all, in this movie, Jane Jameson is the best actress, and she's just awful. This movie has the clich√© every horrible step to imagine, and all played badly. Extra sexual teen couple Funny (no) horny joke. Graduate cold chick Kinky local color guy Parental type couple. The rare virgin dog that does not die in this movie surprisingly. Conversations are so painful horror and a wedging pool is distributed with depth. It's almost like you want that everyone will soon die. I saw a rough cut of this movie a few minutes ago, but the way, it got worse. Of course, the most interesting thing here is that Jasmine is trying to feed Jameson's implant, but it does not give a low price for dogs. To avoid all costs.
