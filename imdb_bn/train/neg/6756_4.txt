Dave Hamilton is probably known as the legendary full moon entertainment new name. Sadly, his arrival in this independent studio took place when budget and production prices were lower in his minimum years. However, in his short career, Hamilton established himself as a creative director who managed to manage innovative and original stories. Now, this does not mean that his movies are good, but at least they are different from the usual scary series. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed", Hamilton presented us with a creative twist in the Slasher sub genre. Maddy (Debbie Rokon) is a young girl who finally gets her dream job. Not only that, but it seems Sean (Danny Olssk) has also got a lover, it looks like a lot of sadness later life is laughing for Madrid. To a party with Shawn's friends, they told him that they had created a "club" where members would have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> They obviously are kidding, but Maddy wants to fit wildly so that she actually killed someone. After that, someone starts killing the rest of the "club". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting twist as being the main actress as part of the suspects. The idea is so original and Rokon's performance is so good that it is a shame that Hamilton did not develop the whole story better. The film feels very slow and it is a good idea to crash into bad movies overall. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strange in this sense that all the women cast is very good, male throw painfully bad. Danny Olski is extremely stereotypical and is extremely versatile in his performance as a Yuppie. Julie Strein, Brink Stevens and Lloyd Kaufmann attend small comes and are great in their small roles. Also, many nudity (both male and female) and cast look very good, so it's really a plus. <br /> <br /> Low budget hits the film in the impact section, as there are very few gory scenes and not really graphic (probably because they'll be bad); However, considering the budget, at least the movie looks good. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Although it is not as bad as other well-known movies, it still has many errors and it can be interesting for fans of Debbie Rocon or fans of independent budget films. 4/10
