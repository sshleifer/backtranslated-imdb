An archaeologist (Caspar Van Deen), an ancient, 40 feet mummy in the Nevada desert, stumbled accidentally in a well-preserved underground earthquake. They are determined to help keep it secret and help the Jewish translator find its history. Mummy, explained in the beginning, was a son of a fallen angel and one of the few giants that apparently existed in those days. To save his son from a devastating flood to predict killing his son, he mummed his son and buried him with several maides for centuries - since then he plans to wake him up. In our present time, the fallen angels are still walking the earth and Mummy is resurrected and a show is expected to take place. Most of the film is gradually going to work on fights, bibliography and couple shy, air-thrash fights. Mummy looking is not decent but is shown almost enough. It should have done more with it but it dragged into a great deal ... Ah. Do not disturb.
