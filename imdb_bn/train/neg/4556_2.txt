I do not know what the other person thinks. This movie was created independently, it is actually not terrible. You can be as big a believer as possible ... Most of this movie is a stupid drill. I think it has been insulted by the first 40 minutes watch. And that was no small achievement alone. Not only is acting terrible, but the plot is never even improved. There are countless holes in the story, where you can rarely tell it a story. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but I wrote this first review and its purpose is to save your audience in just a year and a half. I can not remember the end that I could not even see a movie. This one really takes the cake.
