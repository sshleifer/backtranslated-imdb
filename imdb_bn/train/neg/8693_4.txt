I'm from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have been in Berlin for several years. This movie was so far away as Arielington. I saw the mountains in the background of a scene! Texas does not have mountains. I guess the film in Texas is illustrated in Canada. The pronunciation is really bad. They should have earned the actor from Texas to play part. Many aspiring actors out of Hollywood outside Hollywood Although the movie is really sad, because it is a true story. I found the killer and convicted. A good thing is that to help her find his children soon disappearing, after the abduction of his death BC, now Amber has alerted.
