Due to being a big fan of "other" plant in APES movies, I hired this DVD despite all my objection to Tim Burton. Again, he fails to be frustrated with his intrinsic direction. Even the AP makeup shows the second rate, which is unable to consider this psychological energy budget. Mark Wahlberg once proves that he is not an actor (as the Buzzy Night was not enough evidence). I feel embarrassed for the real challenges like Team Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. There is no doubt that their paychecks inspire them because perhaps it can not be a cliche-ridden screenplay. I rent this DVD at a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off.
