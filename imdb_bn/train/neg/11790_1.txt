Deep sh .. It's even better! Yale is cartoon on the photo. "Incredible Mr. Limpit" thinks "Livithan". <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no development of any character or relationship. So called "romantic" scene is very corny and expected. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make it a missed-miss!
