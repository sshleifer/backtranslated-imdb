I imagine when Hitakoop scholars and experts find themselves together, this discussion is not one of the master's great films like "North by Northwest" or "Strenners on a Train", but since 1931, such a less common effort is unclear and serious, Which looks great to the great director. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class London couple who are screaming for the lead. He is ungrateful to them; She accepts it. The change comes in the form of a letter of a uncle, saying he must set up so that they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury. They are planning for a world cruise. But their problem only started. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannah, Roger and Thornhill, or Marion Crane. Well, Marin is helpless right now, but you got the idea. Travel together and go together like Hitchcock moth and candle, best set up for a dangerous journey. Perhaps the first attempt at Hitachi in this theme, and not his most successful or memorable. Hitcock tries to mix comedy with other elements, in this case domestic drama rather than suspense, but both are not here, at least not here. <br /> <br /> Heels is a blue, flat couple, no chemistry or personality. When they find themselves in Folyzie Burger, with the footage cross-cutting, this film seems to be more than ten years old, then they are lost in female actors' outfit. "The screen is gone soon!" Emily gasps <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont), took her own photograph by sitting beside an empty chair, which she asked to be admitted to Emily. Fred's daughter "Princess" (Betty Aman) Clara Bo's eyes and Wallace's Bari's five o'clock shades. An overwhelming fellow passenger is also a fierce spinster, whom Hitchcock always introduces with cartoon horn trumpet. Subtlety had yet to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is shot instantly, with confusing and annoying dialogue. Fred and his umbrella try to do some initial comedy, which does not come, and Kendall laughs laughing when Berry is eating tears. When Fred and Emilie abstained, they were cheated together in the rickshaws, they were one of the most tedious attempts in symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only unclear sympathetic character, because she really thinks her husband and her grief over Gordon's relationship, but most of the reason is that he is among the many magnetic blondes of Hitakoos, his platinum ringlets surround his face Screaming like a bottle of a cheek, on the open deck of a Chinese junk near the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The topic has reached the conclusion of a dangerous situation, which would narrow down with the leader and perhaps set-piece to repair their relationship. Not only are they active participants in resolution, and without the fate of friendly cats, there is nothing about the last resonates. <br /> <br /> At least at the end of the 1930s saw some scenic scenes of London and the opportunity to see the hitco when he was still working for food. "Rich and Strange" Hitakk is paying his debt and is teaching his business, not for a scholars but for ordinary film passengers.
