In 60 minutes, beautiful Christina Galbo tries to escape from isolated boarding school at the beginning of the movie. Is he a terrible thought from a fate, a monster, black-glided killer, or a supernatural evil? No, he's leaving the bulge bundle. The next 40 minutes that follow, various statistics revolve around candlebars in school and show uncomfortable or confusing, which does not say much about itself because perhaps it's a great movie about it, but if you're walking characters around the characters and you're good Alain has stairs to resnais or you know well how bright apple like pepper bava is red Stir in purple stairs. We know that a murderer stalks the school's circumference, but its body count is unfortunate and unclear and in the absence of visceral fear, we do not feel any hidden mystery / unknown secret mystery and want to be a Las Residencia movie, which is good and honesty Want to be but do not know how to do it. We do not know anything because the absence of girls has been found, but we have never got such a hidden mysterious environment, which means that "something serious happens to people here in the wrong place". When the Syder tries to comment on female sexual harassment, she quickly does it with casting hersterics and eye close closure and partial lip, when she portrays the background of the "back-e-hacking" background. Atherial Beauty and Panic A link to the Hanning Rock can not be found here. It's all a little weird and aimless, with no real sense of immediacy or direction. Several people are presented as suspects, but there is little reason to care for any murderers who have no surveillance in the film. I like the first murder, throwing a knife in the face of a victim as a lollipop in the background, but the rest is very irrelevant for my taste. I have had to say that Siradra did a lot of good work with children and WHO could kill a child?
