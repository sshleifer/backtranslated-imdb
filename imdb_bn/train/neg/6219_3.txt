When the Las Vegas Magazine was opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was convinced that it would be considered as the heart-warming of the first Los Angeles films. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story was frustrating, the songs of Sherman brothers were under their normal level, the letters were unclear, and James Stewart and Mikey Roni both saw a lot of good days. However, I was interested to see what I wanted to see in the contribution of Alice Fayei, since she was absent from the screen for many years and was always involved in her previous role in Fox. Alice was letdown by too, stupid script and obsolete photography. Another disappointment <br /> <br /> There is nothing real here, there is nothing even interesting to enjoy for adults - and obviously, there is no magic for anyone. You can skip this one without missing a thing.
