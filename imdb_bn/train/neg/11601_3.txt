A nightmare of Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment of Nightmare in the Elm Street series, and the worst series in the series, Elm Street is worse than a nightmare. I was lucky enough to get nightmares on Elm Street. DVD box set for my birthday and I saw all the sequels. The dream baby was the worst without any doubt, I was surprised that they were doing so well with the last two signals. But I think they just lost charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with where I went. Alice just became more annoying, she is not Nancy or Kirsten, so she did not work for me carrying her own film. Fredri is throwing his fear, it's just a little stupid. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is carrying a child, she can not be happy with her life. But after Freddy returned and he defeated him so easily in the fourth movie, he is not going to be very light on him. But anyway, she wants to have her child and the world born again. Have you ever thought of Freddie's parents? A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out how Frederick's childhood was, and it is probably one thing that could defeat him. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child is just an insult to all bad movies and series. I do not think anyone with this sequel could be happy. The story was really silly, I mean, it probably worked, but again, it was just misguided. I know that if you want to see the Nightmare Signal of the Elm Street series, you will see it, but I will not really recommend it, at least it is not worth it in my opinion. <br /> </ br> 3/10
