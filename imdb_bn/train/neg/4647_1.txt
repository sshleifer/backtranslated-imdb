The half review was good so I took an opportunity for $ 10. Sure Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk but it was not so much. After the next plot, she can be the mother of another actress and she is expanding it to the fallen documentary maker for the young woman. It is not funny that it is nothing but a waste of time. Boogie Knights was based on people who were in adult art, which was never in the industry. Nowadays popular Gonzo videos can become frustrating with what is popular among ridiculous adult films, and in the early 1970's, the big orchestras were bigger and bigger orgy for 5 minutes to do bigger and better things.
