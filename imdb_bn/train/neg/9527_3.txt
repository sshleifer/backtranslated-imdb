I am trying to track Google through this bad phrase, "I hate the people of bad people and kill people in his house" and this movie is only. I think I saw the part of this movie when I was about 10 years old when it was running on the wire. It made quite an impression! This is a movie that kids know that they will not see and when their parents switch to the channel I will switch their channel. When I saw who was cast, I could not believe that these good actors have such a great movie. Then again, if you want to kill people who want to cheat their wife, then this is an interesting movie. Also, if I think, there are some pretty interesting incognito-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest end of all time, but still ... memorable.
