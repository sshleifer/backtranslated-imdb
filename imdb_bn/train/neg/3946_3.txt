I grew up reading both the comics and books, Modesty Blaise, and she really is a heroine for me. Although Quantin Tarantino is not a great fan, I have heard a few years ago that he is considering making a movie: Can he finally give Modicey a wonderful big screen treatment, which he deserves? I heard My Name Is Momiest a few months ago and checked the stars given here, and it was not surprising that the score was not too high, if the heart was not done properly then the heart. So I did not read any reviews and instead see the film, and well, I finished viewing it, and I was surprised, and sad, and yes, very angry, too. Moderate Blues-Character is transforming into a movie that does not give viewers or fans anything. <br /> <br /> It seems almost everything is sub-par and irrelevant, although I certainly wanted to see some actors in other movies where they were right so I can not blame them. But screenplay and direction ... my God, why are you making such shit so bad with the production values ​​compared to your average TV-film? I do not know the background of this movie and I really do not really want to know, but I just can not imagine how the world can tell Tarantino directly with the head that he loves humility and keeps his name? She just lost the respect of a huge amount in my eyes. The director was not the right person for this work and I can really thank him for destroying the night. <br /> <br /> I give this picture 3 stars and those stars are bad actor and technical quality. The other seven stars are absent, this film was not good. Oh well, hopefully, in a little while, there will be a serious production of the Modedia Blaise movie, which has some other goals than stealing money from humble fans. Although people like Tarantino decide that I do not breathe.
