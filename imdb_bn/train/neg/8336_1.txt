How do they make this?! Presenting himself as a Copper comedy, misbegotten "$" is essentially mumbling the sentence fragments of two hours people. Generally reliable Warren BT watches screwed, and usually the Sunny Goldie acts like a depressing situation. For Gert Frabe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - is pretty much more beautiful than his character here. Even the LSD champagne bottle can not save the person's lack of sustainedness. <br /> <br /> Am I picking up this movie from "Plan 9 Outdoor Space"? I will not do anything if someone does not pay me. "P9FOS" is silently created but endless; This is stupidly made and you just feel like your brain melted out your ears. While acting on "Shampoo", Warren BT and Goldie Haun were created for this, but then they played with the terrific "City and Country". Maybe they just can not act in movies. Above all, I would have to break this off my skin off the clock again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remixes should be done again with Jackie Chan. Then I'll give it a look.
