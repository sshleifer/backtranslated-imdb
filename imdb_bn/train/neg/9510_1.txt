Sugar and Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. This image crosses Heathers and Bring bricks and fails. When I saw in January, I went to my girlfriend for the last half-hour of the movie and talked to my mobile phone that the film was so disgusting. I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut, I'll probably check it out, but this is PG-13 trash movie *** and the worst kind ***. Maybe if there is something else in the film, it's okay. But the gags are terrible and the acting is terrible. Worse than a trauma film.
