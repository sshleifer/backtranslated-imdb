If you plan to watch this movie, please review it. I usually do not post my views about what I saw on television, but there was a waste of my life that was a bit productive to get bad taste from my mouth. Narrowing this film will take a lot longer because there are so many mistakes in it. I just say, please never see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it would be a waste of your waste. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is two things; Completely inactive, or work for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you'll be really sorry to see this movie!
