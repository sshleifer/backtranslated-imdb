This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skills, but the script is incredibly shallow and hairy. You have a really serious dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half an hour, I could not accept it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" just does not work and is really quite annoying; His attempts to slopastic humor have become flat and they have reached the line, as he reads the script right on the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Look Wilson. Before agreeing to do this, did he not read the script, or promised the big profit to father Jesse (Jessica's father and filmmaker)? I hope he knows better than signing in other movies like this. Louis Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing a deadly face on his face to suffer through bad conversations. Also, I think 8 out of 10 of the previous commentators of this movie probably 8 were, in fact, Baba Jao was involved in the movie for a better rating of the movie. None of their right mind would really be entertaining this movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, is not it? Maybe buy some acting lessons?
