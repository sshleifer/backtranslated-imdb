<br /> <br /> I recently saw this torture in my film program, and I thought it was scary to me, as I said in my tagline, it was inspired, traged, small and wonderful self-important. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a fan of film, and all the things that the film has to offer. If I want to see a documentary at the Cannes Festival, I'll look at A & E ... and probably will have more purpose in it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. <br /> <br />
