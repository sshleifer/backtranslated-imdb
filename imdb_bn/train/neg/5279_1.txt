My friends can usually be associated with a lot of disappointing movies but it was too bad for us, even when it was finally seen. It was just so annoying and unoriginal. "Hot girls" played in this movie can not even monitor me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The more I saw him I wanted to break my screen. (You know I'm talking about Fat ugly baby) <br /> <br /> I think other film companies should be sued by them. Okay, this is a good idea but all of this movie was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can only be seen by your friends, you can save abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing good.
