In theory, there will be a form of movie entertainment. Although it excludes documentary and other experimental forms of film making; Most movies, especially the genre, do not just tell the story or the message, they must entertain their target audience in some ways. All this is not saying that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production value or low budget, a bad movie is a boring one. "Hellburn" or "sheltered" Damned as a known US citizen is simply a bad movie because it does not involve, and immediately annoying and tiring. It has a very good compound, it only develops worse and The middle act is not good. On the other hand, the film might be a fine or even a classic B-movie, but here it is only a bad effort to make the film <br /> <br /> The director Philip J. Jones tells James Bishop's story (Matt Stacy), a young psychologist who got his dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital, but the old refuge seems to be a secret secret. After the patient's mysterious death and continuous rumors of Satan's practice, James decides to find out what's happening; only to find the boss's extraordinaryity To find out, Dr. McArchat (Bruce Penn), who believes that the bishop is becoming insane as his patients. <br /> <br /> While premiere is very attractive, the film pages should be very much desired. A supernatural mind In an effort to create the thriller, Jones finds the easy way and creates a movie filled with every click on this movie. Of course, there are lots of great films that are filled with clich√©s; But everything in "Hellbar" is damaged and things become a cheap jumble to move, causing annoying and predictable stories. <br /> <br /> Actually, the moderator is mostly in the role. Big exception: Bruce Penn offers such a top-rated performance that the film is considered to be incompetent. Fatty stasies are very weak and the rest of the character is very weak due to forgotten performance. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, a thing about "Hellburn" is to be written; It is very similar to a visual appearance budget and the modern day big budget Hollywod "Awful" produced very similar. Also, make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the design for the main opponent is quite good. Sadly, the rest of the special effects create a huge contrast with horror and old, make-up and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie terrible result in a movie with some good things risen by its serious flaws. Hardcore horror or B-movie fans may be interested in its premises but this is a boring and tedious experience. 3/10
