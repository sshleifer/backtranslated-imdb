Underground Comedy Movie, Probably the worst train ruins I've ever seen Thankfully, I did not pay for this movie, and my friend unwittingly agreed to see again that it was so awful that he wanted to prove to me how awful he was. I love off color comedy. I at least figured it out that would be and I would be entertained. No, instead of acting was so awful, "joke" was very impressive, and was where the plot was found. I could not hold that against this movie so it was probably not supposed to be a plot. It is tragic that the most interesting thing in a comedy is that an old woman bat with her bat. Bats the head ... A man dressed in the uniform of Batman belt uniforms. extremely happy. Just talent I felt like watching the movie that its makers made it and smiled violently with their friends about it. Perhaps we just could not understand this inner joke. Or perhaps it is the worst part of the trash ever made and it should be locked in a vault and should be dumped in the Arctic ocean. <br /> <br /> PSS does not buy this movie!
