The worst tragedy of the 20 year old Van Dam film or American Nijon etc. is a worse battle scene. <br /> <br /> In real terms, it is not a skill in the eyes of the whole film, which is like a cast of wood sculpture. <Br> <br /> Just look for this bad movie, it may be acceptable in the 80's, but it's a 2006 movie, I do not have much love for this movie because it was not born in the 80s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can see unintenial humor at how stupid.
