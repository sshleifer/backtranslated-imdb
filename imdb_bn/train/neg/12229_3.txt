This movie started well, I felt I was seeing an adult version of Safefield. Very soon I started to question the main character's situation and activities, they did not answer what they were doing. All the performances were fantastic but there were only a few moments of few scenes where they were actually funny. Dan Curtis was amazing. I liked him in this role. To cast an agent, his agent needs to show this film. See the first few scenes and then look for something better, or else you will lose yourself in this world. I found it at a video shop a bin. It cost me two dollars and because of the rareness of this movie, I think it's a good price.
