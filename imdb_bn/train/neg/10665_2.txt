About three minutes in this thing, I started fast progress, only during intercourse (why are such bad films always included such beautiful women?). I was done in ten minutes, and would have wanted to get my money back from a broken rental store. Those who are writing this movie will be approved by MPA. Come to the authors - Bad people always come in the car with the bombs powered by the remote control of the good people! It's been done from the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add to the humiliation of injury, the "wrapping" at the end was so subtle that it could come from an action movie written in the last 25 years. Bart Reynolds was good, but he should concentrate on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - run away! Escape!
