As a result of my review of the Screamed House, many people think that I'm a 14-year-old who thinks the scramble is considered "classic". In this case I'm not 30 years old and watching the horror movies for most of my life. But confession, I'm not an 80-year-old child, which has grown up in Slashar / Zambi / Ghost / cannabal etc ... The type of horror film - so usually I like filling movies that are more graphic and faster-speed. Anyone who can appreciate different music, painting or movies in this case - but not necessarily something - why can I appreciate why I can enjoy such movies ... I only ... <br / <br /> Highly dust and tired film about a school that is scratched for a terrible girls in the house. To keep the line of girls in school (or whips in some cases ...) by handing over heavy handed over to the school. He has a little boy who wanders around and wanders around the girls (do not have their nightguards low?)), And meanwhile girls disappear from school because they are victims of a murderer. Look around the campus ... <br /> <br /> I can see why such scouts are often compared to Sosuria (which is the best form of a film in my opinion ...) the school itself and the interaction between girls and their parents - but This photo is so neutral and unknown that I can only stay awake. I'm all for "Tons" and "Suspense" in awesome films - but this picture is not for me. Thankfully, I'm not expecting this episode, so I can not say that I was really frustrated - the room that Scratched made it more powerful, that I personally do not usually enjoy the most horrific movies, from the old 70's. This is not a strict and fast rule, but what I've been enjoying seems clearly more than an exception. Probably for the fearful fans "must be seen" who enjoys more different and proposed horror movies - but I really do not know many fans of such stuff, I really can not offer it ... 4/10
