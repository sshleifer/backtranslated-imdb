I was really looking forward to seeing it, I love Danny Dyer and think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The start was interesting. I liked the relationship between two stars. It quickly leaned toward the original plot, which was attacked by a group of strangers, and during the rape of Ander, the diarrhea was badly beaten. Then they decided to go for some revenge. It feels good, is not it? Well, that's not it. The story gets annoying and as well as tracks, and some things get really weird. I can not give any details, but things can happen that I do not want to look for one. I want to give all the doubt the benefit of the movie, and I really wanted to choose this one. It just does not work. I'm 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
