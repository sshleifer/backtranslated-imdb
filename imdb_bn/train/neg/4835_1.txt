Catherine Bigelow and Mark Bowl are already preparing a series about a young American corporation in Afghanistan. He also works as a highly qualified surgeon and is walking around Kabul freely, driven by NATO soldiers wounded. Especially in the difficult mission, he officially picked a sniper rifle and shot Osama bin Laden some 3,000 yards away. Eventually he was promoted to the sergeant, but sniper and surgeon were unable to decide between the carrier, so he left the army completely. A year later, he was frustrated with civilian life and joined the navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing white uniforms.
