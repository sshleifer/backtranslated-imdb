I always admired Susan Sarandon for her honesty and integrity as her talent as well as her personal life. I think it is weird that he would appear in a film that distorted the event. Rescue from his character from the South Pole was operated by Edmonton's Canadian Charter Company, Alberta Canadian Design and Twin Iter are flying by flying aircraft. The journey was stopped by the US Air Force, the Navy and the Coast Guard, overcoming their power. A few years later, the same company rescued a man from a South Pole base to get a man out. I think that this film is very strong and faces a terrible woman with horrible work. I was unable to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and inform the producers why they should show the rescue plane as a US Hercules.
