Anyone known about my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be busy with a nasty period of time. There are many movies I do not like, for some unreasonable reasons, I felt the desire to review. However, if I'm curious about the name of any bad movie, then do not see Translivia more than 6-5000. Without question, all this time takes the title. 1 terrible film. I can not believe I really created this clanker from the beginning to the end! <br /> <br /> This is clearly meant to catch the fragrance of Mel Brooks' young Frankenstein, but where it was a fun trail in horror film heritage, it is a great and confusing attempt to be frustrating from the weaker element to the smiling. Jaff Goldblum and Ed Begolly Jr. feel ashamed as a pair of journalists in modern day Translivene (probably they thought they were destroyed in this ugly state). During their research, they came up against all the major monsters from past superstitions like vampires, bairvoles, and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can manage this film for his bold ending, is bored through their heart to relieve them from bitter pain. It identifies the carrier Nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it gives strange horror entertainment results.
