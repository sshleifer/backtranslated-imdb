This movie should not be classified as a movie. Although it is more than 10 years old, it should never be funded and it is a stimulus in the Australian film industry, which is now making such bright movies as "Dish" <br /> <br /> Actors can not act, music Being ... must be stupid, not music, the storyline is completely incomplete and the struggle for sitting at it. <br /> <br /> Do not see this picture. It is a complete waste of your time.
