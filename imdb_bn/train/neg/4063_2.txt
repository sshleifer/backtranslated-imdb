Faat Kine has a really good view. The title character gets into an argument with another woman and after threats, Faat Kine spray her face. The scene works because the law is unexpected, bizarre and funny at the same time. In one example, author / director Osman Sabbane gives the audience a character that can be easily rooted, an interesting movie character that can be valuable for two hours. In the scene, he presented a brave woman who is brave in his actions. For the rest of the movie, he seems to present another thing. <br /> <br /> Tone is everywhere. It is not true that all movies must be clearly fit in a particular color, but I do not think that fat cine fits in any way. It is believed that this is a play, although there are moments of such a wide comedy (sprayed face) that it can not be taken seriously. On the other hand, the picture must have been a problem in the film, not a comedy about a lot of serious issues. There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama. Unfortunately, Camb√© does not find that balance. Instead, in one scene after another, they enter into each other without excessive rhythm or cause, leaving two different tones hanging in the air. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The film ends with a large group where disputes of all the letters are resolved, not only are they resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene, probably for twenty minutes. Because at the point where the rest of the scene has become frustrating, the recurring ending with the repetition from the last to the beginning is particularly difficult, which creates a frustrating viewing experience. Perhaps it's hard on Faat Kine too. I'm the right audience for it. I did not feel anything towards the character and I had no connection to any part of the story. There are stories that might be able to find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. However, I was unable to do this and thus could not recommend it.
