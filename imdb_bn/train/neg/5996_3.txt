Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Franks <br /> <br /> Starred: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Carbite <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbird go! <br /> <br /> And so Thunderbirds started, my childhood darling When I heard that they were going to make Thunderbird movies, I was happy. I could not wait to see the thunderbird 2 to save the thunderbolt, Thunderbird 4 would sink deeper? You get the idea. I just could not wait. Then the film was finally released in August 2004. Critics banned it, but I still wanted to go. Finally, as long as the heart was in the same place, the more I had what I had. So I'm sitting in the theater, only 50 in the crowd? All of them were less than thirty and less. Probably most probably the most painful theater experience that I have ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The film (which is considered as a preview) focuses on the youngest Alan Tracy (Brady Carbot) of Trey's family. He spent his days that he could rescue the rest of his family, but he was too small. One day, he finally got the chance when Hood (Ben Kingsley) trapped the rest of his family until Thunderbird 5 (space station). Meanwhile, Hood could steal all the money from his Bank of England before hiding Henchenman of the Hood and rescuing his family. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbird. When you read it in the paper. Once it gets to wear the film ?? What we do is a mess in our hands First off, the film was a lot like for the children, original shows. However, Gary Anderson treated us as an adult and gave us plots that were perfectly developed for children's programming. On the other hand, it lowers the plot down, because it tries to create Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to apply to the Thunderbird series and children fans, not completely absent. Harm jokes, cartoon sounds, and stupid antonics are not funny at this moment, and I'm sure Jonathan Franks never wanted to point out this directive. <br /> <br /> Everybody, everyone considers the script that they are all given, gave a solid performance. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as the Hood, playing a very good part. My only complaint about the characters is Hood's Henchen, who is separated from the Old Lonnie Tune Cartoon, surprisingly enough, kids take them easy. <br /> <br /> What is strange about this? When I was watching the movie I made fun. But once the lamp got over, I realized that the movie was fairly bad, I was 8 dollar lighter, and my time went two hours. A guilty pleasure? Probably. Yet, Thunderbirds is a forgotten mess. Instead of a big "go", I will recommend you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the film could be like the first ten minutes, it was a great movie for Thunderbird's name. However, we get a movie that only Mary Thunderbirds fans (if you want to snooze your childhood) or be very annoyed with the annoying. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbird is 1 Â½ big.
