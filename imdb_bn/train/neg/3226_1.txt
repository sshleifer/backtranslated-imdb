We reached the ceiling of uncertainty with this movie. Originally, the dinosaurs were driven by some strange old birds named Newyas (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, in New York, everybody wishes children and decides that she will show the wishes of children to bring dinosaurs in modern times to shameful exploitation. Dinosaurs eat this thing that makes them smart (screenlines were not too bad). However, does it seem strange that all children of the world want to bring New York dinosaurs to the modern era? Why children do not want to stop famine? Disease? War? Come on, come on! Is this power nothing better than Newyas? Finally, when the dinosaurs come towards modern times, they start singing, dancing and destructive destruction (Basically the thing that you see on the bad LSD trip, I mean you can play T-Rex Golf and jumping on Balloons Spider-Man?) . They end up in Circus and Newyas Brother Square (???), which sign a blank deal with children with dinosaurs. Why? Why would kids sign a blank deal ??? Squies says that if the dinosaurs take something ... "brain-drain" that he should go to children. Instead of dinosaurs, Bad Skriya tearing off the organs, give her terms and conditions. What ?! This stupid! They can only make him man-made, break the agreement, eat it and then go with the kids. I think the filmmakers are trying to show that the violence is bad, which essentially escapes the dinosaurs and squares around Squuyes and apparently eats them completely. Oh yes, that's not all that violent! We're back, no idea, it's not fun, it's stupid, it's stupid, bad writing and the biggest plot hole committed in the film. Even for a baby film ... this BAD.
