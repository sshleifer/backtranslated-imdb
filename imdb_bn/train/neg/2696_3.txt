I know John Cinglton's "Cause of a Smart" guy, he made Boy's N. the Hood, so how did he write and point out this? This is an accident pilot "going to college for the first time" Tin Soap is a parade of annoying stereotypes, and to create a commercial proposal, clich√©s with neutral violence. Who will be the victims of the victim of prey? Angered by a group of Nu-Nazi people will be attacked by iron (and will wake up with blacks and Jews - just laughing!) Lawrence Fishburn's unclear reactionary history, even Professor bothered me and I love people, it's like everyone involved with this movie. The plot lost Of course, except Busta Rhymes. Big up
