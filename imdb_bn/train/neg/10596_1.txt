Van Damme What else can I say? Bill Goldberg We're starting. Now we know that this movie is going to be really awesome. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie in TBS, I knew it would be bad. But I did not think it would be bad. Plot horror, van dame is getting old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his movies are also good. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie. Do not see it. Ever. I will not even pay to see this image. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - A wonderful, action-packed adventure journey in his heart. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but the marketers want to think like us, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
