I really wanted to love this show. I really did it really. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < James, his mandatory "hag" Andrea, James, has a chance to have a good looking, well-liked 15-suit (or referred to as the show "companion") with the help of thirty-something. The only problem is that their half straight and James does not know this. If James loves homosexuals, then they will visit New Zealand, and if he likes it directly, then the straight man will get $ 25,000. How can it be fun?! Hold my hand, roams around: <br /> <br /> The most boring problem of this event is Bachelor himself. James is a wonderful smile and a body with your ideal young and successful gay people, you probably can take two eyes before the shrimp to your local bar Greenwich Gereus. The leading people crossed me because why they led James to throw. God knows there are many hot and vivacious gay men who have died on TV. <br /> <br /> From its rather physical appearance, James is as attractive and exciting as a piece of chocolate. Even, he has this arrogant, shining boring horror. However, if James was standing against a blank, white wall, he'd meld it right into it. I really can not recall if I really listen to singles or significant things. He is that annoying and forgotten. Indeed, a companion flat out advises him that he does not feel a connection. I was the best part of that show. Also, James speaks with a provocative boring throat. Sound filename or sound mancillin, but there is no **** ing segue tones between the sentences ... so that it is painful to sit. I hate it for the event that I was running, "Please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate face is a hug <br /> <br /> <br /> We have a good show. A clear bunch that does not look at anything. Vapid evenly, they seem to be different from one person to the next, "Hey there is a pink highlight. He has his curly hair. "Again, surprisingly, casting decisions seem to be the motto of this show, but it may be hackneyed for typing custom roles, but it is more entertaining than the disagreeable drones, however, they are still all James Which is not difficult to do). You know that you have a problem when some scooter Is actually more attractive than the great and leading people. And who seems to have more fun around the other with the suitors' leaders? <br /> <br /> I was thinking that the ID points mentioned in the message boards were really true: Men are more hot than gay men. <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, I do not say that all the gay boys were ugly and annoying, actually I was somewhat beautiful among them. It was only Brahma that they were only in comparison to men who were seen in shows like A Shot at Love with Tila Tacilah or Belhartite alone. <br /> <br /> I do not know how fast I hurry forward this show time. I can take a lead character as attractive as a cardboard box, I can accept hypocritical, apathetic suitors, but please love me for a little relaxation for God's love. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, conspiracy, sex or excitement you will be disappointed. The biggest "drama" may have been a boy in New York that still comes from a scooter (Dancal!). Since I can guarantee you that as a title, this is just the thing that is remotely similar to the contradiction of this show. <br /> <br /> Surely there is a twist, but if you have any similarity to Gaydaar, it will be easy to understand who is it (it was not difficult at all, I was wrong once). This show is stacking its chips so much that it Failed to deliver anywhere. <br /> <br /> We can keep an eye on exciting activities like James & Co such as Western step dance, shopping for gifts, going to a pet zoo and how to learn gay caroes. to yawn. Sure sure you have occasional taples dance but since everyone is worried when care. This is one of the main problems of the show: No one seems to enjoy themselves - they are just trying hard to get a good time to attend. The facts are all weird and hairy because you really can not blame them. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no physical aspect. There is no cuddling, no applause, no kiss (!), No indication of any kind. It was just an annoying date that "OK, I would go back to my ugly, Sydney operahouse residence (the peeps quickly to the lips) CYA." This show so ridiculous **** ridiculous it. I do not understand that they do not want to play the gender-obsessed nature of the game, but come to ****. Those who watch reality TV shows want more than studiofish loose and kurt kissing. This event refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry, if this is a long wind, I feel that these problems need to be resolved. I appreciate Bravo for the first show of this nature, but managing this show that was inconsistently disrespectful is frustrating. My three points briefly: annoying + annoying + annoying = go to something else. You will have to wait more fun at a doctor's office for an appointment, at least have them interesting magazines.
