Sorry Nobody has to say it. This was really / a dull movie. Probably deserving, but still dull I cried almost annoying with it while watching it. Acting is quite awesome, the story is drawn and expected, score and camera-full working standards and unexciting. This is a film that does not allow you to hate (because it is disabled people), but I hate it, almost everyone hates it. Critics were so kind to this movie that it was interesting. I am not allowed to be their purpose. It won the prize - which I remember correctly. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining. I can not compare to what I saw playing.
