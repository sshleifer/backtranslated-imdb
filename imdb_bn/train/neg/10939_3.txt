This movie is my worst performance which I have ever seen! Some scenes are coming through the nail floor like real. This nail trap catches these bad guys. As you rest left the rest of the movie. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the total of 100 movies of all time. I can not believe that there are signals! I want to see the next whip movie R.O.T.O.R. Can ROO really be worse than this? <br /> <br />
