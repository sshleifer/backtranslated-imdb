In most cases I saw a bad movie. In the first half with some engaging, terse dialogue between suspicious characters in a late night time. The film then proceeded to the visible scene of visible shock (read study) and without any humanity or any other reading, without a review or projecting. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go outside, but the director was present to show this and my arrogance prevented me from showing him insult. Yet the time is valuable (the director himself saw in his article) and I really was lost in the second half of this period. <br /> <br /> Three main letters of the first half are preserved. Movies, especially women's leadership.
