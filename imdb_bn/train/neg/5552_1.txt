This show comes with fast catching position as travel channel. It is billed as reality, but in reality it is the pure prime time soap opera. It tries to use foreign people as a competition in a phone, and then reach the hook audience in the competition soap opera style. <br /> <br /> This is the first CBS game show to take credit from the pioneer - bit clock - Discover and defeat the situation for its competitors to try and overcome. Then win the winning money. They can spice up more with little interaction in character, even better. The game format is in contrast to the bit clock, but the actual achievement of this series is to escape from reality. <br /> <br /> This show contains elements of various successful past programs. True television, rarely, but if you have a desire to compete, local or competition, then this is your cup cup. If you are not, this whole series I say, driveling dripping with the wine. This is the trend that began in 2000, another show hidden behind the reality label. <br /> <br /> It is gentle and well-produced, so it can last for a while. Finally, so let's run again on the Giligan Islands, Green Aces, The Beverly Hillsbis and Bradie Bunch. This is not just employing professional actors. The level of intelligence is about the same.
