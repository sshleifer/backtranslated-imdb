Okay, aside from psychedelic background imagery, the information presented here was good. I could have done the song besides (it was not bad music, it just is not suitable for this movie). <br /> <br /> The director of films for films is often a pagan view of Christ's existence and a wonderful comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life vs. mythological statues / gods such as Mithra and Dionyses' life. Then he presented a 'OK' case by highlighting the chronological order of Christianity, but that does not explode me. <br /> <br /> If the director is stuck with the incident and continues with them, then the film will be good. However, at this moment in the film, Gibson's "Imitation of Christ" and a Christian private school which was attended by the director during his youth was personally divided into a group of grateful attacks. In an interview with his old Principal, (which, of course, is discussed when the director is established under false accusations) I think the Director Director played like a child. He was asking good questions, however, like the movie, this interview attacked the attack of these private private schools, not Christians. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in some information, look at the first 30 minutes or more and then close.
