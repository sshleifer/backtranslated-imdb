This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors You can say that they are trying hard in a turd Polish, but we all know that you can not. Writing is so obvious and obvious, it is sad to see trying to sell. This humorous and penning is so much fun, so it's hard to believe by signing a good actor. <br /> <br /> She says it's so awful that it's a difficult time for us to stay away from the screen. We just need to know where this trainwreck goes. But this is only because we have been caught on TV. If we actually paid for this, we would have hated. <br/> <br/> So it gets 2 stars to be humorous / impressively bad. And accessory music (opposing the hard-hard Hard-Indie soundtrack) is a remake of an episode of the funny-haired Scooby-Doo ... but not good.
