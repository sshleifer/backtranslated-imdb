I really do not really like this movie that's all. It was not really fun and in some cases it was just stupid stupid. Rob Schneider was certainly a very gifted personality and his performance was good, for that it seemed only to be a real waste for him. I mean that some parts were okay and some were ridiculous, but it's about it. This loud aloud drew my attention aloud, that some beautiful beauties were present and I was not the only one to watch the movie because of that, but in this case it was only a fake, even in the slightest case of release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD: Purchase DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If your generation has a sense of humor, why not?
