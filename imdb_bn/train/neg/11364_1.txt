The first ten minutes penalty for making an international film in Belgium is fine: you see the actual chaos of the set, the producer of the nervous breakdown, the cold director-director (Mickey Roche), the bad tempered star, etc. You've seen everything before, but it's good. But then! The rest of the time only repeats itself: again in the same ten minutes over. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, even played bad, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Roar has two good minutes when his character talks about his firm ** cad up career where reality and fiction are seen. Together, that makes 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
