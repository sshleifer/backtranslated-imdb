(278 48 comments have been useful and counted ...) <br /> <br /> People look and feel like a picture - The intellectual cheat is "idealism" which hides behind the symphony. Che's charisma and appearance have a lot to do with his image, which has been misinterpreted by his leftist campaign (such as the film). <br /> <br /> I do not know what's worse! Must be seated by Che's assassination squad or within 4 hours of this sordbarghian garage. It is not questioned why this pet project was made, but they took so long. By "their", I certainly mention the "secret" love of left-wing Hollywood and Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... to take your choice). I was impressed that for almost a decade such an uncertain prejudice campaign was finally adopted for at least talented liberal directors of Tinslawn. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robins? Warren BT? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbara Stresand Even? This is a mystery. These stylish "artists" often involve themselves in similarly, politically unilateral projects, but Che Guevara, who is most popular and well-known, is not yet a movie subject. <Br /> <br /> "Guerrilla" has an all-hallmark of an American truth-bending story on an epic scale; For example, "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", almost like none. Film star Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary However, it can be the work of the controversial and criminal person, however, one thing can not be taken away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a wealthy family - that is why Dell Toro only fits the bill with the bill. Dell Toro may be an attractive, charismatic actor, and he can be physically like Guevara, but he does not take any intellectual qualities above, so he considers Guevara to be very primitive. Brot, Philips and Frankanka Incident, the mediator casts the director just to lack the correct judgment. <br /> <br /> The movie is very slowly (no surprise) and apparently selfish. Even Kubrick's brilliant director considered carefully filming a film that would cross the 3-hour mark, so it is very sophisticated that this is the Soderberg, who has only made one or two firm films and at the beginning of his career, he thinks that his grandmother Grandness The task was up. If you think the length of the movie indicates that most of Che's life has been shown here - then think again. Soderberg has focused on the end of the cadre, and the film is a complex jungle fuzzy, full of spoken ideals of guevara. (Not the norm of psychotherapeutic.) I am surprised that this highly respected director will actually ignore some of the earlier life of a cheek. He actually considers it very reluctant? 600 people are not interested in genocide, huh? Amazing Some well-known directors could not fit one or more full biographies in 4 hours of movie compared to this highly acclaimed Charlotte. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By spreading such historical error, consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God should not forbid pulling the sacred image of Che), Soderberg does not prove himself a humanist - a fake picture that Hollywood and pop music personalities are making difficult for all their careers - But the opposite: he is worried only about ideas, sometimes those whose ideas are examined ( Like guinea pigs). The worst types like Soderbergh and Elitists are; Such people often have a secret contempt for "proleteriat" (what a stupid word) they're supposed to do with the supposed. <br /> <br /> All students of the world wear che's images on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. She is an intelligent, unauthorized, often emblematic personality for young people, who think that keeping the person's face on their chests, in any way, feels them "mad", intellectuals, hip or attractive. Indeed, wearing a Che shirt only identifies the total solitude and total dilemma of self-education. (You do not want to know more about a person before publishing his face before the world?) Che-now-now-cleaned image of the clich√© has become commonplace as Bart Simpson's coffee cup. All "Che-Wears" will probably learn more about Merge's blue hair, which they can read about Fidel Castro's dead companion. <br /> <br /> <br /> This mongrel "standard" would eventually seem to be resting. It seems that mankind will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Poll Pot, Castro, Miloseweich, Seussaceu, Iron Curtain, have killed one crore people, physically and / or mentally more than one billion people have been destroyed through this system ... So which of these things is huh? <br /> <br /> Dell Toure won a ear award, just how ears and other European festivals work - and should be astonishingly surprisingly to vote. Hint: Shan Pen was led by Jury many days ago. <br /> <br /> Visit My Music Related Rants: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
