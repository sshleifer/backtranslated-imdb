I remember that day, Nindino Power Comics, which was the same artwork as the show ... and then came the word that this show is coming to a television near me! I was not chaotic, but it was weird ... I was curious about how bad this program was. My friends all said that this show had no meaning and was very stupid for the simple people like me (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with less hope. <br /> <br /> WHAT A Wonderful Experience !!!!!!!!!!! First off, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how much fanboys drool on Tiff, it's sad. How I hate a good person owned by a restaurant, whatever the chef Casasaki (or its unreasonable name). Bad move, 4 kid TV! Escargoon King Dedede (who sucks big time in this show) is nothing but a beneficial adviser and I hate the company's face that supplies Dedede with horrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I started to hate Kiri, because it is clear that Nintendo Kiki was very sad to gain some popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario to fight for coolness, and Kirby will always have nothing but puff a tiny little cream of homosexuality. NUF said !!!
