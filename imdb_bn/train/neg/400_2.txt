I rarely make this comment, but I was forced to refrain from others in the pain I suffered for watching this movie. Overall story and so stupid and impossible at the details that you simply can not suspend unbelief. The problem starts initially, when you see a new researcher surrounded by a new research porter and a team looks like it looks like a castle, watching the Capitol building in Washington, D. C. Such a life in government salaries? Hah! It just gets worse. In the end, when bad people start killing good people, the next group is so stupid that you want to die for it to clean the gene pool. Special effects are good - a producer can buy it - and the main actor is good in other movies, but here the screenplay and direction are stupid. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhwen's stupid, stupid movie (Shows, Starships Truppers), but this film should be frustrating. He's just plain bad.
