This is one of the most brutal rewrites I have ever seen. If they want to create a movie with a weird story, it should refrain from the title of a fine book. There is no relation between this film except for Wolf's books and titles. I do not think change if they help flow to a story on the screen. The least change should not hit the final product. The last scene of the film is painful. The actor is miscast. The director and / or the screen writer probably could not make a long comedy or decided to promote a vague suggestion. <br /> <br /> Try this book if you've watched and disliked this movie. If you have seen and liked this movie, read the book.
