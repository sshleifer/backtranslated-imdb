Well Astronaut Steve West is sitting in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you did not see the sun with Saturday's ring until you were alive" commented that, always the obvious sweet sunlight flows through the window, suddenly he has a nose bleed. Then, in the West, back to some secret hospital, a molten gelatine mass that becomes a bismarck and drives a chakkar nurse through a fake glass door. Apparently, the West "dissolves and becomes strong", which makes this nonsense as much knowledge as possible in pure, lazy-brain movies. Then this dope is trying to show information like "Army Brass", who sees information like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies), but Google is melting people because he sees all the killings takes place around. She is melted because she attacks a molten old couple. She makes a terrible actress scream and cries shamelessly for about 10 minutes because she is melted. He is melted because he is melted. Immersed Rick Baker's FX is supposed to be a star here, but they just show hockey. The film is shot badly and everything looks so dark and it becomes very difficult to find out what can be done - it will not help anyone. Who says MooCow cut cheese with this ?? : = 8p ps - "Did you get any crackers?"
