It got Nickeloddon and Nick Jr. with big advertising and it was like my son wanted us to see it. Between the DVD and the theater, I've seen so many things from Wonderful (Incredible, Shake) really bad (Wal-E, Brother Beer). But it's easily the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or kids. Is this a "when will this stupid thing end?" Kind of experience? All right, it's targeting the kids (or better - it's more insane than 3 people), but I did not see anything that is expected, iterative, and moving slowly. Then you finally get annoyed while enjoying the end of the movie, ultimately this wicked thing seems to you that it is a set up to make a joke, but not here - it's serious, even though it is hard to know that they are trying to achieve. 3-D effect ... Yes, if you do not see any viewer, it's a big deal, otherwise it does not appear (this seems like the same process if you look on the screen without glasses). Even my son was finally bored. My wife and I both looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Every respect is bad
