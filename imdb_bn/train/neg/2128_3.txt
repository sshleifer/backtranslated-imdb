Restoration of essential, and it can not come near capturing the original charm. Because the extreme length is more than a few yawn inducing part. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and in most cases it is not acting, but direction, set, costume etc. It has a blatant negligence for the details of time. Vanessa Williams is the only member to show any talent that Ten Daly is not very bad. They must be left alone alone enough. Good singing (Vanessa Williams) is poor (everyone else). See the original version 1963 and skip this one. There are not many recommendations here.
