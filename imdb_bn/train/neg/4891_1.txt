I want to make some things clear. I am not familiar with Ming-liang saasai film, and I am very familiar with art. I grew up in seventy times in Goddard, Fallini, Bergman, Bartolukie and many others. <br /> <br /> Art art movies were really ART; Like paint People were able to express their inner feelings, if others understood something, they would not really be worried. They were beyond the commercial value; Just look for some old Antonio (or initial Picasso) and you can understand. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with Tien Bien Yo Dyo Yun (Weaver Cloud). It's a convenience film, festival judge, and a lot of critics to make fooling, some do not say much. <br /> <br /> The story does not give any sense. The lack of water makes the government useful for liquids. A girl of frustration, stolen water from the public bathroom WC. Starting a porno (neighbor) is trying to make a movie with an actress she does not seem comfortable with. There are some romantic awakening in the girl and porn star. This laugh ends with a sex scandal (pornographic) that many people are surprised at, but I believe it is less exciting than American pie or history. <br /> <br /> Never talk about two main characters. Sometimes, a musical number appeared in 60 styles and explains (through a song) what is happening in the mind of the characters. These video clips are really welcomed because only people look at each other except for a previous scene, a conversation or a song, sometimes taking 4, 5 or more minutes, which is a lot more in movie time. <br /> <br /> There are some bits about "hard to do without love", "selfish mind of porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious, this film is intended to fool festive jury and critics (stay away from it). There are some incognito scenes (within the range of Taiwan censorship) and many things are open, but nothing goes away or it goes somewhere. <br /> <br /> Movies have received some (controversial) significant value in the film festivals, and the movie has been an unexpected commercial success (I have seen the movie in France and the theater is packed). <br /> <br /> Do not fool, however. This movie is not new or original or even originally called or illustrated. It's annoying and empty; Really a fraud in the public. Boogie Knights (which I did not really like), Intimacy and 9 tracks are a lot of good films.
