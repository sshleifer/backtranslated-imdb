The only reason being that this movie's rating is 1 is not one of the zero selection options. With a thin conspiracy in the depression era's cobbler soup, terrible acting, and special effects from the "Thunderbirds" TV series, it is surprising that Wyomdark did not kill the director to keep this black mark in his resume. Even according to the 1950s decade, special effects are harmful, without the submersible order of some water. I can only assume that it was nominated for the special effects, because there was no other than 20,000 leagues under the sea. It is certainly their only competition if there was no competition for that year's Disney. I would not recommend the film for the strong core submarine movie buff, because the most realistic view of the submarine was limited to one shot where the upper part of the ocean's water could be dropping. There are some more, better, sub-movies that you can enjoy in this era, such as 20,000 league or torpedo runs.
