Many novels, dramas and short story writers. Dr. Somerset Masham (1874-1965) was considered among the great authors of the world during his lifetime, and although his fame has been lost for years, his work has continued to honor and public issues Published in 1944, Rogers Edge is the story of the first World War, whose spiritual illumination encounters shallow western values ​​in search. This was Mahmah's last major novel - and it was very popular. The novels of the novels have been internal and spiritual in nature, it was an extraordinary choice for a film version - but the 20th Century Fox's Daryl F. Junk loves the book and soon after publishing the screen rights. According to the picture, Majors have written an adaptation from Majma's legendary George Kikar, Rogers Edge - and seems to be an adaptation. While the film was produced, Koko was replaced by Admand Golding, a less-known manager for artistic touch than the director complex, and the Mammoth script was replaced by the memorable Screenplay author Lama Trutty. OXBOW events During World War II, the recent return of military jobs, the tiren power, was thrown like a spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell; Gene Terny, one of the great beauties of his era, was cast as Socialite Isabelle Bradley. Supporting cast was particularly notable, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucele Watson, and Elsa Lancaster. Both budgets and shooting schedules were fantastic, and when the film began in 1946, it was equally well received by the public and the critics. <br /> <br /> But the time is a way of pointing out the point of view from the point of view. Today, Roger Edge is a really well-produced film - but one can say that it is one of the best ones that achieves a fairly consistent mediator. In most cases, the main problem is the script. Although it has been reasonably close to Mostam's novel in the plots, it has been significantly closed in terms of character and it failed to completely defeat the basic elements of the story. We are told that Larry is in search of wisdom; We are told that he accepted it; We are told that he has done it - but despite the occasional and mostly neglected comments, we have never said anything behind it in spiritual, artistic, philosophical, and intellectual processes. We do not particularly mention anything important about the nature of the lightness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Growing ideological riff that is opening in them. Tyrone Power and Gene Tearn were more significant for physical beauty than genius, but both strong guidelines and scripts could turn out to be better performances. Unfortunately, that does not happen here; They are extremely miscast on one note and power boots extensively. Thankfully, throwing support is quite good, especially because of Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb and Lucele Watson; But the so-called famous act of Anne Baxter, as well as no one can expect. <br /> <br /> With just one and a half hour running time, the film feels unnecessarily long. The seemingly endless cocktail party-type banner and indeed the entire India series (which will fall as lightly sunny) will be fully cut off - an odd situation, because this sequence is considered as the whole movie's cruise. Regardless of the specific view, it seems to be all right and at a real point. <br /> <br /> The DVD itself, the film was not restored, but the print is very good and when the bonus package is not particularly memorable or significantly poor. When everything is said and done, then I express the desire of everyone for the production of four stars and material for Roger Eze - but to be honest, the film releases the best and gives Tienni fans, who will enjoy them, and whose spiritual The ideas about knowledge are unclear as in the movie. <br /> <br /> Gft, Amazon reviewer
