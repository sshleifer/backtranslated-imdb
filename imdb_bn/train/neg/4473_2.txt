Dane tries hard and is extreme with its yelling and going rails, spilling on herself and rolling over the floor. Extra. Calm down, assemble yourself and let us laugh. I did not quite understand the comparison to comic and rock stars. Just because of both stage or something up? He said every comedy wants to be a rock star. I'm sure that Rodney Dufferfield was really alive. Like Burger King, he had some good jokes, where people shouted in the drive through him. I like Rhys's Pice Rig. Dan could not have done so much psychic work, and maybe I could have given it a high rating, which would probably be eight.
