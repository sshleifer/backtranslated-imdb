Saying to me that I completely agree with the fundamental theory of the film, that there is probably no historical Jesus and Christian was not an addict. That said, the thesis of this movie is a pretty poor job of proof. It makes good arguments - the difference between Jesus' theoretical life and the Gospel writings is filled with Paul's writings, which does not refer to the historical Jesus - and then fails to firmly argue them firmly. It gives a detailed statement, not presenting statements based on evidence, and it firmly ignores the counter-arguments presented by Christian apologies. The lack of intellectual insufficiency, mental skills, and critical reason are clear, and stunning. The only Christians we hear from the film are the head of the old school-film maker - who is trying to deal with a tweet with a chip on his shoulder as a reasonable, reasonable person - and various Christians are seen in a random way. A parking lot. I am sorry, but I am expressing that Christians do not know much about their religion, it is not really wasting the proof of the deception of Christianity. You can also claim that Jane Lenny has denied the existence of Michael Dukakis in his J-Walking segment. Interview with experts can be interesting, but the film is so full, let's be honest, the filmmaker is just belligerent. In the first five minutes, the film has already been involved in Jerry Fellow with Charles Manson and Branch Dividians with a series of non-left series. And finally, the film becomes so spontaneous that there are no reasonable arguments left, just a rage is angry with the former Christian people and blame the places for their offending childhood. Yes, maybe that movie may be interesting, but it is lost in a documentary of Jesus historiography, and it is sympathetic to any sympathy. This is Michael Moore's film, or a combination of intellectual power with Richard Dawkins's book, Humor or the creation of the movie. leave it.
