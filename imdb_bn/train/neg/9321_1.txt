I rent this movie about 4-5 years ago and were instantly disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a B-movie slavery flick, but a fickle matter was lost for my eyes. Acting grass was similar to dry watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, how was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this movie was good humorous. There was no fear. It seems that a high school student for Christmas got a new video camera. The plot was everywhere, if it existed. If you are bored looking for bad horror movies to pay rent, leave this one. There are many good B-movies there.
