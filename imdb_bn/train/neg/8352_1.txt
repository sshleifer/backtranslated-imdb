I hired this movie because it was printed with the "Romanesque" and "Western" Grand Canyon Scenery. But if you expect a normal romantic west, then forget it. This movie is empty trash! Romance is a young girl who has not even gone through adolescents and medieval people! Children are also lusted by other leering men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> She first tried to shoo off her but eventually she gives up and they drive off as a happy, loving couple. It's rebellious. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film can appeal to anyone other than a podophyll.
