This motion picture comes directly from the full moon entertainment dark dungeon. The production company earned fame in the early part of the decade of the 1990s, creating a horribly bad and hungry horror film. The most famous disaster in their ouvre is "Subspicious", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and in fact the doctor is not Murdood. Hyperactive Director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly stupid and sticky and almost completely ridiculous. I only saw it because it's Jeffrey kombus star. I learned that if you are a fan of him, he may have many difficulties. For every good movie, he seems to have made 5 inferior. However, about story 2 ancient magicians fight about. To save the people for 150 years, here is a good one (Jeffrey Dr. Mordyrd) and a wicked person called Kabal. I want to destroy every form of human life for any reason I have already forgotten. Combs get his instructions from the consultant. That "guy" only exists in the eyes of an eye. Very very Chess, that is! Each and every time a dark illumination screen is displayed, it is the only form of special effects on this film. The whole thing is only a wonderful and annoying piece and when two wizards face each other, it ends before it ends ... I expected that the wicked wizard could fight at least a little, but nuawei .. in some scenes you really have some Identify basicity and creativity (for example Jeffery lectures about the effects of the moon on criminals) and if you If you really pay attention, you may find some small but beautiful aspects (like a cow) that are called Edgar Allen) but overall, it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and probably he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he sure does not have to give a fool to him.
