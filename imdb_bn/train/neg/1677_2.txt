Unlike the other, I refuse to call this kind of auspicious character for a movie status (I do not want to make the style a bad name). Yet it seems that this is the most appropriate description. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> And those who gave their right mind to this dreary and tangled mess gave green lighting. A biography of porn star John Holmes? In a man's study, why did he go to business, and how did he influence him? Great. Bound to be bound, bound to be bound. Almost one million levels are illuminated and compelling (and I have zero interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But was the end of a confusing, violent, continuous rashomone-style research hall associated with the Hall? Who does care in hell? Do we gain insight? This picture completely disregards John Holmes's most striking aspect of life - that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" might be about someone: The real character is the most famous male adult movie star in history, almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things tad thousands worse, the image is disturbed with jerkoff gimmicks - boring machine gun editing, sloppy dogme-95 camerawork, unnecessary split screen graphics and animations etc .. <br /> <br / > In the absence of a compulsory story and unique main character, the director (and I used the word unexpectedly) together with a dozen or more techniques from other films Iksepa and decided to call in a practical film: in conventional black-bypass look, "hell" or "traffic" or "Minority Report;" The horror of film-in-the-air cutting style of "natural birthland killers" or "28 days later" is often not understood; Complete every-moment-silence with the old-song-to-eve-the-timed soundtrack of "Godfalus" or "Blow". groovy, retro title sequence "Velvet goldmine" or "autofocus" or "catch me if you can." The list goes on and on and on. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I had real hope for it. "Wonderland Avenue" has been around for years; Rather than killing, the emphasis is on murder, I think it could work. The killings (and associated with the growing LA type in Holom) mark the end of a career or the end of the '70s, I think the film might have meaning; It could serve a purpose. As it is - meaningless. Meaningless Who knows how many views exist in the continuation of the unknown murder by the public? This kind of painful test is not very popular enough to meet. <br /> <br /> This photo should have been the third task of "John Holles Story". That's it. Duration And it could work. What is that Oh, all right, well, they do not want to tell a traditional rise and fall story. They did not want to create "Boogie Knights" or "GoodFellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted to be different from their film. OK? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they have succeeded. There is a big difference between those movies and "Wonderland." The difference is that those films are good. <br /> <br />
