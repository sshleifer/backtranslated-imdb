Fashionable breaks, yet half-felt character-study, a test of the personality of two college roommates: a talented but illiterate star basketball player, and a smoking-smoking, nervous Rumble-Roger. We never know why these young people are friends. They can share confusion about the world and their place, but they do not seem to have anything in common. Its director, debutant Jack Nicholson - who co-authored scrapeplo with Jeremy Lerner on the basis of Lennar's book - does not introduce our letters with clarity, or they make the scenes shape to help us identify the screen. Here are some very decent performances (especially from the central role of William Taper's new role), but most of the images are unclear (perhaps deliberately), sketchy or uncertain Bruce Dern plays hard-driving basketball trainers, Karen Black is in a relationship with the older, married lady presser, and the misguided friend of Michael Margaretta Tapper (off-putting, top-top performance). Nicholson fails to compile sequences with a certain flavor, likes to influence the character's interaction to affect the sound of the film (I guess); His script is not of any help, and as a result it is unclear with which we are supposed to be sympathetic. Minor, random moments work (a supercar war between Taper and Black, Dorp inspector Darn, all scenes set in court), but the complete third action of the film is frustrating. Expected to play an important role-playing game with sexual assault, Nicholson did not see any style of his skill (or even earned points for the eloquence, because these events were squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to insult his actor, then he should question his motive. Probably "drive, he said," eventually creating some strong statements on the door, the spectators can apologize to the filmmaker for his fall in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, boring movies are dumbfounding as far as left. * **** to 1/2
