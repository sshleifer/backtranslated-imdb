I have a fan of the series and all 7 books are read. I just wanted to see how it was working. I can say that only one person has read the series and is interested in it. Its quite bad, and you have to stop reading them. That does not mean, but Lucy is so ugly that she can be stopped from the movie. She was the director of a daughter? Really, I'm sure the movie Beaver was jealous of his teeth. She will have no beaver in shame that is an overbite. The film loses too much in translation The CS books do not translate easily into the books of Tolkayen LÃ¶cher, even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did! Aslan! Have done very well. Although other people's actors (Beaver, the wolf) looked at the stupid with painted faces, Aslan did a really good job, because it was not the only actor of the people. (I guess it's like the old horse custume? 2 people inside?) Also, what I think kids think about this movie is curious. Maybe they will enjoy it? But the safest bet for adults is that they lack a CS fan, but it lacks it.
