Spying: <br /> <br /> Gateway is mostly an action movie. And what steps are there !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and more. It makes Kim Bassenger and Alex Beldwin like Mac Quas. <br /> <br /> This is a remix and I did not see the original but actually did not care about it, although there are some excellent screenings of chemists and basenes. But the movie itself did it for me. <br /> <br /> The gateway really got tired. This conspiracy has spread through one battle / chase after another and violence continues, Basenzzer and Belvedin hold their great face, no danger can be avoided. In fact, they often look good at the end of the film. Launches I do not think the time for the whole picture of Beszinger's eye makeup goes away. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie I have ever seen, of course not, but it is not very good and if not, then a Action Movie Purist I can not really enjoy this movie because there is not much else. Gettaway is not terribly original, and goes unnecessary to cruel rather in every way from dull. It could be really good. I think <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin are okay but they do not have to do anything other than lag behind them. Sometimes less often, after seeing the same thing repeatedly it gets brutal. Many do not enjoy this one.
