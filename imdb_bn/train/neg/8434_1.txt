This movie shows more ethnic hatred of Jews than David Mamta <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed in Jai <br /> <br /> <br /> Montague brings a cluster of people, clean operation surgery in the Jewish center in New York, which gained common knowledge and I stopped. I am deeply troubled by the idea that Jews are not American and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mama is not a cause for heart that is not healing.
