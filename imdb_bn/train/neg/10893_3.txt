This is one of the movies that should be better than it is. I was scared to think about how blockbuster-affiliated editing was, because the DVD had the epic proportion of the director's cut. Naturally, you do not expect this to be "The Godfather", but the acting class or the two can easily come in handy. <br /> <br /> There were many cute boys in this film, but they were sadly absorbed. I like to see a bevy of hotties almost as close to their BVDs, but I have a right to expect a little more. Although it was not total loss; At least we got a drum (covered) of garbage and covered up really haircut. And Huntley Rater is watching the comedy more than her "Bring It On" (even about acting). Always have a silver lining, have kids. You just have to look really hard for it. And sometimes, you have to use your break button.
