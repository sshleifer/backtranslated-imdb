It was sticky and difficult to know what was the first 30 minutes of Flickr (unless you read the book - which was not mine). <br /> <br /> If you can prevent with the first half, then the second half <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wanted to know why Keaton chose this role, part of it went better with a player. . Other actors keep the balance.
