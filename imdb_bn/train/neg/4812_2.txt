I figured it's any horrible film weird with Osson Welles. Necromancy was sure but it was a little weird for myself. The film is actually a wonderful feeling because it is a contract for the devil / saddle in a small town and working with a young girl's efforts to escape from them. Although the director seems to be deliberately trying to mislead the audience using flashbacks and dream sequences. In the end, there are many unanswered questions. Which is bad, the story is so confusing, it's very hard to root any of the characters. It seems unlikely that Wales would particularly agree to title the film because it has nothing to do with it. Maybe someday they will take out a tape of Outtake and Bloopers from this movie. Now that would be really fun!
