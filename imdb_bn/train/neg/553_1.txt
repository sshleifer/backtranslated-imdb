After waiting anxiously, I would like to say that I could not join the first series in the first series. In the last seven years, the final episode was everything. It has all been destroyed. The journey was 23 years, but Captain Johnway has the ability to reduce it ... Say, seven years. Why seven Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crewiers were all killed along the journey. Why does he want to save only nine? Do others count or do? The most ridiculous part when the crew says that getting home is not really the most important thing for them. As such, "The journey is more important than the destination". Incredible And the last stage is surrounded by other federations ships and the earth is visible. Some about landing, coming back to normal life. <br /> <br /> worst end
