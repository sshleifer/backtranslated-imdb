I want to say that this is the worst movie of Priyancharan (very good Kunki was also released as a director of liberation war), there is no specific story in it and it was shown in the actress and some strange comedy sequence. I think Priyacharan is becoming much more repetitive in Comedy Flickr, just like Govinda and David Dhawan did after some of the better entertainers of the past, they also open their listener. So it would be better to give more attention to the script. Try some variations from his side. Instead of eating spice and masala, we would like to add more garlic and goods!
