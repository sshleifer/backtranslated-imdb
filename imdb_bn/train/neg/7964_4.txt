"Creeps2" is a little more than a pale imitation of the original design, with no original plan other than cash in the name of the previous movie. It also enhances the errors of predecessors, which were often expected and heavy handed over. Yet, for the first time, it was thrilling enough to create periodic lulls, which turned out to be an outstanding but fairly fairly entertaining endeavor. There are a few perfect moments in the sequel, so the clarity of the stories is more clear. In a while, it is distributed, but most of the time, it only links there. <br /> <br /> Basically, all stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just around the sweets. A wooden Indian comes in life, retaliation against the killers of its owner. Teens are devoured by an underwater demon. Come back from the dead to hold a discouraged motorist. None of this premises itself is bad, but they are completely lacking in inspiration. There are a few surprises and no scares. This is an example of a textbook, for example, to create non-selected, numerical films. It does not help a cheap movie that suffers from a cheap painter style, although there was not much to do in spite of being honest. In the end, the second story comes off best, but not many. <br /> <br /> In most cases, performance is good. George Kennedy, as an owner of the unfortunate General Store, does a very good job, especially if the work is not inspired. On the other hand, Dorothy expressed sympathy for her plight despite being a pretty good, anticipated and unnecessary material, just like the Lemo's criminal-terrorist motorbike. However, most of the letters are fairly thin. <br /> <br /> Someone would think that "Croppo 2" got better. Based on the story of Stephen King, original author George Romero returned to the screenplay. Makeup effect artist Tom Savini turns some good, gory work into action. So why is this picture frustrating? I think Romero did not really want to make a second movie, but was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade horrible sequels, clones, rip offs, and what was not, so this one was certainly inevitable. I can quickly imagine the guy to write the script, pick up his paycheck, and run off. I guess what needs to be done to get its own project financing; We can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Published by the new world photo
