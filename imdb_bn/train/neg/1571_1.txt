I have to constantly think about watching this movie; Why are they doing such a problem out of some broken breaks? The car has one million options at slow speed! At the speed of the film, at least one good reason why a writer is not able to stop the car is ... <br /> <br /> There is not much good thing to say about this movie; All normal statements make their appearance, the actors are very bad, leaking such as a drift of stories etc. that makes this movie waste waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
