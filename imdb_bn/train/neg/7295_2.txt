After all, I give 2 stars instead of 1 to this image because at least Peter Folk gave his usual superb performance as Lieutenant Colombo. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Andrew Stevene's acting "I have started reading a poster's comment to everyone while commenting to actresses one after another." To me, it's Stevens's outstanding performance that completely destroyed this movie, and so I was ready to reduce the humiliation of all kinds of commentators. Then I thought, what happened to Steven? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. 17 years after the Columbu film was created, clearly Stevens is in the 33 projects, everyone is crying, so doubting that someone saw the rest of his career. <br /> <br> If you like Colombo, before looking at it, see all the other 69 titles. Save yourself a favor and worst for the end.
