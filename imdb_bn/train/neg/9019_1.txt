Why would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> I do not hope that Dean will create a hit in the movie. Or even decent movies. I saw Loes and Clark, I know exactly ... "Good" Dean Cain. <br /> <br /> It's obviously a cheese flick, and each cheese will have its own custom on Flickr. You scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers because you can not hide more than this movie already. <br /> <br /> to start ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean why ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not give us to say no? <br /> <br /> Why are two events in the movie? Give us a slug line? We get the helipad and then get the day of mess hall. And then that's it, care about timeline. To be honest, who they care about it even after mentioning it, but I think that beside the point. <br /> <br /> Is a movie really good if you can see it through multiple split screens? No answer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who was responsible for the end of the world? It was Scotty oby drew straight out. Oh, dragon's dead now ... tell me to get dinner? Sure, but in some Chinese places ... the name dragon !! Haha hah !! HA HA HA !! Ha ha I used to be superman! Ah ha ha <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , The whole building was exploded ... and no one was alive ... for some reasons an obsolete, unusual lab that survived very well, so they could make a sequel. Lose all of us <br /> <br />
