It should be embarrassed about the kind of films that should be involved with everyone. Poor instructions, acting above and rambles in any other point other than displaying violence that is a plot. When I first saw that it was probably the mockery of the media and how it shows violence, it is not. I'm not sure what makes the film a bad one. Oliver Stone never indicates his worst. In the scene where Woody Herrson's face was due to no reason or Robert Danny Jr.'s awesome performance as a journalist who seems to be perfectly bonkers, this movie is simply a zombie.
