I saw the capsule comment "great acting." In my opinion, these two great actors, who, with the greatest effort of all time, are giving awesome chemistry with great performance for the great director and with each other. Robert De Niro will be the most captivating and intuitive illiterate of all time. The Jane Funder performance goes on the impossible map because he does not explicitly put a handle on this character, because the character is very badly written. An adjective for this film's annoying pacing would be very fast. Although the purpose of the film should be an uplifted story of illiteracy, it is a real "boomer" to see. I've paid 1 out of 10, which I have ever seen, one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level.
