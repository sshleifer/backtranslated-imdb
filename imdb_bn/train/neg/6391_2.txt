HG is usually absorbed, and it has never bothered me - I like the "bloody 2", but I do not really like disguised science or play on the Hearstics. The whole movie is based on a man with an electric accident and esp caused by a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I like "carrier" (novels and movies) but this one bothered me. I think it's the main character developing esp from an electric line. University professor SP also waste his time studying the case. If I wanted to know that I was not alive at 60, SSP was not a misconception, but I guess that any theory of nature will be denied only. What really irritated me was that it was 99% time like a normal person like Schizophrenics, a rude, unexpected villain, and then snap. Nothing could be more from the truth. I hate this idea because they join the public. Many people still think that schizophrenia is a isolated identity disorder. Anyone who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some modest ideas for the movie. I liked the way men used to dine; It was a wonderful change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but she was not close to her forced obedient lovers. I found out how interesting it was to burn her face to her second boyfriend. This script was touched a few weeks before the production and not only focused on the audience making figs, it could be a decent movie.
