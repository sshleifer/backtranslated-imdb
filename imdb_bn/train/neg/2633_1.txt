I have seen the movie trailer several times in the theater and I'm excited. It looked like a classic action thriller created in the 1990's. It reminds me of the fugitive movie, a cat and mouse retreat in Douglas and Sutherland. However, Sentinel is the most ruthless action thriller of all times. I see, many people say that it's like a TV movie. It's not like that. First of all, there are better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies can sometimes be fun, but this movie is a good opposite of having a good time. It's not all visible and most stylish, the sound of the movie is unexpected. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes that are involved in a chase and collision. They are not even big action scenes, but worse than the whole film, these scenes are very transparent. The love relationship between Douglas and Basing was very unnecessary. In addition, the president's assassination plot is the most fascinating story in this genre, but they insist on it. And it is not supposed to be a cat and mouse film as it is. Although, Douglas is now outdated, she is still potential to act in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas may not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice, because you watched Jack Bauer and, in other ways, his character is one of the reasons that made the film look like a TV movie, Eva Longeria Parker is a strange choice, she must be very inactive or straight in this movie, because she is a sub-opera actress. The film was not even funny to me even in a second, so I could not over it for a while.
