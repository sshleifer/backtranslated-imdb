I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, where the Great Dr. was present. Woo bol <br /> <br /> The picture is very bad. And not, in the normal Uwe Bowl "is so bad it is actually recreational" way, but simply plain bad. This plot reveals the concern of a person who leads a terrible life (apparently due to a past criminal record), can not get a job, and fears the cheating wife of 900 pounds. This man turns his civilian uncle into a bird's plan to steal a truck load of trucks containing flu viruses. Al Qaeda has planned to steal a toy and the next incident is completely unknown for two hours of gender and violence. <br /> <br /> acting is awful. (Despite the fact that Dave, who really tries to do it), children are not being shot on a slow pace, and people are not getting a hawk. It's supposed to be ironic, but I'm not sure what to do. Think <br /> <br /> "Aircraft", but by the makers of the South Park and without any joke.
