This is probably one of the worst French movies in more than 100 French movies I've ever seen. Due to horror screenplay and very middle / irrelevant acting is the reason for powerlessness. It does not matter how Western French scenes and fancy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these two characters do not attract people, such as the audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I am surprised, how did the jury award for cancer in this movie won, people, I like almost all the award-winning cinema, but this is not. A big disappointment for me.
