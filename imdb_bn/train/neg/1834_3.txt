I can not say a lot about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as the current rating). I hired it about two years ago and I'm totally sorry. I even tried / loved it twice, but I could not do it. I can safely say that this time I have no desire to see it again. And I'm not one of a movie trash, but I really believe this terrible. It was not even fun at all. The only bit I enjoyed was a few scenes with them in Christopher Walken. I think this image has destroyed Jack Black and Ben Stiler for me. Now when I see a movie of them I can think - this horrible movie nowadays, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Emmy Poehler is very very annoying, too. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think you get my points. They are for the street, Walken.
