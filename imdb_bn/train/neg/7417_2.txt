This picture is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! It's hard to imagine that we can see more bad films this year or next year. There is nothing but shallow clich√© about Italian brotherhood of "love brothers" (set in Australia in Italian immigrants), and it says that Italian can also be spoken in Italy and Italian in Italy. Film message - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people will have to marry beautiful people - really uncomfortable. Geovani Ribisi is very good at 'Suburb' or 'Lost in Translation', but here's the hard-to-endure Italian accent. Check out this picture at your own risk. Trash as Trash!
