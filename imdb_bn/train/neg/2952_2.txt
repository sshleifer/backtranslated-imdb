Just seeing the trailer in Theodore Rex, you think it's a bad comedy comedy with Humpy Goldberg and a man with dinosaur costumes. This is true, but this is the most futuristic story, which looks like a batman with a style of its style and with a look of strange character. It was mixed, and should have been marketed as a prediction, instead of just a lame police comedy. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been resurrected through amazing technology, and they are talking like human and walking. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who has never taken seriously, but after the dinosaur's assassination, he is given a lawsuit, but he must cooperate with the most difficult police in KT Coulteron (Hypie Goldberg). The solution to this killing is to solve the killings, and the audience is prepared to stay awake to watch it awake. <br /> <br /> This picture starts as a normal acting character, but ultimately it is unbearable to hear. As well as being a detective for some reason, he is a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. She imitates famous people and accents, and there are some really awful lines. Huapp accused him of firting and said, "This is not my butt!" How nice! What a lively, incomprehensible line for a child's film even for this child. Whoopi is also annoying and rude for everyone. I hope Teddy will cut her head off the whole length of her film. <br /> <br /> This movie did not know what it wants to be. There is no comedy or comedy, if there is a future scene and action. In any non-action scenes, the characters can be as interesting as it may face inexplicably. The action scenes are not too weird and do not act as violent enough, and as before, comedy only has a bunch of genocide joints. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> If a dinosaur / human detective couple does not have anything, it seems like a beautiful original movie. No! This movie is a huge rip-off of Hugh Framed Roger Robin. Replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set them in the future and it's the same plot. A man died, a dinosaur was killed. A dinosaur and detective assassination, killing a toe and killing a detective assassin. Roger Rabbit's bad guys are Christopher Lloyd and Viasel. The bad guys here feel like Christopher Lloyd and who work like adulteration. Roger Rabbit's club scene where Jessica Robot walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 1 out of 1 / 2 90 minutes PG for mild violence, language and illogical laughter.
