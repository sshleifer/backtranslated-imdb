I do not understand that it can not be BSG and if they are funny then I can run a slow show, but I myself completely unintentionally and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula of BSG seems like: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can barely see it. Actually, it's my watch list below for the week. It is a sad state of affairs. Sifai channels really destroyed their Friday night line up. What happened to SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG's glorious days on Friday night? They were a good thing there.
