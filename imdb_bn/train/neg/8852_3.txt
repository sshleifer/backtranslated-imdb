To be honest, I did not see the original all 'halloween', but the scenes I saw made it clear that the first halong was a great movie. So great, that was made of the seven awesome sequels. They started with "Haoling II: Your sister was a wouolf". I got this movie from VHS from my uncle a few days ago, when he was new to the Andheri brand then took old movies. I just saw it last night, and it was not really a BAD, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with the Sibyl Denning is running three ways with three WayWurf minunts and it was very annoying (but very hot), Christopher's dead body, such as a vampire, as well as killing the dead. This film was actually something like Dracula and The Lost Boy's, like some kind of mosquito ... except for the broken, all Christopher Lee (who played Dracala) was talking about VERWOVOS. Heart, garlic, night life must die at night and the ruler of Venuval will live in Transvaalania). Not much for acting, but it came from the worst Anne McEnroe. I swear, at any time in the film, I found the rotating for the virtual to get me out of the throat, because that throat was always something to say. However, the plot is very stupid and cluttered, so there is no real point to tell you, you can read it only in Wikipedia. However, the thing that makes me really irritate me about this movie is that it is only one of seven sequels that do not count Holing IV (1988), which is the origin of the rebuilding, or in other words, based on the same novel. A sequence of) So do not see this movie. There is no real horror, rarely any bewolves, and just awesome special FX. 3/10
