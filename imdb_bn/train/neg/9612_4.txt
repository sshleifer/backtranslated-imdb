Ultimately, the bad guys are up in the end - always - the question that puts the question of good son's eligibility. Some innocent people are accused of criminal plots - some bothered. Some unnecessary dialogue that debates the various legal issues. Is it just a middle-class stupid old Western, so this is meaningless about trying to keep things "realistic"? One of the few of Cagney's unreasonable presence in the West - is not only about entertainment things about movies. Somewhere in the middle there is a ridiculously offer of wedding time; How do you feel "Where is the boy hiding ?? Where is he ?! Oh ..., will you marry me?"
