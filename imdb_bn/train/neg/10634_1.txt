Writer / director Bert Siebrle placed his work around a movie that he said was wrongly sent by NASA. He said that it was surrounded by television footage of their travels on the moon by utilizing astronaut camera tricks. Astronauts were in orbit around the Earth, and these raw footage composed in just a few seconds of the last movie. Unfortunately, Sibyl's study was so ridiculous that he did not realize that the "backstage" footage was actually taken from a 30-minute live broadcast (this is the railway) that was seen by millions, which NASA did not hide in the vaults. And we have to wonder why Sibal has made his own conspiratorial statement on the footage of the celestial astronauts, because in their own words the hearing of astronauts clearly states that astronauts are just checking the camera, not fixing the footage. Finally, by buying the hacked version of Siebler, nobody can see the raw footage for yourself. (He also showed you Jepruder's murder of JFK more than his "smoking gun".) Sibrell thinks he saw it. Clippings from what other stories do not like to use the sebral, are clearly surrounded by remote window windows, and then say that mats and transparencies have been set up in the space window to create illusions of a remote world. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> The actual evidence is not a root.
