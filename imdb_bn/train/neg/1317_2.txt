The people of the Kino video collect together their fine "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a multi-cassette selection of silent comedy, some decide to cut the first installment with a vague one-relay Furus (1 1616) starring Florida. Very young Oliver Hardy. The set was enjoyable as enjoyable, the decision was unfortunate, one after another was a very poor movie which prevented viewers from watching more. Like any ordinary Fursi, the greed is inspired by the motivation inspired, when the plans become awkward and panic moves towards irrationality, but against goodness, more than one duplicate, illogical and desperate boring. At this moment it is not saying that the frustrating confusing plot is the result of making unwanted footage or inactive movies, but whatever the reason, even the most vigilant viewers see that the relationship between the character and what is happening, in the direction of semiconductor, and ultimately nobody thinks. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < In front of the first scene, awakening with a hangout, Bab perform a roll back from a bed. Believe me, that's funny as it gets in this movie. If you read this before looking at the first cassette of the "Slapstick Encyclopedia" of the buyer, I suggest you to move ahead and move on to good things.
