Most action films are Hindi cinema, especially Sunny and her family's fur. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> It's okay to start and then move to Kenya, but then the film will run and <br /> <br /> the sequence of events will not happen gradually. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> Rajiv Roy is a good one Aja, the music is OK, and in the end only 1 song works better that taophana camera-work. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol seems normal, Chawki acts like a monkey in his time. Scenes are funny, Nasir is right, heroines are pure wood. Amirush Puri is not a terrible half as Tridev, others are okay.
