My first question was to see this picture, "Why is Lime Title?" If you want to tell stories from the boy's point of view, it is not done well. Of course, camera cones were used in the son's view, but most of his major steps were out of his view. It is impossible to speak of a "major" character (obviously a child's silent, suggesting powerless position) makes it difficult to deepen its characteristic. <br /> <br /> Definition of Melodrama: "Dramatic or other literary works have been characterized by the use of stereotyped letters, exaggerated emotions and language, simple morality, and contradiction." Lam fits this definition into one. Visitors hit the head with the common stereotype of the hair and the Catholic Church of Stryen School Mart. And squeezing money from the good leg priest parishioners. (A stereotype that is becoming very tiring.) What's more - Jewish characters are holders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Most of the images were predictable ... Who did not think that we want Terrace to see Scobbing in the toilet, her mother told her, "My daughter's daughter will not cut another woman's toilet!" If I do good then I am a fan of British realityism. In my opinion, not the lime. <br /> <br />
