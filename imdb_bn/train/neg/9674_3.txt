This flare reminds me of some great science-fiction films of the 50's and 60's. It's not scary or interesting, but it's stupid, cheesy and stupid. Special effects are ridiculous, all actors are ridiculous and the end is only horrific. Dont waste your money, rent or buy something good I can give it 3.5 out of 10 (I think this turkey was pretty funny due to its stupidity).
