I think about this movie, I think the 1959 edition was seen by the child. It was not. I felt that what I felt was the failure of the limited acting, the development of poor character, and the failure to show the relationship between the maximum, the boy and his dog. In this version ... a beautiful "isolated" movie for "Flanders Dog". Get the 1959 version!
