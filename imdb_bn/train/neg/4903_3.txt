In opposition to Korean, Hong Kong or even China, I'm not always very fond of producing Taiwan movies. Strong performance quality is rarely found among the films shown in this film. I do not respect myself as respectful as I am actually a fan of indie movies But this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. I'm in the center of the middle where the plot is going. Of course this is not good. Rainie's acting sub-par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and clever. Although he must admit he is a pleasure to look at. On the other hand, Isabella Long plays a more appropriate role as a distraught, tragic, sad, highly preserved character. Overall I find a disappointment in this movie.
