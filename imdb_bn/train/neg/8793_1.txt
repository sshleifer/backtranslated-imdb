To read or comment on this movie to see or not see, I first offer these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chongqing Express" was quickly cited, quickly chanted together and it seemed as if it was completely conceived by someone standing in the line of Hong Kong Burger King. I am trying to work with a scripts in this mundle with a dimensional character store that I have never seen this movie! This is an unreasonable effort with a philosophical ridiculous conversation (a man bursts into his flooded apartment and stunning revelation that "tears can dry up with a tissue, but it takes time to move water"). The same character can also be seen bearing a deep, meaningful relationship with its towel, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry etc. Incognito, rotating, hand-holding cameras - I had no other bothersome feature. And if this is not enough for you to scoff at your popcorn, then we can hear the old 60's "California Dreaming" by Momas and Papasah, especially in the longer sequence, focusing on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Quintin Tarantino was responsible for his frustration with America's Rolling Thunder Productions Company, although I do not understand how a person would bother his talent towards my life. He is known to have commented, "I'm happy for this movie a lot of love." Many of us hope that through future more spectacular discoveries, he will focus on making his audience happy.
