Dialogue: stilted, clichéd; Acting: Hammy, Clichad; Plot: forecast, clichéd. <br /> <br /> Is this "B" trash doing just Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski? A few decades before the making of this film the plummer was well established, there were excellent compositions like "Tess" and "Cats people" behind Kinski, which could certainly be frustrating. <br /> <br /> Bad people have all the bad guys - * bad * bad people! (Especially Plummer! Where is he learning to "german"?) And most of them have bad guy sneers. Innocent devils overdo all your ridiculous enough ridiculous. The good guy lives, among other things: * A 5 "knife knife buried deeply on his shoulder - just pulling it out and after a few seconds, using the arm without any difficulty; * Marines machine-gun fire (I think no one. 50), which presses a bandage around his pants leg and afterwards he is very tall; * Several boxers in which he is from the mouth The screw is often the first in a door frame; * A third enclosure, which is on the side of the fruit, a collapsed ankle or any other kind of lazy inconvenience, a fall, behind. The script is just 3 clever lines, the rest <br/> <br /> All right, it's not bad at all.Blumers come with a specific class in their part, and undoubtedly this is the best actor on Flickr. Certainly not many, but he's technically Most of the villains without resort to the use jira can lazy villains, including the severity of some of its "Way Way and miunsa hyapha" highlights the lines of type, but you're always aware that you are acting the villain Christopher plamarake. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste. Actually, as it does, the 007 film framework of Wood Wood line distribution of Bruce Lee's very clearly decorated battle scenes, but it's not close to Roger Moore's 2007 or Bruce Lee's film. Do not disturb.
