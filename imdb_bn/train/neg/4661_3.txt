Richard Pierre, Rose Pierre and others. It's a weird WW2 movie, and acts as a statement about racism. It is valuable to understand how we feel about the films they produce when it is produced and how it is not about the time of being represented. This means that the movie of 70 is not a movie of 40 (WW2). Nevertheless, there are some good action scenes of 7 black black under a white captain who is trying to catch the dam. The story tells the captain that these men are not just soldiers, but only a service organization A scene that can be a civil war film and not a WW2 movie that reflects everything about the movie. Black lee The German cheeks give an innocent peck and the white captain gets upset. The star and the genre were interesting to me, so I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point.
