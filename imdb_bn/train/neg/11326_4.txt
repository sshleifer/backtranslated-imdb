This is one of two postpokaliptic fantasy films produced by Albert Piune in 1993 - and it's bad. Apparently all his strengths were "sampling" which was an entertaining non-stop action movie, and many more expensive look. "Knights" Suddenly and Chess, an inferior barrel ciphey that often resembles a video game (new opponents always pop up and must be destroyed as soon as possible). The only thing that can save this movie from the trash is Casey Long; Not a particularly attractive woman, but silently a ruthlessly skilled war machine. For Chris Christopherson, considering his age (58), I hope his stunts are double the better salary. (* 1/2)
