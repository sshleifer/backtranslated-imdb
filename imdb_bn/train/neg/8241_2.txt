This movie has many problems related to it, which it has shut down like a low-budget class project from someone in film school. Although I have to pay credit on his camp. I smile at myself many times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, then pop a popcorn bowl, invite some friends, and have some fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with another comment that the word is very bad. It is impossible to follow the dialog for most of the time and the soundtrack is right there.
