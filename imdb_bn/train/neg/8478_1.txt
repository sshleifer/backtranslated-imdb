This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. Acting was kind. Jordan Hintson could not show any uncomfortable emotions. At the beginning of the movie, she is supposed to be discouraged. Instead, he bobbed his head with his lower lip stuck. He sobbed cruelly without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they would have to find him. Everyone else was suffering from good acting. It was flat out annoying. It was an insult to the skaters image. Jordan took a month to train, and they threw him as a person who created the Olympic team. It is actually spitting on the real skaters efforts of their figure in the figure. A merciful excuse for a movie, and a cruel effort to add hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not deserve even one star.
