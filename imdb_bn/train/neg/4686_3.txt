There was good performance by Robin Williams and others, but the film was fairly frustrating and very disappointing compared to a positive review. <br /> <br /> I thought Syed would be a serial killer, who is pushing the man towards death: A dirty guy, ugly clothes quoted his victims by quoting others and hunted them around food till their medical history was read. <br /> <br /> I think this movie attracts most generations, who feel strangers interested in their photos. I hope most retail workers want to break from customers.
