I'm a huge Charlton Haston fan. He was without doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but when he made this movie he thought what he was doing. Generally if he is making a bad film I can blame the screen writer or director, but in this case it's all about him. The extremeness of this movie is all its fault. It proves that even Heston can not shake the story of Shakespeare. I spent my 22 hours on this snooze festival and I would never be back in that time. This is the best Haston movie that I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan you will see this movie as entertaining, but if you do not waste your time, you will be sorry for it for a long time.
