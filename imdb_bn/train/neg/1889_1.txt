This movie attracts a deeper focus on the deepest aspects of human behavior, rather than entertainment. Relating to more than half a dozen stories of corruption, distorted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All activities are performed on several hot and sticky days during a temperature in Vienna, and the heat is likely to cause the film's distraction and hatred. The treatment for the disabled girl was the worst part of my safety equipment vendor, which closely followed the 'slugs flat' drunkenness and distortion scenes. You will be gripped and I hope to be frightened by this film. I hate it but I feel obliged to see it through. 1/10/10 'Funny' 8/10 'Man' occasionally to display.
