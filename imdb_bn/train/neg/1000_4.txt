The plot for breeding, if it can actually be called a plot, there are two significant events. One at the beginning - one at the end. Together this event can make up 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I want to say _ _verything_) is basically the director's great effort to fill in minutes. I like annoying movies, I like dark movies and I will not be disturbed by the strong scenes - but if you want to sit through my 60 minute strange / literary scenes, there is no story telling you something else. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, was completely lost here And no, he's not nude, even in the NC-17 edition, which I saw. <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of a nip - you probably have more interesting dreams.
