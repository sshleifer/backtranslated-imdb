I am a huge fan of comic book series, but this movie falls in the way below my expectations. I hope a heavy metal 2000 kinder seems ... slow, bad conversations, many 'blood' ... but it was worse than it could have imagined. <br /> <br /> Plot line is almost the same as comic, but most of the good points stop there. Characters do not have the power or spirit that draws attention to the comic series. The film only covers a small part of the comic and the part used is slower and more annoying than the next. The focus of the film is on important events rather than the more interesting overall plot of comic book. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it can be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not that way, so now there's another horrible movie that will see some and even less love. My copy will surely collect dust until I finally throw it out.
