Special effects? Good <br /> <br /> script? Terrible No plot No depth. There is no minigence. This image represents Superman as a pointless hero, with an array type hero. In the original film, he represented America Shol War Here, he represents nothing but a hull. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actor was fine. Kevin Speacy was a good choice among others. <br /> <br /> The solution to this problem still does not solve this problem. I can not bring anything meaningful to this movie, when Superman was there, and every day, not only as a comic but also as a meaningful hero in the mind of man. Considering how much the movie can be directed, it was a real waste of money. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor global corporation, political domination, sovereignty, and more and then there. He was just another Gobble Hackman avatar. <br /> <br /> and Superman? What did he stand for in this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
