I saw it for Gary Bus and Fred Williams that they were friends police. They sit in front of the bases but the film is not seen again for 40 minutes. Although he is awesome in every scene. Especially when he disguised himself as blind. <br /> <br /> What is incredible about this movie. Fred Williamson is trying to find out who is beating and killing the sex operators in the film. At one point I think his bus. But it turns out I'm partially okay. Basi is not a killer, but he is calling and harassing the woman by calling. Why? I do not know. In no way did he connect the killer, he only did it for guess.
