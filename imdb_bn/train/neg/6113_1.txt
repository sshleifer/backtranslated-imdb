I shouted my head because the first experience of my 13-year-old movie was seen in this movie. I remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I saw it again on TV several years ago. Big mistake - the acting difficulty, the plot is not existent and the 23-year-old movie T & A is missing if you are lacking in merit ... 0 / ****
