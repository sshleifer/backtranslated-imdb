This image is a very simple but somehow very bad plot. The whole film is kissing a girl through another gate gate, after a few years it is open again with a witch when a group of friends (in which the main actor who faces his ex-girlfriend's frustration, one of whose campers is with his new partner ... The other girl ... just that they have nudity for lesbians and for no special reason). Unfortunately the monster follows the adult girl through now. Also, unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the monster come from? How did he survive an evil child survived the demon demons? Who has trained him and decorated him with a gladiator type? Actually it sounds terrible but it is difficult to say because writing can be so bad that they could not do anything with it. The wrestler was quite good because I give it a three and the effect was pretty fun even though they were very cheap. I did not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be fun.
