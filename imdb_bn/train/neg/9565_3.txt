I can not say that Wargames: Dead code is the worst movie I've ever seen, it was one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. Once the plot device did not guess me 10+ minutes ago at once. There was no benefit of anything in the movie, there is no intelligence behind the scene. The intent of every conversation or typed line was so brilliant that it was impossible to "enter" the film. <br /> <br /> I saw myself laughing at the horror of plot thinking, and leftist efforts for the recovery of the audience, far more often than I find myself enjoying the movie.
