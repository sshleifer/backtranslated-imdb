How nice. I read about this movie and it was so awful that I had to see it, and my lord, I could smell it in St. Louis. Where do I start? Five years later the National Lampons Animal House was trying to follow successfully, but they completely missed the mark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Apparently, he was not working back, so the boys of National Lampun probably called out, "Hey, we're making a C ** PP movie, want to stay there?" Peter was like "Well, I'm not doing a lot of these days, why not?" He was a big side character in the Human House, but he could not carry this tiny flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leave him alone, he must find himself. It is very strange that they are actually in a happy marriage. So she pursues him, where she goes, and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, finally, burns her home, loses most of the kids and sleeps with a store in Bimbace, New York (with a young Diane Lane). Then the wife comes back, wants the kids, and the movie ends with a coin flip which will determine the fate of the children. The idea was actually somewhat tricky, but the manager stunk. The characters seem to be asleep as they all are sleeping, they are doped. Sorry, Sister, your legacy is ruined with this flop. <br /> <br /> Little film # 2 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beautiful girl, recently completed college Not sure what to do with his life. So he became a whore, starts sleeping with some mega rich son, they take their money while they are dead, and he does not stop until the most powerful man in the world gets in bed, Fred Willard (Whoops, I mean President of the United States). Again, it could have been fun, and although I'm not happy that everyone in the cursor (real life Ann Dusenbery) did not fear, his performance was horrific. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, here are Rani Kop Brent Felkon (Robi Benson) experienced Stan Nagersky (Richard Wyommark). Falcone young, naive, even though he really thinks people can help, he becomes cynical after he is shot several thousand times. Nagurski, really, has just given up care. He does not see muggings, attacks, names you name it, and interference. He has identified the world as legal and if he does something, he probably will file a lawsuit. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi ride) arrives at workplace, calling the police close to him, takes offense, but puts him there to protect his lawyer. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been fun, performance was deliberately a camp, but there is no power, no good. Henry Jogalm and Bob Gardley will be ashamed of having their name on this verse. I think writing was not bad, the idea was, but execution was carried out alongside the rescue operation of Iran's hostage crisis. If I were part of this photo, then my name would have to be deleted, it's horrible. Then again, I saw it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that John John scooped up the movie (again repeating "going to the movies") and the film was' much more than an hour and a half. Show this in the movie classes with the title "What you do not want to do in film making." Yes, it's that bad because this script will have to be left over on the shelf.
