Some pictures are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on the real story, this film was true for Pinocchio as the real son of this film. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it traveled very fast. Just as the director wanted and wanted to work with the house. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Heart never gave me a gifted actress as a gifted actress, but then the picture she made was quite low- however the budget. Like most of his other films, he is loudly pushing his characters very loudly, saying that his words are becoming dramatic at a faster pace. She really has a crew in front of her and she finds the wisdom that she is talking with a camera, when she should be involved in the audience in her character. It mostly puts the whole movie down, and it can stand on any foot, it has been destroyed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only good thing about this image when he finally nailed it. But there was not enough satisfaction even to maintain my hatred for such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste of the film compared to dry toast, then see it.
