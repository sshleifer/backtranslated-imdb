Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going into real life) and is on weekends with his friends - which features many of his film genres, which are naturally successful white middle class belching styles. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen finds something to do in the comedy comedy, but here she really is completely flat on her face. Even one liners seem deserted to him. Any plot (bar bit and code shakespeare piece) - but Alan seems to be using the location to allow a semi-mysterious air, which only makes the item more intelligent and half baked. <br /> <br /> It just does not work at any level and it's just a giant bore. The best thing to do with this movie (along with the best credits) is that the bad reviews awaken him and realize that not only is a slidescap scripts uniting and throwing your mate at it is not entertainment.
