I've recognized my problem with the most famous eagle movies I've seen so far. In my taste, they are black and intensely funny, or so light to be dissatisfied as voices or stories. It's a self-important way because I wanted to choose "I'm White Suit in the Man". But I saw myself struggling to sit in a short time. <br /> <br /> Textile staffer Sydney Straton (Alec Guinness) may be gently committed, but he is committed to progress in the form of his effort to innovate a ribbon of fabric that can not be violently broken or dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest test, he works hard against both the material and the human limitation - the second is the bright Kolkata, who does not understand what he is doing, then find it out and more committed to stop it. </ br> <br /> "Little mind like you are standing on the path of progress," Sydney complains, she is practicing in the mirror to tell people what to do <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One problem "White Suit Man" is Sidney's progressive outlook, very small psychologist, even more master or worker who disturbs his work. My problem is more basic: For a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny. It's a rather quick script that often tricks, takes, triple-takes, and looks fun to try to dig its weak attempts. <br /> <br /> সেরা রসিকতা যন্ত্রের শব্দ সিডনি টাইলস, "বিলি-ব্লপ-বিলি-বপ" অনন্তভাবে এবং যাচ্ছে না হওয়া পর্যন্ত প্রত্যেক দর্শকের কাছ থেকে কোঁকড়া দেখায়, যতক্ষণ না সিডনি তার কাছ থেকে তার অলৌকিক ঘটনাকে অন্বেষণ করে বা চেষ্টা Continue <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually its mid 30s). He feels so bloody, he is more than the face of the wax in acting "Doctor Jhabago". The same cold fish are a victim, although he defiled her tragic sense is ignored, his job lost to saving lives proposal (face Vida Hope Bertha like) or young Dafen barnali (Joan Greenwood), to the more fertile character, the "father and Dirt is an actual mate in the fight against ", as words can be just as green as possible". <br /> <br /> Supporting players make "White Suit" work. Ernest Thesara of "Frankenstein's Wife" sounds like a naturally ambitious artist Naseferrat and laugh like a quarrel with death. Howard Marion-Crowford is a leader of other factories as he is playing a burning medical officer at "Lawrence of Arabia". Then Mandy Miller's unexpected kiss is a small girl who steals in the camera within a few moments. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes are so straightforward that directors Alexander McDrandrick has ever worked in a comedy (his previous Ealing comedy "Whiskey Gallery" does not flip this impression). Roger McDougall's game has made the idea of ​​scientific progress positive as a potential disaster, but fails to present a dull Sydney other than the most striking delight of the lights. <br /> <br /> Eelong comedy is remembered for keeping the limelight of comedians. Nevertheless, I do not think of what I saw, only when they play aggressively against our sympathy. "Kind Hearts and karonetasa" and "The ledikilarsa" (myakendrika again, go figure), the classic way. On the other hand, "White Suit", a point which is very unfortunate ryamala the suite when it should be assembled.
