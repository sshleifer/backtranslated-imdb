I've probably seen 200 movies in theaters both in and around the house, and I can confidently say that this movie has seen the worst of this year (if not ever, I have not really seen "Delta Knights of Quest"). After the 13-year-old bad joke, this movie was just funny and because I disliked seeing him on a bus tour, I could not go outside. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid it. Rent a vault. Jerry can be spent in four films by Brackhammer's number of four dollars.
