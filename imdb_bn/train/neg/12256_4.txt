Oh God, I used to see that when I was only 11 or twelve (I would not ask) I was young, but I was not a fool. Anyone can see it a bad movie, nasty, gross, helpless and very stupid. I saw more dominant effects in Disneyland, I saw a good performance in a school, and I saw a more strong crocodile in the zoo, where they do not get anything but ignoring the taped children in glass, tapping the glass <br /> <br /> The story is set in Northern Australia Have been there. Ambitious young man, surfing a shark filled water, trying to play a new water. It has soon become clear that the water is somewhat dangerous. After learning what they will learn, they help a tropical middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal for his family's diet. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every crocodile film made by the end. Fifteen years, which is well Lake Placid, and which is its sequel of the bad. Blood surf will be the second worst crock flick, which is closely behind the private and crocodile. <br /> <br /> Australian salts water crudodil is one of the most dangerous creatures, causing hundreds of injuries or death every year. Movies like Blood Surf are not only harmful images of this type of creature, but the best of the life of the viewer is good. If you do not really want to see it, avoid blood surf.
