I hired this movie due to the promises of William Duffo and Robert Rodriguez. I think the name of Rovers is on the cover (as an actor) that this movie will be good. Rodriguez looks like a movie that if he decides his name, would it be better? Wrong mistake The "worst of man's hand" is far from the worst edit. The manner in which it was edited was not created in any sense, and the film was impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you would not want to follow it anymore. I do not know how Duffo and Rodriguez are involved in this film, perhaps they owe one to someone, but the way to do them better. Besides, they were only for a few minutes in the film and Rodriguez did not even speak. So if you want to see a movie with worse editing, poor performance and confusing stories rather than being a guest, do not say that you have not been warned.
