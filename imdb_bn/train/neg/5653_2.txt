Let's do this in this way. I actually get this movie. I was trying to do what the writer / director did. I understand that the dialogue was meant to be dry and embarrassing. I realized that the plot was supposed to be non-climatic and barbaric. The writer / director was going for that. A very very funny comedy / comedy. With all that understanding, I still think the movie sucked. It seems that the writer / director is trying to recreate the Napoleonic Dynamite with this movie. It was the same feature. Even the main character is similar to Napoleon's behavior. But the Napoleonic dynamite was actually fun. Work on her script. This is not the movie. It has no purpose. Well, let me differently or in other words. Its only purpose is to close the Napoleonic dynamite and try to capture that look and feel. Too bad it does not work.
