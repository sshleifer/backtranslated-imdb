This movie is very annoying, it owns a female gas station and tells a story of her life. Nothing will ever happen exciting. The director really feels like "it is real kept" and the camera behind it almost as a woman lives its life. I had to see other films for a class of this movie, others were not boring. This image also looked for an assignment ... it is better than a boring price with a good grade! After all, do not see the movie until it is needed. But do not discount other movies by this director because they are not bad ... and will not leave other films in Africa, they are usually good, especially when Western directors.
