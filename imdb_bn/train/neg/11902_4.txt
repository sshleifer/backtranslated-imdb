Violent issues about this movie are, according to the director, in the US, there was a problem in finding a distributor because most of the views it can not conform to seemingly contradictory messages of Christian and American grapes. In any way it seems ridiculous to look like a religious movie. <br /> <br /> Because a war veteran who prays with homeless people or wishes someone's wishes to "Godspade", does it create a "Christian" film? Someone can explain that it is indeed mocking religion for its "abundant" land, and the best organizing mission can be handed over to a bowl of symphony and a Bible verse. Unfortunately or unfortunately many? Lots of useless missionless missions? How much of the Monoeo vietnam vets? For this, as a delinquent living person of "pink" agent, do we think of America's "terrible land" of terrible patriots? Maybe we have lots of mental patients? Based on the phone conversations of the main characters of the film, most of us are not concerned about Palestine politics. Of course, if you work in a German homeless shelter, it is unfortunate that in a remote country, it will be much more worried than living her personal life of peace, because in the context of the world, Europe knows about "a great continent". In fact, I agree with the title because the United States "lot of land" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor script, amateur acting and overwhelmingly directed film. Life is very small and one, even an American, does not have "plenty" time to waste watching these pieces.
