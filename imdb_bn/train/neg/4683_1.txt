As a former submarine, I have ever seen it one of the worst submarine films. Above all, rebellion against US Navy ships, especially a nuclear-powered Trident submarine, is unforgettable. This is the best of men and dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is terrific and captains take it seriously from Captain to the junior crew. I could not see that the crew of any ship divided into their alliance between Captain and Executive Officer. An executive officer acting as a driver run by Denzel Washington was released from his duties and court martial, then pressed by the Navy. Navi refused to send a technical adviser to help create this film. Finally, if a member of a submarine crew makes noise in the vessel, then he will be severely suppressed. Learn as much as possible to learn their career as possible to avoid the identification of submariners. They do not slam the door and even speak quietly and do not wear soft soled shoes when running. When I was crew when I was surprised how they portrayed the crew. Strong music will not be tolerated. I actually painted the pumping life, do not sell movie tickets, but it would be considered ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
