... and being given below bigger than ever before. I do not have any direct references or anything here, but at least say, this film is kinder. If you're military-trained, do not bother watching. I want to see some friendly steps in the DVD / twinkle of war, I have kept 2 friends. Why I just could not read reviews. <br /> <br /> There are already huge spots in the movie "Bomb", and they show up and grow bigger and bigger. My two friends, who were not militarily affiliated in any way, saw the mistake of the filmmaker somehow, in my eyes, and I asked some questions about how we are realistic. Well, you might have guessed that they are not. <br /> <br /> Do not skip this movie until you can ignore these totally stupid and reusable mistakes. 2/10 To catch my interest first.
