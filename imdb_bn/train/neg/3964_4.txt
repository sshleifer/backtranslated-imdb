For all the promotions about this movie, I finally keep an open mind for what I think. And, although slightly slowly, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, because of some "old time" fears it makes a painful and uncertain. I was actually excited about a lot of cinematography this scene. Where the dark residue fails, however, its measurements are. The film's ending and contraction seems to be Miles Appart from her body. The story completely lies with an illogical conclusion in her face and the answer I wanted to answer - what happened to Amma? - It was not clear! The argument for negative energy was good, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What could be a pretty scary film was finally scared by a terrible end.
