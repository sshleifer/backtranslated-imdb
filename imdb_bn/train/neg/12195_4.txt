The plot is not so original to it. If someone sees "L'Alteimo Bassio" nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome who lives everyday is annoying and false, everyone asks others what they think. The end of the story is easy to understand because half of the hour is really annoying. Because Mukino's view of this movie is easy to see, so the hardest part seems normal too. It will be enough in the first 2 minutes of the film and the film's goal has already been told. The 30-year-old family saw, I do not like watching movies that I want to show in reality, but to be consistent with their thinking, I have to push more than normal situations. Mukinera keeps the camera in moving space with the camera and this is the only reason that does not allow me to sleep in the movie, although the movie always shouted from the beginning. Perhaps they can be good for the family to see how they are living in reality and there is nothing wrong with it. Mortent was intense and cool but unfortunately in bad movie!
