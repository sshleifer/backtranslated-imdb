Little Mermaid is one of my most beloved Disney movies. I'm sorry to say, when Disney made this sign, it was completely compromised. I'll admit it has some good points. The song is not bad, and the animation is clean and clear. There are some laughs, I'm sure - I do not remember, because after seeing it I banned myself from appearing again. The worst point of this movie is the plot. In this film, Ariel became his father. He forbade his daughter to go to the sea (yes, afraid of fear), just as she was forbidden to go to the country. I personally think that according to his past, Ariel would have maintained several brain ways and did not treat his daughter as his behavior, he was treated. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, changing Ursula, decorating the sea witch (underfed, forgotten sister) is more ridiculous than those terrible. He too, has some little insight to his bidding - but he's not scarier or worse than Ursula. Ursula has ruined our sufferings for its sufferings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same actor (some that always annoy me with a remix / sequel). (His voice was very clear to me!) I think the only reason for the film's creation was that Disney would catch a few dollars faster, I hate to remember a corporation that I really enjoy. I felt a lack of imagination in this plot. I know that this work (child will follow the parents' footprints) will happen, but Ariel was different. That we loved her so much. He had a dream, he fell in love, and he became that dream of truth. Until he appeared in this movie, that is. Then he became like other adults. I do not know this array. And I do not like him. <br /> <br /> I know of some kids who enjoyed this movie, and I know some adults who do not think it. But for me and all of you who love for Ariel, please do not see this movie. We die in the aerle, only a song or two, and a resurgence for a final scene, which is not bad (where he once again gets water) - although he eventually takes very little part.
