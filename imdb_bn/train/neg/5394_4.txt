When I get excited with Shakespeare's modern adaptations, the director can not raise his mind how to use the original or update it. If it uses the original word in an updated setting, then it is particularly difficult when set in the 20th or 21st Century, although it can work well in the stage styles, such as Trevor noon very late night sets Victorian very effectively. It can work with the setting of 30 if there is a lot of songs and dances and much more of Shakespeare's lessons. Unfortunately, it is a beautifully insignificant show though it is very nice. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that Brunge himself. I agree that he was too old to play a student, but more importantly, he is an experienced Shakespeare actor who, despite all his efforts to be another student, always shows his acting power. Of course he should have played the king - no problem surrounded by a mature student legend young students. Instead we had a happy but unimposing actor for the King, thus a legend so-called so-called so-called King. <br /> <br /> The amount of music and dance, which I got tired despite the beautiful songs and beautiful dancing, unfortunately it is understood that Shakespeare's dialogue will be widely spent. So the whole thing ended a trivial and light confection, and I was very upset with the curiosity, and it was overjoyed. Brangha did not complete the Shakespeare trial in this production. <br /> <br /> However, the emperors of Richard Byrs and Geraldine MacAean are fantastic like the old couple.
