Everyone is sorry, I know, this is considered an "art" film, but wow, their guns should be handed over to screenings so that people throw their brain out and do not watch. Although visual design and photographic aspects were excellent, this story is very painful to see. A sound track was missing brutal. Loooonnnnng shot was too long. How long can you sit down and talk? Especially when two people of the dialogue are complained. I really had a hard time getting through this film. Performance was excellent, but how dark, serious, uninspired, can you take stuff? I like Maorian Stapleton and his red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise it was a ripoff by Bergman. And I do not have any fan in it. I think that they are those who enjoy 1 1/2 hours, well, lies.
