I bought this DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pofferer fan. I decided to see myself at the beginning of this week. <br /> <br /> This is a reasonable entertainment piece that has two completely separate story lines. The division with Michele Pfeiffer was two more interesting. She plays a growing Hollywood actress who has many brief unfulfilling relationships. He literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (regular married guy with kids) after driving his car behind her. After being an enemy to each other, he proposed to run in his room because he does not feel comfortable to drive anymore. The romance develops leading the tragedy when his wife finally finds out. I was not prepared to what had happened at the end, but slow motion and routine TV guidance took a plot from the plot. <br /> <br /> Another section involves Darren McGuin's old studio boss. This section actually holds good cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Steven. They all want something from the studio boss but they are finally asked to resign, so they all realize that their career is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> It passes time but it is not interesting and I am glad that it was not bought for me. I'm not Michelle Pfaffafe fan, but she was the only actor to be an observer in this movie, and even in 1983 she was an actress. Overall though you are not a fan of it, avoid it as a routine.
