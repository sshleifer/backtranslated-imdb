I admit I am a great fan of this show, so you must know how disappointed I was to see this movie. First, the plot was awful, I thought it would be more interesting, to see Arnold's father or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a dog wants to destroy Arnold's room, in many other places, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , A spy friend; They carry a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and to make everything worse, they create super-patches on the bus, which many people have already tried, but Arnold, Gerald and Helga, not because of They are a video game expert. <br /> <br /> Actually, my mother, my sister, even I was really frustrated after watching this movie, because it's really the best way to end a good cartoon. I must admit that "Hey Arnold!" I enjoyed it, it was one of my favorite cartoons of Niklodion, but after the film's shit I'm not sure that I'm "Arn Arnold!" I'm going to see As I looked in the past <br /> <br /> Another thing is that with the huge dynamite, I can assure you that a common street will not explode, I think the whole city can explode with it, oh, and please, if all your future films Good cartoons are better but do not do more movies, you've used bad for cartoons that seem to be good. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I
