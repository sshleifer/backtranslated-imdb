I had to walk from the theater. After an hour, I see that people are cheating wives, screaming like a dog like a dog, and using the same f-word like diabetic use. <br /> <br /> no thanks. <br /> <br /> This was particularly frustrating because the film could do a lot. If they can do something more than fornication, talk about it and swear on one another, then any of the letters can be quite interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some types of character development, that happened to other sex scenes. The first hour can be summarized as plot development. 1) Several murder cases may occur; 2) Vinnie witnessed the killing scene; 3) Vinni is moody in the Atlantic / Eastern / Hudson River. 4) Vini cheats on the wife, and 5) Joey (most sympathetic Character show) finds kicks outside his parents' house. Even more, I did not wait to wait. Photography and interplay among the characters were fantastic, but there was nothing for them. There was very little price for waiting for another hour for some incidents of sexual and indecency. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Please read some from Notting Hill, or Shashank Redemption. Is a good study of community and interpersonal relationships.
