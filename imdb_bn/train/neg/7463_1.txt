I've never promised a long time ago, sometimes I see a movie that is a person who was ever a regular member of "Saturday Night Live". I did not get the "korki romano" rent, but I was compelled to watch for half an hour through my inappropriate good behavior. Then my good behavior failed. Foolish, not funny. Tired, not ridiculous. Bad, not good. That's briefly this I can say for this video.
