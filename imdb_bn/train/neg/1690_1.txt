This movie was awesome. I could just be awake through it. If I were provided then I would not see this movie again. The so-called horror scenes are increasingly predictable and assumed. The film was not really about anything which it was originally or valued at $ 7.50 I would pay for it to see. Do not go to see it, do not rent it, do not read it online because you will be totally wasted in these things any time. Sarah Michelle has given a relentless performance of Gella and in fact she has to be ashamed to enjoy her good name with this film. Joining Sarah on getting involved with this horrible, horror movie. Awesome movie, there is no need to see it.
