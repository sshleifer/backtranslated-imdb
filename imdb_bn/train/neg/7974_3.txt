It's the first interesting. A naive Park Ranger (Colin Firth) is married to a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zen), she is known only for a short time. They seem happy, then he disappears without warning. He searched for her and after some death her frustrated childhood and recent past is somewhat frustrating, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems that filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. At the beginning, when it sounds as not as suspicious, at least it's worth watching. Then it could be interesting or even stop learning too much. And the end is so long, so neutral, and irrespective of any tension or intelligence, you think the screenlists do not know what they can do about it and try to get bored. A good idea is to waste a sorry!
