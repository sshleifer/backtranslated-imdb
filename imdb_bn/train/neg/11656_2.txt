Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Just mention the movie, such as Mission impossible 2 can not be a comedy. The film is well-publicized about the fun scenes of white people and the wonderful use of James Woods and Andy Ritter. The film unfortunately plummets from there. Acting horror Tori looks spelling and works perfectly in place. The movie shows hacking together and surprisingly slow. This graduation packed movie contains some mess, which is also associated with the already mentioned Tom Cruise movie, anyone who is funny in my theater. The film, grateful, came suddenly at the sudden end of a sudden 83 minutes. (I'm frustrated because not endeavoring to end humor) I do not know what else to say, it's nothing more than a drunk freaked sedan to make Maramax more cash behind fools. Overall, a very badly completed movie.
