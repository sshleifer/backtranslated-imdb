... but the original word here is "usually." I have been talking about every thought that the movie has been worshiped. But in rating ratings movies, it's a Z rated. Absolutely ridiculous The things I respect about the most favorite of my favorite movies are that they do not take themselves very seriously. Filmmakers treat this type of film lightly, even if it is a serious matter. However, I have received this impression that the producers of this film took the initiative seriously, as they merged the 10-star classics, performing poor efforts in silly lines and silent camera shots. Despite this, despite all this, I have given 4 out of 10 still, as I favor these movies. If you're a b-rated fan, I'll try hard to find it.
