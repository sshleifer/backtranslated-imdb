What a waste of time! I tried to sit through the 'Sky Captain' about 6 times, and in about 3 minutes, I started doing something else in about 3 minutes - something else! It's a totally annoying movie, terrible acting, lack of writing, and obviously the first time director, because it was difficult. And I wanted to like it. I love the scientist, the old blind man, and I can try to request the flash gordon and the metropolis, but my God, I worked for the paramount picture and in 1993, I wrote Sherry Lansing using the blue screen for screen testing. He told me that they will not have interest or do this. After 10 years, Parament releases in 1993, Sherry was right, but he forgot his advice while making this dog green. The Blue Screen is a dominant shot, but not the whole movie. Let's not forget, Jude and Jolie are not great actors (but on easy eyes). Paltro's performance reminds me of high school efforts. Too bad - it could work ed, but only under a skilled director. The funny thing is, Sky Captain's director will continue to work after finishing this task. It is not trade, art!
