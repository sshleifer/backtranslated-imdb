Some things I do not understand Such as this movie. If I was really creating a really cheap and painful look of the Dino and Crocodile plural models in Maya and then people who cut and paste in an amateur video clip because of screaming and eating the same thing? How can anyone believe that the fraudulent CGI Denkroek will come out of any place, affecting the film's events? I know that its B-grade, low budget, and all but the producers can be broken into pieces which nobody ever sees or sees. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid that they will sit through this? Apparently so. laughing? No, these things are not even ridiculous.
