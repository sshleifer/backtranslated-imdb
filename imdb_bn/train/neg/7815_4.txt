As a longtime fan from Comunix to Superman in the 1950s, the first two of Chris River's films and Loes and Clarke and finally Smithville, I'm really looking forward to doing something clearer with "Superman Returns". Instead, we tried another attempt to convert Lex Luther into real estate, another superman-stomach-up-cryptnick crinking-crippanite sequence and internal inconsistency: when he himself sealed himself in the sea with 6 cryptanets , But when Lewis closes 3, * leaves the rest in it *, can he place the continent * in place ?? Truly, the only hero in the story was Loes Partner - I could not remember his name. He has done nothing more than all types of living, heroic things, but skill and skill - there is no supernatural, no immunity ... Only ordinary people <br /> <br /> They make Superman so small. Why can not we fight Superman for saving the universe from General Jode instead of Lenx's small scheme or to fight. Oh, I've forgotten ... they're having a childhood. <br /> <br /> Yes, I think I'll stave off a little girl ... <br /> <br /> You should probably, too ...
