I hired this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacy and Morgan Freeman seen this, so it looks promising. And it was, Justin Timberlake came upon the scene. She should not be allowed to do a really bad actor and sometimes a movie. I mean, one of the most annoying, uninspired actors he has ever seen. He keeps absolutely no emotion in any of his lines. Josh Pollack's role wasted why? I think Matt Damon likes the best. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacy is another big disappointment. Her character is so inferior, it looks like American beauty and bad mix of her character in John 7 Dane. It can be cool, but believe me, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. This is one of the very few good things about this movie. She's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing is special. Although he has some really cool lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, though it was a bit clear and exaggerated, it was good. I was expecting a big turn when Lazarver (Dylan McDermott) died, but nothing happened.
