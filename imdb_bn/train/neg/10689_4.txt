Cuba Gooding Jr., a secret service agent who blames himself for the assassination of US President, I would say directly that this is not significant for this very talented actor and why this movie shows us. In order to reveal the conspiracy surrounding the death of the President, he took a series reporter (with Anne Harmon) and thus, Allah, Allah, Bla. <br /> <br /> Even with James Woods's cast, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angel Harmon's 'End Games' failed to grab your attention, simple and easy; Some of the good works, the act is not bad and the story is still clipped and it can lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - not good! The script and instructions make absolutely sure that it does not suck you into a story at any stage or you do not give a slightest idea of ​​a character. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and dull.
