When we go like Joe Swan - we are at a time - a good filmmaker or even a filmmaker! Where are the new crop of filmmakers with brain and talent ??? We need to hell with them, bad and mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This film is about nothing, just as the characters of the film stand for nothing. It's this terrible, so-called Zen Yay, which is idle idiot, some of them have announced themselves to filmmakers that they are annoyed to learn something about learning before shooting. Well, Osson Wells was a filmmaker. John Houston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a film maker. Dryer was a filmmaker, etc. How these films, like these shows, can be stupid, so-called "filmmakers" when they believe that there is no script, no direction, no thought, no legitimate "camerawork" (everything has been shot horribly DV), an art of editing, Nothing stands for the creation of "rebellious" or "advanced" movies. No, it is considered as pure masturbation for ignorance, laziness, or just the movie (and really "jack-off shot" in your mouth, so be prepared). <br /> <br /> See the movie "Indie" in the first movie of the movie: Linklater, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jermus, Joest, Lee, or Harzg ... has not created anything as boring and purposeless. This is still Swan- whatever, still going on every year SXSW and greeting some kind of gutsy, new talent. Shit! I can not imagine anyone like this, and this so-called filmmaker has everything (which I saw) all bad (new stuff has definitely been made to appeal to one of the mainstream listeners, sitcom calling one). If you are not a friend or a family member, then make it clear clearly ... Secondly, if you are a family member or a friend, you will probably feel embarrassed to see the family member or friend in such an objectionable situation .. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not the art. It's the ultimate reverse.
