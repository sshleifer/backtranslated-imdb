This movie kindly reminds me of a Mary-Kate and Ashley cinema only. Only wealthy sisters think that the actress has acted more, but Amanda Miklakka is sometimes okay in this movie, but Allen is acting. I think that after the high school musical they needed to come up with a bit better and this was definitely not it. The story line was not too big and I think they got two guys to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not the big ally of Michelka fan, and this movie did not make me as good as me. I think they should be sick of singing and if you are not good at doing then only see this movie (which is sadly not me)
