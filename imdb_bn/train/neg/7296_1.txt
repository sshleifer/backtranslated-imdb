The Columbo movie is going downhill over the years, this year it may have reached below. Peter Folk gives the same stupid performance and this movie comes as vague. As usual in this series, the crime scene protocol is so lacking in the suitability of the suitability is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro hits the scenes chews and pantomime faces and Andrew Steefens is a fantastic unconvincing lady man. (His obscure, though, was a hoot!) Was by sponsoring the number of scripts and its distribution. They could not bring Colombo to the nineties, leaving only all of us with one or two memories of intelligent plots, good scripts and sharp characters.
