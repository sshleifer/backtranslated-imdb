<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The next girl's father thinks that he is a compulsive "son" ('Bhasikarman Piyan'); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupted the film with his speech, the worst was how homemakers started exercising through women's work - yet we believe that he is not a believer; Although he used to read well, he threw out seven of his six powers by fooling him; I can go, but you can get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are gods, gods and Rajinikanth. One of these sections has difficulty with directories for fitting Rajinikanth. Initially, Rajinikanth is doing what Rajanikant is doing only by Tamil heroes - standing beside villain and, despite being the oldest, the film's most beautiful girl got him. Rajinikanth does a good job and some of the trademark styles of Rajinikanth are actually enjoyable - an innovation of "father count". This movie makes it intolerable that some of the basic minutes are sometimes written by a bad book professor. Even some of the campaigns that are forced and obvious are punctuated with comedy. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; We see that the hero is facing various obstacles (from the politicians, normally), but we can not really make a routine for the hero because we do not know what the ultimate goal of the hero is. Ultimately, when everyone wants to be a leader, then the hero gives one of his speeches and becomes a fan. The director does not offer any solution to the problem of climax scene. <br /> <br /> at Rehman's score really interesting Either he shows the brightness patches or he does not bother to invest himself entirely in this movie - who can blame him. There is a scene where Rajinikanth falls into the van with a crane and then begins to count her father by throwing a knife. Music works as a catalyst for moments by adding a lot more appropriate and more stimulating. The songs are all middle class, some years later, nobody will be annoyed with the song from this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest place you can allocate to IMDB. This film contains all the elements to justify its proper place at the bottom of the IMDB ranking.
