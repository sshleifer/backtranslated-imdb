Or: Is it a bird? This is a plane? No, look ... it's a disaster! Or: No need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> (... okay, that's enough.) If the singer tries to make a romantic titanic like a box office crush, then he fails. The SR structure can not do this, create dark and limited color schemes (I would say it "will-washy"), boring natural dialogue, shoes with advanced aliens technology, missing fun and magic etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because it is not a Superman or Superhero movie. This is a (and a very bad and annoying) social study in this area, where every person can fly almost every 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so let us supervillas, superserrate and superfluous things. <br /> <br /> We like entertainment! Singer, if you want to create a drama about the sadness and tragedy of love of 2:40 long souls? Then take the character of normal people and remake a Yentl. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman back. And then, supersadlysoftie are standing in the door. Perhaps the singer tries to kill legends without cryptanets, but a bad movie can not do this. Do not give up, they are planning a signal ... <br /> <br /> The next time the singer (and Warner Brothers), create a superhero movie, do not have a sad superlame soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful imagination with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, there are technically all types, yes, there are many small things, some curiosity, a scene scene scene, etc. But these are the only bad pieces that are common to their common values. <br/> <br /> This is not more than the worst movies of my life and one of my worst movies. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Kate Bosworth playing a 22-year-old star reporter, she looks like 19. Superman was five years away, so she slept with her 6 years ago, so she wroting 16, (looking like 13) and a daily planet journalist, "I spend a night with Superman." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he is playing a little wood, but the whole movie is wood, so ...?! Temporary was well marsden and sometimes posey. Rest, forget it Even spacy, this is not its terrain. <br /> <br /> Reve / Hackman / Kidar is acting so easy with fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What would that be? The problem here, as they are a fun, means this is serious. Next, does Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fall and become like Jesus or angel? Or they speak directly to God. Why not They are superheroes, saving lives of people every day. So every week we should have at least one talk with God ... Oh my God. Perhaps it is not a real-declared movie, instead it's a diversified parallel parallel universe. <br /> <br /> This superlum depression flickr for the warnings brothers is probably the greatest disaster in history. Not just for money. <br /> <br /> I realized that it was difficult (or maybe) to create and transport some messages or feelings, but alone, missing and sadly people are not new and thousands of movies or TV shows are very good, Magnolia Like old or new And this Flying Superman, sorry, the flying frogs were more impressive than the Superman. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, this is nothing but nothing. Actually it's nothing but nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the comic (supercope) movie and stole it three hours of our life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smile's younger brother. (Very angry and green like hell.)
