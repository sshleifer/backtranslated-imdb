While broadcasting on Danish Television yesterday, there was two reasons to watch this slipper. First, I wanted to see Gina Lolobridida - and I was not disappointed here. She looked fantastic. Secondly, I've been impressed by reading the film that in the film of the Philip De Broker, it portrays a humorous humor that is not available. In this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found Jocos estimate (without any malicious comments about the war) and the letters were completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were curiously carried out in mechanical and unknown fashion, without any idea of ​​a play. I'm the observer at the end, but I was bored very quickly and I was sitting there, waiting for the Llobrgridder scene.
