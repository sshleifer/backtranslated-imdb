Joe Dawn Baker is here and there in the small role, good actor is right ... he was right in Goldstein and made a beautiful bond villain in Living Dellites and appeared in various other films. What he can not do is to run a movie in the movie, which he is in this very bad revenge movie. Joe Dawn's friend is killed, so he killed the murderer's brother and detains the murderer in Italy, but some people set up the plane in Malta and the killer went away. The rest of the film is pursuing Joe Dawn and the killer there, Joe Dawn has taken over various times, Joe Dawn is torturing and torturing a Bertender. The movie is pretty bad and you will not drag yourself for Joe Dawn's character. How many times will you be surprised by a punch of heroes don heroes and how he is proven to be incapable. The main part of the movie comes when Joe Dawn beats the murderer of Malta in a priest's garment, and then he gets in the boat and throws them around Malta. This movie is also sometimes one of the worst brackets to finish a movie.
