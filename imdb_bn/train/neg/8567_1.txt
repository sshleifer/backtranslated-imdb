When I rented this movie, I had very few expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the film was less than I was (much less). The actors were bad (doctor's wife was the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (without murder), but it's not a comedy, it's a ridiculous novel stupidity. The title has been well-chosen without a thing: after dead husbands they can add stupid movies! I give it 5 and 5 half.
