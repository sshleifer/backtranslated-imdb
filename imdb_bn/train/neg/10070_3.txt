Starring Roger Rogers Jesse James and his appearance-equal, gambling Clint Barnes George "Gabi" Hayes M. Roger's former flock, Sheriff Gabbi Gal Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Penn (Polly Morgan) are a significant team, because two journalists find the story about the protagonist's hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, the development of a plot of wrong identity / camouflage, Rogers is a "dual role" article. Rogers are charming, as usual; But, there really is nothing to increase its performance on it - any possibility of providing a memorable Jael / Hyde performance is done by poor material. The best pair of St. Joe Laurus' journal journalists to see Miss Storm and Miss - they highlight the film. The song is fine, though badly synched. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James A Bay (1941) Joseph Kain ~ Ray Rogers, George Gabbie Hayes, Gull Storm
