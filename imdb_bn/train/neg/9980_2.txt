Do not waste your 90 minutes on "Fast Food, Fast Women" It's predictable writing of annoying episodic scripts with three line lines patching together, horribly played, even bad music is ridiculous because of the bad. Every time I was on screen I found the unnxic main character crash. She needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend 90 minutes that you dedicate to Turkey is a bit exciting ... such as pruning your titles. You want more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Only the freedom fighter Luis Laser about this film, but he is much better than this tired script. Like the big man in the movie, she is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Look!
