After reading this film for years, how did it get Ruiz in French critics, especially the Snowbish Cahier rush, when I finally saw it about a year ago, I found it very frustrating (but I guess hope Sky high). Saturated Black and Sawdate Shots, these deliberately cerebral films (made for TV, and forgiving, only one hour long) have been described as a conversation between artists and an off-screen storyline that they are shown in a series of films (which are shown in tableaux vivantas style ) And try to keep some sources about hidden political offenses. (The scary Kate Buckinsl film has a similar argument to the film Acquirer). Borgesian is a word I read a lot of reviews about this movie, but I'd say almost no Borges story is more interesting than this film.
