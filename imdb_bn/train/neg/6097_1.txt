Back in 1985 I caught this thing on her (I can not call it a movie). I was in college and I was in high school, whose hormones were out of control. I figured out early that this was hopeless. Stupid scripts (to show how old boys have to score with a few young women), bad acting (with one exception) and kind-hearted joke. The beautiful woman nude here was happy with my friend for a while - but after 30 minutes she got annoyed. Remember - this is a high school boy! It was such that before the nudity became so easy on the Internet. We keep watching to expect interesting or fun things but that did not happen. The most interesting thing about this is the original advertising campaign which was filled in the studio! (A poster had a mythological review, "This is the best movie I saw this afternoon!"). Leadership has only shown the talent of Grant Cromwell and has actually gone towards a business career. No budget and annoying t & a. leave it.
