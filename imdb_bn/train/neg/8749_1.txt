Everyone said a terrible movie. Scott McCain's Camo appearance laughs me, which gives a reward for the programmers killed in front of the Sun Logro wall. McNally is the Chief Executive Officer of Sun Microsystems, a company that defines itself by Microsoft's hate. They have been instrumental in submitting betrayal charges against Microsoft. So, was this bad movie enough to be able to add fuel to that fire? <br /> <br /> I do not have any public records that I've seen Sun's involvement, but clearly this film maker Scott McNeley knows. An interesting mystery
