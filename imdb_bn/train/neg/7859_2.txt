My god This movie was terrible. I can not complain about it too much. I just went to see it grossed out. It was enough, sort of. It is funny that the most scary part of the movie was very soon where women were forced to give birth to extremely severely forced children. <br /> <br /> I think it was the most famous actor Hispanic singer in the movie, who was a supporter on Friday. Everyone in the movie has done a terrible acting job. It was something I had never seen to see the worst performance. <br /> <br /> I hope that it will be much more terrible than the first one. It was not. I expected it to be more awesome because it's a sequel and horror movie consistently less successful than their predecessors. Gore and Violence These days, it is expected to be even more dangerous than selling horror movies (panic 2, see 3, Zipar Cripps 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but it was not as awesome as the first one. There was still other disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first movie were annoying but the filmmakers worked so hard that they would be absolutely smiling. <br /> <br /> I hate the whole idea of ​​showing the son of a soldier's son on the camera phone, "I love you, mother" four times. It was stupid to show in the first place because they tried to feel worse for the weaker soil than the rest of our soldiers, and it was even more foolish to remember us even to show us. Three times more for this reason. This movie was a joke.
