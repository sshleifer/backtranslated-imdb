The airport '77 is loaded with a brand new luxury 747 aircraft with valuable paintings and starts with the rich businessman Philip Stevens (James Stewart) who flies on their flight and the VIP cluster open to the public with their property open to the public. As a museum, Stevens' daughter Julie (Kathleen Quinlan) and her son on board. The planned aircraft is planned at the airport, but a mid-plane plane plane passed by Co-Pilot Chambers (Robert Foxworth) and his two partner Banker (Monte Markham) and Wilson (Michael Marca Pataki). Sleeping gas, they plan to steal the precious goods and an unused flat strip on an isolated island, but during the making of their descendants, chambers hit an ocean ridge of ocean and it crashed into the sea due to crashes in the sea. Right in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle Trouble with wind, water extraction and problems to live with over 200 miles of flights are mounted for the living because they are fast waiting for quick help ... <br /> <br /> A little different Tally Airport 1977 Smasher Disaster Thriller Airport ( 1970) This second signal was directed by Jerry James and again it was like the predecessors, I can not say that 77 manabandara any kind of forgotten classics, it is not necessary for this exact reason, although it is not recreational. I saw so far that three airport films out, I actually liked this one, best. This is my favorite plot, three excellent mid-air high-jacking and then crashing (she did not see oil reg?) And drowning of 747 (probably the manufacturers were trying to cross the original airport with others.) The popular disaster of Piosden Adventures Tourism (1972) And it gets trapped where it is trapped, with difficult confrontations facing them, 747 floods or any door If the wind is open or sinking, it is open and it is a great idea to be prepared for a small disaster storm, but it is a missed opportunity because of bad disrespectful character, shameless dialogue, slow set-piece and a lack of danger or suspicion. Although the lazy plot gives entertainment for 108 minutes, it does not take much after the plane sinks, and I think that there should be Jinnah returned to the Kennedy Junked Airlines staff, Joe Petrani, but only got few views, and rarely said something to be concerned about the background, even when the navy could not fly with huge ships and helicopters. <br /> <br /> The home video and theater version of '77 108 minutes are run when US TV editions add an extra hour of footage with a new opening credit sequence; many more scenes such as George Kennedy's Patroni, character meat, and more Flashbacks Navigator with rescue scenes and discoveries or couple of corpses. Although I would like to see this extra footage, I'm not sure that I can spend around three hours of the airport '77. The anticipated film is badly messed up with the intruder fashion design, with internal design preferences, I would say that the effects of the toy planes model are not bigger than the others. Hall of Sheme takes pride in the Razzie Prize for signature with other two airports, although I can think of a lot worse than this, so I think it's a little rigid. Unfortunately, the action sequences are not slowly slowed down and do not cause tension, which seems embarrassing, if I am well-formed then it can be a beautiful picture. <br /> <br /> Production standards are worth seeing if the value is correct. Acting is not uncommon, but Oscar winner Jack Lemn once said, because of the mistake of this star, once Oscars winner James Stewart feels old and weak, once Oscar winner Lee Grant was drunk and Sir Christopher Lee. There are many things to do and many familiar faces have to be found.
