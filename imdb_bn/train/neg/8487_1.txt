I have not seen this bad thing since I have gone from the James Bond film "Muncher" to the twentieth century. I could only sit in its fullness for the sake of Sultan, but she could not do anything to save the animal. <br /> <br /> "Pie", "Orlando" and "Trance", have miserably failed in every aspect of movie moviemaking. Character was cardboard and unable to express any sympathy. The plot was completely incredible. Switon's exception was amateur, amateur Computer graphics were worse than "trown". Timothy Levy was extremely annoying. I could go, but what was the point. <br /> <br /> What I can say about this picture is that Tilda Swinton was in her. I do not know why an actress of her eligibility agrees for this kind of ugly behavior, but she probably expressed regret at this time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
