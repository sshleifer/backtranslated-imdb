Swayze is not a very believable alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; Which was my final protagonist in 1952 "Scaramooche", 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and 1950s "King Solomon Mines". Patrick Swayze completely failed. An old Alan Quatermain illustration by Shann Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was otherwise very good to flop big. Alison Doodie also lacks the lack of role in the role of Dobarra Kher's great lady, and ultimately it makes it harder to fill someone's shoes in the role of the most impressive Syriac Umbopo !!! Anyone frustrated by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, if I can not get you hands in the granger version, now I highly recommend it.
