There is a lot more chance than this movie. But it only fails to distribute, it simultaneously exposes the intelligent religious propaganda. The difference is that this time he is considered to have a south accent, which he significantly lose in each scene many times. <br /> <br /> Al Passino is his shotgun but it looks like this is walking through the image and collecting a check mark. He is like normal but rarely standout <br /> <br /> Casting Cast - A little something in the story, if something is added, but romantic interest is thrown into it. While talking about the story, one of the deceitful "real care" is where Kassak himself is the renowned Mayor, who just wants to search for "right things". <br /> <br /> People do not work this way Cusack's character ultimately loses all credibility, among which it is promoted and vomited, without disclosing it. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness feel deeper. Although it is completely wrong, I will not make the law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad, number movie. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's actually a promotional, promoter, self-righteous movie for the last moment. Good off with a mindless whip than junk this pill.
