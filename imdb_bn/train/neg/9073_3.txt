This film looked promising but it was actually quite bad. The courtyard was in O.K., but the plot itself was terrible. Actors try their best with limited ingredients, but they can not rise above the original spiritedness of this tacky college film. Jason Schwartzmann was once again very annoying - even more than the Rushmore, the rest of Cast was quite unknown. Putting off the scenes that should be fun and should be turned into incredibly adolescent. Trying to be a road trip / American pie but fails to cheat on all levels. Total waste every time.
