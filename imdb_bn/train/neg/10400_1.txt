Enough enough ... Sometimes they will stop making movies based on a concept of long death. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was annoying. The TV series was horribly depressing. And this movie only drives deeper parts. <br /> <br /> Another effect of computer influence and dolls, now in the 1800s, we have set the series in the Wild West and they fight against the Gobinas. Like the first one Rehash, they have to learn how to beat them again. I gently entertain myself. Otherwise this direct-to-video release, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is going the way too far. Oh and I'm wondering how any of these incidents have not happened ... did they just forget to record this unprecedented phenomenon? I think some such history will be made, so our friends in the first movie will not be prepared so much. <br /> <br /> A movie that destroys the original just makes me crazy. Avoid this rubbish.
