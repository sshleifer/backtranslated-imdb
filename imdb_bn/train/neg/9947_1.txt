This movie was terrible. I swear that they can not even write a script that they have paired it with the whole film. Ice was boring as hell. * SPOILERS PHHT does not see it more because * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. She might have gone long. The ground was difficult to catch him with the dogs near impossible. And when ICE is on that hill and uses Spaz-15 Aselit shotgun as a sniper rifle (and then cut a tree with eight shells?) Can take 1000 shells to spend the size of the tree.) Shotgun and hand gun are wrong at 100yards may be. And they even saw reflections. What light reflects ?? I do not see that opportunity a thing. Also, when he was shooting in the peg and continued, he was disappointed that he would die there. Plus ends where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette belt. Blow it up and will not kill him. The bullet will still kill the ice, but hug Barrel.
