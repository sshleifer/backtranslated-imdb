All right, so I went to this movie which is not really expected to see an action flick similar to Fast and Furious. Some excellent cars are some decent girls a bit of a decent plot. Unfortunately, I want to say that I have seen the worst movie this year. The cars were not good and the girls were not right, but the way they kept the movie was not right. The story just seemed not to care about you cast and the movie just seemed pieced together. So overall, this movie was not the worst thing ever, but if you want to watch a movie this weekend, I will now pass a pass for it.
