Despite the bad reviews, I just had to go to this movie ?? After all, Star H Super Super Shui Q Plus plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Is that worth checking out? Well, like Bab Fest, it's hard to lose Marshall Angels. Eye candy top quality. Shu-always seems surprising, and among the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandbroke and Amanda Strang have been especially caught in my firm eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if this movie is judged by any other possible talent, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action is unrestrained and cruel cruel to special effects. Director Clarence Folk and producer Wong Jing gave us a photographic cast and something else. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of seeing this one, would you be better to see 2 without having sex? Again!
