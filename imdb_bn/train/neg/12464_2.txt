This film was supposedly made up of five sub-plots with a thriller that developed simultaneously, but eventually it was over. <br /> <br /> The speed of writing was slow, the speed was slow and the letters were annoying. George Clooney thinks he has to go to the gym, Matt Damon uploaded it and others are reading their line from the teleprimeter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was carefully prepared to be politically correct and so it does not say anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentary more excitement. Just do nothing to see it only.
