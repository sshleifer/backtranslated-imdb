I love jammy fox <br /> <br /> and I enjoy 99% of all movies I can see. <br /> <br /> I said, I admit that it may have smiled behind some of the two minor white women, which smiled at every little thing ( "Oh no, jammy is walking on the door!"), But .. this was just so incredible boring. There can not be any durable camera shots and a camera shot can not be shot from a conventional angle ... everything will be your face, loud, and boring. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be smooth and like Malkovich, but at the moment it is old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. From all the letters, you have seen many lines, long ago you heard, and a lot of "hard people" lines ... and I do not think anything, unless it's originality. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Fox, and I think she was really fun, and I thought she was funny in this movie ... but it's not funny about all I have to endure. <br /> <br /> This film requires less shoot-up, less annoying camera shots, more passion, more sense, and more Jamie Fox. I gave it a 2.
