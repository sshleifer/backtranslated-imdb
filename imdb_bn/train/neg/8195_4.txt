On the eve of every Christmas, I still have to bear a new show in my life of this wonderful life. I thoroughly enjoyed bad Santa. So sued me. I admit it. I liked cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I like nice, intelligent ones, but with so many things, there is a lot of different things. What will happen to all the rumors of Samsung's annual cinematic Ka-Ching Ka-Ching in the Christmas season, from Edmund Gawley to Billy Bob Thornton? No one will forget Fred Fredson's Bedford fruit, but I do not believe that to achieve the Christmas film, Iconic level must be achieved. "Fred" is perfectly ok holiday movie, enough humor for adults and adequate charm for kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, though most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was the leading Santa, which helped a lot. A great flashing, and unlikely to surely see for somebody's annual Christmas heritage. But I enjoyed my wife and daughter and the things I enjoyed, the vacation with little dash on vacation. There is nothing wrong with that.
