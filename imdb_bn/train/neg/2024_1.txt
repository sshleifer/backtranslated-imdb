Trying to make money for the success of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs. 100, this lungi is an excuse for entertaining - Shoemi Moni, who danced 12 sexy dancers with a bright red hookah dress. A contestant begins a phrase, such as "which team has lost." Three choices, A, B, or C, which fulfill each word. There are three possibilities to answer the three options of the contestant. Host - William Shatna in his objectionable memorandum - asks the contestant if he "wants to lock the answer", and when the contender says yes, he likes a dancer, whom he shouted, "Show me the money!" He opened a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was correct, he added the amount of his winning; If he is wrong, the amount is reduced. (So, theoretically, due to the meaning of Shatner, it is really possible to compete in this frustrating competition.) There is a "killer card" and the contestant likes the girl who has scroll, but she answered correctly, nothing happened. If he responds incorrectly, the game will suddenly go to death and answer other questions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, Shatana asks women for the "last dance" and they all are somewhat blurred Do it. <br /> <br /> I see this event very much in 6 episodes, at this time it is expected that excuses will be shown for this unfortunate game. (It may be worse - they may host Cuba's Gooding Junior, although I'm called him a better dancer than 'Shat', though they call him this day.) <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess - I was wrong! It lasts only for 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
