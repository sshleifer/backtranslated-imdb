What looks like a good compartment for a movie ... unfortunately it fails to deliver on almost every level. Having worked very hard at the beginning of the movie, I've really fought myself with the desire to stop the biggest problem from a visible side, it really is that "aunty" nervous cuts across the spies and semi-movies that actually distracts you from the whole story. It's hard to immerse you in the moment and make it difficult for a suspicious ending, but the movie has only half the imagery and unnecessary scripts that just feel frustrated and confused, why they try to go so deeper with it. .
