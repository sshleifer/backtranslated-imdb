The worst TV series in the entire house! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that it is impossible to endure. The best character Joey even sometimes he is very annoying. The girl DJ, who wrote her character? Every time I speak, he wants to kill my soul. Danny mentions when starting with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> DJ Casino won almost ten thousand dollars or more. However, he is not eighteen, so do not play gambling according to the law. However, casinos were ready to pay their money, but then Danny recognized him and he was not eighteen because of the money he did not raise. Oh, give me a break, is not it? The scene that I saw stupid and child, I immediately stopped the television. They will not buy a child who is not saying anything in this series. Who the world thinks the flower house is entertaining and fun? Without this, Shakespeare wrote without writing how he would write Shakespeare's words, and he wrote scripts for the complete text as stupid for writing something that is childish and stupid. <br /> <br /> For those who have bad heart or bad medicines, or have any desire for life or have any feeling in the real world, I have not seen the 'full house' deeply! Try it. Avoid this series. Protect yourself from idiocy and nonsense. This is the worst television show ever! I'd rather see the teletbills. 'Do not see this'
