Madeleine is an incredible place to live, work, and study. I was there twice, and I have never heard anything about guerrilla activities, hostesses of hostages, or anything to sort. There are "invisible police", but it is not a Big Brother system *. There are just enough police that they are visible in everyday life, but they do not trouble anyone for some reason. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary that portrays young people in this film, of course, its characters. Film directors carefully constructed a plot line in the daily activities of La Sierra residents, and when a "character" dies, there is genuine passions. But it is hard to imagine that all the members of the three youth block Metro, a Colombian government group used to terrorize La Sierra before the country's reconstruction began. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is a perfect illustration in the life of Colombia; Of course, some minor crimes may be just as aware, but when "modern" cities like London, New York, or Tokyo seem to have been pickupting, Colombia does not seem to be different after all. Colombians are looking forward to seeing them around the world that the country is now progressing better than before.
