The show was a great episode, this is not one of them. This is not a terrible episode, it is very difficult to follow the "dead person", "the room covers", and "the cat that is digging is actually gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple married to Peggy (Amanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shelene). In the first five minutes, you know that Charles had just married Peggy for her money. The two went to their honeymoon and their car broke down in a hole in the pit and had to take shelter in their old abandoned palace. Charles soon finds a secret in the family of Peggy ... <br /> <br /> I think you will see this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the first episode.
