A pair of movie campers, a man and a woman likely to walk together alone in a huge desert together. Certainly people hear something and it makes him so mad that he goes to investigate. Our killer stomach welcomes him with a stab. Then she rides the girl and slashes her throat. During the opening scene, the camera is from the murderer's point of view. <br /> <br /> We meet with the next four main characters, two couples, of which there is a stone. The joke about how men will be able to handle camping alone double, sparking the token blonde's ambition in one week. Unexpectedly, men leave the same day and their cars are broken. They arrive in the evening. When people come, they warn about their disappearance by Ralph Dopplanger on the streets of the dungeons. With the song about the killing of dark forests, they ignore the warnings and initiatives of black night and sing eight hundred songs. People are lost <br /> <br /> In the next scene we realize that this is not just a burning clone, but a ghost story! Women are afraid and huddling by fire together in the lonely. Two children decided to show shadows and play Tom peeping. Well they are definitely scratched by their voice echo! Her mother came out of a hole in her forearm and came out and asked two women if they see her child before she disappears. <br /> <br /> Children go to father's house and tell two beautiful women from the river. Because this is quite a stir and he gets up, grab his knife from the top of the fireplace. "Daddy hunting hunting," the little girl exclaims with bad acting. It is clear here that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " We have already heard that it is not understandable because of Pantha's pregnancy (perhaps she is swimming in allergic and even in California). She got a little injury before she fell into the head. A thunderstorm explodes and men seek shelter, which turns out where Papa lives. There is clearly no one here because there is a fire and some weird roasting on it. The children appear and alert the father, who looks after moments. As soon as he arrives, they disappear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, our killers go after women only. She invites men to eat something and tells stories about our ex-wife. We are given a flashback to get caught catching his wife cheating. The old man will not tell them that he and his lover have killed later, but it's about the light of the day. We are not given the reasons for the death of children. People go to sleep and go cruelly. The next morning, the men look for their women's camp empty. After a brief discussion they split up. One can stay in the camp, go another and get help. One that is going back to his car breaks his legs. We then agree to the surviving girls that they were the ghosts who were sad about their mother and killed themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> She was dating or blonde was married. The way children are killed and women have to tell about it. He decides to see it for himself and probably run into the killer. Thankfully, the children stopped him by threatening him to leave forever. You know where you are going. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film deserves four stars out of ten, and it is generous. For all his misgivings, the musical score is well done. It's still very watchable. Some cameras are in the corner which looks professional and some set is well done. The plot is incredible. There are such things as voluntary voluntary volunteers, but with 6 miles walk away; I can not imagine Token Blonde will take off that middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Allan "Skip" banned
