I thought that Jumbo Flush Eaters 2 was a pretty horror film when the body was recovered by the US military, while the body was recovered by the US military, when the body was released into the atmosphere in a small island. Soon the infected locals become meat-hungry bodies and a group of soldiers on the holidays must meet a group of tourists and they will manage to survive in a abandoned hotel trying to save lives alive. I did not find this picture as good as the original movie, Jabboo Flesh Eaters. But it's still a just awesome movie with some good actions. I was not one of the best in the series. 4/10
