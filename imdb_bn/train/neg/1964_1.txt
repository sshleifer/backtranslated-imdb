When I saw this movie cover, the first one I think was made for the video. In the mind, the second thing looked at another horrible movie "Darkness Fruit", the story of this dark wizard who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, most of the darkness fruit was a great composition compared to the garbage junk, and this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short back story for the wizard, or plays an uninterrupted role for two young people who provide a shiny new bike for their storages to meet with teeth. The opening is poorly filmed, and like the rest of the movie, it certainly is not scary. Currently, the picture is about Peter (Lochlin Monro). Peter rented his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (the moon west), and his daughter's coils came to stay there. Coils meet a neighbor's child, and they talk about tooth fairy, and how do you lose your teeth, or he will come for you. Unfortunately after a second, it seems Tooth Fair steals his bike and pulls out his teeth (how harmful). Cole tooth fairy will live in anger, and her mother and Peter can protect her, and awaken their romance ... it's a bad movie, maybe you can find it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this stupid film is how to control the tooth fairy. They say, if you lose your teeth, then he kills you. He is like a serial killer who dies randomly, and if you lose your teeth, you're going to go He stole a bike, so apparently he is a thief. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this movie was based on the Darkness fruit, but where did the tooth fair look for inspiration? let's see. She looks like a burning victim, and she previously went around killing slaughtering children. Hmmm ... this is a proper rip off of Elm Street movies about "Night Night" of "Frame Krieger". And this is not the worst part of this horror mess, is the measurement. This movie may be the most ridiculous climax (not literally funny because I'm more ill at it than fun) I have ever seen. Do not see this <br /> <br /> Just a little negligence. Lochlin Mukoon was in a horror movie, and Zyana Ballard was on the horror movie 3, and they were both in it, so apparently the scary movie stars were forced to finish their bad career. <br /> <br /> 1/2 of my ratings ****. 80 minutes. No more for violence.
