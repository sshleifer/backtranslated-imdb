For such a great classic story, setting (position), Grendel was frustrating. As an author, I blame the script that completely lacks dramatic tension. The club's story rubbin provides a new system of useful and literary classics. For some strange reasons the Rubik was primarily excluded. To know this, I was shot dead in 21 days and it shows unfortunately. Now we have to wait for the big screen Hollywood version. I have the word in FX, I can really endure crappy CGI but the script will be rock and it lacks a very slow, spartan and drama. I will blame the actors but ... because I know more than acting, I will choose my colleagues.
