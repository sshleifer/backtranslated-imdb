That's one of the worst movies I made. Plot goes as follows. Slogan for 10 minutes or more by exploring forest areas. B go anywhere and have a strip. Some more jungle slogans. Let the other excuses to hollow. Back to the jungle. Oh look There is a Tarzan looking guy! Strip, bo - strip. Safari kill people People looking for Tarzan have a fight scene. Bo saves. Bo strips. Run the credit. Run the credit, run.
