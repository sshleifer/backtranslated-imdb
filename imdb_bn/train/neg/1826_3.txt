Last night I saw this movie and even after a few beers this film came out from me when I realized that I was actually watching it. In a word, it is unfunny. UNfunny I fully believe trivbit about jack black forgiveness for making this rubbish. I do not believe that Barry Levinson will not miss this script when reading the first page. I can not believe that I have seen it for more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 * out of 10 because I love seeing Christopher Walken a terrible movie for picnic. Also, this movie exists as a character, the horse "Corky", is actually quite ridiculous.
