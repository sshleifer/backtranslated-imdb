Nacho Vigalondo Spain is very famous. He is such a bad show that you can feel sick ... very embarrassing. Nacho has made some trade on TV, I think Naco was searching for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (commercially, Mac Kerni was about to collect CDs). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like the business of a nurse: bad stories, bad directions and awful performance. I can not believe that such a horrific movie was in Kodak theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image can be very well connected to a Spanish TV businessman, the producer of his wife, 7:35.
