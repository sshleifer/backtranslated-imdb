First of all, tell me that I'm a big fan of Ashley Jod; So I was interested in testing her first role. No argument that its genius is clear and its performance is excellent. I can guess how professional critics prefer the aesthetic content of the story. However, I think the movies are meant for our entertainment and where this movie is failing. <br /> <br /> By half the point, I thought to myself, "How long should we bother the store girl, idlly standing near a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?" <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there is no such luck. The movie finally ended up all the annoying, annoying, weird stories. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm a job-junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedy. But I hope to entertain. <br /> <br /> This image is comparable to your neighboring bad home movies. Frustration! <br /> <br /> I will not like this movie. Zero Entertainment Price. The longest 114 minutes of my life <br /> <br />
