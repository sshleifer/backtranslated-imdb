Maybe it's dipping, or maybe it's a continuous scene of people crying, crying or otherwise carrying, but I've never seen Europa 51 being one of the most consumed (and so annoying) movies I've ever seen. Mother's Ingrid Bergman's boy (his Sandro franchina) is too busy to spend her stupid time. While entertaining guests at a dinner party in Mummy and Dad (Blue Alexander Knox), the young boy tried to kill himself, in order to change the continuous continuity of life, which was found during Bergman's time while maintaining condolences on the poor and the poor. Inspired by the editor of the Communist newspaper Andrea (Itoro Zahani), she soon spends less time with her husband, who lock her up in her mad shelter for her hardship. Bergman played the role of Hill, played the role of the Jordy of Arc in 1948, and Rosellini did excellent work for his illumination and the best effect. Unfortunately, this script enhances its position with the Ham-Faced Golden Globes, such as Andria and Mam Marxist and Christian Plotwood. By the scene fitted to the final tears, I had more than this to fill my tedious characters. As a real step for Rossellini, he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the legendary and mysterious theme of St. Francis's 1950's.
