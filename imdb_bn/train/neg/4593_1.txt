As a physics student, I became aware of many stupid professors in the field, and so-called so-called experts. When I'm studying my studies, I am going to examine the real physics and learn more about those who are working properly. <br /> <br /> Then, my friends would like to see me talk about this "physics film". I do not know anything about it, I'm excited, hopefully the information will be well presented. <br /> <br /> I have made real quantum mechanics; It was not. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a fundamental idea that anything can happen to you in any dirty particle, and if you can just open your eyes. Think for it, for a moment <br /> <br /> Our bodies comprise somewhere near 10 Â° 30 dioxide particles. That's a billion billion billion particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of canceling each other altogether. If you add more particles to the mixture, it is almost impossible to have large net quantum results. Ask us to believe that this is a valid idea, there is no logic behind it ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, in physics, and I counted 3 events during this movie. But they were always presented in a confusing way. I have never seen <br /> <br /> I can not say much for the nervous part of the movie, I have no medical training. It seemed as though it was a bit more true, remembering my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least this image was worth the release: dancing peptides (or whatever they were actually) in the scene. Not to destroy the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees "different" personalities with their pypidides, and then the film goes to the dance floor, where we are surrounded by split dances, occasionally surrounded by SG peptide, And filled with a complete CGI scene, dance peptides. At that time, the film was trying to tell us to "add emotions", so our lover's song was treated with the complete song, "Love is addicted." <br /> <br /> <br /> This scene was released because of the scenes that can go through, and still take this movie seriously ... well, you are the ones who "have to open your eyes."
