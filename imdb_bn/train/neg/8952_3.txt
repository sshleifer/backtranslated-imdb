I'm now 37 years old when George Orwell's future life is over, but what I saw after reading the book is completely confused. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, I am sure that is mostly, but only by losses and by quotation. Without this limited knowledge, this film was a mystery, even with it I have not been more educated about the 1984 story, which I saw before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At least as far as the campaign is concerned), but with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a few names related to Eurasia, but nothing is understood without their explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? What does she do? Where does he come from? Where does he work? Why did he change the news report? Why is he not in the front line? Why does not he eat food in the canteen? What is he drinking with full water? Why is he so weak and sick? Why is he not as intelligent as everyone else? What is the deal with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little back story has been beautiful, no scrub that, do not read essential books for those like me. Apart from this, it is difficult to follow a confusing and art-house movie, which guides you about what's going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been disrespectfully and badly edited and continuous editing from it sinks into conversations that make it harder to work on how the Big Brother screens are running. I admit that this may be an artistic choice, but it is similarly annoying. Also, I know it has been mentioned earlier, but why all the nudity? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, for the words these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is another step too many steps away. I can only imagine that you read this book because it relies entirely because if this film is really 'literal translation', then I tell many people why it is very important to understand why 1984 is honored as a classic. <br /> <br /> There is no denying it is denied that it has given light years ahead of its time and predicted every change in our society (perhaps it was a Bible)? But many novel novelists In the story, the same thing was done without a splendid hole. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I have to do from the beginning and buy a copy. If I want to make any assumptions in this book, <br /> <br /> <br /> I was waiting for a few years for a lot of frustration.
