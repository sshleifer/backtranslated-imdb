After reading most reviews, I do not know some people watching movies, but obviously I did not see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome. Acting, Moore initially, just terrible. Women can not work. Nice tits, but she just could not work Sometimes he does not come across the real character. Instead, this violent Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play with the boys to play. <br /> <br /> And this movie is finally - Hollywood's Belief. Training is at the top of the order. Politics - at the top Political Purity - Above Battle Scenes - You Guess It Up, Up Get your mission going and get out without being detected. So what do you do Shoot so many rounds off and certainly make as much noise as possible. Oh g Eye. Jane, you can be my wing man any time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> What else can be expected from commercial American films? I guess so much.
