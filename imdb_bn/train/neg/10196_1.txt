As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to watching this movie - especially it was Scotty Newsen. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <Br / <br /> <br /> Unlike characters and annoying, soundtrack horror and plots, well, not one. <br /> <br /> I got really headache and repeatedly read my own barcode number. Twenty minutes after the DVD box I became bored. He was really disappointed that Newsne was not in the film, otherwise I would have lost $ 16 off eBay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - 72 just like offsets !!! Terrible :(
