There was some error in this movie from the beginning. The main character of Hayden Christensen is a rich young Mogul who inherits his father's vast wealth and power and he is struggling to fill his father's shoes and mother's (and co-executives) are very tight. He has a heart disease problem and organ donor registry that is waiting in limbo. There are also short stories that your first impression becomes most important later, such as his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and middle class girl (Jessica Elblas), her friendship with her romance. Uncreative story lines, but the movie is not bad enough to destroy. The only real "Oh vey!" The moment was the name of Lane Olin's character. Lilith is dependent on woman ... fine! <br /> <br /> Surgery scenes are not in the sensor. I appreciate that, those who could not find the scary scenario of surgery. The horrors of awakening during Anesthesia were well done first. You feel emotional pain by crystalline crystallization through crystalline chest and rib spreaders. The satirical moment comes from the trailer, when he takes some unfortunate awakening in the fasting time, he is still lucky that his surgical team plans to kill him, he helps him to know. <br /> <br /> A big turn, but very predictive and send the film to spread the memories of conspiracies and his little signs, but he missed us initially, like us. <br /> <br /> There are two more twists in the end involving her relationship with her mother. An impressive gesture by an oyly, which comes as helpless due to poor writing. The other is secret about the past of the family, which seems very long and vain. <br /> <br /> Well done Anesthesia awareness plays in poorly written conspiracy theater. This is a complete endeavor that has flat fractures, it's about the whole movie.
