Movie makers can make it a rated rating with a guilty / exploitation film (with plenty of nudity), but the coyote firefly can be more effective. But since PG-13 ratings are all these days the studio wants us to do so, we finally end up with a movie like this: A PG-13 "Teeses" Flick is not allowed to go anywhere near the movie that can go as far as possible. <br /> <br /> The script is generic, it is actually easy to guess what the plot point will happen in 15 minutes before it actually happened. Acting is enough, but the letters are so paper-thin that nothing can be done with them. There were so many points in my mind that I was watching a music video instead of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only wealth of this picture is a wonderful woman. We get to see them in some extremely tight and gorgeous exposing outfits ..... but only PG-13 can be shown due to limitations. There are plenty of discretion and tones, some well-dancers are making groups of dance numbers, but there is nudity or gender to speak. Teera Banks (They are becoming even more beautiful with age) for a very short period of time. Sexy Newcomer Piper Perabo is very easy on the eyes (and its a killer smile) and shows some genuine acting feasibility. <br /> <br /> I found this movie only for pre-teen boys. Rated ratings are not allowed to watch movies. That audience might get a lot of it from a titillation perspective, but the adult audience would feel annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: Movie-1 Women-10
