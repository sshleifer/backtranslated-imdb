3lbs is probably only a self motivating program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / Moody deep doctor. Except the House he is absolutely not even attractive in the case of brain surgery, unlike any personality and Gray's anatomy. This program is supposed to be set in a leading center for neurlogical field - there is nothing going on yet interesting or exciting! The so-called 'dubious' conflict between him and the rival does not even add to the show and does not even hallucinate them. In the pilot, there was a brief look at his father's social life. Boring and vain <br /> <br /> <br /> This show has a glow of almost therapeutic plays, and it does nothing to stand out as special.
