A few months ago I saw this picture with some friends, even today I am very stupid to be silly The first few scenes were delightful alone. I will not loot anything for those who want to see it, I do not want to laugh. During the whole movie I saw this movie and said, I was trying to understand exactly what points I was doing in this movie. In the end, we all got bored, as the primary sunrise of a movie and Shock stopped this random. There is no trace and a trace of acting decent. A kindergarten about the characters is about as developed as "Learn to Read" books. They even managed to make reluctant to lesbian lesbian scenes.
