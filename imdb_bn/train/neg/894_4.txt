Yesterday it was seen at the Sao Paulo Intel Film Festival. Before leaving I came here and saw how it was rated, and at the time it was 7.4, a nice excellent rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to go out (never) but the film's producer Feeling embarrassed for the screening. <br /> <br /> I do not like the dialogues are shallow and are not leading anywhere, the characters are shallow than the dialogue, nothing leadership somewhere, and the worst and the worst: movie advertisements Siemens and lots of organic. I've already paid for myself to go to the movies and Chattelling's main character on the Internet and Siemens Mobile has always popped-up on top of her lap; Or other character bathing or cutting his hair, there are only plenty of organic shampoo displayed on the screen! Plots, characters, romance, some were good but it would all be endangered, but bad, really bad! Do not know how to do a "sexual relationship". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
