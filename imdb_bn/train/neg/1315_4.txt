Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that her uncle Oli is coming to watch the new wife and baby. The problem, they do not exist - Ollie apparently made them! So, to find a child with a child near him and his Paul who agreed to make his family promise. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I saw at least a couple with other muted shorts with this right plot. Among these, Bobby Vernon did not kill me. It's much better than most people - perhaps it was created a decade later - when the comedy becomes more sophisticated and relies less on the non-snap-snapstick. Now I am not against physical jokes, but in some snapstick films, shooting people, humiliating each other and making a little disturbing. Sadly, at the end of each other, they are doing exactly what they are doing. None of this is sensual and it is as if they go beyond the ideas of the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a milestone in entertainment. There is a considerable amount of merit to monitor it until you have a obsessive silent fan like yourself.
