It is a movie that tries to rebuild Thai history, which is located in the ancient city of Ayurveda. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was like many Thai movies which I saw and enjoyed, in which Thai actors say Thai and martial arts craziness. Well, it's not anyone. The film is shot entirely in English, it is full of the Anglo-Actors, and production prices are so awful, ridiculously bad .... but not funny! Can we blame for this garbage? The acting, dialog, and set were mostly quite bad. Through their local high school drama club, they saw some war scenes like dancers. Special effects were mostly bad, but some were only patchy in the cheaper animations screen, especially Chess effects. This is a large, epic-style outdoor war scene, where thousands of additional dresses run across a field, but when we see the conflict between the two forces - HA! What a joke! The film features a couple of beauties. They do not show a little more skin. At least that is something to appreciate that guys. Do not disturb.
