This was the most stupid movie I saw that there was no plot and the actors were not taking care. 90% of the film was not a plot, I laughed my rib began to hurt. Bit where the old man was wicked when Capture Robert Duvall. A silent film on a supper level does not involve the precipitation on the main character and the abundance of rainfall closeups. This is a failed attempt to create a noor thriller and instead dislikes viewers in an incompatible view. It was based on a manuscript of John Grisham, because I do not count as one of his book for adaptation of this film because it does not show any mystery and compelling stories such as 'Firm' or 'Rennemacher'.
