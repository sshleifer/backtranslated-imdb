I can not find some big space for this episode - that Miranda is so extraordinary, and something ugly that will make you crazy. Someone here commented that it might be something more than atrocity instead of light waves or freelance. Miranda is just a blur. The episode is slowly, incompatible and deviated. I do not even understand why Coloss is an ambassador - why does not the federation leave Madusan only? I like a part of it, when speaking about the loneliness of human experience through a colossal speech. Overall, I've been in love with TOS and even its best, I'll always tune. Although this episode - Mmm, I will not buy it except the copy used under $ 3.
