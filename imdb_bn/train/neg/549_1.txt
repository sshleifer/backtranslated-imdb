I can not believe that Indian film industry still keeps a third-thirds drop like a walk. For beginners, storyline is completely impossible ?? The minor boy was thrown out of the family so that he could teach some self-sufficiency. So what will he do? He quickly won some national talent competition by jumping some stars in front of a panel of judges (I'm not really kidding here). Meanwhile, her father is going to die of lung cancer, but he keeps it secret from the boy, but he lived long enough to see his son famous, to see his new grandson and to create a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Is the actress worthy of his miserliness? There was no attempt to convince any major player of this film. Naturally, for the Indian films, the family lived in a huge palace and seemed relatively obsolete by the real world concerns. <br /> <br /> Since making such terrible movies, since the honest, the main victims have made the mistake of knowing intelligent visitors such pictures. Actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be honored as god by people who are nothing but the blind faith of Bollywood.
