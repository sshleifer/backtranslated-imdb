My God is a scary boring movie. I'm a big fan of Gina Garner, when I rented this movie, I hope romantic drama and some great performances of Garnashon. Gerton is always great, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is very good for the red surfaces. Romance is very uncomfortable in Gerton and Serbazzi's characters. And I absolutely hate the character of Sergeyzija (the organizer of a world), he is not charming in any way in the movie. How Dr. Lauren Graham (Gerson) is out of my understanding Perhaps Shan Connery, Robert Deanero or Harrison Ford did a better job of this role, but they do not think the European-Scale guess. However, I was so annoyed by the druing of the movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Garnashon film, watch her best movie bound. If you are looking for a young and old age romantic movie, try some Harrison Ford or Shan Connie films. Gina Gerson is so humble, and deserves a better chance, I want her to be better liked in the future.
