Gentleman sleazeball Bruno Mattei again found it again with this erotic thriller that echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. However, as expected, Matthi made his film in a small budget - so it looks unfinished after it's new release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To give His daughter is not only found in Europe but also in prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys to get her sources. While he finally reached contact with the snuff organization managed by the mysterious doctor's head, he got himself in danger. <br /> <br /> It's not good to say about it, though it's a promise. The problem is that the movie is not as lazy as it is, and so a director can expect to produce films like Blood Willault. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) It is not fair enough and it does not actually contain the attention of viewers in nudity and sex. Plots are not that special, probably for various different positions of wonderfully across Europe. The end is extremely frustrating. Acting is not really awesome, besides Anaa Our, who played Doctor Hadith: He sees and works extremely vague. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But again again helm It's good to be back: It was the first thriller from the 1994's Gial Whiskey Dentro.
