I'm really very bad about science / fay and horror films - I'm seeing them at the age of 4 or 5, so I've seen some bad things, but I have to deal with it. I have not seen too many Saifi Channel movies, so I do not expect too much - usually a committed movie that does not stop talking. Springs are the eternal hope, I guess - or the hope of hope over the experience, as they say. Unfortunately, it was a dog from the beginning and I knew it, but like a moth to teach, I thought, something would be interesting. It's not All the actors give a decent performance - given the script, I do not know how they all put the face straight. Collagen-hungry insects have something with parasitic animals who are slowly taking on a body of human race, one at a time. There is a bad plastic surgeon who cooperates with the enemy's outer appearance with their people ... Do not worry, he gets what he is coming to him. Slug people themselves do not know where they came from, they think they might have thumbed a journey on a tattooed earth, but ... they know about slug royal members among them - the slug princess who is able to breed with a man Know that she loves the worm queen and her own ... Oh, what would I have to go? Please, I request you, will not see it for 2 hours of your life ... something will be good ... you can spend two hours in a bad, less enjoyable way ... it will be even better.
