This movie is like real life, which means I do not do anything on the occasion of 2 hours or more, and the game plan or plot is often not proven by the invisible cast (their invisibility is mentioned by many critics due to "experimental" lighting). <br /> <br /> A big bore. Altman is no big surprise in this surgery - he's a very variable actor (yes we all like "Gossford Park", but "Pate at Ports" someone? Kansas City? TT and Women? S), but the raw material is actually a John Grisham Excellent cast that you will understand through the story, and gloaming your sleepy sleep collection - it really makes a great composition of the bad film. And no, it's "very bad it's not good". <br /> <br /> It's bad.
