Alon in the Dark Hall is a BAD movie and associated with Dus Bigallo for the worst movie of the year. My wish was that I would say but of course IMDb counted a word and corrected it all. <br /> <br /> Do I think any kind of bad movie bad bad movie? Red Zune Cuba, slower goo and low budget drakes like Mansos. Or a huge budget like Goggles, Superbabbas or this Gough disparates. Director Md. Ago Go Go and Monos can see movies because there is no source of the director. Such films are directors, fools, money-loping donkeys, who are not only concerned about their audiences. <br /> <br /> When you speak Uwe (this is the mastermind behind this frustrating whip and already has some real rubbish under its belt) that happens once in a blue moon. Really horrible bad horror pictures. Everything about it is a mess. Chess CGI, bad plot, insane random camera cut and insulting soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Alone, Dark is a horror movie that absolutely no one sees. Hello Review on Give me a sting, roll in 2006 and I can not say this again. <br /> <br /> Do not see this picture.
