According to IMDB, there are no reviews for any website; This "thing" is not a director. Well, that would definitely explain a lot! Insert some misleading indecent sequences together for a group of gathered and an isolated sanitarium wall inside the thin slab about Satan worship and female sacrifices. "Hardgore" is a prime example of the completely demented 70's smut, it is really made with production quality and scripting inspiration. In the beginning of the 70s and in addition to pornography, horror movies were very popular in satanic discipline, so why not combine them together? Here's a simple story about a young nymphomaniac girl who is committed to her for a mental shelter, and on the first night already, she is drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, a lot of dildo-action. Friendly lesbian nurse tries to alert him, but he even has his throat slit on the same night. The horrible aspects are really elaborated weakly, ridiculously torn away from the masked devil mask to ridiculing non-fearful devil masks. Photography and acting performances are almost helplessly amateur, but what do you expect from a film that sperm-arson talking about dildo footage and spoken male reproductive organs? The leading lady is a fine girl with a rhythmic body of John Lin, but most of her co-stars (male and female) fierce and excessive-haired sleaze balls.
