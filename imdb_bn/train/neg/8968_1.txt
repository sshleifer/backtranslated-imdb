The screen writing is so stupid, my life has been lost 2 hours, I will never return (where I have heard it earlier). So much so to play. Often changes make things happen to keep you observer and wait for some events. Yet there is not a single core item in this movie. The first cube was a horrific movie, which did not create much sense in the end, it was raised on the bare zero and tried to revise the same story, without this time the first movie did not give an answer to it Spoon-Feed explanations for every detail. The comic thing is, the director was a bit weird and recycled the exact sequence of the first film and tried to explain them. But the scenes are just copied, there is no logic. This script is sooo dotless I can imagine that it is written for a 15 year old belle cap and a square project with a beer pack. Finally, they upset the 'good' wunderkind guy, and he became a disastrous co-worker in the first movie, and in 1997 when they found him (see 'this room green ..'). Gudi Goody, Clap Clap, What a Bound First of all, if you have not seen the first one, then it does not give any idea that you ntk the director. Oh, another great idea: instead of numbers x, y, z coordinate the room (cube 1997), this time it gives 3 characters, each giving 26 possible adjustment values. Duh Growing increment is no longer understood. So before anyone can use them, the letters disappear. I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write down this movie just a lot of bad, inconsistent, or just stupid ideas. The director / writer will have to enjoy some talent.
