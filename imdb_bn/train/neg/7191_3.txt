It was seen in the midnight slam of Montreal's Festival des Mind on Monday night. What a disappointment This movie is definitely rated by IMDB fans. Acting was only but regular. Instructions do not bring something new or interesting. This plot is not enough: the film is the college's grandson and the game they are playing is the amazing call (7eventy 5ive). And above, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like punching and like a slash with an ax that makes you jump once or twice in the whole movie, you can choose it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
