You all know, due to a member of the full Moon crew, Davin Hamilton, GIGSW did not have the way to Blackbasket. One of those who sold devine video chains. He recently published a movie, BLEED, which he sold at BlackBusster at the same time in JigsawSab. He does not take a GIGSW to the BlackBerry customer and doubles the number of BLEED. The result looks like a flow of JIGSAW, and bleed looks like a hit. The main problem with this is that Blud is one of the worst movies, and we all know, jigsabab, good, gold. I am requesting all of you to go to the Blayayet page on the Internet and to defend the GIGSW and all your responses. Similarly, you have to go to the JIGSAW page and have to vote for it (if you have not already). We will have to get a minimum of 8 or 8.5 screenshots and it will be down to about 2 seconds (thus leaving it on 100 bad movie lists on the Internet). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> Hope everyone is doing well, Math -
