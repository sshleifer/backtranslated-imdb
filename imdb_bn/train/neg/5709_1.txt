Nick Cage Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... treasure "keeper", whatever that means) those treasure hunters are descended from a long line. A lot of our ancestors had an idea about the wealth that our founding fathers, most not all frimmasses, decided to hide, because they did not want to fund their finances poorly. <br /> <br /> The first formula turns into a long lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, Financial Yan (San Bienne), the movie Dark Relay (Justin Bartha of Amrit "Jigli") and some inexperienced needy, ship cargo ships. They immediately sprinkle a lot of gun powder throughout the floor, it is not significant in any way. Finally they found the pillar (a skeleton hanging over it) and it became a pipe with writing ... in it. Type, type <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this frozen cargo hold, while the crew just stood around slack-jawed. I mean come back Anyone coming to the strange Arctic should have a little voice in their frustration and can not find interesting things, but they are standing there because Gates has entered into his own world, solving the puzzle. <br /> <br /> The next formula has become the declaration of independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is uncomfortable. Different letters provide gratingly obvious exposition (use it). All this leads to a gun pull over Ian's lack of gates, and a big explosion gunman is going off. (Oh, that's why they sprayed all the guns! Hugh !!) Ian and his pregnant run away and Gates and Movie Dark Reilly travel nine miles to Subzero temperature in an Inuit village to prevent them. <br /> <br /> To stop them, Gates ends after trying the FBI and super archive Abigail Chase (Dean Kruger), Gates and Relay must steal it themselves. The relay then told Gates why they could not steal the announcement because it is protected with metal and laser eyes and high technology protection with blah blah. Gates then told the relay that it had the chance to steal from the reserve. Does the relay know what the reserve house, Gates asks? "Is there a place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; That's the actual line. Bartha is not giving it a joke like it is. So the researches about the relay library Congress and archives and water and soujage, the FarquinoneAtloud, but the conservation room does not know what. Most of this refers to the level of this script. <br /> <br /> To make this brief, Gates actually closes with D, in a ridiculous period - a movie that can only happen. (I hate the way to show computer monitoring technology in movies - complete of impossible and unreal graphics and fonts.) Abigail chase ends tagging for convenience and as an obvious "love interest" angle. At one stage, three of them, in law enforcement, shouted loudly and loudly in their dress shop, <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the sources and gates abduction. , Played by a vague Jon Voight, leads good boys and bad guys home to a huge Indiana Jones fun located under New York City. Curious that the subway builders found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior Leadership Ian off on a wild hanging chair. Ian believes that they are stuck in a cul-de-sac and leave them there. However, when they leave, Relay asks how they are going out. Gates ... <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... Press a button and open a door. No, I'm serious. A button, like they could have a vacuum flash in an office building. The best thing was to know where he was. However, after some more gravel-kitty, they remember this immense treasure house (remember, it is under Manhattan!) All types of historic golden things are full. Riley gets to deliver a really stupid line. Again And FBI officer Harvey Kettle forgave them, arrested Shine Bean, and allowed two chemistry-less Leeds to marry. <br /> <br /> For an audience, I think that all the exhibitions will be difficult to ignore logic, and stereotyped characters for too long. However, in some of its manifestations, excellent history texts are inserted into random conversations. I want more conversations like that in my life.
