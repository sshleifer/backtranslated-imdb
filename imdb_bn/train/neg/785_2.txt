This ridiculous and inactive film must reach the most confusing version of "Hamlet" on the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as obscene; When the soldiers of Fortinbras are suddenly seen in the horizon ("Monty Python and Holi Grill"), when the Ophilia is shown as a straight jacket, the palace is protected only by Francisco, very non-Shakespeare's "AtaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaak" before the assassination), and the lower part of hostage Cagney And a number of star returned to Mary Pikeford's Kate Days <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In an Edwardian setting but at the same time, it decided to employ a curated curriculum, so that the dialogue is strongly converted to Elizabeth's mentality. And there is no idea that it is presented in the context. And Brangha does not concern himself with these textual sublets like Hamlet and Olfiilia's nature, and treats viewers with an obscene nude sex scene in a couple who suppress any ambiguity outside the stashed glass window. <br /> <br /> The intact text allows Brunge to join his favorite cinematic glasses: more footage from Kenneth Branagh It is not clear with the statement that "how can I tell against me clearly" that at the end of the first half of the film in the nineteenth hour (at least it feels like), that with the wind, trying to play with a dramatic crossway, "I will not be hungry anymore. " It can serve the arrogant Brunge, but it does not serve Shakespeare: When I watched this movie in the theater, I kept my partner silent and "a great moment with Mr. Hamlet." BranAg ultimately survives the most fun and worst of the moment, when he cursed Olivier's film and encouraged Claudius's death by hanging him over a high tower on a hallet over a high tower and cursing him with a sword. By running through Claudius's heart with a super-hero bulls eye in the King by throwing a definitely magic rapier across Branagh's Dane legend. The only thing to survive at this moment, which was helplessly away from the narcotics, was that it was very close. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was praised in some quarters as a serious illustration of this accidental picture. Indeed, there is nothing more than a star-studded display of monochromatic filmmakers by his own racism. The emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet does not have to pay anything, but some strange smiles and horrifying scenes of pride of a man.
