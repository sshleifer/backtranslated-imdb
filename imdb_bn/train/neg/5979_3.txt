Pokemon 3 TVs less than three or four episodes of the series, combined with the usual ad. The story is ideal for Pokémon (conflict, war, and a resolution that is ultimately happy), and there is nothing real or unusual in the animation. Without any explanation, some of the plots of the plot are filled (the last stop!) And everything is a bit sweeter. <br /> <br /> Why are you watching this big screen? The only reason is that your child is to be a part of the world. My two boys enjoy Pokémon, and show interest in my preferences, we are closer. Seeing a movie in a theater is different than watching it on the tube, and my boys enjoy the full movie running experience. I gave the movie 4, mostly from my children's point of view. <br /> <br />
