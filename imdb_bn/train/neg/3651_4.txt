I was expecting very funny movies. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes, and many did not work. I do not want to bring Sherlock Holmes and the descendants of Mariani. It was confusing. Instead of resurrected Moriarty, if they were just new to someone, it was more fun. Some things were fun. Bart Kou Kwouk was funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was fun. McGratt was not like McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 in Hawaii. Connie Booth is definitely very good with accent. He plays well in Indiana, but in English and New York. Unfortunately, he was not presenting a lot in the script. I was hoping to have more fun movies. Instead, I got a confusing movie with a poor script. Rather naughty, both booths and cleese were together in this. Perhaps they were about to break in 77.
