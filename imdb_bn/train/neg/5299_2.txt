I really like slash movie, but it's really terrible. Acting long, the script is bad, and the atmosphere does not exist. The plot is as follows: A distorted church church pocket kills people in a small American town. That's right - this plot. Very original, Ah! "The Night and the Charlie" is not enough, if the film is not awesome, at least it should be bloody. Crop this cheaper piece If you want to see some good slasher flicks, check "Madman", "Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Door" or "Humans" - do not waste your time on this worthless time. Garbage pieces.
