Did you understand that you are seeing the same show for eight years, right? I used to understand the initial curiosity of coexistence on the island of strangers, but you feel that after unexpected observation, the heroes of the holes will be able to drive roughly through a bush for about a decade. You are committed to some more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about the legitimacy of the show which is suspicious for the records. It is difficult to suspend unbelief for "Bushy Bill" when the whole crew of producers and cameras lock an air-conditioned make-shift bio-dome with Frosty Mokuchino with Moti. <br /> <br /> appeal here? I do not care about these people or their scary life. I just do not get it. But if you make yourself cruel to the hairy, impure people, then I suggest you turn off your TV and take a trip to your local bus station where you can see such people in their true residence. They can free their people, and say free, you can sit back and resort to their extraordinary ability to recover large amounts of garbage canter cigarette debris, finally hit "pay-mart" and a naive Dr. Frankenstein-style cancer creates cancer -Stick, when everyone is begging people for change for food, it is enough to recommend the sting of "Aqua Velva" in their sky. And the best part? Like Survivor, a member of the tribal "Island" keeps "Island" every week, when they send packing to the local organization unknowingly when the horrified state of full blasted schizophrenia goes to the gear! Now that entertainment!
