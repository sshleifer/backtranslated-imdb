As I did in the author's script, I am going to spend a lot of time for this review. This is easily the best series ever. <br /> <br /> They killed the young Johnson. Mark Blankfield's performance was only miraculously God, so everyone was there !! Physical comedy was compulsory, flat, and expected. The script was written by Monglyd Monkey with the help of the column called Jigi Steinberg and Rocko Urbci. How the producer managed to fade out of my graduation such as stupid cinematic separation. They even led an experienced actor Ray Walton to look like a talent-less buffoon. Director Michael Schultz will be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I am 96 minutes of my life I can spend watching a bright comedy memorizing these moods so I can try and convince everyone involved for this cinematic persecution.
