This is a big budget movie than General Honda (with more explicitly set sets) ?? Although special effects still have different lazes to them (demonic bat and radiant witnesses on display). It also uses an amazing number of American actors: visionary scientist Joseph Cotton seems helpless and weak (however, his character seems to be 204 years old!), The hero of an innocent Richard Jakele Photographer. , As the main villain, we get Caesar Romero and Patricia Medina (originally both campi). I have often said that I grew up watching movies in Italian-English-language movies? But in Japanese, listening to Hollywood actors is totally different! <br /> <br /> LATITUDE ZERO looks like a small version of courageous Jude Verne's courage, and at that stage it is fairly entertaining. Indeed, in this case, due to the subtle coolness of the set-up, it is better than the low-low diversity of Honda's Honda-The-Phage formula. In this plot Romeo is involved in the kidnapping of a famous scientist ?? He wanted to establish himself as the most developed city of coastal hydroelectricity (the world's highest mind-set). We're treating rivalry with a lot of stupid warfare, but the most interesting scenes in Romero Cave must be attacked ?? In fact, Cotton is doing a little bit and men in the rubber cases (through the laser emitted from his gloves!) Must be acting in the male, of course, it will be regarded as the Nadir of his acting career; Customer is the other big, Romero, its material more ?? After all, he was the Joker of Batman TV series and in the 1960s! Cotten has a short-dressed blonde doctor on his team, and is assisted by an intense Asian; On the other hand, Romero is empty on Oriental Family Fate ?? However, he ends up getting a raw contract for his efforts (the girl's brain is finally transferred to the lion and condo hybrids - among the greatest creatures you have ever seen!). Apparently, today's media blaster has set this 2-disk set!
