This is the absolutely dumbest movie I've ever seen. A fantastic cast is a waste of what. That's the game of ignoramus deputies as James Cromwell. I used to go, but obviously anyone who spent more time on this review in the script. It is only about us versus the movie, and how to remove the insulting slowness without reasonable tolerance of humanity. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and I love James Garner.
