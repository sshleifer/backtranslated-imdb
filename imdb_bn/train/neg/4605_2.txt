This movie was written by Charlie Higgs, who made her own show based on this "legendary" fast show and one of the fast show's characters (Tony Car Sales). He also wrote James Bond's book for kids. <br /> <br /> I actually saw Gordon's films that are based on stories of love stories, and each one of them is astonishing. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is completely "contemporary", which means cone camera, quick and weird cutting, cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here, I guess, but it's still timeless and cheap. It often remembers the cameraman, who is vibrating his DV camera in front of the actors / actresses and trying to create stunning steps in the pictures (hopefully some may be tolerant). Welding is good, and there is a complete atmosphere, which is the result of good directions. I think the main character, "zero" young guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". Fat guy is good And the man who looks like Alec beldwin, but not him. But soon after the opening, the film has become somewhat unusual: in this case, I want to mean an endless line in the scene of sorrow and sickness. There are not many humanities in this movie: It is completely neutral, and every person in this movie is hateful and hopeless, or soon dead. There's no fun saying that. It's 1'40 long reversal without any relief at any moment. However, Gordon is still one of the most active filmmakers in my life who is active today, and I think this movie is a test and its failure as a test. Everyone has lost lost experience to learn from time to time and find their way again. This can be Gordon's most discouraged and empty job.
