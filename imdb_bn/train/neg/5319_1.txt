One method for the worst movies of all time: A man escaping from the WHFF has an inconsistent influence (the person who shot that shot, but when he shoots someone else) they are just invisible) and a deer pet takes time. Then you got unlikely characters, a 30-year-old college student, an unexpected end and lots, a lot of effort to hair. To avoid all costs.
