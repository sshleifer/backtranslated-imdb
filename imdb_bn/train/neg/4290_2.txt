I'll give this picture two stars because it is equipped with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it primarily teems with clich√©s and stereotypes: mountainous people are the fake white trash of fantastic religious or ragged racist types, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people, who roam without sound, disappear in the eye, talk to animals and read the mind at a great distance. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that what was the picture (without showing the beautiful pictures of the mountains, the log cabin, wood, an assortment of creatures, freely-climber mountains and strange people in the church) during the entire movie. It was not growing at the time of frustration, nor the story of being a fatherless, nor a struggle about identity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although this image appears to be about the teachings of the Little Tree, we almost do not learn anything about it. A brief summary of his people's history was given (who was brave and intelligent) and a distillery demonstrated; During the timber cutting (in its failure) and whiskey (his literal sense of running) tried his hand; How to read with granny and its dictionary (and perhaps writing) - and it was. Apparently he did not learn much during his time in the boarding school because he had become a tattoo locked. However, the granny and grandma and Graham Greene's character have confirmed that the Little Tree has become a very spiritual person whose main goal is as an adult - later, and I'm imitating here, "horses with Nabazos" and "Some get caught in the war" - Daddy and grandfather and Graham Greene's character is "caught" in heaven (instead, tell girls dating, getting married, kids or others Making fooling of others). <br /> <br /> To the end, but at least I must not say that I'm Dada's business aggressive. Why would everything still be a whiskey? To combat stereotype of "drunk indian"?
