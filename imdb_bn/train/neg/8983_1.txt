Ulises is a literary teacher that comes in a coastal town. There, he will love the most beautiful girl of the city, Martina. They will start a warm romance that ends in the tragic death of Oles in the sea. Some years later, Martina was married to Sierra, who is the richest person in the city and lived a quiet happy life around money. One day, the advent of Wills will work without raising his emotions and thinking about the outcome. The plot is quite curious and some of the actors play a decent part. In addition, three quarters of the movie is sex acts, which are still well-illustrated, quite tedious, we want to see more developments in the story. This is not a bad film with Big Luna Luna, lots of sexuality, no arguments everywhere and fools.
