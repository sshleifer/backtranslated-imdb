At first I pretend this post to say that I am a fan of the original Star Wars movies ... I do not read books, do not play games, do not wear underwear or do not eat cereals (if any) I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to saying this, people have praised this movie so much that I see how I see it. Take this film with yourself, and do not compare it with its terrible predecessors (EP1, 2), I do not understand how you can call it as a great movie. For all the terrible errors in the script - Chess dialogue, transformed scenes (i.e., R2 suddenly a badas, and long CGI acute cheesy scenes with little man touching), deer acting, and significant plot holes ... How's that good? There was no internal hesitation in Anakin; It seems like a switch flipped and he suddenly was all evil. I am not interested in movies for the last 20 minutes or so (with which "Nubuo!" Frankenstein's scene is destroyed). When you critically bombard the screen with wonderful CGI effects and fill the gap with the worst one-liners and it is said that this is not a great movie. A film with such a "bold" tone, was very levity in all character lectures. <br /> <br /> I closed a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, there really was actually a sense of strengthening and seriousness that was going to happen?
