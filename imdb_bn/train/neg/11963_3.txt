I love Billy Crystal, and I think it will be fun to watch this film, because I know that he has praised Alan King and they will be fun together. I thought I saw all the Billy movies but could not remember it, and now I know why. So it's full of clich√©s and terrible emotions; You can smell each scene coming (and going!). Delivering not to be too often funny. She is very busy showing her pain in the worst tears of weeping or how badly her father can be thrown out. Alan King is quite a favorite, as a sub-plot for the extraction of films. But a coincidence that Billy meets his father just like a health crisis, etc., etc. Or the two busy doctors could stop their practice in the moon in LA. And when it's over, boy, it's fast! Almost as the author realized that they held themselves in the corner and the only way was death scene. Good humor is quite frustrating with a few glimmers.
