"Translivia 6-5000" is an incomplete but occasionally funny and charming mid-80's paranoid parody, which has some real names for Cast and some real-time potential scripts. Two Bozo journalists have been sent to a Gossip Tabloid magazine, against their will, to send the story of the return of tragedy to the stranger scientist Frankenstein. The film has some interesting interesting pictures and details on the left and right side, such as a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes, which are used in the breakfast table with cream and sugar. However, the impressive success of the movie is not so successful that it should be and should have been done, which is very much with the disappointment and parody situation. Roger Corman produced "Transylvania Twist", which came after four years later, much fun and much more recommended. This film is particularly parading classic universal milestones in the early 30's, so if you are sure that you want to understand all the small gags and references, then you have seen it. While Frankenstein's character entered his laboratory, there is a nice original package that only acts as a crazy-minded evil scientist. It has been revealed that he is actually more concerned with the situation of the exiled monsters than the Father of the Damien who is the Messiah. Michael Richards, the lazy person acting in the cinemaker of Sinefield, played as a psychological Butler, which appeared in the most inappropriate moments and disappeared. I am convinced that Mr. Tirturo's character was inspired by Richard's role here in "Mr. Deeds".
