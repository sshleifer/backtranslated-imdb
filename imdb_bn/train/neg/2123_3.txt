I go to UCSEB and do some classes with executive producer Allison Anders. He is a fantastic teacher and director so whatever he kept his name, I would have thought quite well. This image seems a good choice as a selection of the Santa Barbara film festival. <br /> <br /> While this movie contained some nice shots and movies, the lack of stories and compatibility really made things out of what they were trying to accomplish. My main problem was that it's someone's first movie and you can certainly tell. Bad acting and an even worse screen this film is off to off the ground. There was some excellent soundtrack music that gives a sense of the main characters that struggles to deal with sadness for leaving him and now he is growing up. I just want to say that due to the lack of story and performance in spite of the goodness of the film, it prevents something good.
