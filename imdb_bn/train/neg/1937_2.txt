I liked this image in the first half or so. It was nice to see the emerging romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mail, and I wanted to see them happen inevitable. However, once Egigrid's maternity home has been switched off, it completely becomes separate. Instead of romance and commonplace, we see some doppies parallel characters that appeared to destroy the film. For the attention of the mother, Fool's fool and fiance of military attachment looked stupid - like an application from an old love boat episode. How can the charm and elegance of the first part of the film go beyond my guilt? This film is a clear attempt by Reno to regain success with the rules of the game, because the movie is very similar after the access to the country's estates (such as other movies) at the same time. I was not a great fan of the rules of the game, but Alanna and her men praised the art and the principles of the original film.
