I like Jane Austen's novel. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility Books and Movies, and I'm getting half way through Mansfield Park. But I could not stand on Emma. I left the book after two chapters and at the end of the film I could not keep less care about Emma. He does not seem to change at all. Perhaps it is Paltro acting (which is awesome at Se7en) or lack of film interest. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Dress was beautiful, but the dance was frustrating compared to the Pride and Prizoodis dance of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehell. <br /> <br /> I basically gave it 2 for knightly. Bloody gorgeous, and although it's rather patchy performance for Ivan McGregor, I like his singing.
