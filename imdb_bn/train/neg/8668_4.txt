I have never read the Bradbury novel that is based on this movie but from what I've collected, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I will do it). My comments will be fully based on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that I had to see it and was very excited, but when I was finally finished, I was very frustrated. That is why the film was so amateur. The actor played well (though Roberts and Price both are good actors - just not here). Children actors, it seems, have been asked to show only, in character dresses, tell lines and create faces. The set and the props were cheap and unreal. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was very scared to surprise him that I had to go online and check who did, see the kind of work he has done. The edit was cut and pasted and the plot (screenplay) was exactly the same (though the author was involved with himself, the quiz?). Tension, fear, and mystery building were so light that it was never uncertain when finally finally came. <br /> <br /> I read some comments from this movie and it is difficult for people to really believe. Most of the pain is what content is interesting and fun and stimulating. It was so likely. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it shunned the story's brilliance.
