What is usually an actor's first film can miss - this is often the first thing where everyone involved is really showing the lack of film experience, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than the fact that even 1982's value is so bad, it is fierce. Pictured entirely in a small budget in the Chicago area, the entire cast performance is quite tough, wood and cartoon - a cross between high school and poor community theater. The nearby traffic word often sings the dialog, and the dialogue is declared as compulsory and convenient rather than bad, natural and biological. The scenes are narrow and sticky, and although the characters go on for years, even children and adults are not even in the age. <br /> <br /> I believe that it is possible to create a Christian film that is a big, secular audience, but often the creator of such films becomes so focused on 'messages' or in this case, the project has its own autobiographical relationships that produce good movies Separates prices. (I'm sure that it has no majority that the main character's producer / director / editor and the same name as the cast member.) Thankfully, Michael Maderson is much more interesting and credible - see his next movie. Careers like him are certainly not built in such movies.
