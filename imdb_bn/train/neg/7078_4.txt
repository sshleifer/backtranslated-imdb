This movie can be an appropriate B-movie if giving so much attention to the 3/4 sex scene of the film. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure there is a lot more out of sexual harassment than sexual intercourse. Michael did a good job considering what happened to Barbas, which was not much. At one stage or another, one must laugh at him, because his character was so cruel. Nastassa Kinski played her role as a sexual therapist, she could do more and I would not recommend her sexual relationship. In her strong role as a boyfriend and a related wife, Rosanna Arquette stood the most for me in this movie. There is something about the strong appeal about beautiful inside and out. He played the role and you saw the movie, you started to feel bad. <br /> <br /> "A diary of misconduct" Although the Oscars are not a modern classical of standards or standards, it is quite informative and how a person can take personal giants and how you feel about how you destroy many things in life. Does a fair job.
