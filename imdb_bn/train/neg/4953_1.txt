I have never commented on IMDB before, but I think I must stay after watching Batman Animation. Her ultimate garbage! Warner Bros. 90th was a perfect animated series of Batman so what are they trying to get involved in formula? I think to write a complaint letter to the WB. The original animation was dark and bruding, the way Batman had the right way. WB had this mess up with some of the future Tripe Batman. Now they produce this drivel. Joker is not similar to Joker from remote DC comics. DC should be sued. I request those who agree to write or write to WB and use the power of the people to get back the original formula
