"Cavemen" exceed my expectations, and not in a better way. It even wanted to be even worse than it was. Basically, here's the show: Cavimans are an alternative nation, they face bias, etc. Perhaps the idea of ​​a fool is probably made; Almost being able to fit the jail time for authors. In one event, a caveman was taken to a club, the girls were selected to choose, and then nothing else happened. This 22-minute Andy Rooney was memorable to hear the conversation, then died by a stack knife through midget cannabal. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of the dialog: "You are sure that you are right as soon as you go out with a cavalier." "Yes, it's okay. I liked 10 thousand!" Sunny ... Probably the best text I have ever seen is <br /> <br /> <br /> 22 minute horror makeup cave, tackling difficult social problems ... like an entertainment night. I also think the recent ideas are so bad that they resorted to creating a siticom outside car insurance advertising. I'm surprised if they can live longer, so that I've ever seen a new title for the worst show. I would say that even worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laghlin" was knocked out of something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a comet somewhere in the world. <br /> <br /> Sincerely incredible ...)
