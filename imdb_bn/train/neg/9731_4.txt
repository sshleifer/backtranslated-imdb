Others have already commented on the "fall" of the manager Tob Hooper, but what about Brad Dowryf? He was perfectly capable of choosing the best projects (he proved in acting the same year "Exxist III"), then why did he agree to publish it? Sure, he plays a suitable demented, and the film is not completely bad; It's just uninvolving, uninteresting and unappealing. The three "un-" too much. (* 1/2)
