Remember, Harrison Ford is Hollywood's biggest star because he made a great movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the overwhelming majority of suboptotals can not face the weakening of the central story. <br /> <br /> At least Ford is enjoying himself more than his last few projects and he can carry most of the time. Heartnate is adequate, but Chemoth and Redford are not related to chemistry like New York and Redford. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Hollywood Homeside" is a reasonably diverse change, but only. Take Ford out, and this is not the case too.
