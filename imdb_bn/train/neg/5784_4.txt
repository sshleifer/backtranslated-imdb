I was not nearly smitten with this as some other critic. Sure, it's a pair of lovely girls playing lover, lesbian vampire. Marion Morris and Anulka D. As well as driving the street roads with razor teeth, they play two lovely sirens, roam in their homes (in the evening) and their prey ... call us hungry men. What happened there ... well, they kiss each other and kiss each other, they kill their viewers. Director José Ramón Larrez has some flares of brightness with his camera. Some scenes are quite brutal and effectively shot, but single films are not kept up to a film (intended to punish ... at least consciously). There really is not a lot of stories here. We have two daughters. We showed some unreasonable and unknown starters, where we shot them with their pistol. Why? What does it mean that "we have such people that awakened a man in the hotel for a long time to force him to do so many years ago? Does he have any purpose? Of course, I have a more general question as a couple of beautiful village girls working as vampires in the English countryside. There is a wine cellar made from wine and carpathians? However, the script is inundated with such flaws It is a very annoying form of hunting, alcohol, and food, they are (quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. The end is going on with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climate. I said, some effective scenes by the director ... I especially liked the clothes of the girls and painted a wooden picture in search of their prey. The room is also the most impressive set and I say both girls very nice Bo. Especially Marion Morris, on the one hand has a lot more. The old film fans, the silent screen in a brief cameo of an older u love is the end of the film.
