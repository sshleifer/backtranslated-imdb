A barbarian scientist is decapitated girlfriend so she brought life back to her head. Truly this movie plot He tried to find another body, he searched through the suburban area of ​​that perfect body. For some reason he has the ugly looking giant in his closet in a closet. The movie's sleaze style is ridiculous. None in the movie can actually work with the head. The closet giant is a man with a mask tie and you can really say. The plot is slow, weaker and the last is done so badly. See the mystery of this step science theater version 3000. Believe me, I will not see this movie on my own.
