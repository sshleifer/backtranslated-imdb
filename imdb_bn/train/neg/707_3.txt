"All the celebration festivals?" Where ...? When ... <br /> <br /> What was the story of all monks and theme events? <br /> <br /> An unusual title! There is nothing in the story that has a remote connection with "all the saints festival". There is nothing in the story about "All Souls" which is mentioned in the word. Why do not you get annoyed using this title if you do not want to include any story or theme about "All Souls Day" or "All Children's Festivals"? <br /> <br /> shamefully bad script and amateur writing <br /> <br /> <br /> How did they attract such a great talent in this disguise? The article is so ametic that letters give big lectures about their life history for the audience, telling each other their whole life. People do not have all the ways to talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What the director is thinking <br /> <br /> The direction is similar! Compulsory and overly deliberate style seems amateurish. In one scene, a character is shouting "take away my hand from me" and no one is touching him! But the worst-directed scene, incredibly top battle scenes at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> A highly abusive, crippled battle scene is more intense <br /> <br /> Most fake war scenes have many dead people. It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit !! You can see their cues can wait an extra for a walk across the camera. Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys - each little gasp and twitch exaggerating. The quantity of blood samples of war criminals has been applied too much and negatively, as if some people use a ketchup dispenser and reddish reddish squirted clothes. <br /> <br /> This whole war scene is really a sugar fight movie. You almost hope that a horse like Will Farel and Mike Mayer travel around and pay a fifth. <br /> <br /> Who would actually use this path in this life? <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> terribly distorted, and literally form his wound lesion of blood. Even a complete fool would know that he died! Yet he - very neutral - on and over "Daddy, dad ..." while watching someone overwhelming. As much as he gave credibility and passion, so you can expect from a non-actor child who repeats the line all day for the camera. <br /> <br /> Even the poor child has no acting skills, the scene is completely incredible. A few hours after the murder of a little girl did not even exist in the middle of the battlefield - when hundreds of corpses were surrounded, she stood quietly! The child of the natural intellect shouted and feared, the bloody killing was going on! <br /> <br /> Will we be so frustrated or laugh? <br /> <br /> <br /> A huge hook through his face and cheeks. She looks like a hook a fish! Curiously funny story, the whole scene covers as fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> Fantasie La-La-Land, mother and girls are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another interesting story, you see a central character - the mother of the little girl - in the end of the scene and in the next scene, which happens 20+ years later, she looks exactly the same! He is still young and beautiful, and now is the same age as his daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost closed the movie because the direction and the writing were horrible - but I wanted to see Louisiana settings and I wanted to like all the actors because I tried to stop it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Out of the place with the voice. It's an unknown way to start a movie, for the rest of the time, romance novels seem to be targeted to women. Strange contradiction tone!
