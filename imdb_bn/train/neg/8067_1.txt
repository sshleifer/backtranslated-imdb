First off, say that this annoying movie will be at the top of my list. Nothing, and I mean this movie is nothing but thrilling excited. It's mostly confusing and it's going to progress as you would just end up! Some people want a movie that "thinks" of their whole thing, which I say ... "more power to you" !! I just want to entertain the other side. That's what this stinker brings me back to, entertainment is not it. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that most agree here. Most of it did not give any idea, and when you feel that you have a view, another lam scene is visible and ... well looks where you are going. Avoid, this one sucks .... bad !!
