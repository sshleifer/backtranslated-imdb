Tony Scott was not a very good director, but every film made after "Crimson Tide" seems to be taking him one step ahead of the worst job today (Michael Bay may fall in the same category, but at least his big, fool, confusing Some primarily opposite-level entertainment). And other exaggerated Hollywood biopics (such as "D-Lovely" and "accepting a dangerous mind" for example) detailing the "mystery" behind-the-scenes scene by the society, churning the life of excessive, or perfect shallow ciphers, "Domino" is a Films that begin with a little probability and the dashes are the smallest amount before the 60-minute mark. With the current running time of 128 minutes, the film seems twice as tall, and with time spent with characters, this unexpectedly simple and forgotten (in contrast to the superior "attraction rules"), Scott's attempt to reconcile with rebellion through the smith of Domini, Conscious-Rich Girl-Voices-Only Claudius Claude's Attraction Only the macrocytes may find joyful). The story The worm-up-crust-child learns more exciting trade in Damini Harvey (Kare Knightley, the performance of ersatz-badass as shallow as the superb face) and the shallow lifestyle of Los Angeles, and accosts gruff monsters hunter Mickey Rourke and Adger Ramirez; Alongside, double cross, shootout, media focus (tongue-in-the-goal courtesy of Christopher Walken, in his trademark sledge phone), and romance has ridiculous signs. Scott spent together for more than a few seconds, the film crashed the resolution to see the Neon-Drunken nightmare, which is really unexpected to see - if Scott was given the chance to frame a photo, it would be ghost, or some kind of distorted; But these strong stylistic overloads provoke the small plot, characterization and the mystery of the film (for that, eh, nothing is said for the "entertainment" value). Most of the letters come as both abusive or stereotypical, both (intolerable, in a few minutes segment where African Americans introduce a new list of "Jerry Spring" classical classifications) and I wish for myself everybody's end to end our hero's "tail". The word "domino" readily, the ineffective trash - any interest in this individual sketch was expected to inspire its audience, in a few minutes it was lost in the sea of ​​Migraine-Eduing Neon Prestenes.
