All possible ways to detect the bodies of a small girl are found stripped. When it is discovered that one leg is more than the other, it is considered to be the body of a missing female body. After this panic, the couple separated and made maternal addiction and created a sad situation. All these changes when one day, many years later, he gets a phone call from his daughter! With the help of a former police and a reporter, he started his journey to determine whether he really was alive. "Los Sina Number" is a mess-based plot, a flame is slow, and completely unscary. Savings pity is Emma Villarsaw, who did outstanding work as a mother of despair. The best part of the movie is over, but I'm not sure the rest of the film is worth the money. Beware of English subtitles in the latest R1 release - they are not quite right.
