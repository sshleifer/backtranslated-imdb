In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan again loves many little girls. She meets her at her restaurant. Little girl, nevertheless, flirt with him. He did not know what to do and asked him. Her invitation was rather strange to her reaction. It was supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And that annoys me about this whole movie. It was not that funny. Jokes and scripts were terrible! I liked the only joke about the waiter's teeth, but several times later, which started. <br /> <br /> Amitabh's little girlfriend is said to be sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with a little girl! It was awesome! I know that one can be associated with a child, but this man has an adult conversation with this child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He should give Amitabh a tough time, but we all recognize Parsh, he can not do it. So even the last conversation, when they sit around the table, even it seems funny. <br /> <br /> I'm just a fan of movies who are really funny. I do not think I will see this movie again.
