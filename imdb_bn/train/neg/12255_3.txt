... which is not exactly a ringing approval. Overall, "Dino Croke" was a good movie. Of course, Matt Barlangie played a full bag of bags in that movie, who was crying for the whole movie to eat and drink by Dino Crock of his younger brother. But the special effects of "Dino Croke" were good, the plot line was good and the performance was even better. Here is the "blood surf" problem - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a baby model with a dispersed jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co Shipwrecked on a secluded island, in which they face a rabid group of ugly Filipino nationals who try to force themselves to group women. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes. And 3) There is not enough time to cross. "Blood surf" has some of its worth of qualities - actresses are quite attractive and at the end of the film, eat them by Matt Barlangee Croke. But if you are in your death sentence and have enough time to watch only a Matt Borlenghi / killer crocodile movie, then exclude it and instead of "Deno Krok" fire.
