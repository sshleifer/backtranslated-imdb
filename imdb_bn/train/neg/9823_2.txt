This movie has an interesting discussion. Is a moral person good enough, or do you need anything more? The film promotes that, apart from God's guidance, being a morally good person is not enough. At the beginning of the film there is a line, "You and I can look at a person morally good, but both know that he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> I'm not a Christian, discussions on this topic were interesting, but not for movie purposes. I have kept the movie with a strong feeling that it is morally good enough *. The presented arguments and discussions were very favorable, so that they crushed themselves with the weight of their ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when the mind of ignorant and illiterate mind. George Carlin's character in Dougma said: "If they are young hook hooks" <br /> <br /> The main foundation is very interesting. In the 1890s, a Bible scientist is trying to publish a book that says morality is justified without God, as long as morality is meaningful. Do not you just ask a child to steal? Or do not you ask him to steal because God does not tell you? (It's not annoying to tell the child to steal, because if he stole his stone if he feels stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants to recommend his school books (spreading the world) to help. However, it requires unanimous consent, and one scholar opposes it. He outlined the very first of the debates about the morality of morality versus logic of God's word for the sake of morality, through a very interesting discussion. To prove his point, he has to make a time machine (to make a plot entirely, which I did well), and to send Carlisle in the year 2002, where learning ethics will lead us without God. <BR> <br /> It should be clear, she has opinions and she changes by what she sees and turns her back on her return (because she comes back, this is not really a mockery, it's a bible movie after all) <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>> Not necessarily in this movie, it creates two "bad guys" who want to try to find Carlisle, even if he did not hurt, committed crime, or did anything. What is wrong with this film of Karliscill's view, showing the view of this "sinful world" and bringing him back with a new perspective? Also, some points of the movie that make me sure that I'm happy, I'm not a Christian, or at least someone says "this is god or nothing". At the end of the movie, three people bored me. First, when two "bad boys" just went to Karlisel's right place, Karlissale did * only * doing a really horrible act. He is awake like his time-jumping coming Jesus, and it makes so "bad guys" (those Christians btw, odd enough), they just remember to miss the rapture Second, after returning to Carlisle, he found a boy in which he started the film not to steal (but does not mention God, ran away with a baby), and told him that the time of theft was wrong Because God commanded it. Like the above Curlin quote, Fear among the children's religion is a mistake in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally, fairytale. Another awesome technique Carlisle asks the inventor how far they can go, and he said that he does not know. The theorem he tried to force the Bible in the distant future (starting at 2100) and it failed. He kept reducing 10 years, and again Tries, and fades out, he is like 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carlis has mentioned that he seems to be coming to the end of the world, because the earth was involved with sin and God's name was reduced. The tactics have become frightened for thousands of years. You will think about this in the light of time, the church will be enlightened. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this movie. Although I was pretty sure that it was enough before being morally good, now I know it for a fact. If you're not a Christian, it's valuable to watch, to make sure you're as senseless as people in this movie.
