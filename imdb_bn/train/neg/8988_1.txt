Until now, the worst movie I ever seen was Ben and Arthur. You really should examine reviews for this movie instead of this one. The review statistics of this movie have made it more positive for some people involved in creating this, by relentless and dishonorable pushing, it is fairly easy to publish the evidence online. At least those who created Ben and Arthur were very respected to stand on their own cone, rather instead of pretending to be steadfast, suckers like me would buy it. <br /> <br /> Everything goes horribly about scripts, scripts, stories, casting, acting, directions, photography, editing, music ... and in any movie? Whatever it is, it gets worse as it gets here It would be ridiculous if it is not so unpleasant. I was discovered that I was still not convinced of the positive reviews for it because it is watching observers seem to get it even better. <br /> <br /> It does not take much money to make a great movie, or less budget means a movie will be bad. My favorite example of mastering the sewing-budget is the amazing garland of Gass Van Sant, but there are many more. Sideline Secrets ?? Director's Cut or Original ?? Not bad because those who made it did not have any money, but without surrendering there was not a huge amount of ego and no talent.
