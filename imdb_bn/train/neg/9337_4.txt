From giving caffeine kick, you can expect from a movie that shares its name with the increase in the strength of warm drinks, about coffee clunks and not just a ropeway revenge story. Indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee then it would be rather weak and littered with water, some undesirable dregs and lack of a lingering examination. Sporadically hit it spot, but otherwise hope it will not be the hot action drama. <br /> <br /> Plot wise, a nurse who is taking a law in her own hands and punishing the drug by harsh justice, lady-pimple ', hooked-suckers who hooked her younger sister, hooked the sick state. The socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youth in America is prominent in coffee, and it acts as a worrying element of coffee crusade against political corruption and racialism of white establishment, which makes profits, and Afro-American minorities Sadly, timely messages have been reduced by poor quality of film and lack of focus. Coffee ideas are important, it is just that they are not well targeted. <br /> <br /> One of the coffee bean points is the presence of Blaxploitation icon Palm Grey. Plays his role with the gear guru and produces the heroine of an interesting action, because of his strange violence (with him working with the whole house of the Hood, drive the car through the front door)! . It is a shame that the incident becomes available, while the time is wasting sexual exploitation as much as possible. It can not be helped in a low budget, but it is not just blacksmithing flicks, there is a pure lack of coffee. Just as problems decrease due to lack of standard quality, ultimately entertainment and excitement are skewered in the entertainment and distraction moments. <br /> <br /> Total results are operational and wooden. We get a hip heroine but a hip movie. Coffy has her moments as it should be regarded as an original film in a shame and Blaxploitation crazy; It just does not ascends upwards above the mean, warm numbers.
