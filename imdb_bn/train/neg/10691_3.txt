I do not rent this or argue with me. I'm always scared of hiring something I never heard of (remember not to be in the theater). Great cast ... that's what scale tipped. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes to look fun, but incredible. It only gets worse afterwards. If they want to make their movies even better in future projects, then the authors of this movie can do a little research. Or they might just try to write something a little believable. I agree to give it a 3. .... because writing is a 1 (only because the word is) and a 2 is able to get so many good actors, despite having to read the script of this movie. Oh my God sucks this movie.
