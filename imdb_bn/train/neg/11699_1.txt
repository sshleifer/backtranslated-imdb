Thana's plot is thin thin. And total. Drive on a fat lawyer Gypsy woman, and gypsy damn to lose her and lose weight ... from the bone. OK, the Gypsy discipline should be entertaining, but the weight loss has gone bad? No Stephen King thinks so apart. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and screenwriter in this horror film did the same. The lawyer is not just criminally irresponsible, he is also lean, huh! Thinner has broken into an unexpected piece for a person who has not seen anything worse than lean. Hey, I can just say: Well, look at the mirror.
