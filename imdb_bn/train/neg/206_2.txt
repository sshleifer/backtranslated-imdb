I gave this picture 2 stars because Dominic Monghan actually tried his efforts through his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything related to this movie was executed very badly. The director should not think again about what to do for his career, but he might have to watch some movies. Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, putting him in a movie of this merit makes him terrible. Anyone "actor" that was playing Jack's best friend should not stepped in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small film, but perhaps the characters and their surroundings should have a little more time and effort. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as I've done) you'll be very disappointed.
