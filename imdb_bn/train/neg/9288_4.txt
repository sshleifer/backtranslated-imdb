Half-Paste Dead, the main role Steven Seagal played was a major B-hit. Half Paste Dead 2 is a direct-to-video seagull, an action movie without losing any action but has no power to get anything. It is less entertaining than the first: In all aspects. But it's a look though worthy. If you want to watch action movies or just something during a pop up session; If you want to watch the previous WWE stars on the screen or even if you prefer to see the signals, even if you do not even want to see it. <br /> <br /> Kurup has done well, Bill Golberg was less than the average. I think he does not work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I'm telling you. The rest did the job, but nothing was amazing, there was not much that was far from the right. <br /> <br /> Technical description, well, a Sony made production can not be very good. Cinematography was a disaster but the overall direction was acceptable. Whatever you want, just watch it. If you see, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you do not lose.
