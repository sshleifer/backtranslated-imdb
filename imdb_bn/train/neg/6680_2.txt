Wow, what a snoozer Definately one of Bacon's worst films. Bad acting combined with a formulatory, if not unbelievable, scripts me spending time I lost watching this on cable television. I can not tell about it that a basketball scout is very much attached to its employer, who is involved with a tribe that happens at the end of the war, which is determined by a basketball game. Grade: F +
