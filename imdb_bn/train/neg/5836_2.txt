This confusing story comes from the political conspiracy and murder of Richard Condon's pen (Manchurian candidate 1962). In the story, almost comic books are difficult to swallow in fashion. All-star cast is considered to be completely cast and not fault in the poor efforts: the novel was completed in the same short time. It seems that the story is actually mocking the more sincere efforts of "Manchurian Candidate". All accounts are a disappointment.
