This film is absolutely awesome. One of the worst movies I've ever seen is one. The story does not exist almost, the characters are full of stereotypes and special-FX only make you smile. The only outstanding thing about this movie is guest appearance of Rapper Kulio as a guest officer. <br /> <br /> If this picture is considered as a comedy then I did not get the full point. If you want to watch this movie, please drill yourself first and then prepare for some good smile ... especially when the first Special-FX screen is on. <br /> <br /> But if you prefer a trash movie, this movie must be seen for you.
