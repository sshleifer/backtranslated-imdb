Poor tub hooper. He directed an ever-awful classic "Texas Chaimsaw genocide". Then what he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and that's saying a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dowryf) whose things (and people) can fire ... or something like that. Very rarely is the original idea (Anyone remembering "the firestorm arter"?) It is a real mess ... literally everything is made wrong! Pathetic acting (even darf!), Asyn script, production prices, alluring special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! One must miss ... even better for laughs.
