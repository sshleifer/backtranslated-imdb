This movie is slow and there is no plot. It carries the life of a group of shipbuilders. Sincere in his efforts to get a job among the elderly. There may be some social commentary here, but it is not drawn to the very annoying light because it is not painted in a sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why it looked at 7.8. I saw the whole tedious thing and made the prospect to pay huge compensation. No luck IMDb ratings have always had such a good match for my taste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My wife said, Javier Borme does not like this movie. He does not mean my type, so my contract does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give it 1.
