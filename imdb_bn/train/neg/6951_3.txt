When you order a steak it does not just hate but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> I feel like this so-called "Butter galactica". The arguments can be made on its quality, but the reality is not that the fans are ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you sit in that rude restaurant, I imagine. You are waiting for their return years, which you love them in the famous New York Strip Steak. When your food comes, you find that they apply the name "New York Strip" to a chicken dish. You complain but the waiter simply says "But G Cheeken, really really good"! Are you really careful if chicken is good? You Wanted to Strip New York - A Steak! The waiter then explains, "You wanted to cheer, Jae Zir, J as you zay, zomezing NEW. We felt that G. Czechen would be more popular because we named it our previous delicious country". In the future, ask whether you will find the original New York Strip in the menu, but you have been told that the restaurant is now a menu called "New York Strip", so you will never see the New York Strip - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main show! * <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the responsible production team of this new edition is abusive and humiliating for the original. The team responsible for the revival of the BG wanted to love the real series - If you want to improve what they liked, then do not try to sell the new series by exploiting the name of the Blaster Galactic. <br /> <br /> If Saifi wanted the channel to give us a new show, then not so! Give it a new name! Do not use the name that we remember in an effort to attract visitors. This effectively gives us the opportunity to see a real match in the future. <br /> <br /> We are waiting 25 years to see what we knew as Bijji because we loved something original! We simply did not ask for NAME and the remainder of the basic concepts. We really liked something for the original series! <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that the original seratam component was omitted. Sure, the original BG was incomplete and could use some updates. This mini series, however, did not improve any relations, but special effects (which were good but not unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many visitors will debate about quality in this regard. New ceremony but we will not forgive Saif and Ron Moore for the destruction of our dreams. <br /> <br /> It is said ... I will comment on the talent of this new mini (not the original): <br /> <br /> The best part of the war section was. The effort clearly makes the effects more "real" and less "see the effect at the woof." I say this sequence was not exemplified by today's standards, they are keeping up with the original movie-for-cables. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some opinions try to fake the effect of a "real" camera with false tracking and zerky zoom. However, these cameras did not seem to have any visible SOURCE. The extraordinarily more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only example I saw such as "live cam" when we were talking about taking action from the security cam. <br /> <br /> Script, you ask? The script was written by a teenager for other teens. Character felt cardboard and stereotypical. In fact, the whole story felt oppressed together from other well-known stereootypes. The only good feature of the whole story was that some of the elements that were preserved from the original series. It is obviously "stupid" to digest your average TV audience. <br /> <br /> The contact with people was kind. Dramas based on fine looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was so exaggerated to the point that it was so exaggerated that they lost all the ability to move any refreshed visitors. That was clear in any interaction between Adam and Son. Attempted to ensure that the director does not pay attention, but the frequent and helpless audience will not miss it. Sorry, but the real people do not carry out continuously. <br /> <br /> I was not standing this BAD show myself. Nothing great; It will not be honored by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it will be watchable by the public. Although I could personally live without it. I simply saw how it actually captured the true attitude. <br /> <br /> This mini series will be remembered as a symbol of how much the story quality has been moved to appeal to large numbers. In the opposition to the true market of Science Physicians, its requirements on the CGF channel have become "ruthless" to supply to the public. The time we wanted for Steak would be and despite our complaints, they insisted on giving us chicken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I left you with just one thought <br /> <br /> <br /> No <br /> <br />
