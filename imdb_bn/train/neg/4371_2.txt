After leaving TV's popular "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knots made a bold effort with the help of filmmaker Starodom's mother tongue-comedy comedy cars. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", cheap (most notably in most of the Notes movies) is portrayed in the film, much worse than others. Don plays a small town snake who was taken to the cosmonaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for the trip - they want him as their new friend! Some would say that weaker satirical technology relies on the immediate fever of Americans in the new era, but blurred is just a fictitious excuse for capturing kids. It goes on a good start, with the set up and nostalgic positions, but it became increasingly more idle and stupid. * ****
