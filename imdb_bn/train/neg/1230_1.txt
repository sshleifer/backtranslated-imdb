This stupid story of this story (and therefore bad movie) can not be described! Basing, Dell Toro ... What do you think ?? So a stool and its parking space are completely full. The bising character bought a cup of tea and some packaging papers. <br /> <br /> When he comes out, the whole place is so empty, some people shot around two guns? Although he lives there, when he moves away from the bad, he is the most remote and instead transferred to a nearby police station or at least one crowded place ?? Come on !!! I will not even go to the infamous red toolbox, since other people did it earlier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
