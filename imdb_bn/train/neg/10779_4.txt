I found this film a perfect dissapointment. The director - especially Stanley Tookie, Chris Walken, Han Azarier and Allan Orkin (not even mentioning four main leads) - Genuine talent - an unbroken, middle-class story has been completely destroyed, whose conclusion can not be taken care of once, terrible, Stereo type characters are introduced. Julia Roberts is weak, Jeta-Jones is easily boring (visible to high reclamation, re-establishing her role, apart from humor), Crystal walks with her old hypo-active, neurotic, boring change-arrogance and cusack her part. , Apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> <br />, which is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance among central characters, alone chemistry and comedy- (possible speakers), the only moment of gentle laughing with Kasak's role in the grosses point and with Allan Orkin Her relationship came behind - the script writer is obviously unable to show any fundamentals. (Spoilers) Aziariya was reasonably fun like Mexican boyfriend and Waken has fun as a parody of the archery-maverick-type type director - but these parts form a very small screen time, and instead (spellars) treat with our Billy Crystal His dog is being sniffed by a dog. Pure genius <br /> <br /> For the large fan of the people of John Kasak, not to mention the rest of the superb cast, I was completely left entirely with a movie with good sense and at the same time used the old series clips and even often 'consume' Out, Tiny-Movie 'to reduce yourself to the depth of laughter, explore or expand any of them They are reluctant to do so. <br /> <br /> Very poor 4/10.
