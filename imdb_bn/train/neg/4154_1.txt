Vampires Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Girl short skirt geophone speaker. Also in the box: Alert: A plot - only authors and directors can understand the end or other of this movie. <br /> <br /> Although seriously I like the bad movie. I love vampire I love hair To hell, I even enjoy lesbians. This film is a three-dimensional and confusing (or unincorporated) plot, terrible (I really sound) conversation, and random stuff and nothing to do anything (or they ... I do not know what is happening in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the green otmele 'flame' in harmful gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not cover their hair's oatmeals and paint). By any means, the result was this BAD movie, if you can even call it. <br /> <br /> Did not you understand the last word? Was the vampire really nurse and the other girl was really emotional patient? Where was the vampire vs. Zombie? Hell, where the vampire was all ... you could not really call the vampire of the girls. Anyway. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or buy this movie. If you're really interested ... okay, I can understand. Seriously, even the BAD film lovers can not support it. It should be 100 numbers below 1.
