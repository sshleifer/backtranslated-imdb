Do not really judge this blues. It starts poorly with Violet Probe and Blind Willie McClell's pictures (or is it Blumen Lemmon Jefferson? Which is blind in any way) apparently from outer space? (?) And describes the lives of our various blues musicians. As it is Corny, this documentary can be visually the most interesting part. Then the only thing that can be seen is that the performers face extraordinary classic tunes, Beck and Shemekya coopland's choices, with the likes of Fake 20s black and white interacted, later raping the same songs. This is a great device that can show us why old blues was really great, but it does not make it look attractive. There is nothing here that makes it a movie and not playing a radio. Someone should be forced to see this bad revision. Shame it for Wenders, Scorsese and especially Blues. To avoid all costs.
