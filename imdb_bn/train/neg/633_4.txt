Good Earth Life is a slave girl and China follows a poor farmer. The movie is Pearl S. Based on the novel of Buck. The story is great, but I hate that they decided to throw Angolos in leadership roles. Walter Connley is ridiculous as a farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, as most of the main actors, I could not endure listening to his words. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Hollywood could not cast their ethnic beliefs past. Lead role African-Americans keep shoes polished to take England as they look like Chinese and play them as Anglo-Angles.
