If Tod's sheets come out and admit that this film was intended for explosion in the zombie style, then I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie where each scene, line and even every actor was designed as a parody of the dawn. I could probably figure out the alphabet soup, restart the rest of the character, and still have a good script. Especially when I think of this movie comes to mind two scenes. Spoiler alert! One while walking to Mike's parents and other parents, I walk down a stairs jam packed with zombies. Even though it brush against a small staircase and even flailing insomnia, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the pre-maritime moves around, saying, "God you are horny blurred", and only a shoot. Another military is complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around it for about forty seconds, when it is surrounded by zombies in an arm's length. He was then almost impossible to run out of the crowd and join other people. Speaker alert! This view will be believed. Still, I enjoy this movie almost as a comedy because it is very funny. To get so many people in his film and to buy it, he bought the toad sheets for the drive but not for anything else.
