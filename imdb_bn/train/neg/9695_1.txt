Warning! Do not even consider seeing this photo in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this broken piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers apparently have no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human. If you are looking for a fun movie - look somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Hope this is Mr. A slow / painful death never dies and the film never creates a movie, "The Junior" (a good indication of his apparent inexperience and intellectual childhood). <br /> <br /> In fact, writing about this shit has also been lost, so that's why I will stop and watch a good movie. .
