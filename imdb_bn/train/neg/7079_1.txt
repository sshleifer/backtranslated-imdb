There is no reason to bother to rent this flick. From the beginning credit, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was portrayed as a soft porn movie, but there really is no girlfriend about it. The appearance of sexual oppression is stimulating, but only at one point. <br /> <br /> The annoying sex scene, bad plot, and Ed Begolly Junior and Roman Arkack are not enough to save this movie. .
