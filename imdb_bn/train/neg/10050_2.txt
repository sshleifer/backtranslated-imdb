A great disappointment with writer Hamm and director Dante. Prior to the first season "Homemaking" the collaboration was the best and the most ridiculous. This poor management of a playful generation left me stupid. The supposed "payoff" showing generic alien showing some extract from infectious psychosis is totally dissatisfied and nothing is explained. If the point of the story was "clear" out of the human missile plan, why did they go to such unhappy tragedy and rogue fashion? Why is not just a whole deadly virus shameless La Stephen King's "standing" male population being instead of meat men? I keep watching as the episode will keep expected but it just got more pretentious and taunting. The religious theorem seems to be compulsory, but it was clear that Sam Ham thought that the amount of weight he gave was deep. I like many works of Dante and Humayous but it was just unwanted.
