The 'Blue Desert' is likely to be half-passenger and the main character of the potential thriller, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. While being attacked on another street in New York, comic book artist Roberts moved to a small town in the west. On his first days, he dubbed the crazy Randall Atkins (who plays this part well with Craig Schaffer), who will not eventually go near him. Already twice before being in the situation, she is afraid of her safety, she suspects the nude city police, Steve Smith (DB Swine, whose character does not appear to be quite believable, reducing friendship and relationship with her, believe the red deer beliefs). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because he told him that Atkins is a former cons of sexual abuse and sexual abuse. However, there is a lack of evidence that he had before handing him up to the police. <br /> <br /> The movie had enough reason to create at least one interesting movie because soon there is confusion that Roberts should believe. However, many of the motivated mysteries are shown forcibly because Roberts's character seems to not respond to ordinary things since we think any reasonable person may think. And its delayed responses allow for many mysteries that can happen easily and abnormally, especially in the end. Perhaps Swini was the wrong choice for this role; The baby was so confused that Kevin Anderson's personality was described as 'sleeping with the enemies' in his character. Or, if Lisa Roberts is written as a strong character, it can be good enough as well. In the meantime, the film is not the best, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
