His screenplay as Christopher Lambert Gridon is boring and frustrating. This film was probably the classic Tom Hans of Forrest Gump, or Rain Man's Dustin Hoffman and Sam Donson as Sam Penn, I played in AM Sam. <br /> <br /> The meaning of our story is very bad because of the lines, Charlton Haston, Carroll O'Connor, Sheryl Jones, Mike Connors and Shell Winters's supporter's performance were extraordinary. 3 of 10
