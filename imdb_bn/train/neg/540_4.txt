All for Love (as a title during the weekend it's broadcast) is a romantic drama by Captain St Ives, a French officer from Napoleon's army who was captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he met and fell in love. A young girl going to prison! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, somewhat fantastic but I would say that it works well by everyone involved and it has got a good cast which includes Miranda Richardson, Anna Freel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason got the features of Isaac. You can expect that the costume design is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if this movie is not broadcasted on BBC 2 after receiving a complaint. Captain St. Eves is lying in a prostitute bed where the nipple is fully exposed and there is a view of the French prisoners' baths, in which there is a full frontal male nudity where there is no mention of a murder scene that does not have clear sight of blood. You have to think about any kind of sources that the BBC schedules are doing
