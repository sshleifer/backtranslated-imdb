This movie will be the line for the most annoying movie in the year. <br /> <br /> The killings of this movie are considered to be of interest to this movie but not for any interest. Cast is not bad but the script is terrible horror, I'm just sitting wondering during this movie, how the world's people think about how it can entertain the movie <br /> <br /> The film's producers are very clever They made a boring movie but good actors and actresses hid it with their cast. People will go to Blockbuster and probably watch this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Christian Scott Thomas and Will Duffo have to rent this good movie. (The boy is for a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you want to return and want to rent this movie then some people have actually enjoyed this movie but I like watching a movie with money
