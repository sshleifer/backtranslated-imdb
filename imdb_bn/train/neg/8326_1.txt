This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where it will start .... <br /> <br /> Plot (what is slightly): Clayton Beersford Jr. (Hayden Crestensen), a young billionaire, desperately needed a replacement with a bad heart. Clay has secretly been involved by her mother PA, Samantha, Jessica Alba. These two are secretly married at night, it is such that cardiovascular diseases are found in the same rare blood type. Go and see that one odd image! Once on an operating table, Anessia is not working out of a clay, and she can feel everything and hear everything. Fortunately, Clay is capable of filtering a sharp scalpel cutting pain of a ray, just think carefully in the memories of her feud, open her chest, which says that she can not stop what she is doing with an annoying voice. <br /> <br /> <br /> The course will start when you see the surgical scene. <br /> <br /> How can a young person agree with a patient like a surgeon, a nurse, a doctor, and a heart transplant operated by a drunken anaesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom was drawn to the teeth. Medical treatment can not be mentioned, which is very annoying to take seriously ... The operating room does not even keep the barbarians ... People can go home and out without smoking only. During the operation, the audience heard Clay's thoughts, some of which are very interesting. Ah ... but all that is here ... doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. Trust him to be unconscious, villains speak freely. God! what'll happen? <br /> <br /> OK ... At least there is no intervention from anyone in the hospital, although four cases filed against a misconduct doctor are doing main heart surgery. Even Clay's excessive insecure mother does not seem capable of examining her condition. The only Samantha interested in the latest updates ... but oh no ... sweet sams can be in it ... you can quickly find something through the Scooby Doo dialog ... <br /> <br /> Finally, clay anesthetics came up with awareness It does not matter, because both ends in the same way. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / authors are trying to make fun of the victim of Anesthesia awareness, there are probably some fun fun ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy. .
