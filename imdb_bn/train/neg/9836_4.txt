John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) are trail friends who go to Rodeoscale to rodeoscope. Scott is a fair contestant, but finds out that if he is not willing to receive fifty cents in dollars from a notorious prometor in the sense of a reward, he must collect his win in the gunpoint. In most cases, Bandit Pitt (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide that they want to take the rest of the roda; They shot producer Fernsworth (Henry Hall) and it seems to be the killer of Scott and Kansas Charlie. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler used a running gag in the film where they are going to go with their fists on various acridities. Each time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne pauses him and makes him fool. <br /> <br /> If you are very aware, Lipton's tea ad is clear in one scene, where Skate loves to love Anne (Mary Corumanman) <br /> <br /> <br /> Friends again call robbery at one point. Looking at the heart and changing its way wrong, the bad guy wants to come clean in the gym and accept the Sheriff, but Pitt shoot him down. While engaging, Jim Doctor and his sister told Anna to tell her story. In an incredible scene, Anne penetrates right in the middle of a gun battle to face the sheriff between good boys and villains. <br /> <br /> One of John Wayne Western's from "The Desperate Trilogy" from Lone Star. Production during this era. Emergency absence is George "Gabi" Hayes and Yakima Cantt, usually one or both of these will be seen in the oaters. If you are John Wayne Fan, you have to see it once, but perhaps it will be enough.
