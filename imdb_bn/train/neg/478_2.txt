The worst Warner Bros. Francis film competition is tough. I've probably only seen eight, but comets are the worst in Broadway recently. The very best thing about it is to summarize it. Oh, and Aurie-Kelly Gown (of course) fine. There is no cinematography on James Wang Hau. Kay Francis is greasy throughout life and generally feels less attractive. Mina Gamble, whom I do not know otherwise, is a semi-tough "burlesque" dancer as well (she looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). Closed shot - who was able to walk a dirt walk towards a prison in a jail trapped in a step by fraud in a step-by-step, when Francis and his child (when did the child know who was Francis his mother?). The whole movie is so cheap, so impractical and so indifferent that everyone who created it is infected with a sinking suspicion: Warner Bros. throws garbage to those who do not know, among their worst guesses of Warner Bras, that they've got garbage .
