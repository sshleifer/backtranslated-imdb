So, where is the cannon? Those who will be surprised by the title of the film and the 'real cannibal' appeal will be disappointed. Instead, we showed a strange man and his reciprocal re-inspection of a Papua New Guinea village, one of which was her lover a few decades ago. People, Tobias Snybbe, New York, Jewish, because they come and are associated with the documentary, in any way, as they appear in their scenes in different scenes. <br /> <br /> There is no real redemption here: only the stories relay some Native and Tobias yourself by. All together, a bad film. Very interesting and great cinematography. Saturn is very enjoyable throughout life and gives us an interesting glimpse of a life that can be found just as far away from the Western civilization. <br /> <br /> It is not just a cover and a claim to be a plot plot. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 kids
