Ivan (Valerie Nikolayev) is a bitter, cruel journalist who investigated unspecified. He travels to this small town where it is said that it is a witch (Ita never) community terrorists. <br /> <br /> She stalls his car and takes shelter in a small building, and fills a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he turned into a giant and he was amazed who killed him, and killed this woman in the city ... I think there was witch but I'm not completely sure. Ivan is now being followed by his spirit, or something, and believe in him, or something, to beat it. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian film. They are usually filled with long actors, stupid tales and short effects. Note that this is not only a Christian film but also a foreigner. Actor movie over voice for Ivan is more ridiculous than terrorists, it is so high pitch and whiny You will not miss much by missing this image.
