I saw the first show, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compatton presented himself as a "mysterious" vampire transformed and represented Suu Kyi as an independent woman. However, the show has moved away from here and once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters will lose their original personality with their acting ability. According to episode 5, the rash of the bribe is so low that there is only the forehead in its mouth. Sookie, or rather the actress, even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events react to its surroundings and how enjoyable it is to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they can sleep with each other and show original characteristic. They were teased with each other that way I was hooked and easily toyed with something more. As soon as Sookie lose it, he struts around like the total ditz, Bill Billis and his appendage size is just so. Bill also loses its debonair attitude and good, he just gets simple folly. He does not really explain his actions without it for Sookie. Why? If they have love, their love never fills one another. So far, it seems to be a sexual relationship, which is the main part of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are generally equal to sex but come. Every five seconds I see some humping going on. It was not an amazing thing since HBO always tried to pass a soft core pass as a decent TV show. The bill is coming out of the dirt and for some reason it is taking with drying without any reason? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not go into details about. All the events that are happening are usually undefined. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can say is the smallest letter. Her and her drunken mother is much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to watch shows is because of the development of minor letters. <br /> <br /> The program shown to reduce gender and original characterization will be more effective.
