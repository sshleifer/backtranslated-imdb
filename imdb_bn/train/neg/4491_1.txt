1/10 and it's just because I do not go down with my ratings. <br /> <br /> Press this "Movie" and wait for the last movie of "Trilogy", do not buy it or rent it. Believe me you will not miss a thing. Architect did not bring any new information: _ (spoiler) _ There are more NEOs before, NR.6 or something like that. You can already illustrate something like this from the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first matrix created was not working because it was very perfect. Trinity was dead and Neo brought her "love" back, where did I look? Oh exactly the first movie where the role is opposite! Like action-scenes, there is nothing new with more opponents. In the big battle we (betrayal of war?) In the battle of war (20+ ships), betrayed by somebody (Hmmm, probably the man holding the knife who wanted to kill Neo?) Who shook the EGM button soon <br /> <br /> In all shameless plaques (especially those boys who went to visit it once) to make all the money, which apparently act like a charm.
