I have seen this first when my Tivo system is sorted out as a tip. I like Danny Elfman and it can be interesting. On top of that, I was a fan of Max Fischer's work, and it started with the look and feel of his 30's cartoon. With both of those, I will keep my interest in it. I was roasted. Just a few minutes, and I had a quick forward button. I ran through it in about 15 minutes and thought that it was. After that, I read some other reviews here and thought that I did not give enough chance. I recorded it again and saw it through. I have 75 minutes of my life, I'm not back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe there is no worse reviews. Personally, I think it's less because 10 lines get the lowest comments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, and puke joke. The letters are flat. The "alphabetical spontaneous" link is waxed, basically bound to tune, going through A-E, "F" clearly strikes the helplessness, and then there is no idea. The journey does not work for the first time through the intestines, only to leave the following landing. <br /> <br /> What you expect from what you expect, without the ability to determine which movie is "Out-South Park" Stone and Parker's is not funny. This could be fun if you're high. Otherwise, it's not.
