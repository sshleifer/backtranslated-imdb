As much as I'm thinking about this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could make it <br /> <br /> It was worse than that, but I know that at least <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I called the director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He even agreed that he was not aware of what he was doing, and <br /> <br /> <br> /> Was forced to do something because it was digitally portrayed. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film is working hard to cope with the formula. <br /> <br /> It has been created for itself: "9 people must be connected in any way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Can we get the point 'A' from point 'B'? So <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Minutes of each character in relation to another person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bukkeri is a scene where she wonders That's it. I said <br /> <br /> ... out of 10.
