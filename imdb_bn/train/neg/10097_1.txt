I shopped off by BB and watched over 4 weekend flicks pick up on flickers. Now, I realize that the effects will be chess, the acting will be sub-par and the sets will be suspected. So I'm not expecting much. But there should at least have a story. The stories do not cost anything except time ..... apparently, they have no time. <br /> <br /> There were 5 bodies of "J Zombie Nation" which appeared at the end of the film. The new wave looked like hookers. The zombie picture on the front cover is not displayed in the movie. It was absolutely annoying to see and it was not something to offer. <br /> <br /> The running time was only 81 minutes but it was felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who was on another computer computer only, could listen to the film), it sounds like obscene junk ... if you think it sounds slowly but ... but it was not even that good <br /> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> it ended free and I still ripped off. I rated it 1 out of 10 because IMDb would not allow me to use decimal.
