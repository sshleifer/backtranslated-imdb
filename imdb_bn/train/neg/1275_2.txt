This is a horror movie. These three stories are bound with a psychiatrist hypnotic line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. About the first wild wolves and some lady, some things which makes sense, but hypnotism makes for that thing. Second, Bad Bill Packethon should not be seen as a positive roommate as a piechant. The last one, sadly, the best is almost impossible, which I guess is that it makes it better than other garbage.
