I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I was really frustrated with it. Not sure why I would really like to make a movie like this It was a little entertaining, but I think it was like creating a lot of controversy about the people they were making. On Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, Director; Wednesday, the man gets coffee; Etc. It seems that they really wanted to make different movies, but only time and money were there. <br /> <br /> Anyone else commented that the acting was really good, but my disagreement. Again, if the actors could have kept the face directly during filming, it would probably be better actor than they did for them. <br /> <br /> The movie stamps behind the fact that the movie is a mystery ... something along the lines of historical law and order or National Treasure. It starts like this, but then, it can not rotate somewhere in the twilight zone, or ... what was the other that was not good ... a bad part of the outer limits <br /> <br /> < The main allegation of my movie is that this is just a game. There are evil people with white white hair. There is an interest in love, when he first appears, the wind actually goes through his hair. Seriously Once you realize it's a Christian movie, the end is also easy to spot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been done badly, especially the first scene - the way forward ahead of your best foot. It was not terrible for most of the films, but an old lady sometimes had a badly bad shot, praying, lifting arms in the dark room, when light was hit - something that would make you feel ashamed to watch a movie.
