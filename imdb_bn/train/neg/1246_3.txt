I think spoilers <br /> <br /> The complete endless silly argument destroyed the entire movie. I just could not get over it. And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly see myself crashing - I have landed on the planet with the talk, I want everyone, "Ahhhhhhh ... live your life! The monkeys have been inherited in the world!" But he is like all, "talking apes, okay. Next?" I would say it's pretty cool. He must run into something even strangely on a regular basis. In addition to this, it is still the best work of Rick Bucker. This is the true proof of how far we came to the monkey makeup field. 3/10.
