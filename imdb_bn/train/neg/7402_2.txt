This is a typical example of highly skilled directors in terms of the technical expertise of video clips / technical attempts to film their first full-length feature. On one side are imagery, camera, light, CGI and even the words are highly polished and really "expensive" look and feel. Even actors show a possible probability of a certain amount - at a stage where the best performances can not hide the bad plot too. <br /> <br /> In this case it is not a bad plot but not a single plot. <50% "What was that?", "What was it?" And "what was that?" Although no letter or listener in any case is given the slightest indication of an answer. In most other dialogue, one feels that there was never a dialogue book and the actors had to free themselves from a plot that was never explained to them. The only reason why Sky Bennett's performance might be so good is that his character as an autistic girl did not allow him to get the line of sadly horrible dialogue to deal with other actors. In this way he was able to show his acting talent, which could not even come to the rest of Caste. I mean, there is no actor in the world who can be ready for such dialogue: <br /> BEN: Is it real, is not it? Emily: Turn it off. Ben: A mass of monosyes, huh? People: Someone will have to control this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not by you, by no one. Emily: You are not. Ben: No <br /> <br /> Get me Gosboam. But for horrible, more for awesome efforts. At some moments I feel ashamed to add actors to their villa. <br /> <br /> 2 stars in excellent tech work.
