This movie is nothing interesting I thought it was interesting to give a man a bite of Rangamati goats and it should be given for some laughs. Wrong! There is nothing interesting about the movie. For example, in the middle of a farmer's garden, the main character to pass on the goats is not funny, it is the border of obscenity. They roam about mutualism in this movie at one point, and it's just fun. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs can eat anywhere, any time. The main character does everything with everything, everywhere, not funny. It becomes a cliche. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider, I suppose, the role is acceptable. By this, I mean that he is not a bad actor, but it's hard to comment on the quality with the hole material. However, Kona Hasle, in half of the Human Romantic Lead (who count the number of animals which are also interested in the romantic lead as the main character?), The whole thing seems to be ashamed, that too. It seems that he is acting in a vacuum, the film is different from all other actors. <br /> <br /> See this image only if you want to be bored by a transparent, neutral, repetitive element.
