This difficult little horror film is actually one of Ronnie Harlin's best. The story is a beautiful routine stuff, but the atmosphere really makes it come alive; In fact, almost a trial about the stories of ghosts. The real horror prison comes from itself and Ronnie H. Do not give us a detailed description of how much worse they are with those growing, leaking, rats-even with the oldest hellfire (even with the gentleman!). The limited role is usually supported by prisoners of some very authentic appearance (there are no beautiful boys in this cast.) The intimidating fans should check this one.
