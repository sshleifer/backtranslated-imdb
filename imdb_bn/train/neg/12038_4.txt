All this will happen in the movie. There are only a few small scenes where I do not know what's going on, so it does not count. This movie is very annoying, it's painful, and it's coming from a person who likes it when making movies. Confused? Well, I was after this nasty observer. What Donald Sutherland did was because he completely missed with this one. And what's with the "podfil" scene at the beginning of the movie. Someone can sleep! 4/10
