I rent this DVD for two reasons. Great actors and directors, although Robert Altman may be hurt or missed. In this case, it was a big miss. His attempt to create the mystery of Altman fell in his quetta. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Agence", I do not think he could possibly contribute to such a Turkey, and I hope it will not destroy his reputation. It seems that Robert Duval once lost his way to the Oscars. Including acting on a downward spiral that is eaten as this one-meaning films. Duval once starred in an excellent film, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercy", but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I think it out of 10 out of 2.
