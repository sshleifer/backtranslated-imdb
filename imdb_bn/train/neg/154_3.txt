It looked at English subscribes to DVD in real language. Either the subtitles were very poor or actual conversations created many stories and did not develop any characters. There are several hackers, but the movie does not need their presence to make their presence good or bad. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes made in CGG are attractive for color and brightness but it can be great before long time. If something like that, it reminds me of a child's movie with signals, transaction scenes and sham plot. I am sure that I realized what was happening in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather unfortunate.
