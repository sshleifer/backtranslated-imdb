I had to endure teenage adult, high school angst and family conflict for almost all shows. I do not really care about fretting high school girls about their relationship. I spent time on helm with such problems and I'm going through the "Lite" versions of fantastic misery, I do not tolerate them. I want science fiction. Here's the only reason I am here. There was a few seconds of science fiction late in the ceremony. We finally see a proto-silen. It was well but with a problem. His red eye dot interest will lock on an object. We all know that the cylinder eye pattern always scans back, giving the machine a map of the world. <br /> <br /> I hope the author will fix this abuse before the second episode.
