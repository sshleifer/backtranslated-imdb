This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1 so I hope more than that. It starts spontaneously funny and respectful with a power in mind. But before halfway through the film, it starts pulling and everything becomes a sudden prediction. The first letter of office character was delightful in the movie, but we know them very well; They become caricatures, not all of the real people. This same story I saw hundreds of times, only slightly called here in different situations. The thing is, if I used to get another conversation love story, the dialog was not so brutal! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In case of dead letter office. I hope this movie will end soon in the David Movie Office.
