Hitting my mind on how to make this movie. I work at home writing emails and saw this when answering the phone - I just saw it because I hope the "revenge" part will be good. Needless to say, revenge and forced plot twists were not worth the email which they saw. In fact, I'm not sure what happened at the end. The act again was bad like making the law again in the "FBI Files" show - so far, the worst replay (really "arrest and justice" can actually be worse as a law-form). I did not even know the movie at IMDB as long as I was in the movie's third Eye Blind, but it's obvious because it did not make any film. I hope he is a good singer.
