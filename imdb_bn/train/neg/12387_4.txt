Lipstick Another Shiny Movie Failure I'm trying to think about a good thing that I can tell about movies, and I have problems with some problems. I think Marjax Hemingway was the best part of the red dress that was put to the end of the movie. The writing and the script was not the worst for me, but it could have been very good. Lipstick was very happy to look at the eye. The sets were very shiny and were nice to see. The cast was just fine. I think that the character of Bacroft was the only possible character of the film. Chris Sarandon was sorry to waste his time at this time.
