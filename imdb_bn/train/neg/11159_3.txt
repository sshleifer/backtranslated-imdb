I saw this movie 'Snake preview' and I must admit that I do not like many films with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. The half-movie theater did not return after half the holidays. I could not blame them, if this is not true then there was absolutely no need for the second half of the photo. I hope to see the credit just before the movie goes ahead ten years ago.
