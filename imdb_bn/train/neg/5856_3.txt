Rama Rao has made some very good films in the 1980s, but she is a filmmaker who can not be mature with changing times, styles and fashion. He stuck with the same old style of fashion design. <br /> <br /> Actors do not get bad, not good. Anil Kapoor usually works very well with both father and his son's role, but faulty scripts often find him funny and kind. The line is good, but then - he's always good, and here he is not like that. He does the best he has given, but he always does that. In conclusion, nothing great is great. Rabina is okay, which is normal, not bad, no good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This image is gentle, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a delayed film? Well, even then it will still be down to the standard. The scripts are scary, the film is overdone, and stories do not go anywhere. It seems like a movie made in the early 1990's, but the script seems to be old, like the 1950s. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan, do not recommend it actor actor
