I can not think a lot about speaking about this film. <br /> <br /> It was a horror movie ... I could not even tell you what I decided to see it. It was a few freedom fighters I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> This plot became neutral from impossible. My whole body was in the duration of the movie because I could not wait to finish the terrible thing and finish it. At the end of the film, I felt myself out of comfort. <br /> <br /> The editing was poor, acting was sub-par, and the story was weak. Francois Robinson was appointed as a native American, even though he did not even meet with Native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be stupid, then it should be a ridiculous fool - at a very short time. It was not. It was just unfortunate.
