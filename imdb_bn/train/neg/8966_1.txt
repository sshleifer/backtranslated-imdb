The original "cube" is a fantastic b-movie that is full of paranoys, caricature characterization and great over-the-counter performance. It's weird, mysterious, and cool. And it stands perfectly well, without a stupid sensual "cubic zero" <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie repeats the part of the Cube series (most of the folly is recycled sadly), part breaks. The cube takes bold action to explain what - which was not published in the first movie - but since the explanation is strong, I want to keep it secret. There are some possible interesting references to society that exist outside of density, but they do not develop any political-religious universal state without any indication. So, a little social comment feels flat and candid. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. Acting is completely amateur hours, slow pacing (how long does this screen show two screen screens?), And the effects of the womb, during rebellion, fail to be satisfied. In short, "Cub Zero" reminds me of a "cube" fan-fix, a drunken and sophomric clone of a good film that does not explicitly require a single cylinder.
