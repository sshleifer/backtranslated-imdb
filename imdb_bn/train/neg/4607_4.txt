I can not imagine how I waited for the ant king. As a big Gordon fan, I was waiting for the European Premier with the confidence of the mischief. Especially when I like Dagon-Gordon's last achievement - so much so Antosh King is here premiered in my country and it came to those who present themselves in Gordon. Unfortunately, I can not go and congratulate him for later. The King of the Annus is his most unknown and medieval film. Indeed, the quality level does not exceed the standard TV-thriller standard. Plot outline is very regular and with some poor view exceptions, Gordon-touch is not generally recognized. Above that, already weak script has more than the Swiss bowler's hole! It is rented for a killing who included a young wannabe-crook. So he's doing. And of course they are not paying him. And of course he falls in love with a hunter's wife. And of course he attacks himself .. Only the sequence that goes crazy is worth mentioning and they reminded you only that you are watching Stuart Gordon. As a heroic low life with performance performances McKenzza, George Norm Peterson 'Wendt' is less like a harsh sexual bomb, such as Carbie Bastard and Curie Wahrer. Extremely irrational events are happening continuously and the atrocities of the story become very quick, when make-up effects are not enough to please amateur-fearing fans. I read a few comments in The King of the Ents, claiming Gordon's best because it is finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. If this is the case then I am unexpected and thanks again for the other person to see the animator. Many Oh well, I think every good director steam and inspiration runs out in the end. It's worse it overcame Stewart Gordon.
