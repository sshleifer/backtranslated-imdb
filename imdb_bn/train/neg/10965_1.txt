I'm actually writing this picture. . . If the following comments prove "lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker" then it may be. . <br /> <br />. . I thought (still thinking about how I'm currently viewing) this image. . . It is too overrated, too, to put it quietly. Again, too <br /> <br /> <br /> It's like a really bad movie that is made by someone outside of a very limited organization. . . And who could not pay attention to this detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go through many different ways I am missing this movie. . . Well . . I do not understand it (remember, I totally acknowledge that this is not my fault here - not a film maker - this is not "part of the fantastic genius"). . . I rent this a whim because the reviews were very, very outstanding. . <br /> <br /> <br /> .
