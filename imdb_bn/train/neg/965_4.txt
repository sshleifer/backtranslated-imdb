First I like that movie. It seems to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. Clothing designer Albert Olski has made his best !!! Robert R. as a wonderful set decorator The same as Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the script writer was extremely disappointed by me. The best finishing stairs will be the scene, but instead, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Do not want the end. Dad became the lover of his own daughter and his former wife knew about it and found it right. That would be right, for example, if the authors used to say that there is now a different soul in the body, but they did not do it, they simply missed out on memories. The actors were good, they were really fun. Cyber ​​Shepherd was impressive, Robert Donnie was very funny in the junior dance scene :)) ... but some moments also spoil good acting impressions. For example, after her husband died, Jean and Jeffreys played by Cybele Shepherd for 23 years (it was a long time!), She was true to her, she did not love anyone else, and when she met her, her friend Philip Train ( After a scene with Ryan O'Leal, for her love, she betrayed a very tall man for so many years! It will be a good movie, and if some do not end it mental psychology.
