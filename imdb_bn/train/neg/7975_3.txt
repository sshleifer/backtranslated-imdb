I sat down in front of the TV and thought, "Oh, Alfred Hittak, even Brian DePalma could do it!" There are chances, you too will be It does not start intrigueing. A British Park Ranger living in Los Angeles (Colin Firth), married a beautiful, shy woman (Lisa Zen), whom she had seen in the park shortly before. Then, one day he disappears. The police could not find any documentation that he had ever existed, and Firth managed his own search. So far everything is right. As she is going to give up, she has played the role of her best woman's friend (Billy Jane), and she has leaned towards her former life in the production of underground drugs, nightclubs and amateua, and then in the history of mental instability. Meanwhile, Firth's life is dangerous, and the film is separated. No letters from Lisa Jane's past are interesting. The film moves slowly, and has very little steps. There is a concubine related to the meaning of missing drugs, but this is just a throw. No Chase, no cliffhanging sequence, and no mystery. Just a lot of dull beatings and chats by annoying characters. One thing worthless, Lisa Jane and Billy Jane, brothers and sisters, but they do not appear together in one scene. At the end of the film you are thinking about what you think and awake to get awake.
