My friends and I rented it for "bad movie night" with high hopes, but there was something in the brain in the lotdown. The brain itself is greedy looking stupid, but it mostly sat on its little platform. Who thought that only 94 minutes of minutes in the brain will slay three people? This movie is going on in most cases, Atevez-Nokhoffe lead is playing a rebel genius (we have been told that his extraordinary intelligence has led to his wide joke and mischief in school stunts, among which somebody has a crzee glue on the chair). It has some great lines, a happy out-of-shape and out-breathing henchman who barely manage everywhere, and, yes, some chick gets nude. However, director of pacing industry desperately needs some school education. Out of the last half, only at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring cheesy scenes make up the middle of the plot and start pulling it later. PRI complex inside the scene is particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are running up and down the same Sierwell. I could modify the screenplay in this item for half an hour - more cheese, more cows, more nudity, more brain action. If you are going to create a bad horror movie, at least let me look something cool while closing my curiosity. Maybe the director was really trying to bring the audience to his movies - at the end of this Cufffest, I began to feel like a wandering suburbs.
