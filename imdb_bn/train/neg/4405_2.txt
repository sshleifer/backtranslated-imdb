What I can say is that before watching the film, I had no indication of what was Annimory Schwarzbach or his life story .. And I must admit that the film was rarely helped to reach this information .. And even some of the words on Google's website Typing did not succeed in persuading me for some research; However, I can say that actress Janet Hain was facing her face face-to-face and she really did well and it showed deep emotional status, because it is real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The script of this movie also happened in Turkey and Tehran and Afghanistan. But believe that I am familiar with this area, it is an Arabian desert in Morocco. Turkish people and the Persian people are completely different in face and culture. Just like that language is not Arabic .. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing for making such a film - Documentary type - A thorough study of these minor elements is compulsory.
