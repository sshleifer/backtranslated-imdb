... and it's this picture. I imagine that after the negative life actually, enemy souls are bound to an uncomfortable sofa, and this movie is forced to look at a continuous loop for eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not bad, but perhaps I saw the worst movie next to "Manas, the hand of luck" ... and I saw many bad movies, you believe in me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most movies focus on the revival of these two bodies rather than the "heroes" of this film, who are actually for less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really spoils the film by adding bad music and editing poor work. But honestly, it was probably a bad movie to start, so the crown could not really hurt it. <br /> <br /> This is actually a 100 list. I would not wish to be one of my worst enemies this one. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my campi b movie. It was bad, but I still liked it despite my star rating.
