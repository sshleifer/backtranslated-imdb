This film proves that every movie made in Hollywood's glorious day is not worth seeing. Just because you've got a nice ensemble weld means a scrip that was probably written by a chip could not overcome! Think about this - the film has pictures of Richard Weidmark, Lauren Baakal, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lilian Gish and Paul Stewart, and it's still a bad movie! The basic premise of the film is not bad - a personal mental hospital where the staff is worse than the patient! Also, there was a lot of subplant commitments involving additional work done to husband and wife (Weidark and Graham). However, this script was driven with all the fascination and stealing of the torch torch - Bellicose and the film repeatedly over the scene. Actually, it is less like a play and a very bad episode of "General Hospital" Delicate, this film is not !! Realistic, this picture is not !! <br /> <br /> Most of the film was a horror script, but I blamed the producer and also responsible for the miscasting and misuse of veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a family name, but this character was an exceptional talent - especially when filming gangsters playing silent movies. Yet, here, Stewart is cast as a nonscriptive psychiatrist with some strange European accent - it was not very out of his acting range and his character was fully adoption and one-dimensional. Also, Charles Boyer just misprinted hopelessly and fully find the place. This subtle romantic actor appears to have been diverse as America's heartland psychologist. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a terrible movie. It is very watchable in the order of a train debris but it is certainly not very nice. My wife and I did not like most of the movie, but writing was very good. <br /> <br /> PS - Imitation of life in industry, one among Oscar Levant patients plays. In real life, Brilliant Levant spent most of his life in and out of mental institution.
