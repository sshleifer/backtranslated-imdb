I can not say that I liked this movie very much. It has some interesting moments, but it does not seem to be a comedy or drama. This is not really that. Vowels can be a drama and entertainment moments are very few and far away. It does not give too much knowledge. The reasons do not seem to cause any reason. And it's too narrow. I think they have made things right. As long as they were leaving. If they take a little time to explain a bit, it might be a good movie. I would say that the end was climatic, but that means the rest of the film is really growing somewhat, which it did not. It's just the same, and that's the end. I could not find it boring, but as I said, there was no point at all. I'm a reluctant and weak, 3/10 of the Winter Kills
