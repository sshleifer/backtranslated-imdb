I saw this in a movie called "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin films were shown. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I almost went out of this movie, and I like science-imagination! The story is set in a future New York City, which is full of blade runner-style sky advertising and similar controversy about cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not quite narrow for an hour-and-twenty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people and Egyptian gods. It seems that artificial people have high hands and control the city's politics. People are used for donations of slaves and eugenics and organs. A floating pyramid of Egyptian deities (based on the large pyramid of Khufu and a smooth "outer" with a smooth "caps" on the pyramid has been completed.) Will a floating future pyramid be in perfect condition?). The Pyramid rests over the city and no one understands why and why it is there. I will not carry you with the so-called plot, but there are many unnecessary graves and many visible scenes. As I said, the film was influenced by Blade Runner and was probably also influenced by the fifth element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credit you were thanked in the UK, France and Italy. The film is French, but French actors who do not speak French use it. So, it is clear that their French dialogue has been dubbed. This is a confusion, and I thought that going back and forth between real people and animations is very confusing. It does not help the animations that are not poor - not better than a video game. Leave this one out.
