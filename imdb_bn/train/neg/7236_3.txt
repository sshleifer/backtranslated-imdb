Let's see ... I'm trying to find everything in the positive, so what do I say about the splendor? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, they would not succeed in removing all the personality of Gonyith Paltrow, usually very vibrant, and finished by creating a caracter√≠sticas in carroll ears and Barbara Haris. <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, how are you stories? It does not have to fly, because it was sinking. Whatever the sequence was? It was not funny, that's the comedy rules. It was not enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, I can not be sure - let's just "damaged" like this. I'm sure those guys who started with a vision, I mean, they might have a pitch for studio cases, but I need to find it. <br /> <br /> Even if I was a patient who could forgive the stupid stupidity of the story, I could not recommend a good conscience in a movie which allows a person to go to the professional interview interview in a windmaker and dirty, sculpture, stupid hair. Talking about the hair - do we want to be satisfied with intentional black roots and platinum lock? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I have already lost 97 onerous minutes in the actual review of the movie - I can not spend more time with this sufferer.
