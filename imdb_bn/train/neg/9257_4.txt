If you expect something new, you have selected the wrong movie. Who can think of a movie that could be a virtual replacement of its predecessors? Perhaps the producer and maybe the manager but hopeful they were not serious when creating this issue. This whole film is like making the first 3-Movie Best Hit DVDs, but the actors are changing. BHHAAAAD.
