Buying movies for my friend 5 ?? (It's not even 1 cent value), because they wrote it like American Pie. But soon we will know that there is a long way to survive American pi. It's not even a comedy, it's really really like a really bad documentary. Not only is the story bad, pictures and sounds also sucks. They put some alcohol, girl, dwarfs and drunk teens. And the result is a disaster. If you do not see this movie as it is buying, then spend your money on something else better. If you want to torture yourself, do not invite your friends, unless you hate and you want to get rid of them.
