When I go to the video store to rent a flickr, I generally believe in IMDb's opinion in the film, and till now, I have never seen a free rate of 7.0 or above on the site without enjoying it. <br /> <br /> </ br /> One legendary director of the 20th Century, Sidney Lloyt actually made a filmmaker wrong with the biggest mistake: Cast of a film completely fits completely obscure characters with no real drawings character. <Br/> <br /> I like movies with flawed characters, but no dark light in a person's dark light, we also have some dark or bright color green colors compared to others. Mr. Lloyt exceeds this line by filling this image with a completely disrespectful and almost moccotic pitch-color letter. <br /> <br /> An amazing, immature, unlawful, irresponsible man like Ethan Huq 30, is divorced with a wife who dislikes her and a girl feels that she is a victim, which she is too much His unwillingness and willingness to do his dirty work for others, because he dreadfully separated his bank robbery from planning and mother was dying. When he was standing near his elder brother at the end of the film, it was more painful than lifting. Ethan Huq has played his character well, but does not give much to work with him because it looks like he has a chest on his chest and he does not particularly care about it. <br /> <br /> Talk to her character wife who is equally bad. Every shot that he has added has encircled him for money only for the rent and support of the child, and more insignificant in his non-existent self-esteem with humiliation. Seriously, that's just about all the characters. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays his father Charles and for many years Mr. Finn has acted as a great actor, and spent 90% of the film in the same movie. Because of the worst constipation in the world, he opened half of his stomach. As long as Mr. Finney has been an actor, you feel that he will become more interested. Although he does not see it further, his character is probably tragic and angry. And when he rebuked Andy at the conclusion of the movie, Just like Frankenstein, he brings a monster out of his own grief. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do with his character, Maurice Tomi. An unhappy marriage with Andy stuck in and there is a relation with her brother for some unreasonable reason. When Andy's world starts to swim beyond the control, she logically rushes the ship, but it does not actually give her less selfish or self-service than any other film's character, but perhaps with the most common knowledge. <<br /> And finally we came to Andy, always playing the role of Philip Camer Hoffman, the only reason I did this rating 1 instead of 1. Her performance of heroin-addiction, financial executive who is ruthlessly mesmerizing her parents' insurmountable jewelry store "perfect crime" is excessive mesmerizing. Unstable, fragile homicidal maniac is a defective project to his descendant credible and tragic from the calm master planner. Hoffman's character ends as the film's main villain, but the options are alternatives, alternatives are an awful younger brother and the last psychological and indirect son of his son, his mother's unidentified assault happened due to the husband's surrendering parent's abortion. . Finally <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> This picture is simply worth seeing for the great performance of PSH and the nature of its train's debris. There is really no reason to cheering for the price, because there really does not hope to be any character.
