Can i say I think I should write a "spyar alert" and then "publish" they used F-word A LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences. I did not like the film at all - much more hints about sexual distraction, deviation and cheating. And that swear window was completely out. I gave this movie "3" and the two points for Mira Sourvino's sexy movement on Dara Floor.
