This movie has made it among my top 10 most horror films. Horrible <br /> <br /> There was not a single minute where there was no war with a monster or anyone else. There was no chance for the development of any character, they were busy with others in a sword fight. I did not have any emotional attachment (except big machines that wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The scenes were stolen from other movies, Lotus, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, the Scratch scene was stolen from Yoda, Obee One and Vader from the final scene of old Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The spider machine at the beginning was exactly the same that attacked the spider in the trap of Fredo's princess. (Elias Wood is the victim of both pictures) and wait ...... it hypnotizes his prey (stings) and wraps them out ..... hello hello ???? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time? What would anyone say to me with Najee?!? Nazi's ???? <br /> <br /> A teenage story line reached a young conclusion. The movie could not determine whether it was a child film or adult film, and it was mostly not. <br /> <br /> Just awful To say the least of a true frustration. Save your money.
