Sequels have a nasty habit of frustrating, and I can give it the best credit that retains the old tradition. These three stories are no better than the original crossover. <br /> <br /> As far as three of the best wood statues are involved, killing its owners comes to life for revenge. The second story is a lake monster that does not appear to be much more than a floating shield, it may surprise you that someone might be afraid of it. In the third story, a Cami is included as a truck driver from Stephen King, but then it is a remarkable story about the victim of road traffic accident, who beat him and returned from the dead. <br /> <br> See original cropo instead, or be happy with it if you have already done it.
