I've had a fan without a trace from the premiere episode. I can not really express my frustration in the mountain last week. This is a real problem that has dealt with many African-American families and is dealing with them. In the first 48 hours, lack of media coverage has been documented in recent studies. Local, state, and federal laws including law enforcement are also logical. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and ended in the end? Apparently, television can deal almost without subject matter. It's embarrassing. Get it together or do not explore it later.
