Sorry, but I hope to avoid a weekend fiasco to face the plot line and I now face your end. Dad died and Mother asked Santa in the letter to bring her back to her family for Christmas, ... and Santa. Dad is completely healthy, healthy and completely unaware that he has died. All the last syrupy sweet. <br /> <br /> But recently my five-year-old lost her best dog friend as a parent, it was a horrific flick. Now my son is sure to ask him to bring his friend back to Santa! Do not underestimate a young heart empowerment - No indication will convince him that it's just a movie and his dog is not coming back for Christmas. The heart was broken just to see his joy on Christmas day to know that he would face his loss. <br /> <br /> For those of you who recently lost your loved ones, shame is a shame for you. It is difficult to deal with losses once for a child, but there is some desire that we should not be portrayed as a possibility.
