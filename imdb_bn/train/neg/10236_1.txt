Really awesome <br /> <br /> Now, the soldiers of the movie permit to elaborate on me before joking on their lates. The way I've enjoyed it, it's just one of the worst movies I've seen and the worst movie I've ever seen in the movie (a fascinating claim, I remember Daredevil on the big screen). Two Lead (Daniel Gilly and Elisa Cuthbert) were terrible terrible at worst and bad times. Of course, they did not help with the help of a script that had a much more psychological depth as Duffen and Celest's single and characteristic features that were reliable as O & D Defence. The plot (to extend a little word) was unincorporated and thin in 'Gore' scene, undoubtedly was cruel, irrelevant and ridiculous formulas. A plot runs around 20 models of model (Cuthbert), who is kidnapped, imprisoned, and is subjected to both psychological and physical abuse. Torture scenes seem like disconnected pieces and stressed instead of frustrating audiences. Although very few positive ideas are found from this film, its release features are flaws that make it a horror movie. I do not hear a more vocal audience in a movie. Within twenty minutes, the whole movie was broken into pieces and it continued on the whole path. I was laughing at my fate, was getting excited by a photo that topped the frustrating movie. The way you see it, it really illustrates the film's achievement and the future director Vanbabs for a movie movie that does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> I left to mention that I was able to enter the free movie ... so I could laugh at it. I was still tempted to ask my money back ... it was really bad.
