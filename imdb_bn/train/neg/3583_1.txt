If there was a scale below 1, then it would be a -10, which would follow the footsteps of GoogleSpell. Acting (if there was such a thing) was fierce, the plot in the shambles. And Ren Rousseau was sorely ill in his role, enough to drag a person. Ten thumbs down for a stupid movie. Mercy Savings: Kudos for era costuming.
