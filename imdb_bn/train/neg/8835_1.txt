Seeing this picture, I read a review that this movie might be one of the best movies ever! The tension escalated by O ha scene ... from the annoying character of this movie. The little girl is trying to sink a little boy by screaming, the killer is running without any notice (and the man talking to a little boy on the beach?). Everything looks right and then this photo is inappropriate. As I have seen, the film was moving on one side and can not go anywhere, but from the new direction ... and <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is awesome, but the writing is horrific. Every character of each character says that some incredible, unrealistic and colleague cast extra / reactions are simply strange. There is no solution to the problems developed throughout the film, it is confusing and finally a big waste of time.
