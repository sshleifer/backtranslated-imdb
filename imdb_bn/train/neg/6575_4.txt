Interesting films about an actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It finally kept my attention and I'm sorry to see it. I could never read this hijacking incident, so the rebels were interested in dragging it. I enjoy the historical films of that era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with the Confederate uniform. They look very good !!! Acting time was a bit tough. I like eating thumb because he has no teeth. The injured soldier was a little weird playing the fetching with an enemy. Overall, it was a descendant film.
