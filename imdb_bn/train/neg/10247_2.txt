It's one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen, its awesome. Christopher Lee is good but he rarely opened the only good part of the scene. <br /> <br /> Not fooled by the title. "The end of the world" is really a bad movie, I finally stop it and see that it was so bad, only to die in the brain, hard-B movie fans die to stand upside down.
