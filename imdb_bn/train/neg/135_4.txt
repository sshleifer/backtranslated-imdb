There was no effort to stop Valentine from another teenage slash film, which is a sub-tactics of horror films that we saw in the last decade or more. I've complained to many people that many of the worst films that have been blocked by Halloween from Promoting Night to Carey, and as much as I hate to be unexpected, the rip off is so vague that it is not impossible to say something. Poor Jeremiah's head at the beginning of the film, the punching punch was probably taken from Kerry that he had rightly said in the movie ('Hey everyone, this director, and the following is my career-of-the-view!'). But it's just a suggestion. <br /> <br /> The spoilers are sorted into pieces in the same way that each other's naughty adventure thriller is formed. In the beginning we know some girls in a short time, they die, people are old-oh-but-stuff-just happen-they are surprised by the voice of other people, and then they start to die. Here are the problems that directors and writers want to clearly and honestly keep the film mysterious and suspicious, but they have no idea how they can do this. For example, take Jason Here is this frustrating arrogant man, who is so full of himself and worse than the woman that he shares the checks with each person by date, and after a brief history, how poor poor Jeremy is treated as one of the first characters in the film, he is supposed to carry some significance Is. Along with this, it is also more important that it is the primary formula like a little boy that all girls are terrorists in sixth grade, and the same primary sign in below the initial valentines day cards. <br /> <br /> The deliberate and sometimes successfully misleading one or more characters are not ambiguous by the behavior of which seems to be a major suspect, and Jason is a perfect example of the attempt, but not a successful attempt is a good example. Of course, I thought for a while that he could be a very good killer, but that's not the point. We know from the very beginning that he is terrible with women, which connects the little boy with him at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film he laughs at the Chief Minister's two flats in the presence of a team, and then gives them a detestable look and walks away, from the party and no With the explanation disappeared from the movie. We already know that he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so bad that when he was done with him they accepted him completely. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> At the beginning of the film, when Shelley strikes her assassin with her own scalpel, she does not make any words, she thinks that a woman can be silent to prevent herself from expressing herself as a woman, rather than to everyone's suspects. But then for the rest of the film, our strong, uninterrupted, unarmed killer has a passionate mask and that giant Butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who, with all respect, feels that he had some problems with girls in six categories) mentioned that he was influenced by Halloween. It is absolutely unnecessary, because it is so bad that he stole this movie. The only difference between Valentine's and Michael's killer is that Michael's mask was so effective and he did not have problems with the Nakballs. These things are shameless. Finally, there is a short attempt to mislead our killers once more (gradually and stretched and done with 'The-Killer' mask removal), but then we see Adam's nose starting bleeding, since She has kept her often reluctant girlfriend Keat, and we know she is a murderer all along. Nothing in the film could be a killer until the final act was made, and this vague noclides were not the ultimate way to identify the real killer at the end of the movie. Valentine is not terrible (in the middle I've seen it in the empty room myself, and as long as I can remember, I was afraid of darkness and I did not even fear), and the letters could take care if it is not so clear that they're just going to die. I remember being influenced by the theatrical previews (though the film was faster than theater's battlefield), but the end result is the same old thing.
