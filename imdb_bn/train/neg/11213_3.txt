All right ... I saw a lot of bad movies. I'm proud of that fact. Many times there are some gems in B-bomb. But this movie I saw is the worst. I like a good horror movie ... but a plot and a sense of consciousness. The opening scene looks pretty good. Regular music and imagery. Then it goes down the hill from it. One of the main characters has a disability (rings in tinetas). Now this will threaten to reveal her secret. They made the film's focus very high. So he was ringing in his ear and accidentally left a ear plug where he should not have been where he should be. No need to keep it up. So this guy is related to this girl and she falls in a motorlet and hits her head on the last table. Instead of knowing all about his relationship, he decided to dump his body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she happened and what happened. After seeing her sister again (as a zombie like ghosts) and even directing the body position she finally finds her. Now the body is rescued and killed and the only suspect that killed him. The bad thing is that he had a lot of plans. Just fill the guy where his twin pose to be and the body has been dumped. The fool does not believe that he killed him. So all was expressed there and even though he was a gun .... The way he managed to get strangled himself. So the last scene of the movie is walking out of her and her twin water "Spirits" Then you will tell me in this movie that the bad guy will win. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actor played from some acting
