I thought it was a very disguised, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. White Laser and Orlando Bloom were very good in their introduction, and their characters gave some personality; But the whole thing is compulsory and mechanical. Please <br /> <br /> may be much more involved in the beginning; Probably starting with a shootout, and then how they went there or how it was thrilled to repeat it. And I felt that every scene was regularly expected and the sign was posted, like the very bad tv soap. <br /> <br /> I was really waiting for this movie, and hope to do a little better. I can only speak for him that it hits the Mike Jagger version, but not much.
