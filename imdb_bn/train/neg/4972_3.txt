The worst thing for this show was difficult to say: bad acting, bad words in different parts, bad CGI, inappropriate set for time, poor script It would have been better if the script followed a little closer to the original story - there is enough good material in Bialophyf and there is enough tension and good material to provide good stories rather than written statement. <Br> <br /> And why to introduce a wonderful new weapon that burns explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was only made "within 21 days". It shows a lack of quality. I think this seems like a general (poor) attitude taken by the Saifai Channel (and others) while making films from the classic story in the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
