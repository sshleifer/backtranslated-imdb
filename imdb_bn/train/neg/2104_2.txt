I bought this video in Walmart's $ 1 bine. I think I pay extra !!! In the 1940s, for a small studio, Lughosi made a long string of 3rd-rated movies (in this case, the monogram - mostly made by Bori age films). Although the misfortune of most of these films can not reach the horror level in his last film (Ed Wood "The brain", such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 Out of Out Space), they still have poor movies and they all have to be avoided, but the most dead-fan fans . <br /> <br /> I got an old movie, so I tried it. In addition, these few small films were really good - not just this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She concocts from young brides. They never explained why he was a deaf or a woman, or his wife had to suffer - so you can see that this plot never really smiled. However, a really annoying female reporter (Jimmy Olson or a Lois Lane without Superman) wants to go under all these obvious killings, in which the bodies were stolen! So, he followed some formulas on Lugosi's doorstep all the way. The house of Lugosi is complete with his crazy wife, a female assistant and two strange men who are apparently assisted with Assistant Boys (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). This fortunate reporter naturally faints across the film - apparently go hand in hand with narcolepsy and good investigative journalism! Finally, the smokers all died - mostly in their own hands and all the best. In conclusion, he decided to get married with a reporter and a doctor. And, naturally, the reporter's folly cameraman faints when this happened. If you do not watch, then there are many imperfections in this movie. Or, perhaps it was a slow and ponderous film because they just fall asleep!
