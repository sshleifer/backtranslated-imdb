World Snooker Championship ended in the final final, Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Graeme Dot from 18 frames to 8 BBC 2, got a gap in his schedule, and so I decided to broadcast a movie in Muon. There is no knowledge. <br /> <br / > I miss title credits a few seconds, so Viggo Martensen did not play it and probably it could be a cheap TV It seems that, inevitably, they were arranged for the summer camp kids' TV, even though it is bright (very brightly lit) cinematography, it seems to be a cinematic film, and it's like a heavy man until the arrival of Wagga Martensen Walker was not near. If the story of Montensen was not starred in a TV movie, the film would have been published, I think it's like a legend like a Kingdom View like Robert Dinner. Wait a minute, Bob? .... <br /> <br /> Some people mention on this site that Pearl and Marty are an unauthorized on-screen couple and I agree. I understand why Perl will be attracted to exciting Hippies, but there is no idea that Waqar will attract the player's wife Perl. My time was in the sixties, but if you've got a choice between hippie kids and the boring homewomen, it's not really a choice. I remember that people have been receiving LSD for a long time, so I assumed it was a problem of money. The main problem is a romantic drama in the heart ( Just as you would expect in TVM) Why include a fairly straightforward sex scene with a few cloaking age scenes? It is poisoned with the rest of the film, and perhaps in 1969, some 20 men have been given headaches in women. I probably say because the film seems to be looking at a sharp market with the advent of young people, and those teenagers will probably be indifferent to the historical and social perspectives of walkers on the Moon and Woodstock. In other words, the attempt to move towards Munn tried to attract a lot of listeners, but perhaps none of them would apply
