I saw this photo "Exciting Desh Noveles Picture The Jopon" in Paris two weeks ago. Although I did not expect much more than that, I would like to say that I was disappointed like many people in the audience ... If I want to feel like how I felt, I would say I'm comparing it. Princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's silly. But I could not help it. The story is quite different, but the world in the illustrated world is very similar. And from this point of view, "a tree of Palermo" definitely can not compare with Miazaki's Masterworks. Even if it's technically good enough, Borodam finally ... I do not even recommend you take care of it due to its complete lack of originality. I got it 10 out of 2 (somewhat harsh, I guess it's 3 or 4)
