I have to be the point and point. This film is not all good. The film buff frames the acting, script, story, direction and almost all editions. Amanda Pitt has proved that he can work, because he was the tallest place in The Hole Nine Yard. So he avoided this image with ten foot poles. However, my child's section thinks this picture is very funny. If you can forget at least the quality of production, and if you think funny jokes are funny you must be correct. And those of you who can not stop your pedestal, your choice. My inner child did not die, and I smiled a fair bit. Yet, only 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really bites.
