Unfortunately, the film was very prominent, it was different because of weak / impossible story lines, miscasting, and a lack of content / materials. One of the most obvious flaws was San Connie, who played an Arab man, could not pronounce his Arab name! It may seem a small error but it indicates the current lack of effort to pay attention to detail. The average of the acting quality was down well below the mean. <br /> <br /> The hero of the movie, saving grace was very final in the plot! And a French song (I do not recall the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie where Shan Connery was visually obscure.
