It's the most painful film I've ever seen but it's watchable in all fairness and rather fun. I do not think the filmmaker intended it as your ideal Hollywood blockbuster quality. This is about a serial killer, only a stupid film that drops in a load of poisonous wastes and the snow reacts with it (it is in the middle of the winter). Then he turns into a killer snowman which is enough to make you laugh on yourself. This picture is really stupid but it's funny. The killers are joyful. I do not advise you to go and buy it (as I've done - it's great to cover!) But if it happens on TV in one night and you're laughing then keep it.
