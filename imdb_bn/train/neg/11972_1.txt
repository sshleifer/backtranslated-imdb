The first ten minutes of "Just Link" really point to most of the film's direction. Lenny (Ryan Maryman) is a 14-year-old boy living in New York in the '50s. He had a burning desire to see the sexual intercourse between two men. He thinks who is the best man? Well, of course his own mother and father! Unfortunately, for Leny, she was seen before, and she was sent away to stay with her uncle and uncle uncle for the summer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife sexually However, the wife is quite pregnant and they are not currently sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. Most of his daughters and his friends hanging around spend their free time. They have a small club where they all sit near and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not a harmless, sorted way in 1950. I do not have any idea in any way, but I've found it malignant to talk about masturbation, thinking and anal sex to these kids. The kind of excitement can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but this picture seems to be just distorted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lenny's carnal desire. Jason Alexander needs to stay away from the director's chair as far as possible. "For good or bad" (1996) was awful and now this is happening. What a waste 1/10
