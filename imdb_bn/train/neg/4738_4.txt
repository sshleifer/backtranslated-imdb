I love the original Azumi in the live action monga, the fascinating storyline, the cool soundtrack, the direction (kitmura stone!), Editing, performing and completing the whole part, not to mention the beautiful Ayaya Uye, So I was really looking forward to Azimi 2, but finally I think I've won Lotto and lost the ticket: (Azumi has picked up two where Ajumi has gone, but they are completely different from 2 different movies.) Slowly, the action is exciting and as well Not like the dance form and there is not much of the character development, it is apparently guided by the same person that Taooo is also the giant fry Due to the reduction in the quality of the diversity (if it is possible!). I agree with some other past critics, who say that this is a lost opportunity.If this installment continues with the rouche kitamura, but some beautiful Japanese forest scenes are seen when slow The speed of action takes place and we are very briefly killing all the bit characters who are quick to kill even real boys. Very simple fight with the Spider-Man in the Bamboo jungle. A memorable war scene with a Spider-Man (A monkey episode!). Varanas 1 was a climatic war scene with the effects of our barrel camera, Ajumi 2 has brought us a crazy cam! ! At last, the violence of Azimi was disrespectful, but the Aya still does a good job. She looks great in Cape ... but where did she come from? I do not think I will see him again! ... what a sad expression
