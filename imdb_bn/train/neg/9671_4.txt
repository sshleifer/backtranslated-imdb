I will never be able to give 6 or 7 in Progaganda film because it shows when and how it is successful during the campaign. If there are people who look at this piece and think "Well, but Jews certainly did something for their behavior on the WW2", then the movie is very cleverly 'why and how' and how a man is lying on the horizon. What can target a campaign movie? For example, the section that is included in the American film about the Rothschild family is used here very impressively. Why is not the question asked to keep away from the Jews its wealth officer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Objective and promotional requirements. Visitors will be happy to express gratitude at the time coming ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a simplicity that shows the most basic psychological perception of viewers. The film is like today's history, so it does not really need to do much about it. However, in this simplicity of the words of ethnic degradation, the cautionary may find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization and integration problems. Overall, fine trash.
