I am very happy with foreign films and I understand what they are trying to achieve even though some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this picture were annoying. I often thought about how attractive it would be to create a movie that shows a specific date or time which is not actually a point. Now I have seen a movie which I will not be thinking of with that line. There are tones about society, racism, and some desirability ... but the South Park is there. And when I look in the South Park it actually drives me to feel passion. After the first five minutes I felt the emotions in this movie. I usually rate seven or more movies because I love each film the most. I gave this photo one.
