This is a low budget "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new employee in a specially unnamed office, where she meets and starts her colleague "Chris". During a hot tea-party, Chris and his friends were pleased by Madry that they were in the "Murders Club" where everyone killed someone for kick. When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, then herbs are made. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good and there is a need for this style and budget level (nudity, gore, probably slightly bigger than cast), however, after the credit roll, you ask yourself why you see it in your 80 minutes Have lived the life.
