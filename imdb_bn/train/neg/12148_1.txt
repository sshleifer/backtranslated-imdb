Sincerely, who gave this movie to God's name is a 8.1 rating ?? I think those who made or acted in films actually voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or perhaps the student, film. I saw a movie fan, and horror movie, but here literally nothing was released. The stories and the acting were the worst I ever seen. The use of toys, airsoft guns, including terrible special effects, where others use as bad as all other. I am bad for all the movies in the movie, but F-Bomb was omitted from every third word and I think we could be the winner for most of the F-Bomb ever used in a movie. The film is depicted using a cheap video camera and not a real movie. I hope this will be a rewards for an amateur movie that will only be shown on the public access stations of the country, but it is not about a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not hire this movie. I can say that it was a terrible waste of free movie rental coupons. This is valuable time that you will not get back. Unfortunately for me, the time lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, please consider this as my warning.
