The plot of this film is not only capable of abducting pregnant women by breaking sweat, but it was a great impression of 'Mrs.'. However, I gave this movie so little rating because it hated me completely. <br /> <br /> I am not afraid of any film makers in any way and have always found love for horror. But this picture went far away in terms of violence and torture to get points on shock factors. <br /> <br /> I think most people hide for the first ten minutes' hide and seek, to find themselves reaching for the remote.
