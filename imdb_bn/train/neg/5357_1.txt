I do not know where to start. Many of the movies on this Saturday, many cheap Saturday, feel that they would come back to the late nineties in the end of the decade. Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's bad digital overlays and really "secret agency" and the word villain is really full of screaming. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there's little continuity now. It seems that some have thrown a bunch of scenes together and have forgotten that it could be a plot. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes when the explosive device in the car of an agent car of many villain trees For some reasons, the device has been explicitly referred to as a "remote explosion" but the bad guys decide to move on its motorcycle. This carries the back. With all the bad guys ridiculous and completely screwed bike stunts all the time. Standing on the bike, doing wheelies and so on. At one stage, a crash occurs and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bicycle (clearly CGI) in the car, but the riders disappeared. Then, after a few seconds the rider and the bike back ... apparently unscathed by the crash. Although an explosive device was installed in the car at this stage, the attackers preferred to shoot the agent during the past driving, then blow up his car. Which is clearly done with CGI. The word is confusing? <br /> <br /> I can say that when I say CGI, we are not talking about CGI link of ring type here. We're talking cheap cheesy power rangers typing CGI, actually I think it will be working well on Power Ranger. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie Savini and Todd I will never know, I can only guess it for money, as a favor to someone or because it has been blackmailed ... Probably the last one.
