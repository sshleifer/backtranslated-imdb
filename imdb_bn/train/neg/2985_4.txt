When I finally got the opportunity to see the 3 zombo 3 (Jumboom Flacheter 2 Europe) in Imperial Zone 2 Japanese DVD, then I went through the entertainment of this zombie epic. The transition is almost infinite, it is good as before, if Ankara Bay can not catch it, but it should be seen. Gore should really stand like this and you can really appreciate the nice makeup and gore fx. The word is very awesome. It only lasts 2 channels, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate Chess Music (actually a very good score), and effective sound effects even though impressions are effective. It does not feel so good and adds excellent transfers to the overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flowed in this film, with the headache explosion, it was very cruel, filled with poisonous mega-pimples, pushing a dead body, killing a woman extremist Did not burn the people)), mynia, zombie children and more I lost track. <br /> <br /> This is especially no doubt for Italian-type fans. Especially the Italian type. Its some nice set pieces and movies available, I think people do not give it enough credit, if you see a clean print, and do not have some awesome pirate copies, it's a complete experience. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give for a second, and I realize it is like an incompatible plot, dubbing is terrific, hard to act, and the feeling of curiosity is celebrated in grand fashion, but it is part of its appeal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best horror movies ever made for me, you can not make it this bad, very good, the movie. It's the highest growing casualty If they smile, it would have been a disaster, but they played it directly as an arrow and the fruit was a terrific classic classic, its nose nose and all the traditional moviemaking values. <br /> <br /> Action sequence tones, external losses, excellent set design, good, sometimes gre cinematography, surprisingly Chess is acting, and inconsistent but still interesting plot, great makeup effect, beautiful women who butt, excellent music, and Sometimes ridiculous, sometimes obscure, but always entertaining zombies. It's all about how you can make mistakes with this movie, a classical classic that stands test of time.
