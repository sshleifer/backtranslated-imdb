College students, who are emptying a reprehensible dormitory, are suppressed by a barbarous killer. <br /> <br /> A mixed bag for Darmat the Dripped Blood (Uk empty) slasher fans. The film's production values ​​are quite low and most of the story is beautiful routine, and there is also a vague left hanging around for a red herring. Actually save up for the story's build up, forgetting one or two brutal murders. But the film is really well-made to its amazing acute measurement (in an atmospheric setting) and absolutely brave, unusual conclusions. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to throw the most part. Stephen Sachs is a lot better as he is a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an unfortunate student. <br /> <br /> All of this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the end is well-tasted valuable and this audience has been saving a whole hu-hum from the movie. <br /> <br /> ** ****
