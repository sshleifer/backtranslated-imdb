This picture is really bad. This is probably harsh, but it's hard. Okay Pop script, each vampire clique is used in the book and there is no sympathy for the main character ... such as All Dracula There have been some really fantastic Dracula / Vampire movies in the past, but it does not make it to the "terrible" slot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Get confusing mess - Dakula 2000 <br /> <br /> I do not really find any good things to say about this movie, as it seems to have not been bad enough in the first stage, but they seem to affect Johnny Lee Miller's English accent ... you Crying ... Well, he's English, but he sounds like American trying to make an American accent. <br /> <br /> All you can tell your money (if you are thinking of buying it), or rent it, check it out, and find out for yourself why it is terrible like Televisibi. <br /> <br /> PS though La La is quite awesome!
