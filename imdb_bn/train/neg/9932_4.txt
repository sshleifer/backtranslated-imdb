Dan Deoria, actor of a perfectly suitable B-movie that created a lot of extra-ordinary silent people in the 1940s, could not do much like this: A young man was charged with the murder of an unexpectedly married singer; When he was executed, his wife decided to solve the case through the help of the husband of the deceased woman. After a fantastic opening shot, Flick quickly settles into the B-movie formula. It certainly looks good, but the Twist finish is colorless and the cast (including Peter Lor and Broaderk Crowford) are just a bit harder. Colonel Wallicht is based on the novel, and is readable for single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** ****
