I got a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I was supposed to have it "Boogeyman II" that it was associated with the original. But you know what they say about "guess": it makes "donkey" from "you" and "me". There is a lot of footage from the original picture of the BII and I read the actress Love's acting. While watching "Boogeyman's Return", I decided to move around to see the infamous death-to-toothbrush scene through the main stage. Before I knew it, the film was over. Slit off I think that I have this BII because it has similar titles in one of BII's alternative titles. Oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Stop talking about my mistakes and start talking about the film's mistakes. Many, many, wrong. Who does this wolf think? He thinks he will really sell different forms of the same movie. There is no up to the original holding Part III. It's basically a flashback from a brain's eye, which is basically a flashback, which gives everything to our event through a wildly annoying game. That movie Oh, and stereo scenes by a death, but you can read off someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to watch again.
