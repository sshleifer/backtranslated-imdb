Stand up. In Twin Cities, one of our stations that shows "Big Bad Movie" on Monday Fridays. Tonight's nuggets were with Kerry Fisher, a movie called "She Back Back", which is a really annoying woman who ends up being murdered when she rushes to her house. Bia (Beatrice) comes back to hate her husband. He wants to take revenge on his killers, so he is "back". And she will not rest until she is there. He continually irritates him ... and the audience, too! This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, though I like bad movies (my favorite movie Janangeo). I really shook my head across the whole film, thinking I thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Beta is just so annoying. The plot is stupid; The acting is bad; The story ... Well, you get my drift. However, if you really want to see a bad movie - really really bad movie, make a check out of it. You will not be disappointed. Oh
