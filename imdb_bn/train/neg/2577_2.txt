This story was a different angle that energized me, unable to buy previously seen VHS sight. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> There was no great story - the critically ill people in the hospital and their different personalities - with incredible characters, became very unexpected snake opera. <Br> Our "blosses" (William Forsyth) is a stereotype racist white person, which is f-word in every sentence and is so disgusting that she did not give her first name in the movie. She is so much fun to be around. Then, "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipps), a fast-talking female woman. Snipes certainly prefer the fastest "hip" arrogant role because he has played a number of them, such as "white men can not jump." Then Helen Hunt played "Anna", a nice caring, loving person who is related to adultery in the film's main character, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Staltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, this is heartfelt, feel-good type of material. It just makes my heart dissolve in watching this nice folks. However, if you like the rhetoric characters described by idle people in this shameless film, but if you really like it ... you can really like it! Add a dose to the political purity of Hollywood and you go there! What else could be?
