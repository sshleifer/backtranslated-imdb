Casey Affleck is very talented actor and I'm not saying he owe his work. I was willing to have more movies that show her talent. Saying, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. very bad. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have kept almost all the faults in poor script. Affleck's very talented actress, Wes Bentley has done outstanding performances of American beauty, Melissa Shejmila has done well, and now Elisa Dushko is the daughter of Hollywood. I do not think the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. Saying an overstatement that this movie belongs to the horror series. It twists and launches you will expect, but they do not lead anywhere ... without further confusion. I have found the very last climax, because it does not seem to be a sense or any real answer to the real questions I really answered. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a better review, but I can not do it. In all the facts, the only thing that seems to be scary about this movie is that you paid for it.
