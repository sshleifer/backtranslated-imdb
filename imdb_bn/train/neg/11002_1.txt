Hunked as the greatest movie of all time, everyone guarantees to offer - what do you think? It works, I am disturbed that we made the money to pay rent. Two friends and I got annoyed and decided to watch the movie that we saw on TV is all true. Curse of the comedy Central and all other networks that push us on this garbage! It was by the worst movie I saw after Hole Man. I usually avoid crappy, but sucked this one. We beat the camouflage, we think it is hired, and the chance of its film picking has been lifted. There is nothing remote about this movie ... even the "Dickman's bravery" scene was also the best. Color P *** ***. It may be worried that the price of production was bad for some important reasons ... no. Just suck. Do not see this! For any reason. This film will not be too much of a lot of illegal material. That's saying ALOT. Please do not watch this movie if you cherish your affection for love of holiness. It's a lot of things - stupid, dull, and a few unnamed. But the main goal was to notice: Objectionable fun - it failed miserably. Thank you you welcomed ....
