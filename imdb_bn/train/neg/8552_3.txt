... just look at the character of poor Robert Weber (great acting, again!) Who tries to wrestle a sub-machine gun from among the terrorists. Everything seems to be a bit wrong in this movie. The biggest mistake in my opinion is that this move was an attempt to take a firm stand of reality in the early 1980's (the fundamental difference between this flash and more spectacular, satirical and therefore timeless die hard). The story comes as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commando. Opinion when a commando screams? Head down "All the good guys do not do it and all the bad guys they can not explode advertising (away with a good conscience), that the main character can not be engraved down by gas masked commando even though she wear the same clothes and carry arms from the arms It seems unlikely and makes it difficult to take the movie seriously, and it's just that it's more than funny <br /> <br /> I do not think of the criticism of the sinister movement, the shield and the peace for the wrongdoers, controversy between Shahbagh and settlers, and even the representative of power, the film is not a political comment but rather Long and unknown, this movie is tragic due to the characteristic of Magucie Davis's initial activity. He sees the original bigotry and thinks Ena has done extensive research on this topic. However, his performance was a notch above the others, and I think it is down to him to the movies.
