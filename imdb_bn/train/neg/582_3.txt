Excellent characteristic and insight of human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which still strongly imitates today's day. [<br /> <br /> For the film ... Ah. Nothing special Cameraman was definitely an unfortunate addiction and was busy with circular and circular surroundings, making the audience quite annoying. That's why the director is not a stop for this because I have passed - but perhaps he tried very busy, and thus failed to draw good performances from the extraordinary but inefficiently-acting actors, in no way failed. All in all, a weak orientation. Your three hours will read well (or re-reading) books.
