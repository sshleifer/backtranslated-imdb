This is a piece - T !! This t.v. Made worse than looks for. Movie And I thought that a single sequel was even loyal and the result was ... fighting is better than this. Jean Claude venerated shame as she did it again and wondered why she is now in her career. No scripts, no stories and no time should be wasted in this. I mean that. 1 out of 10, too much, too much way. Goldberg should be jackhammered for this. Van shame no actor
