Inspired by African African American Scrooge inspired by modern, struggling cities, there is nothing in this film. Here, Miss Scruz is a rogue banker, who actually receives the benefits of poor and black neighborhood employees and customers. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. One part of the problem is that the story roots do not translate well into the film's urban settings and the script fails to perform the update. Also, constant messages about sharing and distribution are so repeatedly repeated, that the audience is tired of it before reaching their familiar end. It's a messaging movie that does not know when to leave. In the title role, the gifted Cesley Tyson gives an extra extreme performance and is sometimes difficult to understand in the line. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted many times, despite this very relevant message, it is a struggle to adapt to a way that makes it fresh and relevant.
