I was one of the few liberalists shown to show Steve's video. It was a great experience ... campaign and annoyance campaign. <br /> <br /> I hope the film may be a real documentary by Michael Moore of my local school UVSC, but it's an open, slash-and-burn effort to slam the conservative and local religious community. It is sure that a filmmaker is self-service to create a documentary that reflects only his former ideas on the subject. <br /> <br /> More surprising to see all '10' votes posted on his homosex Did they watch the video? Galley gate Batman, these are the President of the rank of men! Their rating is as clear as the bias of this film. Yes, IMDB will help Lam film like a stacking vote. Maybe my vote will help this balance.
