As much as I can be honest, The Devils Playing (or Ville of Blad or Vampire Exstiate or Black Bowl Curse or ????) is a complete bore. Is there a good basis behind the movie ?? A group of women wearing black clothes helped and resurrected a long dead vampire through a descendant body through support ?? But the execution is horrible. Great when there literally nothing happens, there are long moments during the screen. The characters just stand beside nothing. There is no mystery, no mystery, and no plot points about care. Acting is simply unrealistic The average group involved below is a group of nervous dance while staring at most acting cameras. They do this again and again. And this little plot seems to be designed to get more than the naked nude than the designated women. It is not bad or vain, as it is a tragedy or a plot of death, but it stops.
