There is no movie like a group of friends who do not hate each other by hating each other, but they have no freedom to convey * like or listen to them like any other audience. Films are so bad that they are good (an Ed Wood Wood or Todd Slater film), and only plain bad (e.g. Uwe Boll's "work" 99%). Even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g., mystery science theater 3000), this movie is just tolerant. Thankfully, I'm talented (although my mind always works) for me who are not naturally talented in the ruffing of Mastie, eventually * in this * film you just want to pull your head, "nevertheless" the film is painfully informed, about an hour and twenty minutes You'll never come back in Even my MSTie genius was barely a match for this slow, annoying waste time. The most annoying aspect of this movie is that anyone * has green-lighted and / or financed ... I simply paid the talented Amber Benson "Tabu", who clearly made the film Blackmail. I got her less known movie in my rental queue, the review that I want to read well. Wonderfully the best part of the film was its dominant laboratory palace for its interior position.
