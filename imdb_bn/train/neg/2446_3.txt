Rajkumar Santoshi directed the movie as the biggest movie and the biggest box office hit of Indian film without any doubt. <br /> <br /> This movie star is short of all expectations. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar are two great actors like this movie star and when <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Movie is not the best character development plus cinematography, and should tell Bollywood that visual effects should be used only when needed. It should be done with a high budget applicable. The script was such a mistake that calls the viewer to appear on his phone rather than calling a movie. <br /> <br /> New Kumar can hang on the leg well but the law can not do well but where the movie is wasted big time, Storline Screenplay and Scene <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of multi-star flop movie then check it out.
