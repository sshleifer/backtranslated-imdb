I can not believe that Munshi City is so hard to concentrate that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show. This show is like to face the real hard working law enforcement officers. Never before in my life was so stupid in my life. If they pay the bill as a comedy, it will be a matter, but it is not a lie to say reality. I only saw it once and saw that I was scared. I wanted to see the little guy standing with the bad guys. What is that a joke? There was nothing in the real world of the event. Munshi city, police chief, and all officers should shamefully hang their heads and they never want them to come from that city. Wonders do not roam TV!
