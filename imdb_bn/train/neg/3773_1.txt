When people ask me that I've never seen the worst movie. It's not even close to the level of MSST3 level, the dramatic play is in the theater, even the Disney Channel swells late at night. The only time I did not close the Dick Tracy jacket Mannuein to stop Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios) in this case, it would be torn apart, and the touring guides are called "Eat this! Eat this dirty coat of darkness! !!! " I'm not so crazy in the movie, even "Nutty Professor II: The Clams" or "Flash Gordon". Do you like beautiful colors and cinematography? Do not baby here. Critics say, "Oh, but it's like a comic book", well, to me, it's a few weeks after the sunny day of the gordato. About me as very enjoyable Bitches circling around this neighborhood and talking to their watch, myself, and other actors occasionally, someone would expect him to start shooting at any time. To be fair, I once saw this movie, but my pain is a human of threshold, not a god.
