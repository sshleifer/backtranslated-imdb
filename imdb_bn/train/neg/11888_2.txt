To create a movie about the supposed end of the world, there should be some information and reality 1. We never said why these people believe in it. 2. Location Toronto is the new year Eve in Canada. So please tell me why in the middle of some of the why (based on costume), it was like in September <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was in the neo-non-natural style, it needed a director who knew how to know it. <br /> <br /> 4. The pieces of the separate story were all dreary and without any purpose. I could go, but I do not want to be annoying as this film. <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 IMDB Scale <br /> <br /> Thank you always <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
