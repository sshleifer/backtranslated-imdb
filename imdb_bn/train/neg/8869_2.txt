The Swedish film industry with the release of "Farligt f√∂rflutet" has really hit the bottom of the rock. Stefan (Jens Hulton) spent a quiet life with his wife Mary (Regina Lund) last year. One day Steven's old friend agreed to ask him. Stefan has to do a small courier job. He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroin through the Swedish-German custom. Unfortunately Germany does not work as a thing plan and Stefan is in big trouble now. It's always good to see a Swedish movie that is traditionally broken by tradition-drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in production do not have any formula about which film is supposed to be written, the painting or cutting out of the results can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: Bad acting, an incoherent plot and stupid dialogue. The only brightness of the movie is incredibly beautiful Rajina Lund's unknown sex scene. It lasted for just a few seconds after being kept in purity for about 90 minutes, let's say it really, crap.
