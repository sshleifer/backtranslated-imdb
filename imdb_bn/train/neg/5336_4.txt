This movie is not very good. Actually, it was the worst Elvis movie I saw. It has very little conspiracy, mostly sharing, beer drinks and war. Barnes Meridith and Thomas Gomez have been destroyed. I do not know why they did this movie. You can say that Elvis was broken apart as well, he is much more, "follow that dream."
