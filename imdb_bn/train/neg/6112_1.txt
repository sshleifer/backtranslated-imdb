I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected many actions. Since the application from New York to Germany had a rating of 16, so I entered the film as Falcob. It was very annoying. Later, I realized that this husband only shows her husband. I mean this to you through the internet today and you pay for instant access. It's more than 20 years ago, but I'm still wasting my time with this anger. This is a soft-porn for school. Bo Derek undressing and coloring her paintings - Excellent. But then they should name the film undressing the name and its painting.
