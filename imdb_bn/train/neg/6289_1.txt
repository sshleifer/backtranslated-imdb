This is the most cliche-ridden and most romantic comedy I've ever seen. Each scene deserves cringe and two main actors - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corrie was too stupid and naive and Danny did not hear the false promise. <br /> <br /> Naked Campbell and the killer of the urban legend is the only freedom fighter in this poor effort of a movie. Danny (Dean Pars) in her twentieth century and the girl is trying to go to bed - she looks like she is still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia this picture is called Smooth; Everything about this film is smooth. Avoid 1/10
