My kids have been forced to watch it for at least 10 times for the last two Christmas months, I've got enough qualifications to judge the classic version of Dr. Seis and it's good ... it's not very good. First off, Chak Jones's animated TV can be difficult for anyone to follow the classic act, but this explanation is so heavy and handled that is positively flexible. I acknowledge that there are some inspired mess, but overall the film closes as cash in cash, simultaneously reducing the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carey is at the top, but with the Greenwich character it's completely weird. As portrayed by Boris Karloff, he was burning slowly; Systematic and intelligent. There is no way of carrier's madness, and it has only been made the most obvious error. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tomber and Christine Barnesky have been completely destroyed here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins did any role (like his countryman Michael Keaneen), but it is necessary to file these "films that should never be made". It does not bode well for a hat cat, a thin toe that prepping for the public this Christmas. I feel that I would recommend the same to him: avoid it, and read the book or watch the TV special. This 2 hours you can never get back
