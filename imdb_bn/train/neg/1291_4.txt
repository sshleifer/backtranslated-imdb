I am sad because there is a time in history that is so attractive and so rich for film, it can be made in the Hu-Hem event. Wm C Quantrill may be seen in the movie, probably the most intimate image of this period. Frank James never mentioned, Cole Yuger, Dieto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who was crying while leaving his murderer in battle, he was completely missing in the script. Instead, we were forced to see imaginary characters that we never developed any person. Sad The costume was wonderful, as was the location shooting in Missouri. I hope that Lee will make another film in this era and try again, or any other filmmaker will enjoy a lot of resources to play on the screen.
