This is another scandal piece related to breaking WWII code, stealing, etc. This performance is about what the MGM "B" actors can expect from this cast. <br /> <br /> One big caution The first two flash Gordon serials have played a great role in playing very sexy Dale Ardene, but Jean Rogers is just awesome in this movie. His character is very annoying. She absolutely does not give up with her overacting. We believe that during the era of a world war, there will obviously be the Top Topic Code, even if it has an official function, it will be allowed to pop in and out of any office of its choice. I am sorry that I saw this movie from this perspective. It has forever changed the perception of my Rogers. Gifted, he is an extreme light weight. <br /> <br /> Limon is his usual self, which means he is just enough. <br /> <br /> <br />
