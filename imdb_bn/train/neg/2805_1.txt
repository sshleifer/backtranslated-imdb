This adaptation is positively a subcategory which is in love for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has no idea of ​​Rochester's different ideas. I felt that he had never read the book, he had quieted it in a very strong crisis and sent a letter summary that was "Gumpi, Brody, Mykurki Past". He is not Rochester as a character or a real personality, but like a leading group who never smiles, until he is impressively transformed into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only realization that this adaptation was excited in me was the sympathy and sympathy for Charlotte Brontë, who in most cases banned her. Go and go ahead in the book. Rochester is a private one. And by the way: A "passport" means love discipline means you will not eat her face.
