The film has been dedicated to TL's movies, the first is a milestone, and the second best-known film Disney has been made, and now I'm writing an animation, voice work, music, but I do not dispute this. TLK is more of a Timon / Pumbaa screwball in the atmosphere. Although it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is a big joke ... and it's about who stores it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! There is potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
