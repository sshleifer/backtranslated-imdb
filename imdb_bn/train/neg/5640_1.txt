I had a huge willow Duffo fan, and really wanted this film (I had to get it in a Region 5 Chinese DVD!). But, it's actually a bit bad that I've seen. <br /> <br /> acting (without dope) terrible. Both Dofo and Colagrande wrote and directed (although they did not submit to the director), and there is no intelligent talent for writing or managing them. (Stay away from bewildering; Zia is out of business, please!) <br /> <br /> Of course nothing will happen. Except for a completely abusive series, without the complete credible motivation, these two people (who are only seen) work in this house. Coalgard's sleep, I could not at least change the lesser expression. And sexual scenes are cruel lame. I actually cringed twice in between them. Isha! They definitely do not have at least bit lover, and yet the only time you are putting the film to sleep is not. Then, it's busy bothering you. <br /> <br /> Just awful
