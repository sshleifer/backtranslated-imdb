This will be the worst side I've seen. Close-up can be a very strong shot, but when there is nothing except close-up in each scene, it will lose all its effects. <br /> <br /> There is a very nice view to work with Tony Scott, the retreat of Mexico, the canteen, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn resides, and starts a journey to retaliate to the dusty city Costa. Unfortunately, before moving to a big, giant-headed picture, we keep an eye on these places quickly. Transit scenes that are driving coaster across Mexico are quickly closed. <br /> <br /> The score is more dramatic and cruel, which we think should indicate every emotion. The story itself should be managed much better. Among other things, many people pop out from somewhere to help with the coaster - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a common thriller story, but many have taken the same compound and have done something extraordinary with it. Costa Rica was somewhat similar story, but it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> The end was completely anticlimactic and was suffering from the most composer scores in the film. This movie has never been a great one, but if we look much more in Mexico and look at the huge head, this movie can be visible.
