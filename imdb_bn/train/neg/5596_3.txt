A group of models are looking for an apartment to live, and it is shown by a local real estate agent. The model and the agent are unknown, however, in the apartment of "Hell Threathold" and when crossed, the giant "dethman" is called to kill everyone on his way. The story of Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of murder, is said to be. <br /> <br /> Although I am a low budget, microbetgett and champion of independent films, I can not appreciate this movie. The makers are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor is proud of his performance skills DVD, but I can not wrap my head. If you perform an extra one or two hours in 24 hours, what will be the difference? And why can pride be made because of pride, irrational and innovative behavior? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The dialog is definitely advertising-free because no written authors such as empty fiction can bring it. The agent also does not know anything about housing ... he concentrates in a home, which nobody can take care of, incorrectly explains the heat source (does he not see the radiator?) And say that the fatal problem will be solved when they call "terminator" . Please, write a script - some deviation is good, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> Why are girls modeling going? Their employees had no point in plot, and this seems like an obligation. At one point an actress broke the character and said something about the effect of "Dude, they are going to be uncomfortable", which seems to be more natural than any other line, although the other place is out of place due to other bad conversations. <Br> <br /> The monster made no sense. I commended the effort to explain how "the threshold of hell" will go to random places in the world (including random fireplaces), but why not explain the monsters? There is a man involved in his background, whose love is killed by another man. How does this make you a giant? (Why did we need this Victorian flashbacks without any dialogue and outlook throughout the field?) It's over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dramatic break in line was awful. Sam Bishop's character was far away, with interviews far behind. Each question needs a break, a funny face and a response ... a break, a funny face and a response followed? I was very frustrated. To me, the only point was to pull the time ... but I got 30 minutes better delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and then walked around with the same credit twice). <BR> <br /> Who was the character of Sam Bishop? He has seen these and accused of killing girls, but he was never in the story with the girls yet. How did he see them? And if he did not, how did he kill the goddess? And if he does not see the goddess, how does he know the soul of the apostolic Apostoles? I was lost so much ... when it was written there was an outline for a plot? <br /> <br /> The only part enjoyed in this movie was a view of bathroom models. It was not really important or something, but I was given only to break from the annoying. I wonder what director Felix Diaz thinks. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his obscure game), but I am surprised by his film making skills. However, the best part of the DVD was the trailer for its "Superhero Excellcher" (only the trailer was better than this whole waste). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I have to be so strict. I want to think that this movie can test what can be done within 24 hours, or just a test and idea could never make a quality movie for fun. But if "Superhero Excelsior" gives an indication, then Diaj can create quality ... so why did he choose to avoid it? Probably the world will never know.
