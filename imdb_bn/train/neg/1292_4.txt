OK .. It was not the worst movie I ever saw, but I heard a lot of good things and I was very disappointed. I found out where the filmmakers came from and they are trying to express the fact that both sides were not different from each other in this war, who was defeated in battle etc. . (Well, this is my idea, however = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Any kind of movie annoyed me. I've seen a really big movie, but it just pulls upwards and much more. Basically because I could not take care of myself for the characters. I was just thinking ... who is caring ??? I get acting, rather than being a dead pan and spreading dialogue. I realized that it was 1800 and all, but most of the conversations seemed just irrelevant. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "romance" in this story does not seem to support anything else "I'm a guy and you are a girl" I do not think much, and I still feel that these people are being believed in love. Oh well .. I guess it's completely "this horror around us, we're stuck in each other" type thing, or whatever. I was hoping for some kind of dynamic among the two best friends (both of whom were initially interested in girls) but that was just sorted. Maybe avoid a cliche love triangle. I do not know <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt is the only character I really like. And everything written in Su Li was well. I just did not dislike Jack, but he felt a little ... fool, I guess. Jack Bull I do not care for all. And I'm sure that you are not supposed to hate everyone else, except for the poor ordinary people who just bow down and right down. It was quite a graphic and the whole thing was "the horrors of war", but I saw many movies with the same theme, it was good. (I've enjoyed a lot of patriotism, for example, even if it was somewhat emotionally manipulated) but, as I have already said, I'm a cruel one. Can i say :)
