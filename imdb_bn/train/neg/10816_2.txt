Oh exactly what I need, another movie about the 19th century England. That's just as good as in England, not just the broken football stadium. In this beautiful setting of Lord's, Dame, and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsberg, walks continuously as Jane Eyre from the novel that no one has read voluntarily. Jane usually tries to teach Mr. Rochester to the French girl, where she is always seen to see empty chalkboards. One day, Mr. Rochester (the auto-pilot William Hart) falls in love with Jane and all this, but the matter of his wife's wife is still stuck, which is locked on the attic. Oh, it was not in the brochure. Some people throw around and fire with some caution (probably they rent the set), the film finally comes to an end. Everything looked really authentic, that's something I guess. But then again, no.
