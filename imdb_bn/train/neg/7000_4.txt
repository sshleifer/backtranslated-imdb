The house of Hollywood, popularity, glamor, and profit search is seldom ruled by spiritual values, and it is astonishing that the efforts to investigate spiritual life are thin and often shameless (far better to go - in Bresnan, Dryer, Rosellini, and Bergman films for exploring the art of spirituality). "Odd cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure films, love stories, and religious instincts make it bitter for many insights that try to communicate. An image of evidence and salvation matches Verne (the most playful and self-related as Clark thinks) and Julie (Joan Crowford, Snelling and Hard Dames throws all the other tries to try as queen) is the best ridiculous. Does it match up before the war against the star system sponsor St., MGM before sending it to many dreaded slavery? But then . Here is a good supportive performance, and apparently the moment of arrest: Shadowy prison barracks; The boats escaped by the light of the moon, or the painters against the cloud scene; Julie wind whips up as you walk along the seafront; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter LÃ¶hr) are entitled to Verne's independence for the fury of the storm; An unusual ennobling gay prison romance in two convicts. . Above all, Paul Lucas's honorable and isolated performance is like Hessler, who is a murderer who can appreciate the qualities of Kumburu, yet he also comes behind him. At the most arresting time of the film, Hessler left Cambrow, standing outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, I see the shadow on its face, which reveals a moment of fear and confidence. Then she exits at night. At this point, Hessler has gained the ambiguity, depth, and power of existence that does not lead to any other character achievement. What is the deepest sympathy relationship with Hasler, the mystery of this movie?
