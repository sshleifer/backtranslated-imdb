I fully agree with critics critically reviews of the variety that the film is not funny, animated or insensitive about the creative process because its proof is guaranteed. Naturally it's dirty and the light is really problematic. The film is supposed to run the character, poor lighting does not improve performance and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expression of the actor. Many non-South Africans will find it difficult to follow the spoken English in the film and local humor will be lost in this process. I saw this photo at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. The comments and reactions of the movie begin with the welcome statement from the film about our painful past. Unfortunately Bonnie Chaw will not be regarded as the light of the New Wave of South Africa, but some of our extraordinary films in racism history will be rated at our best in our 110 year old film history. It is no wonder that the film is only about two weeks after its release and most of Durbaan and Gouteng's movies have disappeared from the movies in Cape Town. It has explicitly limited appeal to South African audiences.
