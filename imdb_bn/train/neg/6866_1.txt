This movie is so small than the strangers on the train or even in an accidental meeting in this case, despite the plot equality, I can not really compare it with it. The character of Yancy Butler came across such a Dopi Demweet, I feel very embarrassed to see the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy many lifetime movies, but now I feel obliged to see each one. In the interest of promoting homework in the house. I am often silent, but this photo strongly bothers me loudly, walking around the house and roaming around the house, hunting myself more torture before returning to my usual favorite chair. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
