Anyone who does not give much to anyone in very poor efforts, but is a hardcore fan of Stanley Tuchi who tries, but our leading person can not save the weak structure, dialogue, direction, or talent. <br /> <br /> This plodding story of a naive new seller for a hazard company is the only trick, there is its quirky side letter. But without a realistic backdrop, such characters are vain. <br /> <br /> nothing to see here, keep moving <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
