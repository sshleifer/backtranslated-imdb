The moment you give an 'art film' 1/10, your people are spending your senses, half-ass-ed, artistic obstructions for blood. I like an unknown 'classical classic' or a 10 'strange classic' classic movie, or mention how I do not spoil the list of 'Art House Movies' and I'm not a pretty challenging disaster. I say that someone explains the purpose, purpose and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here's how I will summarize the summary: Three related related legends related to the urban legend are being opened, the incident. Following it (below, you save 3-hour pain): The host of game shows caused by lung cancer tried to patches things with his cock-addicted daughter, when she was raped or not had a child, and the relationship With the problem being courted by a bumbling police officer, the game show's star competitor decides that he wants to be a failed child prodigy No, the fate of the game has been another 60-year-old contestant, now we can see that with the need of money for a braceender with a braceender and 'corrective oral surgery', when the producer of the game show himself dies of lung cancer, Asking male nurses to help him keep him with the son who was abandoned many years ago And a woman who later became a teacher of surrendering, even m. The producer's second wife suffers from guilt for cheating with death; And oh, finally, it's frog rain (you read properly). And I think you are incredibly long and unmatched, literally charming together, without any rhythm or reason, each character probably does not come for any shade or scene, to ensure that the film crosses 3 hours and the 'Modern epic' <br /> <br /> You probably think that I could do a good job in summarizing the movie (and instead of confusing you) if I wrote the vague thing more consistently, maybe instead of just a few words ... well, now you I know how I think.
