Anyone has written a "nice" post about this guys, these guys have been a friend. It's also bad for backyard wrestling. In fact this is not even the backyard wrestling, it is a trumpolin hit few boys in each other. Each of the boys is about 45 pounds wet and does not have an ounce of entertainment value. It is only possible to have some annoying children, even if it is possible, even a bad name in the garden is also given. If you want to see some recreational backyard wrestling, the pain behind the exercise is a joy. It is named BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Pryhishon's 2 biggest stars These boys are good They actually went from yarding to it and had professionally trained as "real" pro wrestlers trained. They went legit and have gotten well. I recommend checking out those 2 guys. MDogg insane and hook off So this crappy DVD does not waste your time or your cash, there are "good" back in the yard video.
