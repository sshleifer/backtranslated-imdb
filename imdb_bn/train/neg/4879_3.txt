Something bad than a comedy movie lacking in humor? The answer is yes; The picture that fails to generate any interest across the picture. The project is not very bad - a helpless front man for an illegal business - but it's a potbly with a poor script and screenplay and it does not work. <br /> <br /> Was it considered a good 'B' 1942? It's hard to imagine The only positive aspect of the film is several well-known faces of '30 and 40 ', such as Warren Heimer, Vince Burnett and Robert Armstrong (I always think of Richard Cromwell as weak who killed Gary Cooper as "the life of Bengal lancer", so I count him Did not do). <br /> <br /> You can not recommend it and give it a rating of 3 - If you like the root canal.
