Rent it last night. Inauguration (2001) runs very WAAAAAAAAAY. Hitchiker view service no purpose. Some skits were just opposite. I knew earlier that Cherie Chase was for less than 2 minutes. There is no problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> Koko, Uranus, Babas Commercial, Curtis Muffield Music <br /> <br />: 75 minutes to 7 minutes of good element of the movie <br /> << br /> <br /> I give you some advice: If you want to make an unreal movie movie and movie movie, rent "kontouki fried movie". If you want less and less movie films and movies for spoofing then "Mumin America" ​​or "UHF" <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not get bothered to rent this movie . You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Why Shapiro's Best Movie Still "Modern Problems"
