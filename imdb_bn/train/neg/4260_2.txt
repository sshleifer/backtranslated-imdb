Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently to stop the movie. It was terribly boring, and most of the rocks around the mountain randomly with no visible direction. Then the hero comes in the picture. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Of course white. She was not even passing for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was very confusing, and because the story did nothing to help. Futile war sequences and lame dialogue. It was an hour and forty minutes long, and in the end I was trying to eat my own face. I have seen it because the people in the video store where I work always ask me that this movie is a good one. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. "No, good God! No! It's fierce! Do not do it for yourself! I'll recommend another movie, perhaps an entertainer."
