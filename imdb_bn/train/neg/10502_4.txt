The movie has different story lines that follow different different characters. The lines of different stories do not seem to be a complete piece that makes this comedy very inconvenient and sometimes it is annoying to see. <br /> <br /> It may be weak and cliche, but it is true; The best way to visit the Crocodile Hunter series on the discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more delightful than this movie. I'm sure both cast and crew have enjoyed so much fun to make this film, but the film does not give much pleasure to our visitors. This is not just funny for a comedy, and Steve and Terry Irwin are not good actors, even if they do not play! Their antics are not only good enough to make a complete film, and their view seems long, confusing and unnecessary and even annoying. <br /> <br /> The movie was quite probable, that means Steve Irwin is a character that is curious to see both curiosity and ridicule, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'Crocodile Hunters', my first reaction was ; Bright! Although the movie suffers from its story poorly and story lines incompatible with unintended and weird characters. The movie has a certain entertainment value, at least once, enough to watch this movie, but of course I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> A waste time to watch this movie. Yet this movie can only be viewed once, when it gets on TV, in the rainy afternoon. It has some good moments but the story line really casts the film and its potential is completely destroyed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
