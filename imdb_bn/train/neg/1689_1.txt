Wow, let's do the total down! The reality is that people think this movie is horrifying. Special effects were "ring." A Direct Rip Off The story What was there? My opinion ... just a bunch of dazzling imaging. The whole picture was a boring, stupid, messy mess. I suppose there is a market for bad films always with good marketing campaigns. However, the worst horror film I've seen in the year. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! Plastic as Barbie and just such talented .. Do not wait, that Barbie's talent will be an insult! I think this movie was helped by PG-13 in many movie box office, and it was rated, it was an IMO bombing! Stupid movie!
