I'm here again here for your local shopping mall (of course, 'kids at high school hang out !!!!!!), how terrible "Bedy Poh Prome Coreyur" really !!!!!! To prove how bad this trick of a DCOM is <br /> ... we are going to take these four Sumo wrestlers, and they will stuff their photos in the booth. How ... comfortable !!!!! <br /> <br /> Woe! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How terrible? Formula It's so bad, the Disney Channel turns its money away, again, with that exciting yet 10-second promotion, the audience is surprised, "When does this go on ?????" And then, suddenly, when it comes, for one, it did not get higher TV ratings than usual, but it can only be seen once !!!!! Oh no !!!!! One time everyone !!!!! Plus, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, I will not go there any more ... <br /> <br /> I want to smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 0/10
