Actually I do not understand why this movie has made so well here, why Bakhshi did not think it was his best film. I am a big fan of Bakhshi's previous work - especially the 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but he is the true last of the wizards (1977). Then he became the main stream, which started with 'Roberts of the Rings' and then forged 'Fire and Ice' forged with the sword and astronomer Heavyweight Frank Frejetter. <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is animated, the TV quality of animation - I insist that it's worse than its 70's - and the real imagination of the wizards, curiosity, some fantastic background art and underground, adult sensitivity, 'Fire and Ice' is designed for only 14 year old boys Have been, and on Tuesday Robinson Crusoe's intellectual complaint. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like cow books, you can choose it. Although in my view it was a hug on the slide even after 'Wizards', from which Bakhshi never was restored (though he has some recent beautiful TV stuff) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
