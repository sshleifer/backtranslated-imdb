Well, I was excited to download animated open source movies first, only to be destroyed by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the combination of the lips is awful, and you can see that the film is going to understand that nothing is happening. If you feel no emotions for the characters, only the grief for the manufacturers to waste their time. I saw a small film with twice the emotion in half time! This can be a great small film, if they take time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone in Blender is excited to display their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry people make a movie about storytelling.
