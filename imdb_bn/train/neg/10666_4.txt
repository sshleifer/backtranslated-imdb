I would watch most of the 1930s movie fan and the newer Turner classic movies for me. So I gave it a shot, it remained silent on the wonderful Chaplin like Harold Lloyd. After Chaplin I saw Lloyd's silent movies a lot but I have to say I'm bigger than Chaplin's fan. However this picture has become so flat for me that I could not finish it. I understand why his sound carrier was so limited, it did not get very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stogs, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Larel and Hardy Docs boxing spup√©s (or general violence), it's very forgotten. I was interested in seeing Adolf Manzco too because I really enjoyed him on the glorious path, but his role here did not do anything special for me. Perhaps they got it before boxing because at least half of the film (at least it seems) seems like a ring. I can say many Loyd fans here and this is not a popular review issue, but I must determine its rate for what was out there. Do not show any of the 10 out of 10 people trying it out. Choose old movies because they can not see another watch with you again, too flat. For anyone looking for this choice or generally looking for a less well-known comedy, I have recommended "Kelly the Second" a few years ago, others have not played as a comedy of passkey kelly and supporting role with Charles Chase. Both of these turners were shown in the classic movie channel.
