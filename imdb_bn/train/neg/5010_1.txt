Do not waste your time or money on this. Half the modest cast you might think is this tin-thriller, though rarely for a record breaking, can offer a little relaxation for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It will not make you fear, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. It will leave you wondering in the world how you never finished producing this movie. Yes, it's really poor.
