The above supernatural thriller will not be confused with "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a big sister to a movie for me, without giving consistent steps, some critics promised to back back. I felt like everyone hafsing it, and only a few quick cash can make money, because it thinks a lot of things made for TV. Sentinel has reprinted a good film like "Rin of Fire", which has no originality, and Michael Douglas is looking around, I was stupid about my opinion. In addition to its original problem, its main problem was weak speed. I was often confused when trying to watch this movie, I saw how much time was left, once more. Eva is not just wrong with the loungora, who can not remember let's be valuable. <br /> <br /> acting Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, obviously going through the speed. He runs a run, or is not as satisfied as a secret agent. His chemistry was also closed with Basinger. I'm a big fan of Keefor Sucharland, but here he is right, then nothing else. He tried to come across as a garrison, but the other something else managed to be more soft then, and to be honest, he does not seem interested. Eve Logosia Parker is quite middle He did not satisfy his role, and had a pure eye candy. Kim Basinggour is quite horrible as the first lady. He looks tears bored, and his role is a throw away, then something else. Martin Donovan is a big part in the end, but not enough for me. <br /> <br /> below. Sentinel still, another political thriller, that bored my tears. It sucks very old, very tired, and lacks the most important effort. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
