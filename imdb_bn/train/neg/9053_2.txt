Simply, I am the TV show "Mash" trite, preacher, always so, "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and all big sins, and that, is found? That was it (was) incredibly dull. As you lead Alan Elda as the main lead, "(star)", who has so much love for herself and her cleverness, it actually made me uncomfortable to try through an episode. The original series was both Maclean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, whom I would gladly admit that there was a particular patch and style in their character representation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farel both combined exclusively and jointly together with Wonder Bread caviar and eating fresh osters. Loretta Suite, which I became neutral, did not have any blame on her, and there was nothing to be surprised to see, and Gary Barghoff, who was tired of acting and acting out of the looks of the film. I have seen one show in a year. The jammy fare was just a comic lesson "comedy" and really mentioned here is not really mentioned here. Because I was not able to give it a (one) rating, which would be frustrating to read so far, that any rating is not just a subject matter but rather relative. Television, with just a few exceptions, is as angry. In comparatively speaking, the era of Mash and today's (some standard television values) had some production quality and so it deserved both.
