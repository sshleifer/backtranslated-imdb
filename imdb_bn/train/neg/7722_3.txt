The ever-poor action movie was sometimes played by wood dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, which is trapped in a side role which never seems to be in jail. The best average of action, chucked in a bit of nudity and yes Tia Carrera uses a body double! <br /> <br /> Set-up forces the normal renewal police to break the new partner of a common case, the manufacturers try to give a formula to the formula at least, which is laughable with Lundgren's Oriental standards, and the development of the zero-character slicker but the lively city is almost ridiculous , Lundgrens for large showdowns are believed to be believed in the oriental combat outfit. The number of action sequences and li (which the crossover will make pretty) never gives the opportunity to display a particular martial arts brilliance. But he was certainly under the pressure of his great parents, and he did not stay with the father in a very different role in Cro, and he served very well, which shows that he was a unique actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
