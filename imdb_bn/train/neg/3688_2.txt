Naturally, I went to see this movie for A.R. Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not good. With this film, Rajni wanted to finish her movie career, that would be successful. But luckily or unfortunately the film was a failure. After that he delivered an injury with Chandramukhi. I look forward to waiting for Shivaji for her love. <br /> <br /> I read another user's comment in politics. The user is also TN, so I think it is interesting. Rajni is an actor who works, I think, not from her mind but from her mind. He is not the kind of actor acting like Kamal Hassan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .....
