Now I recently got to see the happy comedy Baptist Party, one of my new favorite comedies, until it only hit the movie. So naturally I want to see that it wants to see the same humor, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by American Pie Generation, where it gets destroyed and defeats the purpose of the first film hole. Yes, the first picture has nudity, but it does not show in every single scene. Also the plot is similar from the first, it is not always a complaint with me, but it can be more original. The only thing that I'm happy about is that at least no older actors will not be seen in this movie because it was really chic or really uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are dating only after 2 months, everyone is against it. Melinda is a rich family, but he is very happy with Ron, and Melinder's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will take his job. So they go to Miami for a bachelor's party on weekends and make sure that he will catch Ron in a film that will change his mind about the marriage to Melina. <br /> <br /> A couple here and there, in the Last Temptation, but it failed to deliver what the first film has achieved. These guys, Ron's friend, apart from Seth, were more objectionable than desired, he was funny. Ron and Melinda, the only choice characters apart from Seth, all get your nerve. Do you want to see this picture? Just look at Girl's Wild Wild, it's the same thing that it does not try to pretend a movie. Go to the original bachelor party, this movie will take you to the tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
