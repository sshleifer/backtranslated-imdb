This movie was mostly an hour and a half hour for me. I usually like the cheap horror genre type movie, but this movie was a disappointment. The main error is the lack of creature that creates errors. When they entered the house and found the man, he could take him to the PC. He does not really say anything about anything other than killing his parents, and if I do not miss anything, I did not say how he managed to escape ... It does not mention that it does not give any reason or reason why only living And basically feed the animals after their own death experience. It seemed that he had the chance to go after the "cross event".
