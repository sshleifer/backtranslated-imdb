Any movie in Karen Allen's nude scene and I'm still so annoyed that I can walk, which is frustrating! <br /> <br /> Karen has been stuck in Paris, and soon a sex worker makes friends with the French guy, with whom she is soon to have sex. Of course he married, ("But, cherry, why should it be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of culture (believe it or not) just dull I went outside. <br /> <br /> The movie got better after maybe leaving; But it has to be a lot better for a weak start. <br /> <br /> My suggestion, if you find yourself in this matter, run, do not walk to exit. Save your time and your energy. Most assuredly save your money. It is embarrassing that the production company did not save its money.
