Here some people have compared this picture in some ways in High Noon. Now that is a real extension! I was a big fan of the Senata with some of his acting roles, but perhaps the only person who could play this part was Don Knotts. First off, as someone guided, Sinatra does not just have to build for a Western bad guy wannabe. He is very 'little' at this time of his life. Maybe he was about the same height as Audi Morphy, but Murphy had a pretty strong construction. Saints come as little kids to talk about something which nobody can take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is unclear and is not really trustworthy. I do not want to hide it, but I think the last time and how the dude responds in this story does not give any idea. Another thing, these people are allowed to completely authorize themselves as a 'bad guy'. It's just a small town, so I do not get the attraction and I do not understand why people will affect themselves in such a way. <br /> <br /> There is a 'love interest' in the story and I followed it correctly, when the main character acknowledged that he would not kill such a bad person, he refused to accept then he became very upset. Now there is true love for you. Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name, so he will kill you! 'Ha ha ha Stop, you kill me. Unfortunately, the fundamental foundation of the movie is not good enough, and there is no way to try this story, because no other way can be followed except waste paths. . Want to know why this is not in the video and never seen on TV? Critics obviously banned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is quite bad. I would give Sainta the quota with nearly six things as deep as possible to almost traditional. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a bad west where a city stands against a bad man? Table Rock, or try to pull at Gunpoint - two really, really good with that theme in the west. Johnny Concho Johnny Steinco Frank, you were the greatest singer of all time - but you were not in such a movie.
