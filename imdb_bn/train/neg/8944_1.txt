I saw this movie in the media class last year and I must say I really hate it. I was 10 years old (and 15 years old) to have something to do with him. But this year in English, for 11 years, we had to read the farm by George Orwell. This book is based on the revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I hate it too. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think this was my most annoying movie ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most horrific people to live on this planet. I'm pleased to those who prefer their work, but I do not unfortunately. The film themes were well illustrated, but the way the entire movie was set up and the incident that took place was not my standard. It's just my opinion, and I'm sure many people have enjoyed this movie.
