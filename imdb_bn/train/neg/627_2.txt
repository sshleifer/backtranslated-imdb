O my god This movie ... It was awesome. I'm a huge fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies are bad for other people, I like it. The actor who played 'SquareCro' was amazing, I would say. But this plot was awful. It is made in no sense! It was too much the way of the cow, and an unnecessary (and rebellious) sexual scene was at the beginning. I believe that the director was not trying to get frustrated, but it just became horrific. To add to the cat's waves, they are a plot, the actor (besides 'SquareCro') is horrible, and I care less about them who I've forgotten who was soon to be. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. Anyway, you can avoid avoiding this movie, please.
