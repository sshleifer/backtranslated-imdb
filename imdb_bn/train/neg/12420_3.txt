Not enough just here. There are some fun spots, but not really enough. I was very frustrated because I love stupid movies. I was expecting this to be a hidden gem. It was not. It was a hidden Turkish. <br /> <br /> I was watching this whole time, I was thinking, "Geez, I can do even better than this and I'm a fool." Do not believe a few good reviews. I was suckered by them. Sometimes I laugh loudly Maybe it was fun or cutting edge in 1987 but people, it's flat on today. This movie promised, it just did not provide it. Perhaps if they rewrite it a few more times. I can not blame the actors They were not the best, but they did not have much to work on. This movie failed due to ThreadBar's writing. Very frustrated
