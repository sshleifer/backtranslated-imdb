Anyone who was actually able to sit through this movie and feel like it is a good film that does not appreciate quality movies. The film was insulted to see, the direction was high school film class quality as well as cinematography. The Blair Witch project was good cinematography and I hate that step with a passion! The storyline was likely to be very very good movie, but within the next 10 minutes, it became flat through the rest of the movie. Some have mentioned that this movie was about a child's imagination, all right and fine. But they could do better with this script than they did. I mean, Indian shop. Did the child see the little statue and suddenly imagine the Indian and Vindigo, an Indian spirit? What they mentioned to the shopkeeper and he said that no one works here, but I think it's okay to scary Scratch scene, but then he only rents for the amount of idols and we forget this little boy. It was so long that it became unfortunate. Not only what happened at the hospital's Otis Hospital, but also the feeling of OMG ultimately! Why I Lost My Time During This Time !! This is such a step that I do not recommend to keep an eye on, there are certainly more quality movies that you do not have to insult. Thanks to God, I never had to pay to see this movie, I wanted my money back! For those who gave easy entertainment to this movie .... It is very sad that you reduce your quality of these quality film levels, in fact it is a good movie.
