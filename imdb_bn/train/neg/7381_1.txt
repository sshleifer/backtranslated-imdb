Okay, first stop, Sigal's voice is 50% doped like a film ... why? Because apparently they were rewriting the script and the story while shooting and they would have to change their dialogue for story continuation as a multiple version. Very soon, the overdubs are not only confusing because you just have your scalp, but they do not have any knowledge. <br /> <br /> That said, the story still sucked and did not have any knowledge. When I was finished, my head was punching because the movie was so vague and did not understand at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie lets me stop watching Sigal direct video films because they get worse and worse.
