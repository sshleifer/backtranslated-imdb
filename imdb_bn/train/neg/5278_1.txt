When a comedy movie portrays its amazing soundtrack in the background, you do not know about your behavior with a top notch movie. I hope to share this movie with friends, to get some chocolate, but overall we can have fun with each other, laughing with each other. We could not choose a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few changes with the movie. First off, the comedy was painful. Physical gags are performed and placed poorly. The kid in the movie wants to kill us, blesses us for the scene and the scene, but he is begging like a dog for love. Everything could be bearable if he had pulled from the movie. There was some funny joke, I believe that when someone stole one of the porn movies of the parents of the boys and it faces homosexual pornography. But the best comedy I would say is the opening lip for fat kid. She wear a puke-stained shirt and talk about knowing when something is done. For closing <br /> <br />, the movie editor can save the kid by removing fat kid, cut out 20 minutes out of school scene and end that random bickering ends more than thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> Oh, BTW, there are two good elements that have movies. Kadem Hardenson plays his role nicely and performs his joke so that nobody is missing or grateful. Other releases in the film are the beautiful Mrs. Ali Laundry. His character neglects most of the shameful film. <br /> <br /> <br /> It did not appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 male).
