Yes, it's one of those movies, so terrible, so cruel, so intense that you can not laugh. I saw comedy, good comedy, and laugh less than my wife and I laughed in this movie. Other comments give good enough ideas. Characters are so unpleasant that you encourage fat, the effects are so bad that who you are in charge of the primary school art class, acting - acting - talk about tired conversations and embarrassing breaks. <br /> <br /> But rats, yes, big rats. Why did not I see the rat till the end, rather surprised me. Often the 'big one' is not shown until the end, because the budget limited and the good effects make so much money. But I think, in this case the big rat was hiding in the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that they were such a man who was dressed in woodwork with the scarcity of the third world. <br /> <br />> The most enthusiastic lift section of the whole movie. After finding that the rats can not stand the sound (bad acting) from loud sound, the main child can send a fire alarm ring to the rats. If you ever want to see the wolf of a rat, then the bloody gear goes out of the head like a gear, this film is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> but not more than 99, okay?
