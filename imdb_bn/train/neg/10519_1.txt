I saw many movies and rarely would I rate a movie "1" but this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unreal and the letters were annoying. Usually when I see scary movies, I think it is DUMB when the characters hear a word in the house / forest / school / etc and then shouted "Hello there anyone?" But at least they believe that when they are trustworthy, this movie can not even achieve that right. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that looks like the other spoiler films such as poison and fog academy prize winners. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a waste of time and I can write this comment so that anyone else thinks. This movie will again be watching observers. It's bad!
