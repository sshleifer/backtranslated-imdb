"Meatball Machine" has been one of the most ridiculous, horrific and extremely overwhelming science-fire films I have ever had. It's about good against evil and an upcoming age story, with amusement, in a bloody, sleazy and ridiculous context. Since violence is not particularly dangerous and it does not rebuke you, bloodlessness and nudity are freely driven. I have seen the performance of ECE Takahashi and Toru Tejucu, the worst, if it is not enough, it ignores Yudai Yamaguchi director. It's just this movie, it's bad for the bone, everybody must watch for a B-movie freak !!! ... only: an enjoyable and rare jewel.
