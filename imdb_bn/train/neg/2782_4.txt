Just saw this last weekend movie, I bothered, and frustrated with it. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants come to this country, especially in the former Soviet Union, they bring them with them from the old country and attack and accept what they are going to do for Americans. Which is a very wrong way of showing immigration, and a bad way of telling people about it. That's the main thing Another topic, overall writing, instruction and filming on the amateur level of the village. The actor did quite well, but it does not save this bunch of punk on them. Some jokes were funny, but mostly were bad and chessy. I can not wait to get out of the theater, I want my money back.
