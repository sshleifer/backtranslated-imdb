This is a very annoying film. If you grew up in Vietnam, as I did, then you have seen the footage and the arguments in the picture and have heard about hundred times. But this picture really proves annoying by director Carlton Sherwood. Most of this movie talks with Sherwood on the camera directly in his country's history about this conflict-time timeline. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough in Vietnam, then you 'do not find anything new here. There is no new evidence for the valid evidence of John Kerry or other documentary in Vietnam. Young people interested in this must definitely go to George Batler's excellent film! Honor of theft is clearly meant to be a hat-trick of John Kerry, but it fails miserably to achieve the goal.
