Originally a typical campaign film for a good fight. But there was a couple things that hit me. The first was to use muted epithets. In two cases, Scott character encounters, once in the beginning when he closed his bomb during a bomb blast and once he got a bomb attack pilot ("s *% t"). I could be wrong about the second example but I replayed it many times and it seems like it's me. The third case is that when Anne Sheryli character O'Brien deserves the character and good luck on the neck of the engine engineer ("day" she was obviously very unusual because she's definitely "hacked". I also found a character that was a moral problem with bomb attacks , Especially on civilians bombing. Avuncular superior officer assures him that only due to the accuracy of the bomb attack military The target will be hit, and we are aware of the next strategy of Lemia in order to fire Japan's cities. This scenario is not a bit annoying. I remember Limaye's quote in McCann's "fog of war", this means that if the United States does not win this conflict But he will be judged as the war criminal. The finishing, keeping with the movie, overwrought the way It reminds me of a bit of the end of the White Hit (I'm not comparing movies, end up in the end!) Maybe it's just because 'he gets blown up.
