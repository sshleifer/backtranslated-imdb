Oman IV (1991) for a bad made-TV. Movie As it was more than 80, I suppose that the executors were lying (in the decade of choice in the 90's) because there is no other reason to explain these trails. Why did they bother? A TV Movie? When the idea of ​​this board came, what did they impose on? Did they think for a second that the film will catch up. Perhaps they thought it could create a series? We do not know. But I know one thing. This film is why I have never bought the Omen Quarterly. Instead of excluding this "extra" disk, they should close certain bonuses. <br /> <br /> Owen IV is basically the average American family of the first film. Instead of a graduation nosed punk kid, we get wonderful girl who is brat everyone around her. If the family has a strong parental skill, then there has never been any giant incident in past films. These parents will have to take their feet and make some real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid all costs!
