I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies. If not, then it is very close. Never seen a bad teen soap opera. Well this is one of those who like it. Without the bad For example: (secret speaker) Girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> People: We are all here. <br /> <br /> Girl: But I want to take myself somewhere else. <<br /> <br /> People: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... They are sex while continuing this line. Music bad pop and bad rock rock. If you ever read the book, avoid this movie as a plug-in. They completely alter the character and event personality. In addition, they just get rid of things. Also, the end of the movie ends before the book ends. This is an unprecedented movie. So, if you do not read the book, do not see it. If you read the book, then burn it (movie). If you like that stupid teen soap opera that has less quality than your average low quality teen soap opera, go for it. Then again, should we expect something different from MTV?
