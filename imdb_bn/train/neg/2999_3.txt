Another Friday, the 13th Rifford, even some of his songs! A group of young adults get together for a small high school reconciliation and start to murder a La Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The end is a little more fanciful than your criteria. <br /> <br /> MPA: rated for violence / gender, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug paraphernalia.
