I was interested in this, and fans of Drew Barrymore's dance fans at David Letterman's table just think it's a little more interesting. All right, she shows some breasts (or perhaps a body doubling). The plot bit is slashed and the acting is terrible. Neither the element of the film goes anywhere, nor any material can work with the leadership. Do not waste your time. If you want a vague Drew Barryme movie, instead see Donny Darko, and if you want to see others leave it and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> Dopelgna's legendary treatment is totally criminal. Read Charles Williams novel "Descent Into Hell" for something rather considerable. It is just an excuse to go directly to a B-movie and to spend some time with people in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Does anyone who thinks this performance is commendable? Give me a break.
