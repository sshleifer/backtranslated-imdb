I could never stand on Happy Days after joining the chase Cast, so I knew that the best view of this movie was Scott Bai (Sceneboard Chase scene!) When I was having trouble. Jodie Foster turns her normal professional performance into her first "raised" role, but this is not an excuse for this annoying mess. My life is two hours that I will not get back! No significant characters, incredible storytelling, suspicious editing and awesome cinematography, but worst of all, I did not care less. In the 1970s, the story of the thirteenth century in California, where the children live in unhappy lives and all their parents are stupid Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
