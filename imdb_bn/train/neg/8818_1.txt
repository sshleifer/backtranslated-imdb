When he finds Santa, he is not stupid about some children and is simply plain (???) strange movie. He grew up and became an adult (brandon maggart) who made a list of naughty or beautiful people. A Christmas he snaps and sets out to kill naughty people - certainly dressed as Santa. <br /> <br /> Boring and just plain bad killer Santa Cinema. You're looking gore, it's not here. Only a few of the killings have been shown and they are not very poor with fake influence. Most of the movie is being talked to herself by Brandon Maggar and slowly going crazy. The script is frustrating, the acting is horrific and it's gone, which makes me feel slower on television. Actually, I want to review the tape again and I can not keep watching again! Really really poor end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs Let's go
