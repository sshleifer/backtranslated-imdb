* Review may have spoilers * <br /> <br /> Predictable, camping, bad special effects. It has a TV-movie sense. The idea of ​​the United Nations being accepted by Satan is a striking turn of the world to the world according to the Bible. The courtyard is interesting, but his enthusiasm is short waaaay. If you want to convert people to Christianity with such a film, at least make it a quality! I was deeply checked in my watch while watching this piece. A year ago I did not see anything else about this movie, and there is nothing to say except this picture ... just drop it!
