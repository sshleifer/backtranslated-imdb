I could not wait to get the DVD when I heard so much about the film. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. Many characters were presented, some similar to others, it became impossible to follow the story line. I did not understand that George Clooney received the award for the film because of his involvement in the first half of the film. My wife and I left the DVD after leaving an hour after sadness. Whether the last time I could be considering rapid progress was good but after so much confusion the decision was to make a slight improvement. A colleague told me that in the last minute or fewer films "came together". I waited, waiting for another hour. I gave away the DVD the next day.
