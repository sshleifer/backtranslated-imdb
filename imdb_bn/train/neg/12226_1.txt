I know, I know, "Plan 9 Outside Space" is the worst movie, or perhaps "Manaus, the hand to look." But I can not work on those sock-monkey movies. * Of course * they are bad. How could they be any better? But if you talk about movies with respectable production value and bankable talent, all Turkey's T. Rex will be "Yentl". Since 1964, Barbra Streisand has everything, which has reached the end of this film, all the stormy soundness, all self-absorbed existence. From the single summit of horror, "Intel" is back in the "A Star Born" and "The Mirror to Faces Forward". It's nothing quite like that. I do not want to think about how Straesand was emotionally dragged to create this movie, and I can not possibly imagine the audience that they were playing, even though I would say that there are nine opportunities in ten but you are not a member of it. <Br> <br /> Isaac Boycev's singer Straussand, the guardian of the Nobel Prize winner and the son of Jesus' literature, was so dissatisfied with his story that he blasted him publicly for him. This is a tribute to Straesand's unreasonable pornography, which he did not commit suicide, but instead proceeded to create more horrific movies.
