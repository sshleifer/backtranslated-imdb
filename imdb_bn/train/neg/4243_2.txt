Perhaps the most interesting scene in this movie is when our civilians do not get their medals and plaques and what they do. So the basic idea is that the police are making these gangsters as one hundred thousand, but they are powerless, because the villains are just a little bigger. I guess the police ammo just kinda bounces. They decided to shoot this movie in fake interviews and with all and seriously documentary style, these guys are wrong? They are armed with rolled up newspapers like they are talking about. Well, I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be on the line of fire, even when your advantage is so much, take nuts. And why it took 44 minutes to solve everything? I would say that it is very long time you have surrounded them and you are allowed to shoot. They are ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy themselves big guns to increase their heroism. And then yes, you have it, one of the police actually actually hits anyone. Bullets were probably diverted by a lamp post or something. I guess there was a good smile.
