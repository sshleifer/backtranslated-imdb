There is absolutely nothing happening in this slu, boring, thrilling thriller directed by Amenbar's natural partner Matio Gill. The film does not actually provide any means with rare effects and thriller discovery, and it seems to be a boring exercise. The only silently suspicious moment is the movie's climax, which takes 30 seconds to complete 100-plus minutes and is easily resolved. The plot lacks the sophistication or credibility, and when the concept is original, the way the story is published is arbitrary and the results of each plot machine or outer interference (the instrument of the former Duos). The hero is always passive, everything happens with him to force him to show any enterprise or resourcefulness. If you are a fan of the genre, instead of "Tesses" see.
