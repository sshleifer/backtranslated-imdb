I'm going to see a huge Zia Jhang fan and a film that's about to get me purple butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I made a lot of comments which commented. It's very confusing and extremely slow. Because all the pictures seem to have been shot with a camera, the significant part of it is out of focus. <br /> <br /> This picture has very little dialogue and is not telling you a lot. The endless scenes of people are sitting in each other sleeping apart from smoking or smoking conversations about smoking cigarettes. Following the counter-time of film is very confusing and difficult to follow. Even before I went to read several reviews and there was a general idea about what the film was, it was still hard to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I already knew that this movie was not like a remote location like the previous Zia Zhang acting film but was looking forward to seeing it slightly differently but unfortunately I was disappointed. He never laughs in this movie, although he admits that most of the time he does not get anything to laugh. I could work like sex scenes because they were sexless and you could find out without any obvious feeling among the participants.
