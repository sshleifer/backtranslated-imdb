Holling II (1985) was a complete 180 from the first movie. The first film was a camp and a surprise. The second one was sleazy and Chess. Its production value is bad and the actress is violent. Uncle Veerboole wanted to know the brother's brother, what happened to his beard The "scene" from the first picture was badly rebuilt. An intelligent plain-looking woman with old country (Romania) Bro (Reb Brown) for her sister's murder / transformation / unveiling the mystery of death. Christopher Lee now appears and then disappears and refers to the two as a sage. Danny in Sebel and his two great resources emerge as Stima, Romania's main Verubole. He is suffering from bad situation in the morning, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprised Phillip Mora has managed the film because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (not the content but the film itself itself). To stop the movie you get a lousy "punk" performance from a bridal wannabe "Babel". Perhaps they could get real contracts instead of a simulation if they give some extra money to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> If you do not get frustrated or become distant and you become very lazy to change the channel.
