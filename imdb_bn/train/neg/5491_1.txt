We should be suspicious to discover that in just two minutes the lamp came out and we were the only one there. Only five people joined before the movie began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this movie. The acting is horrific (especially MS Hurley). The script is disabled. The effect we've seen in a million times. The direction of film is the worst that we saw. Abandoned and disturbed. Nobody laugh with the kids. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> There is nothing to see in your movie, but buy some beverages, popcorn and hot dogs and some people are watching. You will get many more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
