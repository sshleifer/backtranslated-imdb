This is why many people remain homeless. . . Because stupid producers pay for making terrible films instead of paying them, if they can get bored! <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is worse than white girls! Little Man has a lame excuse for a character drunk posture as a child. The story was written by six people, awful. The idea is not too bad, if it was original and not a rip-off for a cartoon episode. It's fun moments but some of them are way too much work done and some are just stupid. The acting was very bad. So was the instruction. Anyone involved in this movie will be ashamed of himself. It's racist and midgets very aggressive. I mean, instead of showing sympathy for them, the filmmakers make fun of them! It's really they hate how they do it. They just see kids like midgets. And for a character who is a leftist, posed to get a diamond from a certain family to be a abandoned child. That's like showing something for her lame excuse. It was just not worth it. Do not see these pictures. It is a huge waste of time and money.
