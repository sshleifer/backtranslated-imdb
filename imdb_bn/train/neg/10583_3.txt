I'm sorry to say it, but this photo is awesome. The conversation sounds like they are reading their line for the first time. Probably I got the "Rehearsal Dress Rehearsal" version. Especially in the efforts to compensate the actors for poor performance, the directors use slow effects during special effects. The story has been well written, and the sequence of events I actually saw in many filmmakers. The war seems pretty realistic. But these two incidents happen when two leading actors survive in incredible amounts of time-and-time miraculous point-blank automatic weapons fire, grenades, mortar rounds, and bazookas. The enemy soldiers must have seen some of the worst shots ever seen, especially when they have a truck running in their sight from 30 degrees, and each bunka shot at least 50 feet wide. Those bazookas require serious site calibration.
