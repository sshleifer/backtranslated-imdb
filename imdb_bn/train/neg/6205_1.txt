So they have promoted violence and it has been branded as sick. Well, violence is my best side, but unfortunately we do not understand why they go on their way (completely expected) anger. This film has a really awesome script. We will never know about Robert and his actions, then they are simply benevolent. Acting is not much better, either their worst TV chef and school teacher. Painful in the direction, enough speed to send you sleep. And the school film project on everything in the world? Perhaps a comment on the film? The use of newsreel during the climatic assassination is ridiculous. These guys certainly think that they are intellectuals but frustrated outside their depths. I do not know how in the world they got great light on Yorgos Arvanitis. And how they got paid to do it in the first place even a larger mystery. Outside understanding is absolutely terrible.
