I had nothing to do on Friday night when I rented this photo a month ago. What I can say to describe this outstanding movie is that the trash has happened very badly. I saw kids doing good work in high school. The whole cast looks like they are just reading their lines, feeling no, there is no emotions, and no room for visitors to capture. There was a special effect on another note, and the whole thing seems to have been shot with the camera as if someone could buy radio shakes. <br /> <br /> The shirt does not see anything like the cover of the video. He did not even appear in the movie till the end, and he kept singing and walking a few letters. No actual murder is shown, so it is not a real slash film, because I saw it so I questioned a few issues 1. If the 'serial is a crazy clone killer' then it will not kill any serial killer clowns? 2. If your friend is absent then why do you go out for him instead of looking for him? Really sorry <br /> <br /> 3 Why was the only real act that ended suddenly? Cast finally decided to try their work? This film is as sad as they come. My advice is not to avoid this rent so that you can laugh more than screaming for an hour or two hours.
