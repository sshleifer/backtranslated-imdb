I'm Crispin Glover's "Do It?" Saw Ann Arber Film Festival Certainly, the film was nominated at least right because I had a distinct idea that the writer / director could not even answer anymore. After screening, Mr. Glover said in the question-answer session that the film was originally meant to be a small film to use with Down syndrome. However, this is not enough reason to make a movie. Actors in my opinion, creating blocks for a bigger perspective - a big perspective that seems absent in the best and the worst. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christine Glover also wanted to deal with banned issues. Well, he does this. but why? The film seems to have no position, no reason for tackling anything. Does he think these things should not be banned? The film does not even give me an index. Taboo is not interesting for the ban. Even the audiences can not afford to be bothered or excited at any level because they are not taking care of the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> I ignored the problem with the idea of ​​a moment and I was actually considered to be the most vulnerable to how the film was weakened together. Editing, cinematography, and other technical aspects have often become very amateur. Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went to the movie, and I think the money should have been spent on different designers (Glouar actually designed something - I know I saw at least the sound design among the credits). Paint set is OK (not great), but used weak. Parts seem like a play in a photo staged - which would be good for any kind of purpose, but in Glover it seems only drunk. The other parts are portrayed as a small-scale quality movie like the home movie that I first look at the filmmaker's Ivy. <br /> <br /> Probably "what is this?" The biggest problem with this. I do not understand how important the movie is to be taken. There are some parts that seem like glover that you are seriously shouting. On the other hand, he seems to stop his own little joke. Perhaps he wanted to be something that would be meaningless, meaningful or meaningful, but I felt that Glover could not even get himself to give serious attention to his film. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a small film. If it were In the seventy-two minutes, the film came out of imagery and concepts in the first twenty years, and it is assumed that if the concepts were made substantially, they claim that they were also for that time.
