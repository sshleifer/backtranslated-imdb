OK, this is the 2 worst excuse 4 has been a movie that I've ever been unaware of watching. Like all other Welsen Twin movies, with no possible exception in New York, there was no story in this film, Ground Plot Holes, Dirty Acting and Bad Filming Even !!!!!!!!! If you still have not guessed, then I hate Marie Catt and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I saw it was that I was really annoyed and had nothing else to do. I think, if couples stop the same stereotypical movies, where they keep incredible folly in a foreign location and on the other hand, from the help of two intelligent boys, who immediately dive on them. At least they can be a person of 4 people or both of them will fall the same person. The plot of this story is so disrespectful and just plain. Even a child can see its flaws. Perhaps they may begin to split up or make films with different stories. Anyone who liked this movie was not a crime - it's really stupid, really artificial or not a good movie. Or maybe they really have a smart and bad movie sitemap choice. In no way will I recommend this movie to my worst movie experience for my best movie. This is a good 4 repetitive effort to cool some ribs. It's lovely if you watch for a smile. Basically I give it 0 or less.
