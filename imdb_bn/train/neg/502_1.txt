This film is not a very bad film, with a horror actor - or supposed actors - an annoying side and a story overwhelming, it's a fine copy of a scenic scene from Giori "Toros", which is directed by Sageoo Martino. 1973 (two years ago), the Italian film's most famous mind-thriller and a worldwide culture-film. In "La Santunisa condomo la danza", the director replaced the black girl and white girl's bed scene with ping-tomers watching from the balcony of the bedroom. Naturally, the scene is ridiculous in Rijo's cinema and Martino is worse than the film's flexibility and elegance. To keep another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom again challenged this scene and showed that Rizo's film has no idea, no originality, no taste, and nothing else. I think such things are a crime for the viewer.
