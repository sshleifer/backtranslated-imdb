Of course, on Saturday morning the show of TV kids is sometimes done in this poor work. After all, those producers were counting back to the audience. Well, in this terrible offer, they can calculate the reserve money in at least sets. The script may be rejected from some long-forgotten space opera serials, adding some reminiscent lines for curling with the Norah Heiden for the Cool-Dude Guerrand Prince. Any director could do something decent with such a cruel tale, so along with the action just annoying plods. Curiosity of the spaceship props - a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example - but the history of the planet set film will be the worst thing. Most crude drawings, and all of it are often dancing in a misfocused red light. Even the seam's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's a bad one - as rib thinner as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will be able to hear a message from the Martians - and probably will be fully agreed!
