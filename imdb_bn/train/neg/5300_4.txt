I'm one of the millions of Colombian intoxicants around the world and only saw this character, starting at British Channel 5. It is fascinating to think so much of the film that has spread, and I can only be surprised that anyone saw the huge potential of "Colombo" and added such a touch to such a remarkable and classic series. That said, this special movie is not as good as the rest of the (embarrassing final episodes and without British sponsorship). If Colombo was made in accordance with the original pilot, it must not have been for a long time, or seen and loved around the world. Le in this film Colombo is wearing a smartphone, wearing a normal car, having a partner, does not talk to his relatives and becomes quite aggressive. There are no cats and mouse chemistry between Colombo and "Villain". Watchable, but only for the novelty to see how Columba started out.
