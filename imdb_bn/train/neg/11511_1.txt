I had a fate (wrong) to watch this movie in an exhibition in the United States. Unintentionally sitting on a completely unstable thing, I am amazed at the many reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. After the 1969 revolution it was decorated within the 17th century; This image is just ....... it's bad ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> shallow, badly cut, fashion show. He is not frustrated here; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are quite clearly business plants. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ricky to insult him by giving him money. <br /> <br /> <br />
