There are two reasons why I do not 1 for this movie. One of the reasons is that some of the actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Guinness Walsh) work, who tried to play at normal levels of acting. But in most cases they were blocked by bad scripting in some way. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the search for cool ideas and cyborgs, which I have seen so far that in most cases is different. <br /> <br /> Anything else in this movie might be bad. Boring scenes, vain and annoying dialogs, bad scripts work. And it seems that there was sometimes the first movie for many actors. It may be an interesting story though, but they have failed completely.
