Mulva is a sugercoma by a teen supe. When he was awake he was quite hot (part played by Debbie Rokon in this section), and who made his mistake out for revenge. The sub-title and box industry means that it is a acceptance on "kill bill" movies, but it's Chris Savar's film, it's a wildly mock mockery (and I end up using very late) I do not want to say that it is compared to the first movie Well, but the truth is that when I saw my previous ass, my ass was so unlikely I drunk that I can not even hope to compare the two at the moment. But I enjoyed it because I bought the signal (see when I'm not drunk, good sound, complete and lack of total blurred film) some laugh out loud (very little) but remember that Bonjax is still being funnier. All right, at least for one hour, it's worth the quick early. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Chris Savver's director audio commentator, actress Debbie Rocon and LBP gang; Second commentary by Savar; 31 minutes making featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's less than 6 minutes budget film tribute! Fake 2 minutes to trade syrup; Still gallery; Promotional trailer; And "Trailer: Mulva", "Search for Egg Fog", "Filthy McNisty" 1, 2, and 3; "The Furnal Man", "The Bonsetter", "Midnight Skater", "Daemon Summer" and "Splatter Rampage Wrestling"
