This is the worst movie of my life. Considering some of the choices I made on this photo rental, this is quite a bit. <br /> <br /> Based on the basis of NETIFIC I have found the truth that anyone who went to high school was impossible. The tapes scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was so fun that the sticks were played under my toes, when Rosanna was forced to listen to Big Spider. <br /> <br /> "Squats" are fools and the worst kind of bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's a vague (and poor) rip-off of Kentucky Fried Movie that you are begging to crash through Big Jim Slade Protect us from the stupidity of the wall and "Vince Offer" (anybody). <br /> <br /> If you are a difficulty, stay away from this garbage.
