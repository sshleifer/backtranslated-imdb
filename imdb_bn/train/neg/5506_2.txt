We went to this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of 'My Favorite Martian'. We were our 6 year old girl with us. He wanted to go halfway through the movie, which was both his parents! The parts we saw were sometimes very ridiculous, in most cases, very disinterested or fair. I hope this movie can appeal to kids in the 9-12, kids. It is definitely not suitable for young children. The actual series was far superior to what I heard and if you are going to "revive the past" you will probably be frustrated.
