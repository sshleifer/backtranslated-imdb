I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. It is said that Survival does not live in any way around it. <br /> <br /> I can not give any point on this fundamentality. There is nothing wrong with searching the same themes or restoring what others have done. Indie films have become a police force to make us move a slash through only a single structure, a crazy killer, and a few crazy families. In those lines, I have to compare it with Texas Chess, a wrong turn (although its wrapper is clear), and others. The way to live against comparative films is the lowest. The plot was not root in any way. Some movies may get extraordinary performance, special FX, or other factors by a weak (and way over-completed) plot. There are no banks to survive. If you want, keep in mind the following: Acting in the film never stopped. I do not blame or blame for the director or not. The conversation was the best intermediary, and the actors never showed the talent to pull it (not saying). I mention 2 standouts The top man of this film must have the appearance, but I think he should consider more training before he is ready to carry a film. Greg illustrated actor was also potential, but we have not seen any of it (see movies, you will not believe it ..) <br /> <br /> The monster film look. Ah yes, these little diverse magic designed to take us on the glorious days of "Greenhouse" movies. To make today's film, it has become a hostage. It does not work or it does not. In this case it does not work. There are many more errors that are going on, so it gets confusing from the movie, it does not add up. That said, I think they did a good job of adding that crop. That's some good, quality grains. I think with a different script, good direction, and perhaps the actors, they should try another "greenhouse" effort. They probably pull it off. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical aspects are in my opinion, they never abuse me too much. The audio can be well cared for (it sounds like feeding directly to the camera, but there is no error in it) and it was very soft for my taste to shoot at DV. <br /> <br /> This is all about me .....
