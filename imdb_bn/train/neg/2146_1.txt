I'll put it here, one of the worst series of classic Disney films I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released it as one of her greatest films ever. Now remove great songs, add a poor plot like a lost TV show. "Keep it together and what do you get?" Crud the biggest load I ever saw. I saw this, I thought it was all for Disney. Should end with Cinderella, "and they happily never lived after." This is not garbage. This picture did not deserve a signal like this. I think it will be like "Time on Time" which is medium but better than that. Also, what do we care for Anastasia? He switches party like Yao, but it does not help anyone.
