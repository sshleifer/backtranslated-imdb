For those who want to see this movie? I will say go! Without the description it can be a very good movie / documentary. But the lines of music, descriptions and some implemented stories make it hard for surrogates like me to make surveillance. Following some animals, their life experiences in different seasons that it is an animal soap that we see. But the mlodramatic point is not just spending it for me, even then if the hunter is finally caught in the prey (there is an exception left) the camera is zoomed out or moved to another scene. I ask myself, why it may happen, if they want to show the reality, why is there such a scenario that the novel of the novel remains? I think the public confidence is moral, because after all: it will be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
