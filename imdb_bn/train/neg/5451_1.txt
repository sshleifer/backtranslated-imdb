The picture will be much better than this little shot if they are going to get the fame right for themselves. <br /> <br /> This image is set in Glasgow (although only secondary characters have a couple near Scottish accent). Prices are not going anywhere about those who live, they can actually make funny, insightful, playful, culture films while working on their night in the same cafe in the early morning. Instead we have a group of confident Saddos and a plot that has been done in bits so I recommend it is not banned. X and Y friends. The X is sleeping with Z. Y z as well as sleep. Oh, you find it out. <br /> <br /> Time wasted. Painful dialogue - It appears that a group of 16 years old will be written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely lazy - just writing a female as a token would expect that women cajoled to see it. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh at the beer adverts who can bear beer and usually found in the nondescript city center shuffle rounds on Saturday night, then you will find this film and find it "a right jump". Everyone else, running away, does not move away from this sad mad mix. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
