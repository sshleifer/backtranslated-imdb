Is there anything in this movie that is not predictable? I do not think so. Basically the movie is cliché after the cliché and really nothing comes as surprise. This makes the movie highly anticipated and because of this, the film will not be intensively dragged. So it is not difficult for a thriller and unpredictable, but as a drama it is a failure. Because the story of the movie is very unlikely. I mean, that in this way it can never happen in real life, as it happens in the film. So there is a real mystery and credibility problem in the movie. <br /> <br /> The real events that actually killed this movie are true. It was cringing things at times. Everything is so sutural about this movie. The hunter is depicted as a cold heartless, sexually provoked boy and a neutral young man, as a hunting psychologist, who did not see any work that worked. What happened in the movie was so obvious and it all happened for a reason. Such discipline as 'hunter-gatherer' fixes broken cars. That has to be one of the oldest clichés in the book. I knew the movie tried to achieve that point later. Teachers and students looked around each other and looked at each other and saw the eyes of other people around them. It was almost incredibly clear and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching movies after that point. The movie is full of moment with this moment. <br /> <br /> The title may seem like a cheap porn movie, but it is really mad about the TV movie. This means that everything is happening slowly and the movie spends time in charge development and unnecessary sub-plots, making the movie more playable. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Elizabeth Barclay is doing a great job in this movie. She makes some clichés and even almost realistic look at events. His career in Hollywood seems to be good after the movie appeared in the movie "Shogharg", so unfortunately he still appears in movies and television series consistently. It's a waste of his talents and he certainly deserves well. Other disappointments of other characters. Correa Sevier plays a superb 'untouchable' boy, and it is worse to portray the husband of the main character. She looks more like a sexually-hunted hunting hunter compared to the real hunter of the film. He basically tries to sex with his wife in every sequence. He woke up, he wanted sex. Before she goes to bed, she wants sex. She gets home, she wants sex. It can be a realistic thing, but I do not know, it's not just a movie and it's not like a story in general. <br /> <br /> is a cliché film and I do not think anyone will ever see this movie. This is predictable and there is a lack of mystery and credibility. There is no 'horror' film and it must be monitored once, all the weak and cliché elements of the film also make it far from a proposed one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
