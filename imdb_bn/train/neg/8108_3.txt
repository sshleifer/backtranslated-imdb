After reading this book, I had a lot of money, this movie did not give me any feeling which the book has released. It also makes me amazed if Kaufman likes this book, then he successfully turns it into something else. That's just bad. Where is the most important ?! From the first scene, most of the music dialogues and feelings are sinking, and it continues through film. I think the makers are thinking that by enjoying the music through the film, this story will turn out to be light - but they have failed completely here. Instead, the music moves to 'feel like movie' to give everything that dramatic events happen so that we rely on them so that everything is really heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of this adaptation failure is the story line it is embellishing more dramatic. In the film we see French pass Thomas on the road, who is going to meet Sabina. The visit of this occasion / pass, which I definitely do not read in the book, gives the story of Thomsom more than that which makes it light. There are many other examples of <br /> <br /> where the continuity story has changed, the worst is Emo, but this is done because the book simply does not convert to movies, such as Kundar style. It makes us wonder that all the liberal reviewers of this site write about their film and movie experience instead of just writing about the film. Until it is incomplete as a film. For those who still do not read books I recommend just reading that. For those who have it, you have to say that you are only wasting your time and perhaps end up writing similar stable warnings here.
