All right, this movie was a terrible premises. According to the movie they were going through an apocalyptic war, be serious, yet they have the means of buying huge robots and hitting each other. Each country decides to invest instead of rebuilding their country, but they can not fight with robots, which have no capability. Here's a good idea, to fight against our war, depending on our most useless resources, jokes. <br /> <br /> Everyone says about the director, what about him? She makes a good movie, she makes a bad movie. Due to the movie there is no reason to give some credit to this movie, perhaps she was asleep? I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, it was so lively and ludicrous that I had to laugh. I really spent a good time looking at it, in addition to the cowboy counselor who faced a murderer (believe me that nobody will see this guy as a murderer, it is a wonderful, but lam) any kind of training exercise is a jungle gym. I was sad to see Mst3k does not work on this one. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not mind the budget, I've seen many rational movies that did not have anything to budget. Like cube The storyline was not even pretty and I saw the school plays play well. They could carry 11-year-olds from any middle school game. <br /> <br /> Choose whatever you like, it's a fun movie to watch.
