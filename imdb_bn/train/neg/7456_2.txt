It can not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie have stole one and a half hour of my life and I want it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He reads in the long lines of the former SNL films. Some have been bright, some have miserably failed. There are not many middle grounds in this section. Although Chris Farley was bright, and then OK, and then not funny, and then dead ... so I think he hit the entire spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a plug-in. <br /> <br /> c
