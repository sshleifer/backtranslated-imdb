From the very opening scene you will be able to imitate a very smart and strong 'cruel motive' and see how difficult it is to get rid of it. You'll also notice what they liked by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene, you see two best things in this film, Amy Adams and Mommy Rogers as Katherine and her mother. If you find out that Catherine was not a blonde in the first movie ... then the film goes away, you've seen a romantic romantic story before you mile and you notice that Sebastian already had an anneette with him in the past, here Daniel and a Seycheli are called, here Cherry It is said ... how original it is for a preview Then it became a little budget with many movies and many "Ohh-my" twists with 'Wild Things' movie. As I mentioned, Robin Dau was a very bad choice. He's not a bad actor, he's good .. He just did not do Karim Ryan. Amir Adams, who, in my opinion, is one of the most gifted young actors of my time, again distributing. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way that this trash can save. Completely, this "movie" seems like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode. The score has been stolen from 'cruel intentions' and 'Jabberkarkar' ... Yes, they used scores from Joe BREAKER ... could they not leave it alone?! You want to pass this one in. If you want more cruel objectives, see Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons.
