Because of the popularity of being loaded by The Land of the Dead and Resident Evil series, often the ongoing junkie is trying to earn some money like crazy. It starts at a television station, protected by the military, and reports that Lazar viruses are nearing collapse and the city will soon be free to do their business. The problem is, this is completely false. Zombies are rampantly running and only a small minority is aware of the people. They include Torch (William Garberi), Cameron Man, Sherry (Rachel Morris), Chief Anchor Women (who for some reason are listed to play Shelley on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military campaign Torch and Sherry are not lying to the public but are managed by the secret service of the station (or any other government agency) and they have been heavily censored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The quote source has lost all credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Tell me that this movie is BAD. I was hoping more and not as bad (I was obviously) but I feel so bad that I can not find any freedom fighter in the film, whatever. All parts are played or are very wooden. Does anyone remember their line or they are closing the QC card? I can not even think of the best part of the film or the best actress / actress. There was not really one. If somebody had to make a request to me, then I would say Roger, the military operation was probably the most attractive character but it is not really saying much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to pass this movie, despite the box-covers being pretty (it originally brought me to the movie). 3/10
