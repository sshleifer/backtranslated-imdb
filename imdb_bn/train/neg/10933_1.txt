Find out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about Half-Finger Mormon, and you'll see they played this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Eventually the fate of Cartel has changed (thanks for the goodness) and hopefully I can not see any of the features in the theater. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amateur (I think they used some camcorders for basketball). The plot was limp and very lazy. No one really understands why? I was sand on my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could not give negative ratings to this movie is because the scale will not be given to me.
