No speaker <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but it should sometimes be the most important effort to create. Calling it a "movie" is a stretch. This "random-clips-explicitly-fake-to-durable-violence-and-ugly-women-to-play-sexy-edited-weak-at-a-time" are not viewable. <br /> <br /> This is shown as a random family holiday photo as interesting and it is about the same quality, when you send your ten-year old boy to the jungle with your new video camera, and tell him a movie. <br /> <br /> terrible.
