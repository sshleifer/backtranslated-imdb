I know I have already added a comment but I just wanted to explain something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not some old fog from child Boom generation, which can be grown up in Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br / > <br /> <br /> Bilko was 20 years old before I was born, but I was happy to be honored by BBC Phil Fillers Bilko. If I did not see or hear Phil Silver, I would have been surprised if I enjoyed Steve Martin's instinct - I do not know - maybe I want to. <br /> <br /> Some other critics of this film think that a '10' qualification recognizes that they did not see the original. I'm asking you to spend 21 minutes of your life to watch only a single episode. Even after watching the original Arnie, Colonel Hall, Ritijag and Emma, ​​Dwen Doberman, Hensho, Dino, Flashman, Jimmanon, Mulin etc, you think Steve Martin's film has got something on '2' - I'll stand you in the pants ....
