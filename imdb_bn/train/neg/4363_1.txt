It is difficult to find any positive in this movie. It seems that the producer has to make a profit without much effort and therefore our galaxy is considered as a complete show, which is the greatest excuse for a film in history. Police girls looked extremely sexy in their small uniforms. Two police and more galaxies will go to go to action shots. Of course the budget will be added so they decided to fill the place with that intriguing rerun. Miss Album is excellent looking sexy and its first rate of acting. Those who have heard of MS Stab, but they did not meet before on the screen, were also very interested, but it seems they are not original acting talented. In addition to MS albeit it is the actual garbage.
