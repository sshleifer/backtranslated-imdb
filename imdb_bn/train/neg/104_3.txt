On the way to a small town on the beaten track (but looks suspicious in a freeway), a female reporter goes into a strange hit-hiker who agrees to help her reach her destination. The strange man then mentions a wonderful story related to the area: In the first story, an adulterous couple devised the plot to kill the woman's husband in plot, but eventually suffered a zombie attack; And in the second story, a group of campers are short of their holidays when an unwanted outlaw takes umbrage while keeping her grave. <br /> <br /> An attempt of The J Zombie Chronicles Writer Garrett Clancy and Director Brad Sykes making a zombie-themed mythology ?? An excellent concept, but with only two stories, it is a fall short of disappointing. And this is the only way that fails to provide full budget for this low budget: Acting Housing (Ebenezer Jackson, who talks about the story with Joe Hagertia, which provides a weird performance that I've ever seen); The position is uninspired; The script is dreary; Have a sexual scene with zero nudity; And last .... Well, that beggar believes. <br /> <br /> To be fair, some creative cameras of Sykes-effective (though the overwhelming technique used as a jungle trick is overused) and Joe Castro's cheap enthusiastic enthusiast: an ear is cut off, the ribs are taken out , A face is removed, the brain is squished, and has a dirty decapitation. These positive images can only make movies better, but be careful, zoom churches do not roam the park, and even for G-grade trash viewers. <br /> <br /> I am the zombo chronicles 2/10, but gradually increase my ratings to 3, because I did not see the film with the help of 3D (although I have no doubt that an additional level does not make any difference) .
