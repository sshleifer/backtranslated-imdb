Powerful morphine power rangers have to be the worst television show ever. There is no plot, only a bunch of powdered decorated kids using martial arts in dresses of second-class spandex clothing. <br /> <br /> Looks like special effects that they look like a little bit of clothing, a bad comedy from 70, and the show is just as easy terrible. <br /> <br /> The worse thing than the television show is toys, just the second rate is feeding our kids to plastic garbage. <br /> <br /> There are many great programs to watch your kids! <br /> <br /> Try to give your children something like niklodian, actually they have some intelligence shown, which is like the power rangers.
