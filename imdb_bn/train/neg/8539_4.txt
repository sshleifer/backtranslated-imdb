This compelling (which it should not be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (mostly I can add) looks good, but huh? Again the phrase 'huh?' Actually the word 'huh?' Quite going through your mind Nothing makes sense, nor does it make much effort. I do not know whether it is complexly cryptic or just a hoax twist, but it can not be denied how lucky it sounds weird, weird and sound. <br /> <br /> related unrelated sequences (such as a small girl involved in a nasty opening, dead cats and fire) photographer Mario (in a vague story played by a chest-puffing John Caffeine), who is merely for the iconic Nintendo icon Mario A dead pigment What are these problems?) That confront his girlfriend in the house and a young man. The lady (a nicely bursting paty Shepard) who requested to come with her in the photography assignment, where they come across some hooded dices in the retreat of this remote mountain. <br /> <br /> What is the only atmospheric process is a moody piece and growing unease. Ra√∫l Artigat manages some abnormally unusual and vague passages, but in most cases it appears to be formally absent and inadequate. We saw beautiful scenes of beautiful scenes from Ramon Sampre's attractive painters and we slowly washed the time. But in some areas where it was very dark, what's going on. Fernando Garcia Marquilo's heavily bombarded and over-excised score forced the atmosphere to create frequent intervals. Leads are capable, but an effective bunch (Picture Israel is Picture Israel) second performance. <br /> <br /> A little slowly on the way to interest, but this dreamy set-up (which seems over and over) managed to keep the observer until you stayed close.
