Three Stags - Rockets, Will Travels - 1959 It's the first feature length film as a Stoudgee Star and it's pretty bad. It shows three stogles as a nice composition to go around the world in a decade (since 1963). <br /> <br /> Stuttgart Junketer in a rocket place. They climb into a rocket and it goes on Friday Friday. They fill in a few things in which the unicorns say that they "bring" them back to the world. "He" speaks like an average, happy person - 'Oh, hello. how are you? Here is the lovely planet Hope you like it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the story is going on, but no one has said to the creators of the film that there is no party for 10 minutes or more in this film, nothing will happen. The stogguli leaves the party and then the film is almost finished. <br /> <br /> The high point of the film - the ending where Stoggs sang a small song about their journey. Larry and Carlie Joe face to face with two faces. <br /> <br /> <br /> Another author mentioned the excellent musical score. is not it? Even the music I noticed was two classic tunes - I would take romance and sing the song again, both played in the party. And * that * really high point of the photo - music from old Colombian movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only 99 cents store.
