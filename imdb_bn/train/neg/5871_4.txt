The only reason I see this remake for me was to see how bad it can be and fun. It was not funny about the bad and bad, because I saw "Bhoina I Mir" (1968). What do we start? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Dorhel and Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bijvbhov - a poor fellow whose roots were not deep; Robert Dorhomme and Brendan Donnisson Natasha Rostova - a scary, her picture can cause insomnia; In the order of Robert Dorhomme and Brendon Donnison, Balkansky - a good avatar, like the little colleague (above CF), lacks the spirit of Russia and lacks "struggle inside"; Robert Dorhomme and Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - rather overwhelming leader; Prince Dorczynski of Robert Dorhel and Brendan Donnison - A Turkish with English face; Robert Dorhomme and Brendon Donnison's Count Bezkhov - a timeless fiqh show ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> They look and talk are often hateful. They behave like modern EU citizens who are equipped for a one-day museum. It seems all cheap and in the early 19th century our Russian men and women do not come near the quality. <br /> <br /> Entertainment is a good part of recreation and fun. While remembering our modern product, we had some giggles in our office, which was shown on our TV earlier in the evening. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I suppose, many young people have never seen our movie ("Bhoina I Mir" 1968) or "Tarantino-Spillberg" have strange ideas. . Remember the scene when Hussar saves his friend, walks around, fires, and flies to the bridge? Looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no way to create a better version of the novel, which was properly displayed in our country at once. But I would be happy to see a Russian remix of "Gone with Win". Hey, director, wake up and get busy instead of distorting our classic. <br /> <br /> Now come back to common sense. Jokes together <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Of course, it is a lot of smile - especially the Clemens Pose's uncomfortable ridiculous and the Russian viewer of his dance and singing: "It's so funny that it's funny!") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> New, I want to mention the motion of movie. In my mind, this new version is very patchy. The description and the scenes are not flowing normally - they knit and pop up in a modern video. Again I have to remember our "Bhoina Ai Mir", where the action is so natural and the description is so easy that you will sit easily and enjoy "walking with flow". <br /> <br /> I thought that the Borodino war would be great (many errors rehabilitated in any way) but in 1968 it did not find any match for the Liberation War scenes. <br /> <br /> There should be some good in this movie. And there are. The actor seems to be trying hard to do all the work. They did not have the opportunity from the start, but they still joined the "losing party". That point for plus 1 point. This makes a Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are astonishingly funny, although they want to be dramatically strong and the actors are doing their best work. It all saddens, and sometimes - laughs fits. <br /> <br /> This is the last part of what I still want about this serial. It looks very clearly how each one gets its "pay and taxes". Besides, to be judged by the movie trailer, I thought that this movie is an adult sexual scene, which must kill the whole project. But, luckily, it's not such a garbage. And it's a big plus. <br /> <br /> There is no "Harry Potter" and "Voanna I Mir" is not enough skill to make the movie right here in Russia. I say that the moral quality of my life has become very bad? Thankfully, during our Soviet era, a correct film was shown. The American version of the 1950s was somewhat justified - we still did not exist. Then there were wonderful situations. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the beginning, 1 point for unintended and 2 points for the last part of the serial. Thanks for the attention.
