I can see a good gory film now and then. I've seen some pretty sick stuff However, in these few movies, I have found remarkable in a way that was simply unfavorable and rebellious. When I love gorgeous films when they are fun I liked Wen a lot of creativity behind them. The roar of this photo is not creative. It is sick It is repugnant It's totally unpleasant. For this reason, this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film, but it lacks scares. The only reason to watch this image is for the cow, but it is the most unexpected and ugly aspect of the movie and it's saying a lot. Terrible acting, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and the way is very electronic sound. All of this took me right from the film. Most of the whole film is a long long depressed emotional. There is a freak accident in a shuttle and this guy awakens in a hospital to find out that his skin is dissolved and melted. I guess that he goes out to reduce the melting process and consumes human flesh. There is such a strange concubine that behind the back of a dog is an old couple, some split heads floating in a stream, and the last one involves a person getting involved in electricity generation. There was a time when I tried really hard to enjoy it, but I think that the only view of the whole film was even entertaining, the scene is a scene that initially runs a hospital corridor in slow motion. You like the ugly, ugly, unexpected horror films of advertising, this one is for you.
