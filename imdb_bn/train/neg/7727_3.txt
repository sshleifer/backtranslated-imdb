I comment from the perspective of reading the first novel in these colonies. And from the point of view, I can honestly say that when it's enjoyable, I can see why it has not been rehabilitated recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) This is very scary. Young generation actors were aged 15 to 20 years older than actor characters. Ali McGrath (45) was playing the tube jastro at that time, who was about 26 years old. John-Michael Vincent (39) was at the time with Byron Henri, who was about 22 years old. Other Henry Children and Pamela Tudsbury, actors have played an older role for those who are under the age of 20. <br /> <br /> Some actors were absolutely awkward. Ali McGraw almost made this mini undesirable. I have seen more believing performances in high school drama. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was poor. Ali MacGrow was likely to be fair, bad acting and managing the character. Hitler's screenplay was overdone. His character was much more like a cartoon than a carrier, and was behaving like a villain, sometimes charming, but always portrayed him as a barbarous gifted Harman Walk novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotypically (Berel Jastrow) they do not gain the depth of character created for them in Wouk. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini too dates too. Haqi music, hypocritical narrative (like a description of a junior high school history description) and the whole time the soap opera thinks it has become almost ridiculous. Also, often Beyron and Natali are dressed and instead of 1939 they are made to look like a 1979 look. <br /> <br /> If anyone sees this without having to read a novel, it probably will not have to sit through it, because it will be more applicable at the end of the 70s / 80s, which is essentially the prime- The time soap plays "take yourself very seriously". <br /> <br /> Old movies and likes are sometimes done badly, but it is probably in a case where a creative and inspired director can produce a highly versatile, memorable and critically acclaimed producer. I have never been able to see that until the rimakake (15 hours or more) will have to do the right thing, and the maximum view of the current American philosophy will be given, it will not fly.
