Star rating: ***** works **** Just miss the mark *** Little bit in it ** Peat behind * <br /> <br /> Some Plutinum is lost and some very painful people are now Josh A bombs were developed to destroy the Holos with Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his nasty young Predeze de (a different actor from the previous film, Juleson Mills), with the help of Qi Qi (Jennifer Tung). Set them to stop. <br /> <br /> Another film dealing with terrorism is one year after 9/11. In 2001, Norris himself commented on how the final line of the picture was similar to how it happened in New York City that day, so there might be a mood for a movie where Norris and others beside him - if some terrorist ass kicked kick. For others, Norris is exchangeable as it is exchangeable for anything. It is surprising to you that how the serial has been issued in the first series and if someone can get it, then a man's man 3 might soon be out shortly. <br /> <br /> If you have watched a NORIS movie, you have really seen them all and nothing really happens new or unexpected to it, but at least you know what you got and I said some need to stop some steam. Was there. **
