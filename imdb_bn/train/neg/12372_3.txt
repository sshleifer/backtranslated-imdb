My film had high expectations (title, translation, "how we will be free from others"). Above all, the idea is superb: in a near future, the ruler has taken the result of right-so-called oral and legal torture and the so-called left wing legal torture and decided to kill everyone. Those who can not prove that they are making some contribution to the organization (the organization is called "general good", but in reality the meaning of the interests of ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very good idea! Ideal for taunting taunts! Just, this movie completely blows its chance. Humorous scenes and stupid performance come out, but this mockery does not last; It is not sharp or malicious. And for a charged comedy, there are almost no funny scenes in the movie. Comedy, I guess that the circumstances should be absurd, but the situation is mostly uncomfortable and more serious than laughter or thought development. <br /> <br /> This script is bothering to bother. This action should focus on the political aspects and how wrong it will be to do such work, but instead a young man has spent time who wrote a new law for fun and who is trying to save everyone. , Africans organize a resistance that ships people. Next to all these points! Such a movie does not pretend to be so serious! It's a joke! A political statement. But it does not really start to solve the problem that might be. Maybe afraid to go too far? How cowards It's not industry This is not a real mockery. <br /> <br /> One of the only senior actors in Denmark was Seren Pylamark, very serious, and now it was very good. She was originally a movie in entertainment entertainment price. Everyone else: nothing is special (well, except for Lenny Palsen, who provided a strong performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a problem with most of the Danish films that language is never natural. No structure or delivery. Why is it so difficult to make the right words? Why would it be so stilted and artificial? I hope that when people watch these movies for fifty years from now, they do not think how people talked to the common Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
