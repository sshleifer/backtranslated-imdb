This does not plumb the depth of Creepshow 3, but it comes off. This is what some actors use the same technique in archeology, using the same technique, which is at least confused. <br /> <br /> It tends to annoy the ripps off the Twilight Zone (the bookstore is comparable to the night gallery after the sherling). Unfortunately, producers and authors have forgotten that sherling will sympathize with his characters before making them drunk. A character is not particularly attractive until the sympathetic or last segment. <br /> <br /> Framing Story: Adam West ... Well, myself. He does not go to Bruce Wayne / Batman Camp 60, but he rarely does. He did not play easily, especially in the mysterious "J" (there is an evil verb name to compare Dr. Terrorism, Erasmus and Cryptic) and some light / strange statements made. <br /> <br /> Anthroni: See "Stop at Willbee" on Rod Sterling? Then you've seen this. The red deer is not presented for any purpose, and friends of the main character also identify him as a wimp. Expected as far as can be expected, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Dinner of Nex: Steve Allen's memories of "Mind a Meeting" reminded the traveling stories of various Serling time. Most actors are not too bad (Casuals other than Josh Astin who walks, speaks, and even manages to breathe in tears), and the idea is lightly attractive. But it does not go anywhere like Ainuthi. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, some bugs (who will not do that), and for some reason he is expelled from a nuclear-declining country. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: Not bad bad piece, and manage both forecasts of clicks and creeps. I think it's something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. The main character is gentle sympathizers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Final: So ... why people end up the cold storage of the quarrel suit Till? I do not know and do not know. So ... all the plays go to the bookstore and get trapped? Happy ending with Kinda Boxer disappointed (thanks, guys!), And the first division man died. Then how was he trapped? He went to the bookstore before he died, was stuck ... and did not die? What? is not it? I supposer is not expected to feel the meaning because of this miracle. But still ... <br /> <br />: Overall: Two new twilight zone series, or different from some episodes of Tales of the DarkSide or Monsters. The last two stories and the second part are probably worth your time. But there are not really spectacular things here.
