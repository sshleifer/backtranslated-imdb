Hopkins has succeeded with this effort because the author and director give us a sense that we do not know in almost any film. But perhaps there are problems. His movie has many ambitions and his motives were very complex and very deep, but it is so personal. There are no characters. We do not know anyone, so there is no investment in our part. <br /> <br /> It can be combined with its own characters about a photographer. So what may be. By this I do not understand that the slipstream is hesitant; I mean there is no say. Hopkins film is a test. It may be that it can be an artist who understands the future of his interview with the future that he hits and misses, and / or blind chance of success, because he is a "slipstream" clash between time, dreams, thoughts, and reality points Is thrown in. Nevertheless, it is so unmanaged that it does not leave any place for any emotion, even in the smallest part, it allows us to connect with our characters. <br /> <br /> I do not think of Nippy and the sticky school, machine-gun-motion camera-editing and editing has differentiated me, but by reflecting the film I realize that there was a lot to do with it. There are many movies of the past decade, including the sound effects of the cats or camera movements as well as other atmospheric-vicious technology dodds. I think in this case it was advisable that its purpose was to create a response to the dream impression. However, when I saw it, I knew nothing about slipstream, and I came out in the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins has not made any effort to care for us. There is an interactive movie, and there is a movie that sits on a rocking chair and wears, aware of your presence. Slipstream is next.
