Even with a cast of a generally trusted name like Wallkiller and Lisa Cudro, Wonderland fails to give a sense of depth to this film. It is rarely hit by the patronage of events that took place in the night of July 1981. The Keller is just going through the motion, as both other lead roles such as John Holes and Cudro and Kate Bosworth are misfortunate miscast; Respectively as Homs's wife and underwear girlfriend. The rest cast has such a small role that it is impossible to get any level from them. The film also stars Kerry Fisher, Ted Levin, Frankie G, MC Gany, Dylan McDermott and a Camio from Paris Hilton.
