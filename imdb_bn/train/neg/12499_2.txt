I went to the movies as a snap preview in Austria. So what I'm going to see was an idea. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe it can cut 1/2 without any problem in the story. Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night that you want to be more bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Coster is okay. The film is talking about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lives and the problems they face. There are not many effects in the movie. So if you want to see it, then you do not need to waste your money and film time. It will be more effective to see it at home when it receives DVDs.
