I wanted to believe in this movie that mainstream comedy is recognized as the only country and recognizes stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has become completely different - let's cool and spacious - and look out for it on the other side with little to come out. I bet one small seed went to the nuts for this. I know SL <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have comedic chops to stop it. Even Danny had a good time. I'm actually being serious. Each time they launch a bit character, I remember, "Darn, this person should be lead!" <br /> <br /> Independence means the camera work will not be awesome. Black and white did nothing for this film - actually, due to this flat conversation, it provoked more and more of the excitement. Black and white were also not crisp. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Surprisingly, I saw this film after Little Miss Sunshine and its essay was fantastic - perhaps the shortage of this film has spread to my mind. <br /> <br /> I think the Carney (which was funny than the lead even before he even said anything) is not this movie and David - see it and you'll understand. I was frustrated by the people who organized the OPICOPi. Someone would think that nothing will happen here. I got the feeling that it might be pictured in someone's back garden. I have regularly talked about who has a lot of fun, raunchier and wittier conversations than these "comics". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Excellent work guys
