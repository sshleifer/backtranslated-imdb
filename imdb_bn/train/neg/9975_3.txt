I think this movie was seen as a very young child several times, and some of it was (actually many) which I did not understand. I think once I have seen it as an adult, and I understand then those parts. The only problem with seeing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining for me. So what are these types of movies? Is it a "kids movie"? Very rarely. It's not suitable for kids and language subjects. Is it like a hyperbola like their mother tongue? Maybe, but why not pay more attention to John Rotor's character instead of Jr.? When 7 years of age as the main character of a movie, to work well with its audience, it should be a movie for seven and under-crowd, otherwise there will be no way to be associated with bigger people (even 8-year-olds are younger than them Year does not want to see a movie about a child). I'm sure this movie did not work well at the box office, and could be the reason because it is unable to find a special place in the market.
