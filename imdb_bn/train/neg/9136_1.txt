When the movie started, I saw it was pictured using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera laughs and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct production of DVD movies will be better than this! Hack, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have good production value! Often, the film seriously stops the camera on the tip and launches it - not with a camera person! Mortgages and cameras-work were missing in some of the similar scenarios where they could work and many others were created or badly closing up. Yecch! <br /> <br /> In this picture, two gay men want to get married. They were created almost a decade ago, their only option was to get married in Vermont - time has definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of same-sex marriage can not be considered in any way in this film - if anything, it does not support the support of gay marriage instead of the film's frustration, and instead seriously solves the problem. According to the film, religious people are a stupid fool who carries the Bible and who lied to the people and their wives, when they think of homosexual husbands narrow, they shot the wife alongside them - moving towards the picture. I'm sure this issue gives both parties a decent opportunity! <br /> <br /> The following line - nothing about the film shows any professionalism and I do not even hesitate to call this movie. This is not like a home movie and a list of IMDB or even 100 list of the 100 best movies list of IMDB. The act is horrific, terrible to write, the aspect (if any) is horrible, the camera is terrible and the plot is horrible. This is a movie movie !! I can not say positively in any way by considering the Oscars as compared to Ed Wood's films, and I am sure that Mr Wood's ghost is smiling every time he sees this mess! <br /> <br /> If you're not gay or straight, I have no difference - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how they could make their DVD. I think an actress burns her home computer on her free computer! Seriously, it gives new meaning to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> If a woman is a real lawyer, then will not the reading ability be an important prerequisite? I'm just saying '<br /> <br /> Finally, homosexual marriage is such a serious and important issue, so we can not have a movie which is even better that solves this problem? This one, sadly, invites laughter only
