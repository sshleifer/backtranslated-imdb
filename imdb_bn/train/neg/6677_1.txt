After reading the first 5 reviews of IMDB, I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really a terrible movie, the whole time you see foreigners about 5 minutes (the left cheeky mystery of the movie), the story at the top of the acting, oh boy, no story? <br /> <br> The story does not seem to go any way, first of all they capture the alien (after 7 years! finally they succeed), then how will they not know (7 years later?) and even want it Release (why are they hell?). Then the girlfriend, who is acting at the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly he does not, then again, he does not and then he does not. Then they conclude that killing the tribe will kill the whole mankind (and remember that no other person has seen this permanent alien in these years), and what do they do? They torture it and throw a bunch of aliens on the anvil. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of IMDB, I am very lazy person, who does not write soon, so listen to my warning: It does not watch the movie, do not watch this movie.
