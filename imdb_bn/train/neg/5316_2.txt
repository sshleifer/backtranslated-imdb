These lame dogs throw a bone. Very bad ... you can see anyway. Cole (Ross Hagen) is an interdisciplinary bad guy who was evaporated by an extra powerful spaceship commander (John-Michael Vincent). Coil manages to shuttle a shuttle that catches the earth. An unauthorized Android killer has been sent to bring Wilen back to life. John Phillip Law has played a forest / park render which is careful to deal with these two viewers far away. Clothing is lacking in intelligence and script intelligence. Vincent must have taken the money. The only sign of law enforcement shows. So bad it's almost ridiculous. Also cast in: Diana Ortelli, p. J. Souls and Don Wildsmith.
