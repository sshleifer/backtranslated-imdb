In this way, Mr. Fo (originally, and more appropriately, title halam pho ?? I can not address the title character as "Mr."), a respect for good acting. Both physically attractive jealousy / cripple named Hamam, and Jamaat's Bell, are both Sophia Miles believing as his peculiar partner Kate of sex workers and fantasy romances. The problem comes when you try to connect the roles of what happens in real life. A young man, who spends intimate spaceship of human life, will have to beat Halam as well as the Creator. And in the case of Kate, a woman will be withdrawn and afraid - perhaps she will call the police. <br /> <br /> Not all these things, but what happens in the movie. The mother of poor Halam has died and his father married a woman with whom he is having a relationship. Halam, of course, hates his sage and lets him know. She has sex with her. Kate is a type of job owner who keeps Halam in a dishwashing and plays sex games. She seems to be the mother of her birth. It ended all the fun with Halam to solve his "problem". A few years ago, the game played brilliantly, Virginia Wolfe's Who Of Off, the same optimistic finale, the characters were becoming more knowledgeable and each other got better after another. The problem is, it does not always work in that way, especially when nobody really thinks. Virginia Wolf, the validity of the completion due to the intensity of mental revelation. In Mr. Enrique, mental revelation does not really happen.
