This movie was terrible. I had a very difficult time watching through all these ways through. I do not get movie points What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad and the uninspiring story. The two main characters of the film were very annoying and their dialogues were frustrating. There was no chemistry between cast members. I do not know for this fact, but I think most of the actors were the first timer. The film can easily cut up to one and a half hours without losing the plot. That movie indicates how vicious scenes were. Within two hours of the film, I would rather have a main canal. I want two hours ago! If you want to see a good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mermaids, instead see Napoleon Dynamite.
