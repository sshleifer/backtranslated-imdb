It has been a * great * silent film. Actually good acting, at least a look mother, I'm really acting big! Way way <br /> <br /> Everything is big. Each line is PROFOUND! Every scene is spread by the Human Tragedy! <br /> <br /> In most cases I thought to myself. Yet, like a train destroyed, I could not pull my eyes. I suspect it, although this may work at the dialogue level. On the screen, it's a sudden, incognito, hackneydid, and most of the stratotipal negatives adjective that you can really describe in a bad dramatic job. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in huge capacity, you can enjoy * movie *. Be ready to wait, however. For all the melodramas, this thing is sure to plods along at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This actress was involved when the actors involved themselves were reading it. It does not work after it only reaches near the front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB uses our secret computer-controlled "weighted scores", it's a great misconduct. Curse of hungry class is less than 1. <br /> <br /> Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop their characters only through hoops without any reasoning explanation for their character or development, it's character development! Your character must have a motivation. Being screwed for a while and developing a field * not developing charity *. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stay away from this picture. Or at a very short time, see it mute. Perhaps you will get some pleasure from all the arm-waving letters <br /> <br /> It's a really exciting film that proves that you are looking at James Woods as a dangerous male "look-at-me-me-figurative-and-literally-represented-naked- Weakness-Humans- "Glory. <br /> <br /> Do not say you were not careful.
