OK. I think kind of kind of TV shows and it always has some kind of lessons involved. So, when my kids decide that they want to watch this movie, I decided to tag them all together. I hope I will stay at home and instead see the TV show. <br /> <br /> Among the problems of this movie, the humorous and unreasonable thing is at least Next to the existence of the plot, the character seems to be present in the vacuum, and above all, the gadget does not carry any text. It seems that Disney took all the things that Inspector Gadget works on the TV and left them all. To be fair, I like the movie of my little boy (8 years old), but the old one (10 years old) goes away thinking it's stupid (he was very old for young laughter but too young for adult humor). <<br> <br /> Normally, I like Disney movies but it misses like a mile. It should be missed for everyone, but for the very narrow age band (7 to 9 balls).
