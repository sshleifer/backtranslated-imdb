By any of your mind ?? The thriller will not be satisfied with budget judgments; But, who will pray? A young couple spends the actual end of the world in some alien's hidden laboratories masquerading as church people. <br /> <br /> The miniature earthquake out of the theme, there is a lack of consciousness and style of the whole world, quite similar to the '50s movie. And it is not only, but the EOTW plays like a hybrid ?? Not only on Judgment Day but as convent creeps. <br /> <br /> Does this seem like a part of this totally shameless Slidedash Convent? The absorption, which is significantly 70-style, which seems to be very old today. However, the future of the Convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of deco! Christopher Lee is the world's proudest; But the end of the world is not his pride!
