Before I bought it I did not have any background knowledge of this background, but it was quiet and I wanted to see a real kick-butt viking movie for a while ... Well, this film was not what I was looking for. I hoped for the best, but instead, an annoying Nordic soap opera was distributed which could drag for a long time despite 84 minutes of running time. It is quite playful in the context of the film: It is a Viking Ward who disobeyed his God and Odin is so angry that he named the war-son's son as a disciplinarian and barbarist in Tarek's name. This barrack guy is then forced to live a mad, insane and violent life after his lifetime. This movie is illustrated with most of the rich cinematography and clear acting of actors, but again, when I ended up with this annoyance, I bothered and questioned myself. The filmmakers had the opportunity to do something rather entertaining and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it can be improved with the ineffective nudity and some of the cheap exploitation techniques thrown like Gore ... I mean, we're talking about "barkers" here, right? The Vikings were supposed to be enough bands, which are all rape and astounding, so what Berserkers are supposed to be more extreme? Above all, if you are not a fan of The Young and Races (etc.), myself, in fact, an insane barrator who likes spontaneity, maybe I will clear this piece of celluloid.
