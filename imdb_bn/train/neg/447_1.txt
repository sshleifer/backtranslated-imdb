Well, what can you say about sitcoms? Often quite thrust, morale, dedicative and just plain. So this is the show! It's got a boring cast, even though Ebins' oakage on his perky way, the rest is only stereotyptic .... always as big. We have seen it before all, and when this show is canceled it will probably see it all again. Because, face it, it is a mediator and self-righteous show. Most sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> OK, short. If you want to see some good entertainment, you can take 20 minutes before the mirror. Get some face ... more entertaining than this event!
