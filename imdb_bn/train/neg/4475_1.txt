Awful, just awful! My old room mate used to see this junk and it happened to me crazy. The book is my favorite and it is a shame that some people will never know what it is like, because their first impressions are from such a drink. They changed very quickly as it changed. Since this book disturbed me after reading books like soap opera, providing enough food for modern day entertainment. It is one of the lifetime movie movies that are "based on the real story", but completely imagined. Nobody in the book's passion or depth, just psychological melodrama. If you want to find ways to read high school students, then I suggest you try another version.
