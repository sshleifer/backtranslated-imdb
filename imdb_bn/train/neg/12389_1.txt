Model Chris McCormack (Marjack Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher of his sister Kathy (Mary Hemingway) (Chris Sarden). He faces trial but is totally free. Then she rapes the cows! <br /> <br /> Photos of offensive and sick rape This film is notified as an important drama related to rape. It is a badly written and played (mostly in part) plays badly. It appears to be sympathetic to the victim of rape, but it shows the scene in our mouth. But to be completely honest, Hemingway's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact. The trial scene was boring and anticipated. When 15-year-old Morril was raped, the film went too far (thanks to not being shown). It takes a great end to occupy Moroccan guns and shoots Sarandon. But seriously - raping a young girl is just rebellion. <br /> <br /> acting does not help. For example, there was no actress in the villain. She must have been a beautiful woman (and I believe that is a real model) but her acting is much left to be desired. It reduces the film. Mariele was just right but this is one of his first movies. Sarandon he can do as rapist. He was not bad but had terrible scripts against him. I remember, in 1976 some women stood up during the screening and were glad to kill Sarandan, so maybe it works for some people. People I found this annoying, simple and really sick. A 1 all the way.
