Bad movie for sure. This ridiculous imagination, with many humorous special effects, a very quick look (for example the airport) and a real absurd time. (Charles Dancing) is awful as the evil man and he (the Last Action Hero) is much better. (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-humorous fun, and I've heard that this shrinking has already been successful, big time success ?? !! I do not understand why or how? I have heard myself in a TV interview (Eddie Murphy), when he was nominated for the 2007 Oscars, it expresses a ridiculous syllable !! <br /> <br /> One comment said (Hey ... it's 1980's!). Well, not my friend. This is the stupidity of the film that has produced many Razzak films all year round, whether it was in the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> I wrote two reasons about this picture. The first one is that I would never forget (sometimes Charlotte Lewis) long tires, especially when he was in bed before attacking the bad guy's house, just one blue shirt and the OH Boy wearing camera was mentioned about his naked legs. But how strange! I saw her in the movie follow her and she was not that nice again? However, the second reason is that I have recently found the title of this movie on my list of the worst 100 films! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
