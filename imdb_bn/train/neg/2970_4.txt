I am a back button movie and TV fan. I liked the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not so great that some people expect it. In my opinion, let's give it a big one. I think the problem was no drama in it. Batman: The Fantasum and Batman Mask: There were many plays from the Junker Return. And Batman and Mr. Fritz: Sub Zero also had some plays. Also, I think this movie is light for Batman. The only scene that seems a little darker is the big fight with Ben finally. However, it's a OK Batman movie. But I will rent it.
