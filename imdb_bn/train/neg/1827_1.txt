Jealousy Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Emmy Poehler, and Great Christopher Walken. With such a welding, one can only expect the best. However, nobody with "jealousy" can save the disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stealer) and Nick Vanderpark (black) are the best friends and colleagues in a sandpaper factory. Both are living a decent life, but because of better performance in team work, he is able to achieve more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always brings new ideas for innovation. One day, Nick brings the idea of ​​spray canes that makes dogs disappear (yes, I'm serious). Fall with love with the idea, Nick decided to really discover this product. He makes an offer of investment and profit 50/50 percent of the team to his ideas. The team thinks that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, titled "Ghost-Pool-Rise" (again, I'm serious), eliminates millions of people. He spent his money on things like a big house, a horse, a personal trainer and a fertile desert. Tom Nick started to feel jealous for. So the name of the movie is <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it's still awful. This movie contains the worst conversations and all the poor performances from Cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Playing a homeless character called "Je-Man", even the Great Christopher Walken made this movie fun. The movie is bad from the beginning and is just going to be bad. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie: * You like bad (no curse) * You want to see jack black in white box <br /> <br /> I say, to avoid all costs at the moment, but Especially to avoid: * You get offended by bathroom humor * You love animals
