I first saw this movie on MST 3. And even though I laugh at my previous smile at Jokes, I do not particularly think this movie was bad. Certainly it was difficult to understand that it was quite a budget, but it was a hit-like plot and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MSST 3K version, I had real entertainment. This movie is a cry for a Hollywood remix.
