By all accounts, it can be an interesting film. Containing a score of the defeated Cradle of Firth, acting in front of him, and being promoted as the "future of British horror," I hope to survive the campaign of Alex Chandon's cow festival. <br /> <br /> I was wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything about this image is either cliche or ineligible. In seventeen and eighteen years, the short story booklet was completed (and better) of death. Confessed, the 'sick cell' concept sent cold to my spine, but most of the images were written and played by bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Can not write sandal dialogue Every sentence with a major police investigator is filled with oath and inaccuracy (usually the 'tip of the knee' formula.) Funny, I'm sure I saw it somewhere else ...) No moonlight, you are not tarantino. Or scorsese. It sounds BAD Add oticely to the odd acting with very strange casting (do not make me wrong, Danny Firth is a great singer and musician, but not the actor) and the performances are humorous about the slow downside. Give me Bruce Campbell day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects on all the poor, some shocking CGIs, for terrible dominant influences (for righteousness sake, Peter Jackson did well and budget less than ten years ago) and over-use shriek that made the filter! Often the wrong use of the score of the Cradle of Firth ... people, they should be sued. <br /> <br /> The horrific horror fundamental problem is to take it seriously, to create environment and to encourage terrorism. Repulsion in his audience Many of the best horror films made in seventy and eighteen years will make it even better with the effects of this so much (for example: crazy, junk meat eaters, outer worlds, sauseria etc.), scary pedals in my mind, second rate and obsolete <br /> <br /> I hope the moon can learn from this horrible horse of a photo and create some fearful scary which is really scary II. <br /> <br /> Good luck next time.
