Ben and Arthur have been 10. Sam Morovich wrote, ordered, watched and made this movie. Sam has to act as a good writer, director to give his ideas and act as one who can act. This whole production control is a good example of one person. There was no one to tell him, "Sam is bad, really bad". <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabbel's performance was the only good point, but she was a good director, and better. To work with the actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Morovic should be attached to the chair and this movie was made to watch (twice). Acting and direction was so bad, this movie turned into a comedy. You just had to laugh, and in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> a good second point .... it will be a great date movie. After the first two minutes, allow you to watch the movie and pay more attention to your date!
