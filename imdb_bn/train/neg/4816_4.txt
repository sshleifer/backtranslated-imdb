I'm thinking that young people involved in the creation of "Necromancy" (the lawyer "The Witching" and a bunch of other titles) felt a bit weird on a horror film set with a man who participated with John Hustmann: a proletarian game ("Pedal Will Rock" ") In production; The man was afraid that Alira was attacking ("War of World War"); And directed and played the greatest movie of all time ("Citizen Bought"). And now Osan Welles is acting on a third party flick about a devilish religion. <br /> <br /> Basically there is nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but background music always proved truly confusing. Although the film was not particularly expected, it was not yet viewable. How much was Welles? Thankfully, for the final thirty years of his life, he described the documentary about "Bug Bunny Superstar" (about 1940's Warner Bros cartoons) and hosted the documentary "The Man the Som Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend those two, but this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> She also starred Pamela Franklin and Michael Atak.
