I do not know why I do it myself! I'm going to defend the Dutch and Belgian films and claim that it will get more credits and chances ... and then they will tear you around the head with this kind of junk! Intensive care is a terrific production and probably the worst thing made in Dutch-speaking countries. This is a Dutch effort to create our very franchise franchise, evidently based on the 13th and the original American Streener American Slasher Classic as Halloween. The producer and author are really high targets with this, but really fell short. Intrinsic care became an embarrassing product for everyone involved and therefore a true worship flush here. It is almost impossible to find an original copy of it and it is only shown on special occasions such as "accidental night". For exactly 5 minutes, intensive care tells a story and even trying to create a platinum ... then it changes with a lame and low brain slash 'n dalpala movie - still creates very ridiculous and cheap - effects. The whole cast performance is hateful, though it has some honorable names. The leading male role is played by Coen Wauters ... This guy can be the most famous and preferred artist among Belgium. She hosts a favorite singer, TV show and statues of many young girls. Although he never mentions these things in acting, though. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince himself that there is no intense care.
