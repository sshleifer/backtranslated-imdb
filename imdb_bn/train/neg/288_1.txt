There was nothing worth the price in the original movie, it was even Lama's. I was absolutely amazing that even the rental it was available. Anyone connected to this photo will be high! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? The audience was supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes. Sorry, I tried several times to see this. I borrow a baby from someone to get some feedback. The child said, it was stupid, and he was four years old. I could probably go to some credit filming director, maybe some of the shots made more than a film film. That might push it. I love the theme song The best thing was that it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I think if you enjoy the movie then you want to be as cast and crew as high. Pot is legal in France?
