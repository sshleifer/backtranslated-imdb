Stereotype, derivative, origins and boring Western. Two popular stars (Charlton Haston and James Coburn) have both performances that are far and away from their best; They have the characteristics of character and role characterized mainly by both dialogues. Heston is a sheriff who "used well before the world" and Coburn was a criminal who "stopped him and was forced to pay his debt". In addition, Heston is so old that he has trouble with the horse around the horse and the cobbler is moderately and hard but not as bloody as a murderer like some minor villains. Apparently, filmmakers could not even come up with an original idea about how to create this film somewhat differently. (* 1/2)
