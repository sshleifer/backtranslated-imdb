This movie made me very angry. I wanted to "scientists" and at this time intensively disintegrate filmmakers. Sit through very, very painful. The worst is sophomoric and pretentious. Little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in the new Aggi Horse sh * t sea. The worst offenders are Crack Potter Charlton Ramte and Joseph Dispenja. Mr. Dispena tells us that most people lead the life of mediation and clearly state that they are living in higher flat areas on the other. Even in fact, I agree with the opinions and attitudes that have been presented in such a huge interference, crooked, ambitious, ungodly, propagandist way that I felt the desire to deny them. I think this has made me so angry that they have taken deep insights into the true scientific thought and beat them with their new age. This is mostly based on the breakdown of the application of the concept of quantum theory in macro world. Dramatic parts with Marley Matlin are in amateur and cliche streets. <br /> <br /> I will mention people instead of Bill Bryson's excellent survey of science: "A brief history of almost everything." There is great deep wonder about life and the universe in real, established science.
