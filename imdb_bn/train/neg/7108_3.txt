After seeing the credit with just one name and the director of this movie (Ras Conway), I did not expect much from this movie and I was not frustrated. A man is planning to kill his new wife that he believes in other people that he is insane and will take his own life. On the contrary, the husband is unknown that the plastic pillar he uses, on the contrary, a ghost of a woman apparently retaliated by his first dead wife and using an actual skull. At the end a simple plot with a clique of ironic. If you get tired one night and need to sleep, then it will help sleeping sleep.
