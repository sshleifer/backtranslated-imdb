<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He went to the house, walked around and finally wrote a note that he went there. This scene does not matter, and we do not learn anything about home or its history. <br /> <br /> It can never be told at home or where people have gone, but our impression has been that Hazel probably lived there once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decided to go to the city. Why - We do not know. Once he arrived in this city, he wrote a name and address on a bathroom wall and went out to meet this woman, who is a surprisingly fat hooker. He looked at him for a while and then apparently did not meet him again. Like all other things in this movie, it does not come up and does not work for any purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Hanok tries to befriend him, but hejel is not really interested, even though they are passing the route. <br /> <br /> Hanok can get you as crazy. His habit of going to a zoo and standing in front of the cage and speaking in front of him in front of them humiliated. <br /> <br /> We really know why he did not behave as Enoch, or why Hazel behaved as he did, then Hazel spent his old days of horror, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Hanok later joined a person who wears a gorilla suit and managed to get Gorilla. A suit from her and then she continues around. <br /> <br /> Some of the road propaganda seems to be that Hazel, which is rather hardly harmful and has a continuous border outrage. I was thinking that he was trying to free himself from the religion he had said to himself. <br /> <br /> There have been several confrontations with his preacher and his daughter, though their interaction is not particularly special. Dot, and no plot line. Finally, Hejel started suicide to complete religious exhortation. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the film, the n-word is often associated with the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
