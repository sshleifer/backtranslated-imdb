The boy is related to the love relationship / song, at the moment he is crank and he is straight arrow. Movie-buffs really like this movie? Is it a fan? I must say, the mind gets soft ... "Greece 2" is a really long enterprise that does not have the courage, boldness or sadness to remember his brave (like "Gosses II" or "Exorcist II"). No, it plays whippers along with slower and often dead only. It shows up and feels cheaper, with a big cast lost in dirty directions and unnecessary handling. It got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer for a first time and, even though she did not embarrass herself, forget about it, the role of a role. Dimension is a misfire at minimum. **** No Star
