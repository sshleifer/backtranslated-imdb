I missed this movie in the movie but there was some idea behind my head that it was a look, so when I saw in the DVD, I felt "time to watch". Big mistake <br /> <br /> The big list can not save Turkey, of course one of the worst movies. An inappropriate plot is poorly distributed and presented badly. Perhaps if I used to read Robinson's novel, I doubt if the film is completely different with the novel, and in helping Robins screenplaces, the novel must be read incompatible. br>> <br /> I hope the actors have been given a good salary because they felt embarrassed for the deluge of celluloid and more recently, DVD plays, for example, Pat Murita. Even Thurman also seems uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Drag yourself to do something better for yourself, like tiring your toes or decorating your shock drawer near your 98 minutes. Even when you see it in your local store "below $ 5", see it, even then rebuke!
