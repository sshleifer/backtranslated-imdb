I usually write reviews for movies I really hate or really love. And, you can probably tell from there big numbers, I did not like it. Up to now, I guess you read this plot or even saw the movie, so I will remove the summary. Let's break them down, professional and disaster: <br /> Cons: Concept: The set was set to be interesting. Using a Chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, it does not carry so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the idea of ​​Choice is incorrectly presented. More than what happened in the movie happened. I think the Butterfly Effect is completely presented "can bring back the god of god Tsunami." The presentation comes off though really sloppy. Some people call this intelligent, but it seems to be another sued-up action film. <br /> <br /> Story: Is it just me, or think Kamal blames only ten players in playing together? The plot arises very much; Govinda lost many ghosts in an accidental accident (his friend just happened to mix roots with a package sent to India, a crazy lady just throws a scarf in a statue, half of the welding will be unexpectedly met in the same hospital, and the statue meets a famous singer. It happens. <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh God, CGI It was worse than the special effects of Law 3, and those who sucked. + Okay, whatever part I can say is animated, even my ten-year-old cousin knows that the car does not show up under the water. <br /> <br /> Stunt: Yes, the action scenes I have in Tamil movies are not realistic, but these stunts were terrible and confused me from the story. <br /> Up: I have to admit that RA than expected did a good job. I thought Kemal, the same skin tone, with people playing, so the fake white boys and fake Japanese aikodo me to guard. However, it's still pretty bad, and I can easily say that none of the masks was wearing. <br /> <br /> Songs: The songs were confusing and in many respects. Seen: His character is probably one of the most annoying movies. He was obsessed with loud, ditsy, and idol that was irrational. <br /> <br /> Plot hole and refrigerator logic: Let me get this straight: a lab monkey was smart enough to hold a password-locked door, but not enough to say. The difference between chocolate bars and a rock with a deadly virus in it. And then, a former CIA agent, who was led by the scales of India's sculpture. Instead of following it soon, she first married a pole dancer. A famous Punjabi singer, with cancer, examines the hospital in a small town in third world when he easily gets the best medical treatment. In addition, he got shot soles with a bullet. You think he will die, but instead, the magic bullet cleared his tumor. You read that right, knocked out a bullet Tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Prose ... Naidu Character: Perhaps the only favorite part of the movie was his comedy.
