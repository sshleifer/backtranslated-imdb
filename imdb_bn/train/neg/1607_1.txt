The genius used for the purpose of this "documentary" meaning is a proof. The Venezuelan government pays it that this terrible day of April 2002 in Venezuela lacks legitimacy to search for the truth, even if we do not know the Venezuelan people. <Br> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the managers of these elements are both mistaken and by knowledge both lie. <br /> <br /> Venezuela's political process is very complex for easy understanding by foreign audiences, and they take advantage of it. For example, * potential spibblers * They were shooting at an empty street (what they did?) As a way to tell someone to kill them, but they did not bother showing Chavez protesters. Here, anti-protesters (and a journalist) are "empty" dead or injured on the other side of the road. The political mobilizer can not explain the only helper authorized to fly to Caracas on that day, nothing can do against the snipers in the roof of the presidential palace, which can show little inefficiency. Security measures for the security of the President. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military in the national parliament (in our congress) was asked why they did not work against snipers and he said, "because they were not there to work." President, is this not a confession? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nowadays Chavez's administration's internal affairs minister. <br /> <br /> I will receive thousands of words to describe all the lies of this "documentary" created by the intention of selling this world. The picture of the good basics Hugo Chavez, who ruled for the poor and the poor rich opposition party, wants him everywhere, when 60-70% of the people actually reject his government and include those percent of the poor <br /> <br /> I hope that those who have seen it and are buying it can see a different version which is b b, a group of Venezuela is not showing less than 30 falsities. <br /> <br /> Nazi campaign is back!
