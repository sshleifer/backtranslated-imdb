I could not read Shirley Jackson's novel yet, I'm going to do some of it for a while. I'm sure it's frustrating than the movie. I once saw when I think jumping, even though I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> Special effects were very good and I saw the DVD, but the theater was sure that it was a great scene. After the first few special effects were completed, I was waiting for a story development. <br /> <br /> I must have this picture based on at least a classic novel, so there should be a good story, but it was not. Basically I looked at the character of the pretty cathrine jet-jones throughout the movie, because there was nothing else to watch the watch. Lily Tola was such a sticky character. I liked her one bit, something about whiny men. Also, the man in this movie reminds me of the cartoon and doodle dowry with voice and mouth. I can not relate to all the letters. Quigon, Ahmed Liam Neeson has done a commendable job of trying to get through this movie with some acting. <br /> <br /> I was on the way to see a campy on 13% or Friday Friday just half the three quarters of the way. Skin Quinn Film! At least there are some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story there, at least they meet it with serious death or interesting women. This was nothing. <br /> <br />
