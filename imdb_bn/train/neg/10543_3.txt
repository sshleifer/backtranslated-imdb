The first strength that's really going to be given is to give Jeff Kabar a wonderful kind of play in his 25 years of psychological villain. Labor Bettger is a qualified heir who is part of those who return 50% to the Kerry. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough, the first power has a specialty catching a souped up slashher serial killer who is lost as Lou LHD's detective. It's his latest catch, but there is a lower league with the Kobe League and they are going to the team and making the life of Laurie make it sad. Although the gas chamber was given to Kaber, his soul returned to all kinds of rumor. <br /> <br /> Michaelly William Lur is holding hands as a partner, who has got a nasty ending like a horse with a monster and a tragic Griffith. As a nun with insight, Elizabeth and Elizabeth Arlen are almost helping Lou. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lou really trapped in Turkey Fall. Maybe Satan would make this picture to him.
