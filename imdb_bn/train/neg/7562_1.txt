I did not see the original, but I wanted to skip a quick note for anyone to scroll to: Wicker Man, the worst movie of this year. Even two years may even happen. I hope I can not ask for a drama for my money back or I can not warn myself to warn myself. <br /> <br /> I'll give it two positive feelings: the limitations of the character of Kegiri were at least a smile and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Come here jeers. The film's plot is directed only to move because other characters do not give any direct answers - and he keeps it with !!! How can this movie work for an hour of my time (very few days in the movie) outside of me <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough inappropriate questions to fill a library. Anyone can read this script and think, "Yes, people will have to pay 11 dollars to see how this image will look like this galaxy." <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not see this flick. Or even rent DVDs.
