I tried to watch this movie twice and both of these times I could not make it to the last credit. For the first time I was able to sit in the first war, then lost interest. For the second time I forced myself to act uncomfortable, long SFX and very poor hours to digest. Pulse compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone heard of the old brick timber 2600 Fiasco? For those who did not let you get me admitted It is 1982 ... It is one of the largest box office memorabilia of all time ... They decide to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. The game is big time to spend a long and financially painful story, and as a result, more than 2,600 AT Games are land dumped in landfill because they do not sell them. <br /> <br /> What does the universal soldier do: With this story back? Look at 3.2 ratings and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> terrible movie ... IMDb has forced me to give 1 out of 10 because their rating systems are not as low as 0. In Negative.
