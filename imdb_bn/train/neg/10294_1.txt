<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not allowed, because this movie is not even there. There is no "no" in this movie because there is no plot or character or theme or idea or symbol or discussion or dialog or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it's a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the film is properly so that it is not worth your time while watching, so if you are really interested, then I would like to buy and recommend sandwich or something. Without all the fatigue, headache and unhappiness, you can do whatever you can from this movie. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
