This will be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it was still supposed to be right up my lane; Hell, I like the movie "Congo," and "Alan Quotermen". I have a soft spot for my stupid alien / giant / adventure movie. I decided to go on to why it decided to visit it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Awful / Sci-fi is almost always my intrigues. I am a big fan of archeology, and this movie is involved in a rare treasure. 3. Super natural enemies with quality FX. 4. I usually enjoy Christian Slater and drawers. 5. They are hot to read. <br /> <br /> So there was a possible possibility for this film in the cheese-heavy part of the video store, but the boy started licking the ass. Slater and Dorf have the only release points, and I do not find everyone like them as entertaining ... I mean, face it, both are melodramatic. But now many mistakes in <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> they ride. Although the movie is completely bad, Reid's performance is really awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about his ride nomination for the worst performance of the year. I do not know whether she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curacort simply out of her league ... completely. While trying to carry the roll, the educated scientist, you were not much different than you were going to see the setup in bad porn. I mean not just bad, it's ridiculous. Oh, and those who are weird for you, they do not get naked, just a stupid, totally unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with the performance of Reed, the movie might work, but the plot is influential and the plot seems to be 10 years old. I did not understand it was a video game adaptation until watching the DVD, otherwise I would appreciate the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The story ran away from Starter's orphanage, where he received some terrible flashbacks that had actually happened, he certainly had a hunger. In his adult life, some of the slaughter units were employed by 713, an unusual military that apparently hated evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was very rebellious, I guess, you never know that it was among the voice-overs when I zoned out. The film begins with Slaughter Hunting Artifacts, after collecting some of its latest pieces, "for the sale of rare antiquity to the Chilean mercenary forces". I can make the correct quote wrong, but you can get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a bad doctor who wants to eradicate some hell of the world (no reason), test on children, super giant / foreign-human hybrid, "photonic bullet" (monster can not stand sunlight) and Of course, to try to save Slater and Dorf. <br /> <br /> JC, I can not be clich√©d element. To narrow the focus to the script and provide some depth, there is a complete resurrection. I mean, why this evil scientist is so bad? Oh right, man is destroyed and he is just trying to save the human race. I feel he is infected? How did that happen? Oh okay he's one of the evil giant things in a cage and shoot his blood shoot itself. How did that happen? Why and where he got the Super Slug (oh yeah, they used the old science-fai stand by paracetic alien / giant that "rash" with the backbone of their host), slaughter is blades, half-super-slog powered, but its slug "a Do not fuse due to electrical shock, "Thank God. Oh, and these "mixed" thorns, they do not act as a good-minded monster and community members until they have given a secret signal, from there they make the zombie of the killers. Yes we get zombies <br /> <br /> So bad that can be entertaining, but it's no one. <br /> <br /> Also, the ending can be all-out as stupid, a big deal that can be fixed at first ... at least some dynamite can not cope. <br /> <br /> The worst thing that you will not see, but a bad movie.
