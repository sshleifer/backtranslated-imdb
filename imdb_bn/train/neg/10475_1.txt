I am the wife of a young priest and we have taken some young people to see this picture. We then spent an hour explaining to them. They did not get it and I did not enjoy it. It is an idea that is based on the three main religions of the world (code in the Bible code, the Torah Code and the code in the Koran) and it is suspicious to be ridiculous. This is not a step forward for the Christians in the arts, but it is one step ahead for them who believe that we check our brain at the door.
