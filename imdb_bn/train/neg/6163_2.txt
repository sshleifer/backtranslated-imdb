Hooper is not funny, not romantic, romantic and non-informative. There is no real drama. You will think that there will be some drama of one of the world's greatest Stantman films, an effort but it does not seem to be real. No character study, no lesson learned, there was no real fun of the actors, they were trying to work as fun. You do not want to see Burt and there is no reason to see that Sally does not want to get a glimpse of occasionally. The horse was beautiful and he was supposed to do what it was. Actor was the best actor in this film. Smoky and Bandit were funny movies that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste time
