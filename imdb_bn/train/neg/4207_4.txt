Ghost Town Starts with Kate Barrett (Catherine Hickland) traveling along an isolated desert road, her car suddenly collapses and the horses are reduced ... Riverton's Deputy Sheriff Langley (Frank Loose) is called to investigate the disappearance of Kate. Dad reported in his absence. He found out the broken car and was looking for him, unfortunately his car was broken and he had to walk. Langley ended up in a deserted randown Scratch Town, his shock Langley very soon discovered that it is a literally a Scrut City as it is not populated by his former inhabitants Scratch and is not driven by the evil Devlin (Jimmy F. Skaggs) to explain the causes Kate has been kidnapped and to save her from Langley and to finish the curse of the city ... <br /> <br /> The only and direct directive of this strange film I really did not do a lot of effort in this weird movie, and I do not like all of it. Dook Sandfur script tries to mix horror and western styles that are not for a great effect. Have you ever wondered why there is no more horrible western hybrid movie? Well, not me, but if I ask myself such questions, then Gost Town will find all the answers because it is not very good. The two styles just do not mix well that. There is a lot of things in the West, innocent civilians who are afraid to stand up to a gang of terrorists, firing on the main street, along with the slogan door and damp climbing along the slopes, and utterly overcrowded, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking of dead bodies and some violent There are killings. I was very frustrated, I think there is nothing worse than that, it is just neutral and with it the two sections will not sit together. Plot has some holes, why did Dlin kidnap? I know he does the same to his previous girlfriend, but how did he know what he would do to her? We never know why these ghosts are filled with ghosts, I mean what they have put there and they have returned as ghosts? Then after delivering Delin, after what he has to say, he can not kill him for a few seconds afterwards, meaning that bullets did not work in the first place? <br /> <br /> The governor is okay, there is a wonderful horror movie atmosphere with some brightly lit cobweb strewn sets and the Standard Hollywood Western city is located on the central street with the wooden house beside it. I would not call it scary because it is not there, there is not much tension and the film is dragged to the place even after more than 80 minutes. Forget about Gore, there are some bloody gunfight wounds, one after the other, with a thunder in their neck, and some who steal with the metal poles. <br /> <br /> I thought the budget was too small here, it was made arbitrarily and if there is nothing else, then it is capable. Credits where credits are set fairly well during the time dress and set credits. Acting is ok but no one can win any prize. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Anyone looking for the West will be disturbed with stupid elements, when someone searches for horror films, it will be disturbed by Western elements. It's a bit different, but it's not nonsense that it means any good, if you're frustrating, but do not keep an eye on it.
