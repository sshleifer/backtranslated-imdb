The word failed me. <br /> <br /> And it's not common. <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, it might be great, the wonderful explosion B-Film Sci-Fi, but sadly, it was not there. Very rarely in the field of drama many skilled actors struggle so vainly with such a dog-a script breakfast. I can only support the comments of past critics - clean the bathroom. Actually do something other than seeing this image. <br /> <br /> Positives: Lucy Biemann's nose. Negative: Everything else. <br /> <br /> Most azoid lines: "It's not going anywhere". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
