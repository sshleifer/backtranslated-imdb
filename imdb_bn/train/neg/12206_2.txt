I did not see many reasons for this detail in the film. Sylvester Stallone has again secretly returned to Vietnam after being recruited by prisoner John Rambo, author of "Hell in a Season" and survived by Major Richard Krena, his only friend, pictures of American prisoners are still considered terrible. Shib, and the enemy returned without engaging. <br /> <br /> The possibility of fat. Was he really or did he take pictures, and he would tear? Who will come to watch the movie? <br /> <br /> This is basically the celebration of Stalin muscles. For the preparation of his mission, we found his oily muscles. (They are oily and covers across.) The style worn on black skin, ugly guns, and even the masked knife. Black guns are cleaned, they are assembled together in pairs, and nearly oily as Stallone's muscles. Bow is tested and, yes, it has enough pounds to run a bolt through the enemy's forehead. The knife was torn and stolen with a knife. <br /> <br /> Stalin and one of his pounds were betrayed by one or two Washington lawsuits, enemy politicians, who can bet you, even in boxing. Grammar School No frustration, you know? Just sit beside their feet on the table and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> That's what the movie does, but that is what makes it sad. It was deliberately caught in the legend of the legendary legend in the mid-1980s that there were countless numbers of MIA kept quietly in the silent camp in North Vietnam. Bumper stickers were all-round. (Our MIA is free.) Why would they keep them? It was never advisable, but perhaps to convert POWs into a slave labor force - in a country where there is no other resources than labor. Or perhaps in the United States as an instrument for insulting their pricing - a campaign weapon to keep secret from the Vietnamese world. <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Vietnam is treated in North Medieval Ramboux. Due to her puberty, she picks up her wrist with her wrist, her muscles are still displayed. Then, Suhuman is not affiliated with Vietnam, a Russian officer has been brought to play in the part of the Gestapo Officer - "Remember that halfway." Using a hi-tech type, Russian psychology and electricity, not just dry dumps. <br /> <br /> Rambo comes back and declares that he does not want to drift intentionally unless "this country loves us as much as we love". Vats returned from Vietnam also raised another mythical concept of hatred and disgust, so I think we have elected the Congress many and have appointed others as high-ranking positions. The last three defeated presidential candidates were among the trivial groups. At least Rambo's purpose drifting left cell is open for a single pic, which quickly reached. <br /> <br /> Action films with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were fanciful by advertising but Rambo was ridiculous. It dual goes to March through its fantasy ideological swimming, killing without mercy, can speak only, can only speak. Talking is a sign of weakness.
