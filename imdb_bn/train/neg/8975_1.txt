... like watching a couple films, I came out of the theater to see this. Hmm, a good sign, but who knows? Different strokes for different people, after all. Well, no, no. They are kind of being Godard has published an action that is sensual (entertainment), entertainment (band of exotic), sometimes both (to save my life). It just grows on dull intellectualism, which very quickly nerves. At the time of my appearance, literally half of the audience went to the end of the film. Only if I was so wise.
