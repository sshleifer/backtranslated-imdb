Tom Wolff, New York Snobbery's novel, The Novel of Life, enjoys a shiny look but still does not serve well. This movie is not only the worst loss of Tom Hans, but also the UPS, Kappie-puppet Melanie Griffith suffers as Manipulative South Bell and Bruce Willis (?!), As the darling of New York's literature. The most serious miscasting director was on the chair. Robert Altman could breathe life into these unlikely characters and was attractive to them, but Brian de Palma, for all his visual sociability, had ever had eyes for the man's experience. As a result the film looks good but Blah on the side of favor favor dehumanization seems to think. Indeed, if the mockery does not make the audience angry, what is the point?
