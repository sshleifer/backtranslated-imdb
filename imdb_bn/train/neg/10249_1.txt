What can I say about this movie other than "do not see it"? I wait and wait and wait for someting (or something) to happen and it just does not. While recording most of the filer screen in single movie, two people look amazingly like a walk What are they doing Do they solve a mystery? Are they collecting signals? Probably, it's hard to tell. At the end of the film, many radio signals were decoded (illegally on PET monitor) and this guy gave some speeches, the plot was finally published and removed as soon as possible. Some aliens want to go back to the ostrich in their home world and they are so happy that they want to blow the earth (I think they are not worth sharing). I think they have finished filming and have seen their 35-minute work or art (trash) and have decided that they will allow the editor to turn the crew into an 88-minute feature film. See in your own danger, it's not even funny because it's too bad, it's just bad.
