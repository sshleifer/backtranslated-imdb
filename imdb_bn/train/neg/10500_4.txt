I've never been a bright spectator of "Crocodile Hunter", but occasionally seen an episode, or an episode, and in 2006 I was attracted by the news of Steve Irwin's death when Sting's attack spread. This film, with Steve and his wife Terry, was played in a fantasy story, but was released in 2002, but after several years I did not hear it, even after this I took some time. It's almost to see Well, now I have seen it, and after seeing it here (more than once), and seeing its rating, I was not surprised to wonder, surprised, though it could be a good BIT. Apparently, it is supposed to be a comedy, so this is not a very interesting issue with it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Swallowed by a crocodile! Steve and Terry Irene are in the mission to catch the chickens from where the madness becomes terribly terrorized on a farm owned by Crazy Browzy Drury, and he is not aware of what's inside, two CIA agents are sent to Australia to recover Bacon. ! Agents assist with Joe Buckley and the farmhouse owner and his dogs make the mission more difficult for them! In Steve and Terry's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just crocodiles, and they do not have any sources that there is something unusual in the cracks, when Steve looks after them after the CIA agent, he makes mistakes for their victims! <br /> <br /> I did not smile when watching this movie, the only part that made me laugh was that Steve Irwin used a big snake to scare one of the CIA agents. Even then, I do not think that I even found a little warm smile. As it is behind the CIA headquarters from Australian Outback, it is an incompatible mess, and it seems like clips from "Crocodile Hunter" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) for some reason. Also think that the mix of the farm is added to the farm, from somewhere else, and as funny as the brogue Drewitt played by Magda Szubanski, he is supposed to say that. At one stage, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a major clich√© in the modern comedy! They are so hard to resist?! I have found "Crocodile Hunter" scenes with Steve Wrestling Crocodile and holding other dangerous creatures and I think it's tiring to speak to the audience, but I think I'm never a fan of the show. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why do not you have any side, "Crocodile Hunter: Clash Course" is not a well-matched movie. I'm sure that if you're a fan of Big Steve Irons, it helps you, but if you're also one, then you will not get a guarantee that you would like this movie because some fans were not clearly affected. Actually, some of them seem to be worse than me, so maybe this will not help. I said, there is no guarantee. I can think of Steve Irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. Unfortunately, the attempt to unify the "Crocodile Hunter" that is usually seen with an imaginary story has failed, and a viewer sees that this movie takes more than 90 minutes!
