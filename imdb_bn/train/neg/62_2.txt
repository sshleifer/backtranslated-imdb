Swing! This is an important film because it is one of the remaining black-produced and played films of the 1930s. Many of these movies have become so bad that they are ineligible, but it's pretty good. It's a wonderful opportunity to see only some talented black actors after the Happy Cub of the old cotton club - it's still forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's a mess. The main plot is similar to the Hollywood songs of the era - with a prima donna, which destroys Shara and is unknown unknown, unknown from what it can protect from any day. However, the text is only awkward and somewhat annoying - and images of images of black America that might seem somewhat unusual. Because before this plot is actually gone, you are treated with an account account, who closes its hard working wife (popular stereotype of time) and when he is smiling (who, however, completely overload this role), they are a war Which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, a woman wants to spend the other woman with a straight razor - actually a trash scene! Later on in the film, when the first donna behaved abusively, her husband hit her face and everyone congratulated her! Looks like movies, sometimes the audience wants to appeal to the lowest common majority PLUS they can not work very well - I've seen several bad performances. <Br/> <br /> However, if you can keep an eye on a hungry product in almost every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), it can be a shiny valuable so that you see excellent songs and dance dancing - as well as caught a glimpse of forgotten black culture. Just do not say I've warned you about acting - it's really, really bad!
