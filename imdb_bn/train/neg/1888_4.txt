This movie reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another artwork film with a violent and fundamentalist approach to human nature. I did not like the movie but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I would like to remind me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where there is a bunch of lower classes of residents of Belgian coastal communities. The same story of the people living together, along with their will, as well as all the clashes in the letter which do not match together. I think of the books of French author Emil Jolar, who was the author of nature's nature. I do not like the movie and I do not like people like it. They seem so rude, without all the basic good taste. Someone might question why they live, they are all a big minor member on this planet, living up against their will. Or you can say: hell on this world.
