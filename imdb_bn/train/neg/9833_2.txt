False suspect, John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddie Chandler (as Kansas Charlie) were identified as "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" in the skirt-chasing kiss. Mr. Wayne became "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is considered "Rev. Smith", but Owen calls him "Dr. Smith". Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy are no longer entertaining; However, Owen may be considered infinitely more successful than any of them. Beautiful blonde Mary Cormanman (as Annie), "Our gang" grew from his days, a lovely interest for Owen. He and Chandler have some beautiful scenes with Owen. If you are not a supporter of John Wayne in the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
