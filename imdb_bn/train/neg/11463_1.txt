This is only a response to Yahoo, who says that the film is more realistic than the classic, MapperPies, the Gaus-defining genre. Yes, the brain, the great white (and sharks, calves, black-tip, ocean white tip, other species of tigers) have been known to populate easy-to-find areas. People often do not make it in the menu, but the film shark is repeatedly directed to behave abnormal behavior. It's not like it happened. A killer whale almost destroyed the whole city, singling out a human kindness, dipping a few dozen thick sinks to the north Atlantic liner boat and knowing all the friends of the previous "kindness", reaching a complete city destroy, when it is near enough to water, as ridiculous So thin. Most of these fake counterfeit turkeys Ridiculous Great white sharks are often referred to as hats on people in protective water cages and rafts and surfboards, they look like seals from the bottom. A shark of Bruce-shaped (see if you do not know it) Do not be able to sink a boat like Oraca (Hey! We're talking about that!) It's going to be 6,000 pounds upwards. I could go, but I do not have to. Jazz is amazing (good acting, good music, good writing), orka shit (Josh, lazy writing, disgusting effect, Olsson Twin is the most ridiculous plot in this part of Flickr). It does not see the master of Columbia University. See good movies.
