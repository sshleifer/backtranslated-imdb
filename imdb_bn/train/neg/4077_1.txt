Bad acting, bad direction, scenery that are lasting, terrible light, painful edits and what do you get out of the terrible effects? You've got Jessica: A Ghost Story looks like his shot at Batamam, which is fine, but in light, this medium has to be appreciated. In this case it is not. There are several CUs where the person's face is completely shaded. Especially a scene of psychiatry scene. If you ask me it's a joke Some scenes were so long that they could easily cut half ... but I guess they will not have a movie in the feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the main man, so his character should have some "hero" element, but he does not. She whines and the whole film is scared. I could go, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the light was terrible, I must say that their camera movement was good. Very bad light it is not appreciated. The DVD cover is excellent, and it is where the end is. Just terrible
