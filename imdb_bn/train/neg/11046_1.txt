This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, everything bad In the last 15 minutes, a cat-appropriate cyber-community is introduced that imitates everything. Malcolm McDowell must be required to pay the home because otherwise he will have to sell himself in Hollywood Blood to pay the bill. I do not know how you can go to this rough part from Clockwork Orange and be able to see yourself in the mirror every morning. I could have a better effect on my bathroom. There is no continuity. The editor is asleep or the drugs are so bad. Working, they have to smoke to be bad. The gun creates your mind, by shooting blue fire or bullets. The bad girl in the movie and the other girl look so similar that it is confusing, who is called the 2013 Saddleley Wake. The movie does not have any relation with it
