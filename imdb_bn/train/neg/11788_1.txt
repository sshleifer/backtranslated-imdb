This is one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the Hollywood movie! The plot was so sugar; Especially the end. This movie protects from global catastrophe-The Yale! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use sock patches for eagles! And in the middle of the middle this was a horrible kiss scene, which had two main characters scattered. How guessable! My mother, my sister, and I was so terrible that I could not finish it, and when we could finish it, almost a year later! The second time we saw it and we finished it, we gave MST3K-like feedback across the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: You see it only when you're sitting in the movie! Smile comment, see this watch laughing, and I mean big smiles. Also watch for fun. This movie is a metaphorical paraphrase: this movie is a fascinating field full of cheese and shock dolls!
