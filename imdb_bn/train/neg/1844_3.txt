Personally I think this show looks quite cheaply. Some of the actors are terrible. They seem to do it and fake it I can always say how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less because they make it clearer. It is not very well written. I watch it laugh at it. You say "is it so bad that it is good?" Well, who says this show is applicable. I want to fix it when I just think how it will end. So far I have been correct every time. This is a small game that I play. It's nice when you get annoyed and feel like you smile at something.
