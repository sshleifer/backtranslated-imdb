What ........... is it? It must, of course, be the greatest waste of time in movies, settings and cameras. I know you can not set your expectations for the high 80's slash, but it's too stupid to be true. I paid this movie for $ 0.89 and still felt the desire to return my money. Can you imagine who is it difficult? <br /> <br /> Who is a violent killer in this movie and what is his inspiration? Well in fact, you can not take care less. And why should you? This piece of garbage does not care for manufacturers. They do not try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's much easier to find money with its name) also created kindred (1986) which was rather enjoyable and recently he made the living alive. As well as complete shit, but at least that was one Eliza Dushku. This Junk Duffen Zuniger debuts !!! (Who ??) Yes, OK, Melrose Place Chick. His very memorable character died about 15 minutes. After opening credit. He is the second person to die The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but who does care to mention him or miss him later? The rest of the actors ... they are not really the actor's word, totally selfish. You expect them to die fast and painful ... and only their letters <br /> <br /> My modest views = 0/10
