... then they will have a right place to file this nasty file. Sorry, as a "mystery" does not claim, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. I have been waiting for the "unexpected evil" wait for the promise I made, but only 5 years old is unavailable with this storm of "bad" education. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that they are actually willing to get involved in feeling embarrassed, managed to find some big name actors. Unfortunately it forever changed my opinion about them, and perhaps they could avoid doing anything in the future. I cried a little bit now that I remember the name of the author and the director's name because I would avoid any thing from now on which they still prefer plague. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that everyone here is posting religious fans and says that 10 out of 10 movies, etc. their reviews will be posted first. This may lead to more people being cheated, as I believed that the film was something other than religious propaganda. <br /> <br /> Close the video store to get my money back for false propaganda. Very bad they could not give me back this 105 minutes that I saw the idea that this is actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
