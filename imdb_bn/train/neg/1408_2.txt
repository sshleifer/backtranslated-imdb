I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a miracle". It shows that this movie is ten times worse than "life ...". I think the director / author is kidding with the audience: "Show me how many vulnerabilities you can hold (listen to)". The dialogue is empty, ... the scene is easy. In a few moments, photography is really nice. Some satirical lines are semi-funny, but genuinely it's hard to laugh at the time of "comedy". I finally laughed at myself to be able to watch the movie. You can lift yourself above this director's fiasco, ... You've played some legendary (Miki Manojlovic, Alkler Bercek), and Emir's son striker Kusturica's very good performance. <br /> <br /> Brief: Very bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica should still be making young and top rated movies. Instead, he liked my personal movie theater for this small budget, with the arrogant attitude of the world's trends and negligence of its old fans.
