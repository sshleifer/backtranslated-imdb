One of the cornerstones of low-budget movies is a well known, classic storyline and it is creating a complete chaos. Phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriters accept the permanent sweetheart of the opera story and it comes to the shopping shopping mall of '80. However, the "phantom" target is now only to take revenge on the person who is responsible for the separation of his face and the killing of his family. Special effects provide a good chocolate, especially when the body part starts to appear in the dish from the yogurt stand. Paoli Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be completely objectionable, because in most cases his 15-minute MTV fame did not come. If you are looking for some good laughs to spend the crew of actors and special effects, check out this glance. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
