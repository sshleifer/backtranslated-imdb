God ... where to start I was able to stomach only the first 10 minutes before I stopped it in hatred. Actor Robin Hood played the role, the rest were just terrible. And, I can only extend suspension suspension. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the first episode, I counted the number of mistakes, plotting, and terrible clothing. Starting this, some poor farmers try to find a deer to feed his family. All good and good. However, poor bombing was mostly deaf, because several soldiers, in full armor, were able to sneak into the horse's horse, about 10 feet in it. Then, she is running away, she goes from 10 feet away behind them to a shot where you can not see them, immediately follow them around 20 feet after them. Then, he runs in some bush, and is immediately manhandled by two soldiers ... who were just behind just a few seconds, behind the horse, several dozen feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "armor" soldiers were so painful that they tried to look like Melail and weakly failed. It is to be noted that the "armor" of the lead soldier is bigger than the 5-pound poor partner. Seriously, she looks like she's wearing a baby boy's armor! Finally, Robin fires in about 5 seconds of fire, about one second of the old targets in about a second, which seems to be a repetitive bow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Which nobles were willing to do all the time, right? This sad excuse for how a series is ever crossed beyond me in a second season. The cost of production (at least what I saw) will grow within a few dozen dollars (or euro) ... <br /> <br /> I think high education drama classes can give a good reward. It was very bad, even Robin Hood's terrible Kevin Costa version was also good. <br /> <br /> I give you the price of this humanity and rent it or buy the 80's "Robin of Sherwood" series. Many good writing, acting, costume, and produced. <br /> <br /> Shame, BBC ... for shame ...
