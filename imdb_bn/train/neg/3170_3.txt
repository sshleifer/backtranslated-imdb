There are some funny movies about the spirits coming out of Hollywood. Carey Grant was an angel of "The Bishops Wife" (1947). Of course, at the end of the decade was the best movie of '30s-early' 40s. And, recently, Warren Batty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remix of 1941's "James Jordan Jordan". These were good writing, fun, entertaining comedies, which are centered around the ghosts and the supernatural creatures like the angels. <br /> <br /> Now writer-director Jeff Lowell, making his debut in the film with an extraordinary story. Kate (Eve Logoria Parker), who died on her wedding day, and then she falls for Ghost Spiritual, Ashley (Lake Bell), Katie's drunk, Henry (Paul Rudd). One of the things that is clear at the beginning: Longestly Parker is a model against Constance Bennett (the first two "Carrie of Marie" in the movie "Topper"), against women who scrawl. <br /> <br /> Come on to Henry's sister (Lindsey Sloane) to Henry, "You do not laugh." My situation has been correctly described throughout this picture. <br /> <br /> The main issue of the movie is that the script is not very funny. But due to the presence of Logoriya Parker, it has become worse, that he was surrounded me wrong when he appeared on the screen. Starting with integrating its lack of genius talent, only, he is covered with so much pancake makeup, does he really know how to look? Kate died while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue. To direct his instructions about his eternal life, the angel instructed him (who is actually thrown out), so Kate got back to her as a ghost after learning what her mission was. <br /> Cloak wants Henry to know that she is born naturally after the death of CAT (she feels very good relief from what she saw), so she comes to her asylum, who really 'knows what she is doing as a spiritual (He is also a catapult for the end), why he can see Henry in contact with Kate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is thrown at the end, but the direction of Ashley's handling indicates that she is a warmth like Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to these serious defective women, what he gets is what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Finally Kate appeared in Ashley and fun should start. It's not, and because of more sorrow the other hand it can be quite funny. For example, Norman J. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Allan Mobile, and A. In the first two "top" movies, they will have to rotate in their graves to show their brilliance.
