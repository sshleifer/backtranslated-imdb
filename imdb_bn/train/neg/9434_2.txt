Banned as a 'video nasty' in the United States, Unhinged has naturally gained some ugly. However, the most disgusting thing about the movie was its amateurity in all sections. Bloodyness I can handle: terrible acting, indecent editing, terrible direction, laucy script and unreal soundtrack was much more difficult. <br /> <br /> Three girls were on their way to a music festival, during which time they were hit by a rabin. Storm They were rescued by a friendly stranger who took them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, a batty old lady, and her spinner's daughter welcome the girls, so that they can recover for a few days. However, no one wants to leave the girls? One after another they became victims of an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> terrible film. Music is a total mess (it's like a three-year-old has been out on a synthesizer), and as such, it complements the movie. At the end of some bloody scenes and nudity to save a little unexpected, to refrain from the lowest possible score. /> <br /> If you horror paritrptibadi <br (and unfortunately, I am), you want the video to see this nasty clock tick it off the list. But beware ?? It's really, really bad.
