Here's the first good news. "The soul" is the most visible incredible animated film in the current home theater release. Artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you only take advantage of the visuals of this movie. <br /> <br /> And now for bad news. When I say that the only thing about the animation is going for this film, then I really want to tell. You can think that "soul" has been poorly modified by "Lilo and Sew" last summer. The first person who argued that Disney is a well-established and well-advertised title can give me four pages long title titled "Why 'Lilo and Stitch's Script Ting." <br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technology in the "spirit" display, the story is almost * amazing * dust. Here is a lesson, and (Need to say) it does not just apply to animated movies. You can always have the most thoughtful visual effects to please the psychoanalytic eyes, but your story is annoying and more important, we do not care for your characters, making it bad movies. That's as simple as that Animation is still mind blowing; I just can not wait to see what someone does with the imagination.
