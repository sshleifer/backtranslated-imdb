Good Plots, lack of feeling lacking, absence of good sinmatography, special effects of appropriate appearance, lack of absence ... What do I need? The review has a May spinner. The actors appear to read their lines, and that's not very good. Most "actors" are acting like a second-grade game. The story was written by the second grade mentioned earlier ... this is not really parallel ... it is just so easy and DUMB, a person who thinks that they must be absent, so that they think it is slow. No it's not, it's just as easy as it sounds to you right now. I understand "film", how do I know that it is a stutte! Most of the filmmakers only sit while talking (reading their lines), trying to look terrible. The narrator was answering. "Special effects" were ridiculous. I love low budget movies. I like Caroline Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarani and Michael Brewmore ... not just in this movie ... You can say that they are not paying or paying more, because their heart was not even talented by them. I love Tony Todd ... But, he was enough in this movie. Actually, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony (severely) for just two minutes! I would suggest to move the DVD fast in the two-minute Tony Todd segment. I went to the theater, and paid more money than a single dollar to see this "film", then I did pay'ah and wanted my money back. Hope this is the people who will do well next time.
