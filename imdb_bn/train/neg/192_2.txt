The only good part about this picture is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and annoying. The minister had to retire from the Paltit when his son Paul was separated from the preached education. How long can his sons take the Lord's name in heaven from this film from the Presbyterian background? It does not fit. Soon Paul was out of the river without a boat to remove Paul's (Brad Pitt) stupid, cheerful, selfish story. So soft became a teacher Paul became a compulsory gambling, but he did not want to save Narm. It's very reluctant. We stood by Paul's gentle white sandal because of his native American girl. This was the only part which was of some interest and probably could develop into a real 'wild west'. What we see is a sleepy city where two ministers have nothing to do but 1. Following a long girlfriend and dealing with her family. 2. Paul speaks to the newspaper store while taking a lot of head while talking to him. Swigs and fly tie a lot. I'd rather see a show on fishing that the film will be again-which will never happen.
