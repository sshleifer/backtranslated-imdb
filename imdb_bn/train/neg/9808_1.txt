The worst show I've ever seen The story is about a young man who, for some unreasonable reasons, super-powers, and when they use some special devices, they are transformed into weird, poorly designed cases. They do not see congratulations when they see the performance. Definitely not good, but the worst performance I've ever seen. However, when wearing their suit, acting actor goes bad from bad; Many, very bad. Hyper-animated idiots have numerous unnecessary speeds. Even when they talk, they still feel they are injuring. Villains are fools than the Rangers. Every episode, some weaker, stupid villains come up with a plan to destroy the Rangeers. He then sent an army of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. Then the Rangers started their 10-hour converting animation, then they destroyed the alien. Then, the weakly designed villane, which can be a shielded villain that actually looks and acts evil, gives a ridiculous Ladybug-like creature with trumps attached to it, which shows clear signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight with villains, then villain turns into Godzilla, whether by rain clouds or nuclear missiles (yes, they make animals and animals fire into fire). Power Rangers spent 5 minutes to play hyper-animated and called their jords, which clearly show that the producers of toys use special effects to show their real looks. Power Rangers wins, fame goes crazy, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. 25 minutes to wash in the brain, fake Kung Fu war.
