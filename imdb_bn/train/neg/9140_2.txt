Luck - I do not say. This is a film that can be really good with a bunch of rocky viewers. Some of the acting reminds me of John Waters' primary dedication. I would probably have to take it back - I do not want to insult Waters' power as a director / storyteller. <br /> <br /> I especially love the lawyer about the "full faith and trustworthiness" section. This is "full faith and credit"! <br /> <br /> This reminds me of "Conrad Boy" where the main actor, director, film editor, etc. In most cases, many-related creations such as this are probably left to the best film professionals, who have technical expertise (though a stunt can say something) can stop such things.
