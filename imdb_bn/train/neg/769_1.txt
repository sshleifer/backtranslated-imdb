The biggest drawback of this film is that it is impossible for any person to ever throw McBeth in a professional product. It is impossible to believe that listening to David Lansbury's soft voice respectable "Kal, Kal, and Kal" in the lecture, struggling with labor force, someone would consider him for this role. I believed that he did not participate because he was a polite actor; Because a big name was not found. Then when we look at these parts of the rehearsals, it is difficult to believe that the director can not misunderstand the actors who do not mislead the actors and misunderstand the actors who do not misunderstand and understand the verse and the directors who see the game through their own screws. Explanation Sometimes the directors are so concerned about completing their films (and the authors think that they have the ability to manage their own work) that they decide for less. This seems like an example of this.
