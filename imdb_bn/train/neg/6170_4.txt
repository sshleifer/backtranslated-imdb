This movie starts very slowly, but when the action is finally started, it is very little to follow. I do not understand why some events are happening, and many events have happened before explaining, which makes them confusing. This is the only thing that is in the amount of blood oxygen, although most of the time special effects are lacking. Blood is like red-clad-ed. Skin fountains like somebody's sticks are stepping on a heap. Again, the story feels like a kind of amateur, as the author did not take long to perfect it. I think it can be a better film if it has a great effect and takes more time in the script. I sincerely wish that I did not see the cause of Gore, but I think that I have lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like very poor movies, stay away from it, if not for you.
