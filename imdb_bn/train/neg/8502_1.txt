I initially thought of an interesting movie, the Spanish thriller is an interesting thriller in today's Madrid, but it's not really a film that is interesting for future film directors, interesting to know about not making a movie. No other language can be bad, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent on watching this movie, the act is horrible and the actors are waiting to finish the daily shot to go home, this is Does not come anywhere and does not spend time or money on this movie, annoying, weak and bad.
