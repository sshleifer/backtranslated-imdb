Mary Picford became the Principal of the Scottish Dynasty after her father's death, and then there was romance. Colonial commentator Snow Leopard said the film was rather episodic at the beginning. Some of it is funny, as Piccord is whipping its group near the church, though it has some of it. After all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, transformed romance plot-line and its last episode. The transition is so dark, it is difficult to understand the scenery, but also to calculate it, it does not seem to be the best work of director Maurice Tornur. Picford and Tournor's more accessible 'The Poor Little Rich Girl,' type cast and Picford were once again cooperated as a child character.
