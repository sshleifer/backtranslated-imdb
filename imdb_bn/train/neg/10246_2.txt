The end of the world is a continuous movie, which is strange to the idea of ​​the entire destruction of the world. Some kind of main character scientist, I'm not sure exactly what kind. He has two jobs in a government (?) Facility secured by four security men. His first job is to monitor the transmissions from place to place (though it seems to be more like a job when he does not work on # 2). For Job # 2, he has to make a protection case and go to a dark room ... at least I can do the best. Apparently "the plant" is not exactly secrets, because the scientist brought his wife there. While he discovers a message from the place (he's going to leave a supper) hanging out: Major Earth interrupted, over and over again. He said something about it as the first message from Space, he has never been able to desece; His wife told him that they are going to delay the dinner party. So they go and go to the party (!!!). Moments later he discovered that China had suffered a big earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... somewhere! Yes, Christopher Lee has it, but that does not really help a lot. Also, according to his appearance in Lee Haoling 2, Lati gives a fantastic performance. This movie is annoying, but if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade science-fee, through it you have enough stupid elements that can trouble you through it. Plus, lots of stock footage in the world is being destroyed.
