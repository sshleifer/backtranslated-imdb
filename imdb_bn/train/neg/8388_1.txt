Hope comes with this heartfelt story. Hope you do not have to endure anything again this terrible. * Cough * Razzi Award * Cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it is strange, expected and unknown. While observing, I felt that I was in the psychology test so that people complained that how much the film's quality could be. When I returned my money after the movie, I was told that I saw the whole thing, 'I am not entitled to reward.' I told the assistant manager that many people have complained and have already got back. <br /> <br /> The movie essence is quite basic. Midget thieves steal girts like a diamond and a child to throw the police. But under this cute outline there is an exhibition of original, fresh and sunny skiers. Or <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: Have you seen people suffer from pan? Would you like to fart jokes? Do you want to see texture posture as a threat child with a thermometer? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think the kids say, 'Go Go Go Go Go Gao?' <br /> <br /> <br /> If you answer 'yes' above, then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed as 'the worst movie of the decade' in decades, perhaps a movie or 2 which is bad ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know that only one star will be criticized by critics and then the review will not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This low humor has been created for less intelligent audiences, and I can not recommend any good conscience to anyone. Save your money for some fun. <br /> <br /> Respect
