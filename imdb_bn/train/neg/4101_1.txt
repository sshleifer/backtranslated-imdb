This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Do I ever see this horror movie, even a thriller can not be described as? It's more like a lumbering drama. The scary music was extraordinary but since there was no terrible situation, the director thought it was good to walk down the dump or stairs for daily activities. There was so much potential in the movie. They had beautiful cinematography (es) and interesting characters, but the author thought that you already knew them. They will have explicit explanation or even convincing activities without a source they mean. It's just a matter that tells one about it and it's something completely different.
