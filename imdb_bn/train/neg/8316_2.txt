Cedric Kahn's film is character based instead of character-based, action-based (I'm thinking of LNEW and Fux Rouge), so the genre of the original expert car appears to be associated with some efforts to characterize Suko. I could not find Stevena Cassette as an interesting actor; He reminded the pro athletes who are rich in films like Brat Fever. The catch of that blank stare headlight really looks like a harmful deer. A real actor forced us to reflect on the skill of karqaking rather than reflecting on Suko's personality. <br /> <br /> The little actor Iskel came from Le Basko, due to the Suko storm in Sooko School. The interview in the police office is a wonderful event of joyful panic about a little bit of mixed in the future. Apart from Le Basco, there is nothing to suggest this movie.
