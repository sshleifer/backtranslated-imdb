This picture is quite poor Abysmal acting and full obedience. Furthermore, shooting the film as a documentary can not make it more believable, you can not easily get out of it. Do not allow my comments to distract you, though I would suggest you watch this movie because it portrays some of the sins of the criminals about psychology or existential psychology. However, the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to do it! It's pure and simply fail to capture any ideas of the atmosphere! Do not translate what happened to my feeling of disappointment, panic, fear or fear that any feeling will definitely experience these horrible circumstances. Instead it leaves you with jaw drops to the page "Was it?!" Spilling from your tongue, and by no means are you frustrated by the actions of these boys. Rather you feel embarrassed for another film that starts with probability, but his face is flat on the last side. Jerezzzzzzzz is really ...
