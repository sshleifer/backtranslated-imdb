It smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it will be garbage. This is one of the worst movies of my life. Tony Scott's poor guide style is as prudent as the predecessor of Damino Harvey's life and a little false story. The story is completely isolated and the watch is confusing. Some aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all the action scenes were combined by the weak plot point and the horrific acting. Keira Knightley though this one is not completely naked. That this film is one and only the opposite. If you want to see her naked, the film will move quickly for about one and a half hours and you will be fully seized by Nipal. I strongly recommend that you will never see this movie! </ 3
