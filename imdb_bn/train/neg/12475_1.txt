I did not recall walking outside of a movie theater without once. Not only that, but I had 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An unintended plot, character created with soil, violence with no point of view. I do not care when good friends die; I do not care when bad guys got it. Fantasy and Magic was as thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency. In short, fine entertainment is if you spend an eternity in Hell.
