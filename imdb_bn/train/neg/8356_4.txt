Peter Fonda is so deliberately inspired as an actor that his Lachimose line-reads discard any ridicule or humor in the dialogue. She was a wooden block with opposite hair as if she traded sassy barbus and non-sarcasm repartee with Brooke Shields; Even her small touches (her glizled face is absent, stupid fingering) does not reveal a character directed by herself as an uncertain actor, an uncertain filmmaker. In the southwestern 1950s, a poor gambling player (not a little cheating) won an orphan, a lolita teenager to play a rural poker; After catching a billionaire with the promise of gold in the Grand Canyon, the annoying doubters have become a projector. Some lovely chaos and Henry Phunda are a strange but interesting character, as a summer canyon man, the only compensation for a tedious comedy-drama, two chakras are followed by cartoonist killers, which will stop after reaching their hands. Map Shield is beautiful, however - the camera loves its pouty, shiny beauty - it has no screen presence (and its skinny voice has no range); Every time he opens his mouth, then one person will dive towards the duck. * **** to 1/2
