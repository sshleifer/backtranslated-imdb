It was terrible to say this movie at least. I had a lot of hope after watching "High School Musical". The whole film was a complete hole of "The Simple Life", it was not just a reality show. <br /> <br /> The acting was not good. Amanda Michela had her moments when she was not terrible. On the other hand, Alison McLCK got all the way worse. Krrand Gallinger, who played Amandar's love interest, was played by the French man, but he spoke horrifyingly. One good thing about this movie was completely Michael Trevino, who showed interest in Alison's love. Just remember, if this movie was preceded by "High School Musical", it probably did not seem to be bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> Overall I give it a 2.
