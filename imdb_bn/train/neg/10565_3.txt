You can give a pass to JMS and boys because they were at the beginning of their series and in the small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. I'm not mistaken, the B5 series is still up to the best TV series, but if I could see this movie then I could not order the series. I do not like ohre as an actor, I do not like wearing clothes, and lots of cliche. In most cases in the first season (except for the Babylon Scard and survival) the same can be said; Bruce is immediately putting a fire in the series and it's going to be a wonderful spectacle. If you have watched a B5 fan and this movie then check it out. If you are not a B5 fan ... you do not want to see the series.
