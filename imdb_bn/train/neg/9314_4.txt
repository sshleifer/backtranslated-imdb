Well ... Overall, this movie was quite worthless and it was originally a horror film that ultimately a comedy. I and my friends went to Blockbuster when looking for a scary movie last night I rented this movie. This is definitely not what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor. The actor of this movie (especially Brandon) is so fake that it's fun. And especially when Tracey girl is saying that she is going home and going out of the room. They almost do not show any emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting. And when he finds out the shirt through black papers and holds Mark, he does not even fear that when he is hugging him, he starts attacking him. And seriously, if you're going back, would you just be jogging? I like sprinting for my life! (While some might cross the shoe because it is like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not so big, whenever astronomers throw head in Susan's forest, only when he sits on top of his head with Dennis and Tracy when Dennis foam back in the head. Like the previous person's comments, there is absolutely no knowledge at the beginning and I do not even see why the film was included in it. So what happened in 2003? Like the music it was created like in the 1980's, and the camera-in (?) Did not even really show the professional. At half time, it seems that the camera can not be fixed even when it seems to be stale. Overall, I want to say that I've enjoyed the movie. Although you are trying to find something to be afraid of, I would not recommend it, but if you are looking for something to do or have fun, then I would definitely recommend it.
