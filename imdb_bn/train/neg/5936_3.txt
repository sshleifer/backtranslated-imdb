This image was a disaster from the beginning. Bano and The Age as well as interviews with the actors, with "Next-Generation Next Generation" performance. It leaves little time for Leonard Cohen's clips, who makes the film in the movie with everyone else's commanding, gentle presence, knowledge and humor. The rest became very busy trying to absorb him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament Prophet. Most performance forgotten over-interpretations (especially Rufus and Martha Wineryite) or extraordinary successes Only Beth Orton and Anthony were in the striking distance of Leonard's own version using a little lemonard. The annoying little pseudo-guard-gestures spread throughout the film - such as concert and interview shots, shiny blurred camera work, the use of digital delays (make it harder) on Red Ledger Cohen's comments to hear what is being said and a distraught, proactive under interview sections. Less drone (attempts to add Gravittas?). The real thing, see the song from The Life of the Life of the Guns, produced by the BBC in 1988.
