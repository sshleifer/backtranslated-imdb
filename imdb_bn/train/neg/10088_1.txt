I am an actor, producer, director and what I am going to say is true. This project was the worst movie in the history of filmmaking. The producer and director of this so-called movie editing is a joke and I mean a big joke. Why blockbuster will be released as shit? I am very serious in my work and this film is an insult to my profession. The director is trying to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I saw a bad jabber movie, but this coffee and ear table takes everything cake. SUCKS THIS MOVIE !!! I hate to say bad things about other filmmakers because I am myself, but please consider taking a different profession. I've completed a movie that I respect, but let me tell you "crack smoking", I mean your girls makeup, awesome zombies, what do you think? If I could vote for the whole nation, I would have wanted to. Best Film Film Production !!!
