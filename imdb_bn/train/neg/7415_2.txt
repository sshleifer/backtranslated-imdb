Do you call horror and an awesome story without stories? The most annoying thing about this picture: I feel that the writer is not really deciding what is actually going on in the film! It is a different thing to know, give an indication to the audience and not fully disclose it, but here you feel that screenlists do not know it, the characters of the film do not know it and no one knows the audience! (Remember the "Cube"? Even the movie knew more about it myself.) <br /> <br /> I have eaten 80 terrible / cowgirl films, and this film basically has the deepest roots of these films. But many important things are missing. We do not really know anything about the characters. They keep repeating the empty lines over again. The story is not really developing - it does not go anywhere. B-acting is good in such horror movies, but there is not much work to do in the script. We do not care about letters. There is nothing to think about them. There's even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no thrills, no cold. <br /> <br /> You only use some of the common elements of horror movies. They see Lord Monsters one after the other but their characters do not contribute to the story. <br /> <br /> I genuinely believe that this amount of stories, character development and less number of crew and equipment Oh yes, the filmmakers used to do that - and more - about 20 years ago! As the film ends, the audience feels embarrassed. Really very bad.
