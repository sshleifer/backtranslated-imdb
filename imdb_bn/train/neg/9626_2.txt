There is no bone about it. There are many things wrong with this movie. It is completely clean, very fun, expected and unreasonable. Let's start at: Letter. There are annoying, unfortunate people - giving another blow to the steel barrel in his annoying, destitute person's belt - but in reality it's just normal, love for interest - Aniston plays well, but there is no need to actually do this - fat, friendly friends, and then Clich√©s Store: A boring Australian Australian, a confident Spanish guy etc. Storyline: The startup is a little unusual, but then goes to a map on the map, as each plot returns as expected, your average nose-cheat rage. The biggest problem is that "development" of the character of Stylar did not really come from anything - like playing your average school, the author knew where he started and where he had finished, but not enough stock told the medium bits correctly. Finally, the alleged 'jokes' were nothing but provided a considerable amount of water under overall fairly sunny versions; <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hamburger really broke the dog's dinner here, and the coat of steel and aniston's sugar plantation brought visitors, but in the end the remaining taste was also good. Final comment: This movie may be awesome, but Anton still chooses better things for Cudro's shameless 'Mercy X' than in friends-season movies.
