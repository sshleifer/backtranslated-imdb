Since no one is under 10, they do not mean stupid. If your child likes this image then you are better than his / her test. I am so surprised that so many people can be involved in so many bad people. This "movie" is a showcase for the digital wizard and nothing else. Writing is awesome I can not remember when I heard such bad conversations. The song is outrageous. Acting sub-par but then a lot of actors were not given. Who decided to appoint Joey Fatone? He can not sing and he is ugly like sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is all the precision. It went out of their way to do all of the stupid as possible as it was Great children's movies are wicked, smart and intelligent - movies like Shake and Toy Story in recent years, Willy Onka and The Witch's have mentioned in the past. But Nemo Finding Neem (yes, okay) in the continuous dumbing-Dawn of America, like the recent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the Red Riding Hood, like the cross-trash trash, is drake-erupt.
