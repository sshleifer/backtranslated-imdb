For most of the young viewers there, they probably do not know who was Booster Keaton. So, for this reason, probably they will not feel sad about seeing this image. I will be a silent comedy freak - still having to see almost every Keaton film. I have a huge fan, this picture is very painful from the beginning. Because in his silent days, Keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian. She was amazing in her physicality and her movie was not nearly dull. However, the historians of mobile phones were still annoyed at the end of the silent era, Keaton gave up his independence and became the stock MGM actor. Instead of being a great creative force, MGM has now only seen Keowton as an actor - and they wrote the script for him, which was no respect for him to be great. First of all, these movies were not bad (like cameras) with MGM, but the studio really seemed to blossom with Tokyu - Jimmy Durante put him in several films with him. Durante's humor was based on his gifts for Gab and was abrasive. In contrast, Keaton was calm, and based on action. Unlike two more unlikely actors were difficult to find. As a result of this deadly combination, Keaton made some real horror films. <br /> <br /> It is not to say that Speak is easily a horror film. No, instead it's a time passer and it's an amazingly lazy one. In fact, if you go to the movie it will be considered a comedy, it will probably make it hard to enjoy the movie. Instead, it's sort of a drama with some comic elements. This is not a film that will make the stomach - especially for fans of Keaton <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is doing He knows nothing about the world and his nose is stuck in his book. In a big step, Keaton's servant believes that she receives $ 750,000 from Keaton's dead relatives - hopes that Keaton will come out and enjoy life. It is amazingly designed but in some way it handles the work. Not very good, but it works. <br /> <br /> Keaton immediately left school and made fun by moving to New York. On the way there, he met with an incredibly unbroken theater troop. Because he does not know anything about the world, he does not realize that he is frustrated. And, because he thinks he's going to take them all to New York to run on the rich, Keaton Broadway. However, just before the event opened, his friends knew that Ketan was not rich. So, they do not decide to tell Keaton and try to keep him away from the process server that wants to stop the programs. They assume that if the show is hurt, they can repay the debt and everyone will be happy. However, they forget that the show stinks itself. What are they going to do? And, Keaton would get a nice girl, pick up the gold digger (Thela Todd) or break the flat? If you care, check out the movie. <br /> <br /> For Ketan, he has some stunts in the film, though there are some boundaries at the end. Instead, walking through the part of Keaton in a very subdued manner. This movie or hatred really has little to love about. It's just blah .... when it should be a good hack too.
