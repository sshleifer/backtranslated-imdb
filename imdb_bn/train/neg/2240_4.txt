In the beginning of 1970, on the same day in London, four pairs of pairs "suvy" bad luck. There is a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story inspires them to get clothes from all of them, many of them add a lot of humor and add to their couples with different mufti of British film and TV culture, including House star Richard and Sullivan, the future of Corruption Street, Johnny Bridges, and the horror Film Stalwat Firdi Men (playing a root). The display has a fantastic risqué amount of nudity of women, who like those types of (but definitely nothing hardcore). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite thin and incompatible; Stereotypes of women, and German Anita suffers from any type of infantilizing disorder - she is stuck with color TV, who deliberately acts like unmarried children and dresses to show her private parts; In another serious film, he would be in a psychological case. The most interesting part of this movie is that Swedish girl is taken to a club in London where some friends are still trying to swing, being inspired by middle-aged rocks, losing her virginity and realizing that the scene is not for her. They have some power in these sequences and we point to more curiosity than the end, in which the lack of music business is incompleteness and the stains and the higher classes live vivid and surviving the cruel public school Roué). The strange story of the story is that Chinese girl (future Canal Film Professional May May Le) is falling in love with the Piano Pridegis Employer of her child, has been intertwined with each other and without any good reason in the middle of the night. Orientalist idea that "Chinese birds are unconscious, is not it?" The film is highly condemnable to women's characters and has a scream of homophobia and character in the dialogue. In the end, there is no worldly reason for Shakeik (since they must end the film), all the girls will have to move to their Arab state, which will show the world as the future of the white slave business, which they are all happy with. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
