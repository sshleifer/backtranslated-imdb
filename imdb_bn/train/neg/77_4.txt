I waited in the opening week of the Australian movie with Legger, Edgarton, Bloom, Watts and a wonderful cast of Rash that Ned Kelly's confirmed story will be released in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the hit laser an important role, the plot was thin ... which does not inspire me to read "our sunshine". There were some other plus points, particularly supporting support from Edgarton, sure signs from Jordanian (ensuring his talents at the show in Buffalo soldiers), and the production design that gives real feeling of hardness to the Australian shrine, in the early 19th century Irish immigrants must Saw it. But I can not remember the opportunity to tell the real story of the Australian guy (or he was?) Missed a second chance ... which I suspect is a Hollywood concession and selling pictures in the US. Oh well, Jordan and the producers just do not agree to lose beard to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> Guess, I'm just Peter Kearney's excellent "Kelly of Secret History of the Kelly" gang ". 4/10
