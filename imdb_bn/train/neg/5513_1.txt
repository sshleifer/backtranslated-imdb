I've noticed for several years that when a rock star creates his final album before his death, then if that album is not the best, it is usually somewhat helpful and worth listening. The album is generally good enough for a succession cement. However, when it comes to the Comedians, especially the mainstream comics who act in their own cars, their final film is usually awkward. John Belkeys were "neighbors", John Kendi's "Wagon's East", Chris Farley's "Almost Hero", Phil Hartman's "Little Soldier" and the film was by Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> "Return to Midnight" Although it may not be the last film of Dangerfield, the word is weak in every sense. It was filmed in 2002 according to this website and it is safe to say that Dangerfield is still alive. At the time of my early age, I was a big fan of Dangerfield, and the sneezing of this movie hurt me. <br /> <br /> How the most talented people surprised me? Begin to participate in a movie with a very weak weak premises. Danzerfeld, a great comedian who usually sees his humorous personality in the film, is a prison warden who keeps intimate intimate groups in prison. The owner of the prison, Colonel-Tom-Parker-Millit-Sam-Walton, millions of Eli Rockwood (Randy Quoed), to reduce funding for prisons, Warden sent a group of prisoners to abstain from prison, consumer goods by robot in Robin's convenience facility, and Broke back in prison with loot. Accepting the convenience stores, they (I guess) accept the acceptance of Rockwood, which they accept. <br /> <br /> The movie is often spread and stalled with this fickle firmness. On top of that, the jokes you think it is not funny about the movie's release, even from an honor. It's impossible to be frustrating, because you want to be at least a movie with Oscar Nominated (!!!) Randy Coed, Kirsty Allie, Gilbert Gottfried, Ed Begley Junior, Yewariny Smith and others. Instead, we have played a character that we have seen before in countless other comedies, Allie has played a British successor with a British heir (this film can not carry the actual British person!), And every joke has been set up badly and virtually every member of this ensemble By time. This is not a good comedy in any word. <br/> <br/> "Back Mid Midnight" was originally rated language (and a view of nudity). This is the real grudge that most of the jokes are so humiliating to the audience that even children (if you edit this language) will go out of this movie. Body gags are also incredibly predictable, especially when Eli Pet torments the protagonist's character of the monkey. When the monkey takes a couple of ropes and jumps on the couch's couch, then who will not know where that lip is going? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < True, though, Dangerfield has made some great, first-timelized comedy comedy. "Easy Moni" and "Back to School" are still sunny, and of course, the least Oscar was not worthy. However, there is a difference between making a fool comedy that is funny, and a fool comedy. The next generation of comedy seems like, filmmakers do not even try, which suits the hair's excuse for 90 minutes. Add this movie to your batch of forgotten comedies such as "Reese in Peace, Rodney," but "Wally Sparks" (1997) and "The Godson" (1999). These pictures, I dare say it, are not even valuable.
