Finally, after reading this book this week I was very excited to watch this movie. My 13-year-old boy was also looking at him. I hired it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story that took life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was frustrated. The movie has gone far more than the book rather than being forgiving. George C. Scott is a wonderful actor but it seems that he was only about 20% of the time character. The rest of the time he was quite flat. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is 84, pre-CG effects were mostly created. But it looked very b-movie quality, especially with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is that they found one of the most moving parts of the story: when the soul Christmas Present takes Scruggle on Earth's cyclone tour, is still observing people in obscure situations and still in love with Christ's mother tongue. <br /> <br /> I will accept that Mr. Scott did a good job with "reform" until the screwgie. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that Bob Crutchit was portrayed as a little more cold and mockery. And the little team ... oh bad boy actor did not start me ...
