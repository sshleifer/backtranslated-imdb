I give credit to the writer / director William Gove to find someone to pay for this corrupt "thriller" money. A good reason to not waste money on subscribing to HBO, allowing the purchase of DVDs based on cover art and blurr. Although a pedestrian Dennis Hooper and a game Richard Greco added something important for their resume, the direction of the industry is not half bad. The conversation will leave you grimacing with surprise at its pride; This is called the story at its worst times. There is no tension, no doubt, no fear, no fear, no sympathy, no catharsis, nothing is there. Some interesting and often nude women make annoying spices, but it is clearly seen as the best film for a trailer. I'm sorry for this green-eyed thing. Good for the late night, zoned out only to see. You have been warned.
