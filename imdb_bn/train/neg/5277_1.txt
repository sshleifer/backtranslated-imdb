I grabbed it in the showtime today and wondered how a movie with such an interesting episode could become so incredibly awful. Who is your father A biographer like Brian Davis, a high school senior Chris Hughes who inherited the heir of his dress empire, by his biological parents. Although the premiere of the movie might be a lot of fun, it was first-time destroyed by director Andy Fikman's uninterrupted directive, a bad and predictable screenplay and straightforward performance by video quality. Even ordinary fun Charlie Talbert turns an amazingly helpless performance as the best friend. Ali Laundry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny bud. 1/10
