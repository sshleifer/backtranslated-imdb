I'll start by this and I can not get all the way through it. From Walmart I received reviews of these reviewers on this rainy day. I figured there was no way I would regret my purchase I was wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie until the end of eternity. This is the only appropriate punishment that I can think of expressing this bad thing. The shooting reminds of movies made for a class project on a big old VHS cam. Acting is not much better. The only difference I think is that there are some cool Kayes. Yay, K. Care ... Shechee Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ship comedian is an even bigger loss. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I own it in DVD and see many colleagues Gave it Everybody comes back and laughs and says, "Wow, I did not think I would ever say I would stop shooting the film of Adam Sandler in 15 minutes." <br /> <br /> My reaction is always "You can now" <br /> <br />
