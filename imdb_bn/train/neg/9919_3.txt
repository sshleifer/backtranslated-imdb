In the inaugural view of "Malta Story" At Guinness created such a remarkable similarity with the Nobel Covers that I had hoped for her first words that "some women want to strike regularly - like the ganges" or something like that world - a tiring sister. Unfortunately his conversation was rarely a deathless prose, and even the master would have had trouble bringing it back to life. Actually Mr. Guinness traveled through the photo as if he was looking for a focal point and failed to find out. And there are serious shortcomings of the whole movie. Mr. J. Hawkins likewise starts giving "Jack Hawkins" performances without an ounce of personality and eventually leaves it. It may have been isolated from a dozen British war movies. Often in the 50's, suspected suspects often became active, with very little intention in their schtick. Unable to implicate Malta in a bomb attack, Loftfuff failed to implicate Malta. As a result, the courage of the Maltese people was confronted by the king in front of the grave danger and the island was awarded by George Cross. The eligible movie may be thought of for a movie, but "Malta Story" does not qualify for the word "eligible" in its most sponsor sense. It gives the appearance of being cobbled together to meet a deadline, probably before the actor is missing. Have to live.
