This is very bad, so very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. Do not be too bothered to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and at the end it was frustrating like ... I really did not understand the taste of people, I was a scary movie fan and I. I am not indifferent, but I have a limit! Perhaps it was better than a quarter, then it was at the beginning of the host. So I recommend you do not waste 15 minutes, you can see. I used to be well by the monkey that means acting. And big brothers with parental roles are just awful. What characters do they give in C-movies? No, I do not think that the horror movie is bad for the first time, but one of my ten movies is the only one and it is a Vampire Portrait, Cabin Lake, Houston!
