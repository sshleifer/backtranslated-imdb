I once thought that "The Stoned Edge" was the worst movie ever ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" I could imagine that all the ways beyond it and I could not do anything. I hate the letter "The Stoned Edge." "Hobgoblins" I hate the actor ... and everyone involved in creating this unpleasant. I will not include teaser in this movie, I'm not cruel. I could not have such innocent people as innocent people. In fact, any discussion of the plot involving the film is intelligent and abusive. The words I use to describe this picture are as follows: penetrated, seated and intelligent. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, please do not watch this movie. I request you, from a movie lover to another ... no, from one man to another, please. Do not see it for your own proximity and intelligence. Destroy any copies you come across.
