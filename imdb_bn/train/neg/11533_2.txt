If derivative and anticipated rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, you are for a rare behavior ... they do not appeal to me, so I could not find anything to break this wonderful story. It seems like something directly in the 1980's, when it goes directly to the video, a different age. Jillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are okay to work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But last year did Gillian Anderson get involved with such a film after his acting brightness as Lady Deliloc in the BBC TV adaptation of Blake House? The director is believed to be influenced by the close rape witness and his work on the documentaries, but it is not an excuse for an intersecting scene, where a beating of a pack in the rural body. I do not think I was the only person in the movie. I do not understand the company involved in this movie - FilmFor and VeraV Pictures Both of them have been involved in some great independent British film in recent years. Vervo Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road Distributed - Strethheads are not worth mentioning in the same breath. Take the FilmFour and Verve notes: What can you really do with this really? Are you going to make your artistic judgment by independent British filmmakers? It's a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: Are you listening to thousands of fans of independent British film crying frustrated?
