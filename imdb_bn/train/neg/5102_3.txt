Nicole Egart was listed as his star despite the fact that Michael Donner and Stacey Kitch were much bigger than that. <br /> <br /> It is basically a spin in the movie "Alien Lands of the Earth". The girl feeling sorry for Eggert being pursued by an alien military and takes animals to execute her very sexy disguise. Nudity and a bit of partial nudity, all the features along with a scintillating sex scene. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles through some explicit set pieces and running jokes about the picture shown. When Michael Door is captured, he likes Star Trek Jokes and he really gets a great death scene. <br /> <br /> It was quite clear that Stasi Kitch would be taken away and most of the film was poor end, what kind of talent was best seen by Allen Eggert Pass.
