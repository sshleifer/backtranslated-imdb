I think this piece of garbage is good proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators think that these days the kids want good stories stupid GI JOE version ??? Looney Tuning is some of the most favorite characters in history, but they are not created to be Xtreme, I mean !!! It was a great example of how small tones can be updated without an original concept without its original kiss, but this piece of junk is simply an example of stupid corporate decisions that only kids want to create a cheap stupid show !! ! Children love superhero ??? The whole event is just a waste of time, which we saw new versions of Lonny Tunes, but at this time in Superhero form, it does not look very bad, but the problem is that the show tries hard to copy the series like Batman. Animated series, or new trial league, results ??? The bad copy of the flash (the road runner) or the superman (somebody else's bug buggy) problem is that lonely tunes were not meant to be dramatic, it was considered fun !!!! As I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why is taking the whole world ??? This show tries to dramatic and action packs, but it is something that is capable of series and anime, if you want to see a good upgrade of the old show watch Tiny Tones, but it is an example that can bring life back to the old character, but a good story and Original roots honor. Too bad that the show is already dead, I think another corporate decision.
