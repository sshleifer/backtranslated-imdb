I think I'm the only child in the city who is disturbed by the performance of Branagh. He is a fine actor by most accounts, but he simply can not drag the southern accent. I mean, it was frustrating. It seemed as though he was trying hard to get Yank. Previous critics have questioned why the American actors did not play in this film. I guess that's the second. It is surprising when the actor / actress wants to expand their horizons, but it is very hard to try another thing that stends with a performance. Maybe it was Altman, but he is such a great director ... <br /> <br /> I do not really want Branagh to bashagh for his utterly hateful expression. Everybody screws up here and there. But instead of sitting through a gingerbread man, it's hard to see it so annoying to put a chicken bone or to feed a bucket with bad food.
