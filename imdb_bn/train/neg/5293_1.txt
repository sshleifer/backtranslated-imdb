After reading the box, I picked up this video, I like the story, and Keon Reps! But after a 5-minute inspection, I saw how terrible he was acting, he was walking and talking so foolish all the time, it is not fake and trustworthy. It does not end, almost all characters work so badly, it was ridiculous, the only acceptable play was by Allen Age (David), but the man commits suicide and you do not see him again, why you never knew why he did it! Everything about this movie is shouting low quality, I can not believe how such things are released! I was tempted to stop the experiment many times, actually I did it, I saw half way, I stopped showing off and shutting down, I came to the IMDB to check the other's thoughts, I got zero comments (not surprised), so I'm sorry for myself Decide to impose yourself and come back to finish it, come here to comment on it. The only good thing (for me) was the high school rock band theme, sometimes playing guitar and singing, but it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and direction ... awesome movies.
