Terrible acting, crippled plot, stupid stories and almost all terrible movies sums up this piece of junk. It was boring to sit through. Just awful Do not waste this one penny. In order to see the movie theatrical people really think it is bad about putting this film. This "horror" movie was not even weird or annoying, even at least bit scary. This aspect was interesting in any way. The actor was so horrible by all the actors that any attempt to attract you to the film through dialogue has completely destroyed the actor / actress to open their mouth. Plus the whole story, I do not know why anyone will make a movie with this story again. Do not waste your time or money. Do not even waste a moment to watch this movie even a free ticket. You will feel dumber to visit it.
