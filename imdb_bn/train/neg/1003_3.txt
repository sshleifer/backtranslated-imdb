Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. More than that, I can eat Spanish and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with that point I can comment on the movie: I have no idea how enjoyable it is, the Japanese audience, Omar Omar is a good director-despite the extra pedantic postmodern staff throughout the style of talking head, even it is weird There was something interesting - and I am surprised that he came with it. It may be one of only lost translations, I'm scared of it, but seeing subtitles as a European viewer, I think it was awful that the English subtitles were overloaded. The joke seemed bad, the script disappeared - that means, stop the audience, and talk a little bit embarrassing - my head exploded rapidly about speedy lecture and irrational work. <<br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and it is well-absorbed in the animated scene. However, as soon as the characters are omitted in the film, all the Mamba-Jumbo lectures are omitted to start with funny and not funny. It just wants you to move fast forward characters out of the next cut-out scene. <br /> <br /> I'm planning a sign for Mamoru Oshi. The idea was well but horribly absorbed. Probably the second part will bring good portions of this first and actually create an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more narrated scenes. But hell, if you think of talking head often, the amazing things of fast food giftter will give you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course these comments are based on European experience. Perhaps it is completely useless to the Japanese people, perhaps it was a funny picture that was lost on cultural boundaries and translations. may be.
