I will accept I think Uma Thurman has created a mission to look at the world's most beautiful woman and the picture she has added (unfortunately it includes Batman and Robin, the horror films of The Avengers) and it <br /> <br /> I have the title as the worst movie I've ever seen. (Yes it's even less than Avengers). Everyone looks lost and it is inconsistent outside of belief. <br /> <br /> If you think Uma is a goddess like me, please do not present yourself in this movie. You'll hate for yourself the following morning.
