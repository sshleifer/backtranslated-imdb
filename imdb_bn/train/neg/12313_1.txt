It may not be the worst movie ever produced by Steve Martin, but it was certainly far from his seratum. Obviously, he did this bad job for the Czech check. Drake like this certainly has nothing to improve his fame as a fun person. Does he not understand that when people see the movie in Steve Martin, they hope to entertain, tears do not bother. It is unfortunate that he threw Dan Acroide and Phil Hartman along with him. I do not understand why the gifted people can not achieve such a firmness that people do not want to see in their horror movies. If you are going to call a comedy in a movie then it will be fun. It was not. The US military allows itself to be associated with this pubalum. The complete metal jacket was more sunny than this unfortunate excuse for a "service comedy". Of course, Phil Silver is rolling over his grave.
