I think I just saw a snapshot movie .... a beautifully played, taut, engrossing and awesome thing! Two hours of sexual violence and violence, rape, kidnapping, immorality, corruption, living graves, and misuse of the most fundamental and inauspicious sense of misuse, misuse, misuse. There is no release. And I was ecstatic. I can not stop watching. What can I say about this, that it creates and works like this and is a world that has become so sensitive that eventually the real snooze movies will be ideal. And I'm silent or silent, do not try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I'm not taking refuge, but I'm ashamed myself. And my British cousins ​​are sorry to see issues related to my own tribal-like swooviers. It does not have to be comfortable, but will it cry in vicarious sadism?
