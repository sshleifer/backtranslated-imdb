This is a "very bad it's good" movie that you've always heard but never seen! Unlike Trumah films that are deliberately bad and the camps (and I'm not happy), this is 100% pure. <br /> <br /> But super-lethal killer robots with permission, such as an acid trip and an acid trip to the Solid Gold Dancers and a magician's first mate who calls electricity and turns into a previous Good Witch. It is true that it shocks it so severely at its own end that it is almost the entire circle entertaining. <br/> <br /> Because of that enough watchbill
