I wanted to like this picture, I really did. It has some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. It's going to reach something else (from which they clean somebody's pile, so they agree to join the group) and in some scenes it is gently fun, but trying to be fun in some places. , Really just fillers (of all work scenes). And I could not find the "villians" scary, or the value of hate, as much as I found their child's greatest annoying. <br /> <br /> I met them like people in the picture playing the ball of the church. And I'll say the referee's spot clearly, nevertheless, to the end, I really do not care about anything about the character, or the Church has not taken care of their quest for glory. Perhaps they were all one dimensional, which I might not think if the film was fun or could have flown a little bit more smoothly overall. <br /> <br /> Cartel Hale and Holstorm Entertainment have created some good movies, but this is not one of them.
