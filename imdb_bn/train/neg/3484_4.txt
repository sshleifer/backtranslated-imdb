I remember when this was in the theater, the review said it was horrible. Well, I did not have it bad. It was fun and there were lots of tongue-in-cheeks related to family around the holidays. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He went inside the house and made an agreement to rent a family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where a contract sign. It was fun. <br /> <br /> So, he made a foolish request to the family and even wrote to read scripts. Of course, there is a hot girl for interest in family love. And he does not learn that holidays are bad after all. Also, the whole doo-dah law was fun, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriend's parents did not even tell anything about it. And part where Do-Doh is hit on her "supposed girl". Final Wardich: I'm caught out on cable if it's worth checking out.
