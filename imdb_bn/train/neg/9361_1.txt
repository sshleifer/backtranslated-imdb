When I saw the preview on TV, I was thinking, "OK, it's a good barefoot movie" but it was not. It was not so terrible! The performance was good, the plot was horror, the military bid was just simple fool. I think the SCI-FI channel can do better than this BRAC. The film was as safe as it was that Arnoon would become a warefuff, instead he turned psychology and some doctors threw out the throat. If you read some of my other reviews in other movies, all positive is there but this story is not a terrible cause. 10 max one out. I'm sure you all had some wrewolf flick, but I bet you were not expecting this. Loch Nes Beyond was a better way than this movie, Hack, a film better than a science-fiber channel than this movie.
