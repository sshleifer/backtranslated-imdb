As mentioned, this formula has been printed several times recently with "You've got Mail", including Hong Kong and Meg "Trout Pak" Ryan. Different versions, this is my least favorite. I think that the studio is a coastal starter, which is not quite spent here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry did not get a boil in this film with two leads in this movie. There are no real gimmicks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the days old Donuts, happy but happy. And when the rest of the movie is annoying then only you can follow. Especially the judge is frustrating. Looks like he's not in the neck! I do not know whether I was suffering from pain or something, but he was trying to drag his head like a turtle, all the prey and everything. I could not think of what I got so hot about Van Johnson. I will create a bee line for that cute Violin player. And the van was not great. I've always thought of being a leading Hollywood general, and she does not do anything to spread the image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of stars or prefer this movie in the early 1900's. But there are many more romantic comedies, and they offer you much more than the old confectionery mask.
