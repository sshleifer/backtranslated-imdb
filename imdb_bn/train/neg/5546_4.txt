This image is something like a series of "White Zombie", it was created by the same person (Halperin) and it features zombies. Halperin, George at his day. Romero, though failing to deliver such a one. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of Cambodian people and search for destruction of its source. Its power can be sent so zombies free. Also, the interest of love for evil people. <br /> <br /> Where this picture is really vague imagery. Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and zombie look very strong in their big numbers. Unfortunately, we do not really see most zombies in action, and the story of love seems to play a very big role for a horror film (though there is a legitimate plot reason after this). <br /> <br /> I liked to attack the helpless city people, seeing a few of the bodies of 1930, but this movie did not just provide it. And no strong villain (like Bella Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And the use of lugosi eyes? It's a great influence, but he's never confused with the film ... why not revive it with the new actor's eyes? Above all, a film that is a little scripts can be a great one, and it can be a strong remake of some time (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame). Hack, if they can just "have eyes on the hills" then this film has the hope.
