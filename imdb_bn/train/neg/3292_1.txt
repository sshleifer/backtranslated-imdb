For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I'll start with bad. Bad aspects: Casting choices (especially by the name of ReiLald's boss Hog), played poorly played Cast, story, direction, direction, editing, soundtrack, and above all, from a television series in a modern day. Features: The complete concept of film making, which was not as good as starting, despite its popularity, <br /> <br /> Good point: Jessica Simpson is a red B It is inite ............! <br /> <br /> Someone here resembles the similarity. As Dessie Dude, Jessica Simpson leaned toward her way to Michael Weston as Aynos and asked, "Enos, where is the boss Bog Hogg and Roscoe?", His clouded judgment, where they say. Just as it has been said, "Enos, is this a good movie?", Red bikini used to say yes to his judgment, in his true mind, he said, "No, not really." Well as she looked at a bikini, she could have been nude, and could not even save this horrible piece of film making. Stay away from the Hazard!
