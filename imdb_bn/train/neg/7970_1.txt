Depending on whether you want to spend about 2 hours of your life depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them, God is very awesome they are violent, watch away. I saw the worst movie in my life (and I saw 'Long Time Dead'), and I call it a low-budget horror / cow-style fan and look good to it to compare it. I'm not going to the exact direction of this movie that was bad, the only good thing about it is that it's so terrible that I've seen years in the most fun thing. If you can find it to get a cheap rental, of course it is certainly valuable, if you are involved in making it - shame for you. : o) The IMDB has to start a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it claims completely.
