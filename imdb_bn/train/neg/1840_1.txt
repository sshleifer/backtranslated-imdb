It will be the most cruel unfunny "comedy" ever seen in my life. Ben Stiler, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken can not laugh at me as a crazy homeless man? Some pictures this picture will be wrong. This is the only movie I ever loved to walk. I used to pass free, and still felt like my money wanted back. I can honestly say that the movie I saw was worse than this one was the house of the dead. The Only. Bad Movie I laughed very little in the scene of Mary-round-round, and that was it. Should pay some 2 hours to pay the bills as a comedy multiple smile, right? I do not know, filmmakers think that "Flood" was a funny word, or something. And another running joke is really a dead horse beating - literally.
