Era Levin's Broadway debris comes to the screen with a meat on the bone, with a few tricks and twists, but a conspiracy therapist, but there is no one to take care of it. Desperate writer Michael Caine steals the work of a brilliant young man and plots himself to pass it off; In his horrific plan, talented child killings may be included, among which Kennen's fly husband has surgery. The first act that is presented to everyone, is frustrating, can do all the actors pacing up in kine. Diane Canon has been mistreated by his wife (he is very impressive and clever as a close friend) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the film) feels very uncomfortable in the role of a good writer. These three characters, and the annoying neighbor of Irene Worth, are indefinitely even what happened even after registering until this law was registered until the second law began. Sydney Lumeet's side is suddenly and vague, the set design is incompatible and weak-burning, and the last total disaster. Actors struggle to give some material to the script, but as we look at thin elements, they are hardworking efforts. * **** to 1/2
