The illuminated review of this confusing project is that the author / director / star should be related - or in fact, the same person denies reasonable thinking that the film will be appealed until anyone is connected to this film. Hardly inner woven round. How about this If you want to make a movie - tell a story; Entertain; Draw me with vivid characters Of course, you can do it artfully without bowing the commercial material designed for mass application. However, do not mention the elements of artistic expressions in a vacuum, where the audience continues to struggle constantly to engage in scraps of thread. If I am moved by a dreamy mental thread then make it easy to buy concrete fabric.
