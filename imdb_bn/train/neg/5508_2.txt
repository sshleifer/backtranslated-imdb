The team (Gary Daniel) wants to break into serious television reporting. When he is awgged for a job begging, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) said that Shonnara too. While coming home, the team is surprised that his home is an unexpected visitor on Mars (Christopher Lloyd)! Calling her Uncle Martin, the team soon tries to help her new life to live on the earth. But, wherever he goes, Martini suffered from bathroom in the bathroom and more. Lavi Lizzy (Daryl Hana) finally sees the opportunity to team up with the team, but in real love it is not smooth in this case. Soon, on television, everyone is giving a hope for a story about the real alien, pushing the team. What can a man do? For those who like the old television show of the same name with Bill Buxby and Ray Walton, this film is not worthy of closing Bollywood boots. Its true, arbitrary horror, flat plot, which relies on falling on any plot and flat special. Daniels is okay as the Earth but Loyd is overacting a storm, simply as terrible as foreign. Customs, sets, and production details are enough to cast, as well. Even if your children cover and request for this film, please convince them to pick another flick for their video convert. Be assured, this movie of children and adults will find a tremendous spear, so instead of choosing a night in the museum or around the world in 80 days.
