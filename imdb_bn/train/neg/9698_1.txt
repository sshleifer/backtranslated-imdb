Germany now has many talented filmmakers / actors. None of these are associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why does the producer actually invest something like this around the world? You could make 10 good films with this garbage budget! Seven big stars are running like the left front, not seem funny. Although the interesting thing is that the film's producer (who can be the oldest guy in the bunch) played the Eugenist Bampha. <br /> <br /> The image is filled with a moment that shouted for captions, "You are supposed to laugh now!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting my time I should do the same ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
