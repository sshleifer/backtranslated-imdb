Kind words Bad acting, kindly script, cheezy dialogue and hip-hop music and fashion ... was not that what? The director of this movie is worse than the movie he created. It can be a chance if someone takes some time and effort to revise the whole thing. The studios are still trying to figure out how to screw up so badly. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the Stasi Dash ... Asian chick was not very bad. These very gals carry the whole movie. If this is not for them, then I will destroy my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it yet and do not have any idea, do not waste your time ... You only regret it later.
