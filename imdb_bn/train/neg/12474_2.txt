I watched the version of "Deathstaller III" version 3 and liked the movie so much - even "Amistast" - I decided to watch the entire series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought the second and laugh and started laughing. <br /> <br /> There was nothing interesting about "Deathstricker Me" and when I started riding the credit, I was ashamed and sorry that I bought it! Very ugly and nudity I guess the "DS3" was a lot of cleaner production or MST 3 really did a lot of editing because I expect something like stupid and helpless and easy. I was roasted. Even at $ 6.99 it wasted a waste. I could not even open "DS 2", because tomorrow I'll give it back. Now I'll probably throw this DVD because I can not return it and nobody wants it - with myself! So really, do not bother with this one. Even nudity (lots of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
