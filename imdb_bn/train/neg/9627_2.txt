All right, I love Ben Stiller, though I'm warm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can work at least. I saw him in every movie or sitcom acting difficult to get past him. It sounds like she stood there right outside the script, standing there. It was only a good thing about this movie, and it was that Ben Stiller. This plot is used so and it is ridiculous. How many movies have this same kind of plot ?? Can we say "forces of nature?" The plot is not so old, but the result is quite predictable, it is annoying. I knew everything that's going to happen before it. It was a bore, but the stellar watching is always a joy !!!
