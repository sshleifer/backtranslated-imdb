My book "Basic Institute" was a perfect film. It plays an outstanding role in playing the smallest role of Stone, Douglas and all supporting actors. It was incredible photography, music and nocturna scripts. Add it to a film that will be as good as it is! <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of this signal, it is probably bad, bad acting and a lengthen script, which is completely inactive, this is really annoying, annoying, annoying. The only thing that keeps you centered for a while is the relatively small waiting for the next scene, which is the correct re-associated copy of the original These copies are so bad that they make you laugh and I smile a lot despite myself, because it was like breaking a burning memorial. What's good in this awesome world is the BI Golds Myth Score. The interview with Michael Katon-Jones and the half-intellect responsible for the script, and the interrogation scene, "There is no smoking in this room" and yes he has sent his attorney (now a solicitor)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I saw this terrible movie that was never supposed to be! It's a major harm, so bad. The only release price is the concept of cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Mons Stone could buy the best surgeon money) it could do a good job, but probably can not restore the originality of the original. And what is applicable to human body film production, also. There should be a law: Do not make any signals for the perfect movie!
