I just saw this picture tonight and I would say it's a mess. I love Vince Von but he became funny more annoying here, and the film is less than the 80's classic "Santa Claus Movie" but less than the camp or bad Shia Easton song. The story is that the black sheep in the family is returning to your family for the holidays but to face the North Pole as their answer. Of course, Fred (Vince Von) uploaded the family screw that comes back to his home after the set back backs, in which his girlfriend (Rachel Weiss, in a cameo role) dumped her, so she came home to face her parents and more successful brother Santa . Claus (Paul Giamatti) and Vacky High Jeans have challenged the brothers' rivalry and following some strange and threatening Christmas as well. Now if you think you know you want to finish this film, I think you will be right because it is predictable to the mountain. To play, Vince Vaughn has always played the same loving losing player, but this time he has been more annoying than the likes, Mirinda Richardson has played Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than a few notes, Elizabeth Bank plays Santa's assistant but she is not Neurotic Mix and Poor Kevin Any character other than spaceship is essentially the same person as "Glenger Glen Ross "or acting a little anal. Two of the actors who came out of this photo warmed Paul Jimmyt's genuine warmth and his role like Santa Claus, but he feels a bit embarrassed to stay in the film, and you can not blame him and Rachel. Most of the main actors have been doing a lot more work than a small role in working with them, it's a shame because both Rachel Wiese and Paul Giantty make this script better than they gave them. <br /> <br /> This is a brief disappointment, it is a big disappointment.
