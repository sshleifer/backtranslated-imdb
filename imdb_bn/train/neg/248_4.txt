When will strike? I do not want to see another version of Christmas Carroll again. They try to make films with the same story, try to make the film better on each other, but sadly it does not fail because it is not a good story. Moral, old, conservative, happy thoughts. People can learn Numerous editions of this movie prove that we do not.
