There are many stupid things in this movie that I probably can not name but some: <br /> <br /> The character of BOGART: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (very easy, so I'll leave it. Boy, it makes the word 'humphrey' better.) 2. Its long, curly hair and stupid side effects. 3. Her black birt up, complete with Spurs! 4. The shadow of the lip gloss is not sure whether they are wearing it, but it is not impressive. <br /> <br /> The character of Genghis (Jim Kinn): 1. His lipstick does not do any work, he is. 2. During the whole picture people are melting with their hat! Did they find a hat to fit him? Even a little? !!?! 3. Very tight behind her pants. 4. He shut down his gun more than once, if you know what I mean, and I think what you are doing. <br /> <br /> If you are a casual bogurt or Cagney fan and it may be a speed change to see them in the west, please give yourself a favor and forget the thought. Still the horses hide! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a comedy level or high camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, beware of this viewer. Therefore, only see if a) you will certainly see every West there. B) You are a true cognizant or a bogieist. C) Any of the above comments apply to you. Oh ?? ..
