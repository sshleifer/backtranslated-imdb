Investigator reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Calcutta) has returned; This time, after he "Night Strangler". Again, police officers and fellow journalists disbelieve, or want to cover the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis understands the same basic story as his previous "knight", with less success <br /> <br /> Curtis adds a fun supporting cast, "Dark Shadows", former student George de Cingo and Ivor Francis included. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) heads up a sexy collection of stomach-dancers. And, although I did not see it mention anywhere, it must have been as Roger Davis. McGuin will be in the first scene as a dining companion, which denies the existence of the vampire! <br /> <br /> The Night Stranger (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Joe Ann Fluff, Simon Oakland, Wali Cox
