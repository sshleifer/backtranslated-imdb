For a movie about a killer, it's surprisingly lazy. <br /> <br /> Some do not happen and even when something happens, they do not create any real tension or interest. <br /> <br /> The acting is good from two leads, especially with the assurance and stupidity of the cassette, providing a great performance, but the rest also do what they want to do. <br /> <br /> The problem is poor writing and instruction and the fact that it is not a real story, Suko is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Such films generally try to create excitement or sympathy or create turmoil and it does not create anything other than a feeling of sorrow that you waste time on seeing it.
