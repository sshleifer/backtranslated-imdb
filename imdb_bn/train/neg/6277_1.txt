This film really tries. If you're going to make a horror film, at least give it a reason to believe in hooking the viewer. <br /> <br /> You wait and wait for a film that is waiting for some Grand Sponsorship but it is not. Instead it tries to be very clever and does not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the movie? Where is it going? And more important is what was going on in hell. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how was it bound? Just another weak sci-fi horror. I love fake reviews on IMDB, it seems that the press releases of the film are great (or it has low horizons of people) to confiscate the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the film is better than fragile, but at least it gave you reason and why it happened and its end result. And this does not make everything seem terrible to just everything with Voodle's padding tones. This movie is only when it is less like unknown call. God was that lang too. <br /> <br /> Big tips, if you become awkward, make credible logic and explain to the viewer what is happening, so they have a hook in your story. Because if there is no logic or credibility then there is no strong conviction and it can not be scary. Cast or crew have no disrespect because they did a good job. It's just poor writing.
