Leap years show some heavy heaters in local and regional film and television scenes. And yet, they can not save this movie. There is a lot going on against it - acting, too much melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent direction; And the very few things are going for it - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is basically that after watching this film, all the local films are thrown in a basket and say that local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest of this film based on this one. It is masquerading a television soap opera as a romantic feature film. My expectations were high by buying my tickets and my hopes went in five minutes for the film.
