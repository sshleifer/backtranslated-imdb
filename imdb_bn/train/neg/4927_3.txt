Louis Weber, self-propagandist missionary by film, wrote, managed and produced other films on controversial topics, but it may be seen first to thank TCM. The film is accused of her abortion, but she has tricked the problem by bringing Egenics and birth control smartly, which has impressed that they are no less like abortion. His talent and other cinematic skills have been shown well here in writing, but he can be forgiven for pardoning one. If you are wondering how tiren power, how junior "famous father" looked, your chance here. 1916 fashion and automobiles are also displayed for adding interest to this museum piece. It is enjoyable even if you do not appreciate the promotion.
