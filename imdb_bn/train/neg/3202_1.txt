If you ever hear these three words ... "Joe Dawn Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> The low budget action movie based on the Sheriff of Texas, named after the final justice is the Garonimo (Heronimo Spoken as). He is a messy, slimy, rude character who killed Mullah his partner in Texas on the quest for a criminal. His partner actually slumps down in the movie. Very poor editing. Joe Dawn Baker (Geronimo) has finished 4 or 5 times in jail in this movie, this plot has not gone anywhere. Plus, he shoots everyone like wild west. I think nobody told him that it was 20th century. A female police has appointed her to show her around Malta (who looks like Ellen of Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can set up with Redneck. He must be insane! <br /> <br /> This bar is the most entertaining character in the movie strippers. Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I started bonding with sleazy women. Well, at least it was better than trying to fool some of Geronimo's way out of it. The finishing is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was finally finally happy. You will never forget the last line of Joe Dawn Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It is so difficult to imagine how he was in three bond movies ... very strange! However, if you are laughing, sometimes see MST 3. Also, I've heard of his other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MTT 3 was released by the movie in Reno by DVD. I can not wait!
