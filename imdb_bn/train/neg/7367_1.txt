In fact, I believe that Segal is in a mission to see how painful his films are. This particular movie was full time and full time wasted. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they used to practice her picture and when she felt chilled in the movie, she looked thin and small. Her big pot stomach and double chin going for her and the most tragic and indifferent appearance of her face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous to start and get away from a long way. The whole movie reached the top, where Segal and his group had to take a bunch of people under the influence of the prominent military chemical adrenaline enhancer. There was a lot of unnecessary conversation in the path and voices of Sials in between a statement and gradually referring to dubbing. The word WW sounded like a man with a frog in his neck and was quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The war scene in the film was horrific. Half of the time Sigal Foug can not see what's going on you. The camera leaked his arms and then flying with wall or something after it. It was memorable on television's old Kung Fu series. Very slow speed for the war scene. <br /> <br /> I believe it is the worst movie of Seagull today and I am glad that I do not buy this movie or I'll be very annoyed because I'm a huge fan Aikidoist Seagal.The action star fades away quickly and with every performance It seems to be bad.
