Where to start, this movie is so wrong and horrible about, where I'm not sure what to start. All right, this strapper who wrote these frogs. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, firstly, they could not create their so-called mind for a name. I think they split the difference, so the main title will not go to Brian, but the last screen says that the title will not die. Nobody knows anything about professional occupation. All doctors take the oath "no harm" afterwards. A woman will be considered a "loss" for a woman's replacement for a replacement. Plus, small things called blood and tissue matching. The denial will spell death for January in the pan. Plus those who keep a patch working monster. What bills graduate from medical school, Franklin University? Old FU, or Mad Scientist Technology? There was no name of the monster, which came out of me. Plus, the bright surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner knows how the patient can be saved? All and All A Movie A Disaster, It's Incredibly Stupid and Inaccessible, Without MST3K Thanks I thank Turkey
