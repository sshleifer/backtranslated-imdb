There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why do they make this rebel movie ??? The premises are stupid Threse acting is a dimensional. Special effects are overdone. And this movie is a continuous gun battle between any shocking shots of Hollywood. But then, if they were good shots, everyone died in the first five minutes and there will not be any movies there. Too bad it does not happen that way. Several times bothered to stop it, I stuck with it to see how bad it could get. Glad I (SPOILER?) The whole line of the last line dopey, dishonest aspect Crown stupidity. It is not worthy of the condition of the second characteristics in the third rate drive in season. Along with the general horror of the film, I think deeply about its impact on young viewers. Americans crank out such a shit like this and then why the happenings of the Colombian incident happen. This really disables the movie on the Brobdingnagian scale!
