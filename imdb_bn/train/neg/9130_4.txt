It is true that some fans of Peter Vendor's work, his last venture, may be frustrated. But of course, a fan of the seller will be happy in all his films, because of the huge talent of the people only. And more Phu Manchure Fenendish Plot is no exception. Unfortunately it will prove to be the last film of the vendor, (it was released even after his death), but it is still impossible how man could manage his unchanging talent until his or her death. And we do not just get to sell a vendor but we have to reach because the vendors do not play the title role only, but its generosity, equally hostile Nayland Smith, crazy 168 year old detectives Fu The story is equally unexpected as we follow Foo's ungrateful antics for his age-rebel Illyssar and to try to prevent him from Noyland and his fellow party. Like any major vendor film, the film must be sure of the unexpected performance of him, along with a few of his familiar co-stars - David Tomminson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren. Pink Panther Stalwart Burt Kwouk (Cato) is very nice to enjoy a camio with vendors - although it plays the same role, but still nice. The story is quite ridiculous, as many characters are involved, which is classified as a film firmly under the influence of gooooo. And, even though it never reaches the height of the comedy, there are lots of funny jokes that point to the right direction. Due to the film's first release due to the grief of the world over the death of the vendor, it commercially failed (the film was released within less than 3 weeks) and it was always developed that it was seen that the vendors were the last film. It's far from a great movie - it's often slow, very ridiculous and sometimes the jokes are not there - but it's enjoyable - if only for Peter Salar's top rated performances.
