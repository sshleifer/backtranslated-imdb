This picture is so bad, you can not imagine. Acting is terrible, even worse than third-party soap opera. It's a shame that this movie was the most successful in Switzerland over the last 20 years. Relations between the soldiers did not help in any way. The story can be taken out of the story of Bravo's picture, the dialogues were like a tree-like tree, and the plot hole was bigger than the black hole between our galaxy. But nowadays it does not need much to satisfy the audience. The actors were pretty hungry for example Miss Mississippi and the main character (woah !!) And certainly there was much misuse of drugs. This is truly true people! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13 years. But there has been an atmosphere in the media that does not allow you to reject the movie because if you do not go along with the other's 'sheep', then you are not saying that you are using neutrality and using Peer Group's movement. I was exactly what I was in the military. When I go to the army, what I am going to do is to take steps for every sugar that was carrying medicines and coolness. And I do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it but this picture was worse than brushing the tooth with a brush (which I was forced to force Lieutenant due to bother). Every film needs to be sophisticated. Sometimes you want to entertain for a few hours and forget the problems and I think it is not a bad thing. But such films influence a lot by showing a cool lifestyle to teens, which are actually fools and lead them to foolish senses and sensual stupidity. But since my opinion has not been very popular since now, I will be silent now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any cost and save your WIFE! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
