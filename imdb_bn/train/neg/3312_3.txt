... but I'm sorry to see it. Since IMDB ratings are relatively high (and they were relatively higher than Netfix), I think I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that I've made many movies. Extensively. On the other hand, "Savage Grace," falls in the section of the Sunshine Complex, which is usually directed by Hollywood movies produced and inspired. Brenda Blutin is a worthy actress, and I liked her in other movies. The idea - to increase the garment, a gardener grows up after her husband's death - does not insult me. In spite of Castro's strong efforts to create humor, the film is flat on its face (as long as I and my wife were worried). To be preceded, hey gentle reader, British comedies did not succeed in all offbeat. This one is ugly.
