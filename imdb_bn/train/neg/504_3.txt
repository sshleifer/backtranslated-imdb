Particularly counterfeit example of Italian culture, with a vague title to boot, (if anything, the substitution of Satan is less relevant than the plot!), Gothic Horror and Geiloro contrives a flat sort of whole hybrid in the whole atmosphere (including only the strong dose of the ereco). Actually handling which is a little horrible! Here, we have received a common man stuck on an island (for which he was invited by a count, because he became a dead woman, a dead woman, for his missing husband)! Most of the characters have stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing heroes (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stewart and whose family history is more than a part of the violent tragedy), the heroine, remembers the brutal partner (remembering the West and becoming the most annoying!) , A mood is dedicated manager (forever one after the other and his cruel behavior) !), Some lesbians, a mysterious garden (universal Luciano Pigozzi, who once was involved in action, if you know what I mean), a sincere maid (nominally star fame Benju, although it's valuable, it's really an accessory Part), religious leader of a Butler, printable chambermade etc. Although the film is not a nonsense, tragic dubbing, speed of snails, unnatural production (pictures of visible ocean lifted from some black-white pictures!), And this assassination does not happen in the last half hour, it is not true. Also, although Marcelo Giombini's score seems to be happy, they become incompatible with the situation; That said, a surprisingly broad proof of revelation (considering there are no deficiencies in the suspects here).
