Some very interesting cameras work and a story with many possibilities. But the film is not more than a student graduate thesis in the school. There are two primary reasons for <br /> <br />. Fist, there is no favorite character, even a villain we can not praise for his chutzpah. Secondly, all acting terrible - even from Villen DaFoe. Ham is plenty here, you think you're a picnic - but a picnic from a rogue company where you drink too much beer and you even get your hangover before drinking it. Then you eat and throw an underdone hotdog. Well, I'm a little rough on a young director who could still go to the place - I said the camera worked quite well. <<br /> But I feel cheated - the hug for this movie suggests that we will see a "modern Western" and there is a picture of this DVD packing which also recommends it - but in reality it does not seem to be related to any film, It seems to be made. <br /> <br /> That betrayal hurts; But in addition to this, really we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story fades frustrating, and in the last analysis, we simply do not care. <br /> <br /> Through the DVD player, I've taken it almost halfway. But the rental shop will not give me my money. <br /> <br /> Now, that really hurts.
