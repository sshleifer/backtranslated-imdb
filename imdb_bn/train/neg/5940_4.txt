Look, I am reading and reading this comment and there are so many things that I would like to say but I will try to make it small but clear ... <br /> <br /> First of all, forget how bad this movie was ... how It did not show anything inferior and I agree with most people here that it is "Hollywood", I mean, what real life story did you expect? When people will wake up and see that you will never find the true truth 2pac and Biggie ... it's all covered and buried deep down. Second, I'm not against 2pac Biggie I love both but 2pac and Lil Kim feel embarrassed for this movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, all that is saying That movie is awesome and does not see the truth, you look very blind too because it seems you know something big about or you do not know anything about her and you love this Hollywood teenage movie. Use your mind and see the cloud ... When you get this thing there are many things, I did not say 60% because it is a very broad subject but for the movie. Just could say that it could be a little too much, I did a lot of good work. But whatever I have just given her opinion ... there is no strong feeling. <br /> <br /> I love hip hop and I live for it. But seeing this movie every person can see a little that anyone can Do not think how to live. With respect to everyone for 2pac and BIG, all other artists, such as being prepared for such a living life, should start another page because you are destroying young people ... bring the wrong message to children and that is not going to school, but from the street Basking, hosting and grabbing just for paper .... <br /> <br /> True hip hop seems to be love and intelligence, smart and all. <br /> <br /> I know that many people think that I'm crazy, but this is just my perspective Look, I'm going to be wrong about anything and I'm not saying this is a completely bad movie because if I have a hip for 17 years, I still do not know about any reading or BG, how many articles I have read or how much I support them And listen to their music ... Your opinion likes everyone. Only people who were close to them and the murderers learned the truth behind it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to say for Big Bg and toupak fans and family, these two people were the greatest of all times, they used to live their lives in any way, but please try to be better in the future, Learn and love each other, be good for love, because ultimately you do not like .. How much money or family is available and Kiv Bay quickly understand fully what is in your reach and your own soul, not about feeding your body and mind. If it can lead in such a way, you will be living a life even after death !!!! Love peace and ya all !!!! Rept BG, 2 PAC, Aaliyya, Left Front, Jam Master J and others made a change in the world !!!!
