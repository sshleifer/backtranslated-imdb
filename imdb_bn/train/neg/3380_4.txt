Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show ran for years, but the adaptation of this movie has lost its power and charisma, which has drowned much of the director (Richard Attenborough, as much as possible from B-Way you can get) and lead actors (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-dancer as a thin corporate lawyer). A shiny audition slip for Broadway show, which turns into a therapeutic session for actor-dancer-singers, shocks us, plays a brassiee talent aloud out loud. Something is not a modulated or exquisite, especially a remake of a former dancer theater and a ridiculous subtler about the bottle head with the old flame Douglas. Desire is filled with promises and heartwarming, but their personal story is a bit embarrassing; It matched Attenborough's lazy pensing, faded disasters, and even failed to break even the famous songs into artificial twists. * **** to 1/2
