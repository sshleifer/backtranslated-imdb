This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their kids to look something good for them. It is usually educational, fun, and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No Doodlebop sings and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to learn anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No Instead of doodlops, something that is not a joke and laughs at it. <br /> <br /> Is it brighter? It's very bright, it's painful. As far as color, everything is pretty brilliant, so good. But doodlop is never wrong in the world. Therefore, they are always happy. A child will be in despair because they have never faced sadness. <br /> <br /> This event is very impressive. The high levels of each word are called ambitious and very corny. It's overkill. <br /> <br /> For kids, it's entertaining, but 2 years old you do not want your kids to see it. They do not know how big it will be.
