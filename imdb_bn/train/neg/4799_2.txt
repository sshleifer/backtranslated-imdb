I'm a big fan of the low budget 80's horror movie. This is the worst but not yet spectacular. The plot line drags decent but very long way. You're halfway through the movie before you even get to see any zombie action. The kill is not very creative and the zombies are not very clever. I really believe this movie is good but they make some muffia flicks. It is worth watching but I think the movie stole at least an hour of my life. I have to give film credits to be a bit original If you really live in B-Horror, it's worth watching but if you're not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for me.
