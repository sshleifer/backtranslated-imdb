I can not believe it, IMDB has really got every TV show known to the people! I have not seen this show for over 20 years. I only think of two episodes, and I have rarely remembered. I think Tony might not be able to start from the beginning, because the episode I remembered was one, all of which tried to get Tony to join, but he refused, but he usually became a member of the show. Power House, everyone cheers. <br /> <br /> Remember another thing where Lolo pretends to die for some reason (completed with funeral and mourning). I do not think why he died, or the program ended. <br /> <br /> This shows that I have convinced myself that I will dream because nobody has ever heard of it.
