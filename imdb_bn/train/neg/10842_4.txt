Referring to cast, recently I saw this movie on TCM, hoping for a low artificial jewel, because I consider many movies of 30. This is a gem - even half-precious. Anacronistic clothing and rolls of the 1930s Rolls Royce Limo hit you immediately. Welding is strange, as well. But most of the fools and unnecessary plots are in the device. This movie contains many good elements and a basic plot that promises, but the elements do not mix according to the correct recipe. It should not come together simply. And that's a shame. Somewhat obvious, but minor changes, it can be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about an American Shobargaar (Gene Harlow) - especially from famous people, to find a wealthy British husband. He meets FrenchTone and his friend, who owns Rolls-Royce by his friend employer. Harlow mistakenly thinks that Tone is the owner of Rolls, and he draws his attention to her. This first part of the film is a light comedy about any real difference. However, the tone unknowingly unfurls the 5th column writer of Germany on the eve of the WWW, and at the same time the film spontaneously changes and isolated. Tone and Harlo are married, but as soon as the honeymoon starts, she is shot dead by mother Hari-typing (Benita Hume), and Harry is charged with the murder of her tone through a scene. (Actually, the tone gets wound.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tone, now in the army, and Harry unexpectedly gathered in Grant's hospital room where he is rehabilitating an aircraft crashed. In the following scene, Tone Harlow complained of her abandonment because she was originally a gold digger. Harley never complains against the witnesses 'murder and his panic!' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is in the hands of his Paramouri, Grant's hand, check out the new aircraft he has provided to him from England. Incredibly, both humming and tone can slowly recognize each other, but the place can not be easily removed from there! All right, so the tone shot and almost died; Perhaps a little out of his memory mad. But how many people did Hume shoot in that he forgot one of his signs? (He does not seem faking memory laptop.) <br /> <br /> This is unreasonable and unnecessary. Hume could have recognized him completely, but when he realized that Tone was not able to keep him, he made him a joke. This problem was very good treatment. <br /> <br /> The final is very dissatisfied. Tone and Harlao are making a conspiracy to maintain the reputation of the Cad Grant in the made movie, which leads to his deceptive graveyard as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just walk away. It is great for the French national people to realize the hero of national war, but dissatisfied with the story of love! <br /> <br /> What has this image requested for: Harlow explained that he had fled face to face in fear, Tone forgot the accusation of the murder case and calmly revived his love for him; Then he had a torch for him, even while helping to suppress the crash site to protect the reputation of the grant. Meanwhile, Harlow finally acknowledged the grant for that cad. Then he saw the tone for the brave and superior people, Harlow also revived the feeling for him. At the end of the film, the two of them joined together to work together to prevent the death of the grants. After Grant's burying the hero, we tear them and sit down and kiss. That would be a beautiful little movie made. For Curie Grant fans, it was also better that the tone killed French cadres and grants long-lasting first husband to reconnect with Aaron. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This film has been much better than the role they played in.
