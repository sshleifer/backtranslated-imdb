There is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but since the 70's it's a little more than a dull heist film. The film does not look shiny or sexy as it does. This plot is a re-establishment of tired old casino robbery that happened in death. Apart from Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot is designed by 3 years old. Three women involved in this plan ?? Outside the outside of the Circus Sicas building, on the unnecessary and simple scene scale, opening the cover for the first opportunity as the only waitress, and one is standing close to its clauses. That's pretty much about it. Complex, is not it? Stella Stevens and other women other than the above mentioned breasts are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas co-star Stuart Whitman When Steven did not scramble, he portrayed one of the most cruel shootings in his film in the film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It seems that in the 70's I always enjoyed and some nice shots of Las Vegas were around 1975. But the film itself is very low at 4/10? And that's probably overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good clav√©s.
