Judging from this movie and Strong Man the same year, I will not keep Harry Langdon on top of the list of big silent screen comedies. There simply is not enough. Probably he was on the way to developing his style but took seriously his first big successes. In any event, all his tricks make fun of people interesting, but there is a lack of Keaton and Lloyd's extraordinary skills. He also made the trousers of Chaplin wear a dress and walk as well as weaken his personality. His trademarks show unprotected, stagnant, and anxious reaction, batting his eyes or reacting with his lips on the lips with his back lip touch. In the filming of Langdon's comedy, trying to overcome it with lucky or extraordinary ways or at least physiology, because of sharing various obstacles on its path, like trying to run away to throw stones at a tornado, it spreads the broken building. Lifting a tail is a four or four dodging stone by two so that they roll under it. In this story, the son of a shoemaker who joins cross-country walking nation to reveal the rival company's footwear, he is won by a fate. There is nothing bigger here that does not get much better by Big Three.
