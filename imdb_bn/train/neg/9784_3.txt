My mind, my friends and I saw this movie alone in the headline. It's nice, though it's obvious in its plot and direction - you know where the movie is going in the first five minutes. My main statement to the plot is that while it is tolerant consistent, they do not explain many things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, put on the head, put the sister on ... It is a bad family, but refrain from mentioning occasionally from sister, there is no resolution. I was confused with the scene on the bottle ... it seems pretty random. <br /> <br /> A second concern for writing ... Kids were not bad actors, but many of their scripts would have preferred. Unfortunately, an intelligent dance cinema could have been a single, pushing Blah special effects, hair scripting, and a glaringly clear plot move.
