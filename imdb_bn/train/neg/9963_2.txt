I love Alex Guinness. And that's a lot to say about this film. Indeed, he's not bad at it. She just seems to stand aside, fertile and her usual delightful self, but nada investment. The girl who met her was Federweight, even an inexperienced young French girl, as it is clear. Sir Alex did not choose him since his childhood and is probably not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Donald" wanted to be a French Hitschlief and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. Did he hide behind the forehead and hide deep? Does he love his father? Why did he shake up Susan's hair when he planned to combine various parts of this turkey in the estate of the country? Or perhaps he was simply acting in his absurd. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds Guinness and Paris together with the "old woman". That's a great story! After the destruction of World War II, two lovely personalities in a beautiful city. Why did not anyone come? I would like to know a little but recommend to see Alec Ganini in the appropriate movie "The Card".
