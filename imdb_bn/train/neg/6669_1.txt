I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I could not see it. I came into it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. I really enjoyed Ed Norton and Ivan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I'm just not connected with this movie. The acting was great, cinematography was interesting, but the story, or rather its lack, was a problem. There was no central, connected theme in the movie. Was it a romance in Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it western? Kind, but no. I'm in the movie Twist, I recently saw "brick" and liked it, but the place that went to this movie was also there. It was very strange, and if I did not sit through the whole movie, then I went out. The writing was not terrible, but it was in the right place. At the end of this movie, I was just a little confused and was going to end soon. There was nothing to say about this movie that I was resuscitated, I could understand more off-film films like "Fight Club", but I just did not think much about characters.
