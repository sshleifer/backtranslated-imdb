I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. The semi-autobiographical account of Gary Oldman's life is a violent, account of the dental circles of the Bankkatian account, which resides in the South East London estate, exclusively. Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of character before, but never did it. The film is open with him to order drinks in a paba bar - all of them - and you are already very impressed with a sense of frustration, self-frustration and barbarity which he has shown in various ways throughout the movie. It's an acting masterclass <br /> <br /> Of course, a drama like this stymied and dispossessed requires a foil and Winston is joined by Kathy Burke as her long-downed wife, who exploits and eventually rejects her helpless behavior. Charlie Cride-Miles turns active in the form of Dugby Boy Billy of Fuse-Discussion, though she never reveals anything for herself. Gary Oldman has directed closely to the actors, their council will extend to Clostropophobia of flat scholar. 4/10
