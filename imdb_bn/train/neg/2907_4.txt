Chinese critics often voted Chinese film enthusiasts from outside as well as China's greatest film of all time, and, honestly, I did not find it at all. What I saw was that the most generic melodramas were fantastic, silently handled and played, which was full of revelations for a play. Wei Wei (not laugh) is a young married woman who has suffered from her tuberculosis husband (Yu Shi) as well as for the last few years. It is after WWII, and they live with a husband's teenager sister (Hongmei Zhang) without paying too much money in a accustomed home (they were wealthy when they got married). Besides, the husband's oldest friend (Way Li) comes, who is wife wife of adolescence. She thinks of fleeing from her husband with her husband, although most of her husband remains unknown, it seems she could associate her younger sister with her friend. Set it up, and you do not expect it where it can not go anywhere. I actually saw Rimake, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuazzhuang Tian. It runs a half-hour long, and is actually kind of dust, too, but at least it was nice. This supposed classic is quite helpless.
