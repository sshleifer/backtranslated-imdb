I tried to show this picture twice and still made the boring parts move faster but I still could not finish it. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that this movie actually got a good review. I think these people are trying to promote the film for marketing these good reviews. Their reviews seem very unreal and it looks like an internal work, which makes things more unfortunate. Films should not get real positive comments on their own steam and not the narrow! <br /> <br /> Acting was a memorable of a Chessy film, and not funny. I do not think bad budget movie with less work if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I veered the character I knew. His facial expression and humor were helpless childhood. I thought that the conspiracy of girls was more enjoyable and intended to be established, but they were worse. <br /> <br /> This script was very painful (business lectures above its owners) and unreasonable satirical comments. <br /> <br /> There was nothing more about this image except for some interesting women. <br /> <br /> I never thought that a rating was confusing this. I was interested in his premier but scared by all others. You must see if you want, but I just do not want to waste someone else's expectations / their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's my ... probably not.
