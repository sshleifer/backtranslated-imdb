I see this movie on the WTN now because it started in the channel when I started it. This is a very credible and roughly annoying story about Mary's wife (Alexandra Paul) who wants a young stud / drifter (voiceboard ACB) run by Corre Savier. May be a plot or not. Corey whips off her shirt and Alexandra swoons a lot. I feel that he does not seem to be good at all, and that's why he has been involved with skinny Alexander Paul. This is not really important because I said that she closed her shirt a lot and I just saw a glimpse of the butt whip. The soundtrack has many sacks, which are just painful.
