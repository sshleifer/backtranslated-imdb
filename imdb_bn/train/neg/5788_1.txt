OK, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some suspicious business with ex-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) created a horrific spice by Mr Karl Mesac. <br /> <br /> This horrible spice-mash is talking about that? Well, Messek discusses three complete incomplete Japanese science-fee animated series (i.e. Macros, Southern Cross and Moxiped), adding tons of dialogue - firmly believe that American audience is too stupid to understand the artistic quality of silence and silence - for the violent content Completely abundant, some dominated municipal jumbo has been added, it's O Lau dubbed this aspect by using the worst voice actors (Reba West's song was - and still - intolerant and catastrophic, especially compared to Mrs. Miera.) Ezima ... and this resulted in the continuation of the series with hundreds of continuity problems and plotting Holes. <br /> <br /> Of course, in May Cha was nice to see (especially "Macros Saga") and the plot part that was unscathed was good. But what was good about Robotek was not assigned to Messi's work or "voice intellectualization". It was because of torture and effort (unknown - why?) Would I be brave about the key to stealing here?) Japanese manufacturers. Those of us who eventually got the wind of the real deal and originally compared Robotek, now we could not contact Robotek. Basically, it's much more natural, naturally, and creates a lot more knowledge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Intellectual property from unauthorized and incomprehensible -Carly mesack-like people are used for recycling.
