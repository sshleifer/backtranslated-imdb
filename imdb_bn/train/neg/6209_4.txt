I'm always aware of taking a dislike to a film very instant. Look after it a month later and you can see it differently, or dig it on another continent after 50 years, and some rituals have found stellaristic extraordinary things that are initially noticed. After sitting in the British premier with Robert Carmichael's The Great Existie, I did not have any surprise that after I got the question and the answer was more interesting than the film later. Shane Danielsen (film director and director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival assisted by producer), has protected the film's confidence rather than receiving overall negative feedback from viewers. The Edinburgh Festival audience is not easily frustrated. Only one person walked out of hatred. Criticism of the film includes a clear and constructive, common sense as well as an actor and a woman who has taught MA film directors. It was not an overly 'push' film. There were neutral sexual violence than many films, but much less extreme than most movies (most of the original arms communications were unclear, such as awake genes). The audience disliked it because they were excited for two hours, where it was quite annoying, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, expected and drawn, and where they were on the production of tired and provocative movies. Promise a controversial movie. The metaphors of war in Iraq are transformed, extra emphasis and cruel (except for the general circulation of violence, no deep meaning is unclear); And 'fig leaf' is reference Marquis de Sade, since an audience member has kept it, at the end it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for the lack of development of the plot. <br /> <br /> We have a teenage story for him to make a certain amount of money (he stands for his musical ability at school) but takes drugs and hanging with young people who are hanging with young people and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. . When pushed, Robert seems to have locked many violence inside him. <br /> <br /> The film is not fully qualified. How the audience reached the conclusion of Robert's decision was released: Was this the effect of his colleagues? Why did all the good influences and concerns from parents and teachers have led him to include in a better way of life? Cinemically, there is a careful-looking scene where he is hanging back (that's too much drug, shame, secret sense of morality or waiting for his counter?). Most of her friends are raping a woman in a back room, partially glimpsed and screen center frames. On the face of bare bone flat, a DJ is more concerned that her happier home than the thought of a woman's screaming woman than her music. Finally he is a little annoying if he is attracted to the attention of police in their activities. Although serious headphones were involved in his music enjoyment, he also agreed with his intelligent dissatisfaction while enjoying his musical instruments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said something People have reacted strongly on it (filmmakers said: "If they become vomit, we have succeeded in creating feedback") but most of the time - and I can say so far Edinburgh's response can mirror the reports from the ear - they think, "Why programmers We have such inferior quality Coming to create new movies? " Director Clay Hugg may discuss this conversation but did not develop artistic perspectives. His reply to the mirror of life to authenticate the things being entered in the carpet, even the small plot development of his defense is because he does not want to make a hualoid movie - all is a good answer to criticism. , But unfortunately they do not apply to his movies, while some may not be able to catch a mirror, or misusing the movie while playing a stranger. I tried to try and give him some suspicious suspicion, for a few minutes of screening, but I thought that he was unexpected as his movie and soon I became somewhat important to wash my face. There are many truths. Educate an aspect of the industry, is another inspiration, another is inspired. I asked him whether he had any social or political agenda and Ken Loch (one of the great names he took) he himself did not even before accepting any agenda. Then he came back about his job to tell the truth to his mantra. With this feeling I think it was an overwhelming project for a new manager, or tried to stop myself in the map by promoting second-rate jobs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The soup and it was in the industry. Clay Hughes wants to imitate the great director who has created controversial films and crossed the border. Sadly, at the moment, his power expanded to create high quality excuses for a promotion-only film.
