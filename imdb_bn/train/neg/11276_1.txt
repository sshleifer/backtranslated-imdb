I will not waste time writing more about how every aspect of this movie can be written badly. That's been a lot of detail already, many times over. The 'plot' started is a very vague cuckoo like a bide-gay / gangster-by-number bore and quickly jumped on a shoulder. Anyone that is pretending to see some hidden masterpieces inside this awful mess is just kidding. It has now been seen before watching this movie for 7 or 8 years in the space of 1 week, but it was easy for my easiest movie. I just made this comment, and actually the only reason I went to visit the film because my brother Eddie was present as the second 'heavy' in this pub scene. The face of Russia's Ifon was pushed to a gypopa lighter in Russia (this was actually portrayed in Barry Island's former Button Holiday Camp). My brother has no acting experience - he recently joined an additional organization and it was his first part. It looks like the movie does not require any acting experience in it. <br /> <br /> I think there were about 8 people in the whole movie - and it was only a few days after it was released. I was so irrelevant and so far disappeared so much that I did not hear any other film - and so on. If you were thinking of renting this movie in DVD, then I would ask you to give two pounds of coins until they get red, then jam them on their eye sockets. This will probably be much less painful than watching movies.
