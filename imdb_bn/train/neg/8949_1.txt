A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novelist, 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I recently read. So when I rented the DVD, I was surprised to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to developing Ambiences or developing characters that Orwell did in his book efficiently. The director feels that everyone has read the book after watching the movie, because they do not try to understand how they behave and how they work. Main actor John Hurt surpasses the whole path and does not end up performing anymore. We never find out what we do for a living, or why its love relationship is forbidden, or political climate and why the main character wants rebellion. This book is not properly described in the film and justice can not be done without the explanation of the character of the oppressive political system and the absence of this absence is the greatest reduction in the film. Along with this, John Hart said of being a terrible casting, he was pictured at the age of 15, over 39 years old Winston. But on the more positive note, the rest cast was well selected. It is very bad they put such an awesome adaptive film with the wrong lead actors. -Brian O.
