A High School Principal (Kiwan Win) with a lost basketball team unwittingly employs an instructor who is not only a fantastic blonde woman (Kathy Lee Crosby) but also enthusiastic by their new victorious way. Are you really surprised? Romance grew in between coach and team star Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never advertised. <br /> <br /> Packed with other Crown International photos as Greenhouse Cinema really does not offer any service to this movie. It can be easily edited in a week's television movie. Kathy Lee Crosby looks especially great as coach Randy Rawlings in her skimpy outfits but I expected more than sheer headline from a rated rate film. A side plot involving a team center is hypnotized by his colleagues that he is the real reason behind the new success of the team, instead of coaching former NBA player Sydney Wicks Kathy Lee. Does not tease too much and sleaze enough to make this a big frustration.
