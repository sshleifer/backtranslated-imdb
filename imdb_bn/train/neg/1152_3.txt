I understand what this movie is trying to film. How old is often ignored and behaved like annoyance, which means that they end up inappropriate feelings and their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with this message, but I think it could be so painful to see that it has been across a way. But when I enjoy a good artist movie, the very self-consciously arty (in this case) results in a movie is often frustrating. Try to make a point taking a suitcase packing with a person's shot, slowly, for 5 minutes, but the annoying end of the audience. <br /> <br /> Pair of female characters are very weak and you just want to tell them to pull together. This is a movie that you think you enjoy or rate and certainly has its' qualifications but I was just very disappointed to recommend it to each other. It may have a deeper message than other rocker missiles (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least this is a movie you can enjoy watching.
