I was not deeply impressed with the Dante's first season's offer at "Homkamming", it was not more than a horror story, but a rather unpredictable political statement. The situation in the screwfle is the story of any virus in the world that replaces sexual activity of women with murderous tendencies against women. Explaining the way the scientists killed the screw flyer in this episode, everything started well with a short film. Then there is a small scene where a man was arrested when he found the body in his house. I guess this is supposed to be seen at the beginning of the outbreak, but it is unclear because it is clear. This episode plays for a while. Bla Bla Blah Bla It seems cool and mysterious, but the episodes of the episode become worse and worse because it comes to the sad and unhappy end. The worst phase. Well, without chocolate.
