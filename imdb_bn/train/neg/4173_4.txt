When I was excited, people would have to tell the trailer. Predictive soldiers, led by Vettel Michael Ironside to receive the bad ass vampire. Space. I did not mean high industry expectations, but it looked like a potential B-movie classic. It was no doubt a TV pilot, it was later brought back to feature film. All right, I'll start with some good point movies, the action was suitable for low-budget movies and CGI and used locations were passable. Now, on the wrong side, there was barley outside Michael Iranside first, and its performance here ... was not good. But since I said that he was not so much, I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid, was the PTA type group for the vampires, or I'm not kidding, it is the least incredible thing to meet over time, and it's taken seriously. The film also works on one of the major B movie sins, it tissues a lesbian scene and does not provide. Everything that is shrinking in this movie will not really happen. Since it was meant to be a pilot, the script is almost incomplete and it does not end up regularly. Even the main villains, only come to the end. The sledge and gore factor, if ever a movie is needed, then it's the Vampire War. While closing I would say to the chief crew of the spaceship, all were very skilled actors and could very well keep this mess behind them, and go to larger and better things. They just had nothing to do here.
