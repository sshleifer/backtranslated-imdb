Yes, I'm sitting with the whole thing, why does God know why? <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was very cold outside, all right, they are all shameful but they are <br /> <br /> I give 4 possible 10 stars to Darkling I have seen more bad movies, but it is certainly the right thing to do in the old trash bin of bad movies. Scripts, poor performance, bad light, and special effects on Chess. <br /> <br /> The story, which is not fully understood, is moving around this simple little family, father, mother and little girl - I guess the audience is considered "identification", three of them were tedious and annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Daddy Robin met a wealthy man who owned the vehicle and owned it on the "mysterious" Orient. Robin puts it in a birdcage and refers to it as "durking". <br /> <br /> During filming, Darling has been interpreted as about 3 or 4 different things: the shadow without a person, the inner darkness and Satan among us all. So any of your explanations should be sorted according to your preferences - believe me, it really is not a matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem of darling seems to be that it desires a partner. A man gets companion - and then finally dissatisfied with the people. This, of course, after the disaster, a lot of wealth increases after disaster to hook up with The Dirling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - this is a very long, tiring movie <br /> <br />
