After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to release this shot because it shows the mathematical modeling in an unrealistic method. In the episodes that people would use to predict the behavior of people using the Charlie mathematical model, I thought that my career was having fun. I am not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the person why the fairy tales are closer to "make-believe" <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is a demanding task to select the right model for predicting the situation. Charlie Episz is shown as a genius, but he must spend enough time for the appropriate model, especially to try to guess what he will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are uncertain and unstable, have no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov wrote about this even in the 1950s. Even if there is a model for a specific person, it can be a possible (stochastic) one, which means it has a good chance of making a false prediction. <br /> <br /> For the second, the correct model is considered for some or a condition is available, the model parameter must be known. These parameters are not stability of equations, such as gravitational acceleration (9.8m / sec), and often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Apes must overcome consciousness to find the right parameters for its competing models. And after choosing models and parameters, they will be tested. Strangely, they are not, and miraculously, they fit precisely the predicted situation. Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by numbers, by science -fi movies: The computational effort needed to solve these models. Try Excel to solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one can find a great job. Even if Charlie Epis has the right software to solve its models, even if the hardware can get stuck, it will be terribly slow. And even with the right software / hardware combination, the model solution can reach days. He immediately solved them! I could use computers for his research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a play, it is far from the best show. Characters have been stereotyped somewhat, but despite being in the Big Bang theory the remote is not too interesting. Crime is frustrating and Charlie Episodes sometimes find the FBI quite inadequate among them. <br /> <br /> The show can work for some people. For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!
