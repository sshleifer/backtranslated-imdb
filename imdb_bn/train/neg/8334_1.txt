This is Robert Dual's worst performance, which sounds like William Buckley across the entire film. Her Hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this visual scene is stolen or unreasonable, I can withdraw it from a truly forgotten movie. For example, whether this image should not be shown in every amateur actress category. Thanks to God, Duvall went big and good things and stopped trying to influence a Sanskrit accent. She is a good character actor but that's about it. Klaus is a lot better. Its performance is muted and noteworthy.
