It should be a great movie ... Marily Strip and Jack Nicholson have acted as the two journalists. Mike Nicholas Instructions Oh! It's soft dull dull! Vain and expected! Slow and unconditional! <br /> <br /> It fills a cookie cutter 'boy girl, marriage to boy daughter, relates to son, daughter leaves boy' story. Theres an original idea now! After squirming in two hours (it was just two? It felt like six.) I was not sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was made in 1986. I'm sure that all of us did everything we did 16 years ago, which we will forget. I hope the loss of the honor of Strip et al has begun to be cured and the Emperor's Emulsion started fading. This is not such a bad picture. It's just that it's an outstanding one.
