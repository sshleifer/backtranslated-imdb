I never met Spike Lee's earlier films, because their trailer was never able to capture my interest. I saw, and praised Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster's work, and there are a lot of their DVDs. I was, though, totally disappointed with this movie. If this film gives an indication of Spike Lee's power as a director, my advice would be to get a "job" and to stop the timing and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I think some IMDB commentators have seen the same movie, which I saw. I can only guess from their lover's review that Spike Lee has been blinded by their chat chunks of their pieces. I only paid $ 2.50 for the "second run" theater, and still felt that I wasted my money. <br /> <br /> The IMDB "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - how you can draw a big budget "blockbuster" (Such as the promise of promotion of media) in such a short time? <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard is going to manage the first movie ..." - He might have done some trial in this project, so to give more time, of course. Although the writing was violent, there were some qualifications in the premises. <br /> <br /> All right! Maybe not I am sorry! This image was so damning with grave cleanness, improbable scenery and shy characters, that even she could not make much of it. (Hey Ron! Thank you for thanking Russell ... good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster took part in three weeks." - And it has been shown! The script of "Fixer", which removes human problems, was the script that was incredible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, robbery in the bank, and he will keep ... or what? <br /> <br /> * When "detractive frazier" (Diesel Washington) came to the bank to not verify a corpse, how many bank robbers "led" a policeman without guns (much less "go" a policeman ) To return to the front office, let the police officer walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. After the frazier claimed, "every reason I shoot" was given to the robber. So, why in their short struggle, did not he try to express in the face of robbery? He received the response he was seeking ... the robber shot him to prevent further detection. And why is it "Steve, Steve, Steve-O", (a bandit's associate), had to come and help so long? <br /> <br /> * I understand that this is not your general bank robber. They had a different agenda, and nobody did not want to be damaged. But police did not think they would. It was a disappointing situation for them. Why, when two wicked people "pick up the pizzas?" When they came out, they would not take it. (First, how many robbers came out without using a hostage like a shield? This version of NYC of Spike Lee, or SNL?). Decreasing them will reduce the number of bad people, break their plans, and the rest of the robbers will probably be overrun. If not, at least the bad guy will be at least. (Give swat something, or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * In this country, Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), a police department, will allow Waltz on the right to the bank and discuss what it is with the robbers that she Will not publish? He had no authority, no official certificate; In addition, all this later, "already" a hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why did the CEO of the bank (Christopher Plummer), just destroyed the blame document a long time ago? Broken image! Diamond, he could sell. <br /> <br /> * It's "scam", (not character, actor) with jersey accent, it's easy to volunteer, and he knew the recording was "100% Albany", but he could not speak himself yet. Sir! Get your hands down! And his ex-wife! Is she a "schlump" !!! Both were completely incredible. <br /> <br /> * While questioning the suspects, Dr. Frazier, who are not part of the frustration, are constantly harassed for them? (Ie - the elderly woman could be talking, and then she could not, could not then?) Pause me! <br /> <br /> * Bank robbers have seen that the hostages want to enter the jump suites, can not they come out of the bank to be hostage in their escape plan? <br /> <br /> * At the end of the movie, a false wall was made in the supply room, behind which Clive Oven was hidden "a week" .... Where did the stuff come from? (drywall and foam). It was also assumed that they were riding on the boat, so he could relieve himself. Bank employees did not complain about smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such rebellion; Since the robbers were captured "hand", what kind of "reference" was received from the CEO of Mrs. White Bank, was the goal of Blackmail now because of his failure? <br /> * And the end, but at least not least, what's with the "Electric Glide" of Dangle? How stupid! Should his "determination" be directed to judge his judgment? He was rather a man who took shelter in a shopping cart, when he tried to prevent an intestinal movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Something other than medium plot; lousy script; Bad acting; And overall kind direction ... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully enough insight will be given in this film so that others can help to determine if they can waste their money! <br /> <br />.
