I started by saying how much love TV series is. Impossible to follow his dream because of the tragic nature of the middle age of the people, it is impossible to impress, because it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to practice. In my opinion, it is a doubt among the greatest British season of all time. The TV series is without 10 of my 10 reservations. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie is a true tragedy in every sense of the word spin off. Very rarely the TV show's success has been successfully transferred to the film. This movie is very annoying, sad vowels that often take me to tears at different times. Harold is being beaten in a leg (and not funny), it is not my idea of ​​the comedy, but it is definitely one of the fans of the TV series who would not love this movie. The film was lazyly screaming out of Albert Sincke and was seen to be besieged by neighbors. <br /> <br /> In the Harold and Win romance has come out completely from the tone and it is amazed by the fact that this film is annoyed to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectful girls, or stripes. <br /> <br /> Albert's reaction to comments made against him by Harold's girlfriend was absolutely invaluable in the TV series. In the film, Albert says that there is almost nothing to do with increasing such opportunities. <br /> <br /> Most movie spin-offs of British films seem to be fairly neutral, which is a significant exception to Bush movies (which was even better than a respected TV series!). However, the stapto and suncoat must be placed in the lower right corner of the body and at the bottom of the millidered. <br /> <br /> My suggestion - skip this and see again the second spin off, steppe and gold rides instead. It's a lot lighter tone, more faithful for TV series, and actually very funny.
