Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the film's atmosphere was the first class, the actress is memorable and the story is a classic. I recently bought trilogy and saw interest in Part 2 again after seeing Part 1 and I was very happy to understand that in the first part I was happy that there was a fitting followed in the great Godfather film, everything was just perfect and I was waiting to see Godfather III I could not ... .. wrong! I want to stop at the second. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story like a story, especially the female characters were weak. The passinose project was a weak character, which was eaten at Godfather 1 or 2. Then the scenes such as the Caroline Church singer, all horse horses are invested with all the decoration of the Catholic Church to ride on the sunset, helicopter machine gunning in the invisible meeting (where 'Goodies' goes, and everyone shoots), the pasta bit across the board of a girl and the first cousin , Step-by-step shooting ... ... orange juice for diabetes (a mother of her intelligence and cave Usa is not ready for an emergency?) ... and it was the best of the best will in the world I would not be able to see it again. But I will look 1 and 2 times a year.
