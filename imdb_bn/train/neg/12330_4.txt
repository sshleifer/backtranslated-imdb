Let's keep aside political purity and see it in terms of countless sexual fantasies published in the 1980s because I do not think it is better than anybody else or something else worse. Unless you have a religious clove or a tall woman, you might see a stupid movie like this, without having to do all the work around the material and I personally find it completely innocent feeling before and after watching it. The story was established in New York's Albuquerque, where a rich 15-year-old boy named Philip "Phily" Fillmore (Erie Brown) naturally started the espionage of horny and attractive maid like hell, which started work for his father. <br /> <br /> ***** Spirir Alert ***** Nicole Malo (Silvia Cristal) is friendly to Philly but everything goes warm when her father goes out of business, and she starts to get screwed up with him. She invites him into his bedroom to see his clothes. Philli is painful and does not know how to react first, but soon she goes for her and is sex, but her horror seems to have died from a heart attack! With the help of lazy Lester Lewis (Howard Hesmman), she apparently buryed her body but Blackmailer showed a note from the show and Philly must definitely get $ 10,000 out of her father's safety. When Nicole looks at Phil, she gets surprised and she knows that the whole thing was planned by an extortion founded by Lester, and he just went with him because he is an illegal alien and if he does not tell him that he had talked about Lester, the immigration office Together they tried to get back the father's money before returning home and they collected help from Jack (Ed Begolly Junior), who was a tennis coach, but told to be a policeman for fearing Lester. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was not in the other person's style. Director Alan Mireson can congratulate that he has created a hit film, but the fact is that he never made a career in the film, though he was very successful on television. So ... why so successful? I think it can be only because of Kristel and you can decide that I'm crazy listen to my reasoning. Crystal was an international star due to her soft-core films, so for many reasons, many free thoughts encouraged adults to watch her in an American film that was widely released. With that, the same adults also imagine the idea of ​​teaching their own young people and ways to make love in the elderly woman, which is probably very inexperienced and brings young enthusiasts about the film. However, that is my thinking and if anyone of someone likes to hear it but it comes back to the film, it is clear (and very sad) that such a movie can not possibly be created for religious reasons (except Europe) is correct And there are other incited freaks who would not have any harm to him that could not come with the condition that only a teenage boy is being laid. Indeed, it is a valuable service that their BOYS prayer will happen to them! The film itself is weird and very clear in the double-crossing scene of Crystal's body, especially if you take care of the difference between their breasts. The story (though its fundamentally confusing) is neither very fun nor publisher, so nude scenes are really the norms of the genre.
