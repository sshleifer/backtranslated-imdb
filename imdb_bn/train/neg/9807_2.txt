Very rarely I can disagree with IMDB in a show or film, but I can give less revival reviews, but strong morphine power rangers are very painful, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> If I thought it was an animated series - I was good at assessing, but as a live-action show, it specifies the terms 'Chess' and 'Campi'. Which is Power Ranger. Five multi-colored, super-spandex superiors fighting evil by using their martial arts skills. Clothing is awesome - they think of something that will wear track and field athletes and female decorations. Acting is frustrating, and the war dances are so frustrating and so widespread that it looks as good as the Gene Cloud Van Dam, Bruce Lee, which itself is different. Actually, they seem to be jumping and dancing; This was some version of 'Nutcracker', or they are doing ballet instead of war. Besides, there are some cartoons that seriously show martial arts and are still made in a fun-yet very sugar way, which shows it as stupid. <br /> <br /> Whether the kids show up or not, it's just long and on the edge of ignorance And although this version is set in America, you may apologize for the thought that you have seen some sections of war that they did not hear in the United States, but rather in Japan; Thus the Japanese edition was borrowed a bit 'warp' and footage - only juxtaposed in the US version. <br /> <br /> If you want such things, then Japanese with Sentai - equivalent.
