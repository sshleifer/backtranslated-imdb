There are two points to clear at the beginning. First of all we know that this year Oscar was really this year. It was the way to show the people of the academy that they were not racist, and never did. They wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is absurd to comment on the show, because what would be the difference? But, it's fun to write about This year I was fed up with the Oscars! I do not see the show again. Every year they make some mistakes. Before winning the Crowe "Gladaitor" they should have been for the truly victorious "Rondfen's" Ralph Fiennes. If you have not seen this movie yet, then watch it and you agree. When no release took the "Wide Shot of Eyes" no nomination. And as far as this year, good choices were everywhere! Buzz Lurmman nominated "Best Director"! Are you kidding "A beautiful mind" is up for "best make-up" ???? Gets "training day" nomination ?? The film was horrific, and it seems that Washington could not even launch a single performance, which he proved, he used to use the four-letter word! This award has won! Take the language and I think he is playing around! I liked "Gossford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how they could not give the world to Ottoman! I mean, come on, if the man is given a reward for cleaning a bad feeling, then what about Altman? People now have 32 years of public eyes and no Oscar! I was bored much about this year's Oscars, but I'll stay with it until I have to show another show again! The high level of show (and only the only) when Woody Allen exhibits the best show of all time. She will go down as the greatest moments in the history of the show.
