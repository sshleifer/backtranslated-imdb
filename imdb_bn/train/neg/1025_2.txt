That's the only question I have left with. Why was this movie so big cast when it suck so much? Why was writing so bad, did the audience become completely connected to the characters? Why is it not in any sense? Why did the studio take a perfectly good compound and "Hollywood" was better than all when it needed, saying smart stories? Why? I will never be released because the movies started as frustrating. I hope spainy at Freeman, who is an Oscar winner, is not released on America's big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyone achieving a degree in journalism is a complete ridiculous one. I just think that this script was possible, but the execution was executed and it was a terrible one. Just. No
