The book is fantastic, this is not the picture. There is no reason that this image can not accept a future technical aspect of the book. Hell, the total revocation was released a few years later and it did a good job, even a clock orange published in the '70s did a good job of trying to come around the world in the future. The shameless German expressional colors of the black and white footage of the visible screen, this method has no reason when the film was created in 1984. The main character is the work of writing a white collar, which still works like oil. And cockroach in a garage. This picture decides to adopt a joke-communist approach to design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel does not necessarily refer to a communist, worship-lower-worker theme. This book is more relevant today than it is today, in the modern context. I can not see this shit for more than 20 minutes. Soundtrack is annoying, the lack of telescopes is boring, it seems that the feeling of truthfulness or credibility is denied if the film requires the message of the novel to be hammer.
