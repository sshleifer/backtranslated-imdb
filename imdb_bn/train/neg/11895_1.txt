O my God, what happened here? !! I'm not going to say it again but what kind of background movie? Among the "King Kong vs. Godzilla", it was the worst, more than Dubbing, Linda Miller had to be the worst actress and the case was really chessy. Some villains said. Dr. Dr. Dr. But when this robot broke Gorilla that King Kong has the same power, he tries to build another one and then to kidnap Kong. When he (when Linda Miller is annoying) he makes Kang his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes who then sends robots after him. <br /> <br /> When I was watching the movie, Linda Miller and other strokes started crying when I got a headache. I sat by the sadness of watching the DVD when it was playing, I hope the movie's crazy ending will end until the war is over. The end can be a really bad reason because they can again show up in the dinosaurs of their island war. <br /> <br> Do not watch the movie in any circumstance or if you ... be careful about the frustration you get.
