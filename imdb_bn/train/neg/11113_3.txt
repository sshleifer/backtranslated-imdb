I often think of Scrooge as the slam of those films that others are angry - or, I write the review to adjust to the unreasonable raves. I think this film is almost inefficient, and it is unusual for me, faster than the soft, quieted dialog, quickly imitated, even with the blue, cleared musical numbers. Whatever the originality in this movie exists - a musical, extravagant fantasy, unusual personal setting for some animation - more than a script offset that is not an intelligent or amazing plot development. Separately, June Havre and Dan Daily seem to be beautiful people, but can not afford a movie as a team. Do not have to be really taxing or have too many sex appeal. They're both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is one of the nice notes. The best part of the movie is to give me a beautiful dress and great body of June Havar.
