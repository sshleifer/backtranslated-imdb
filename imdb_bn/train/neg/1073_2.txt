I can not believe that the waste of so much merit in one movie! Gingerbread Man starts at the right foot and leads to create some great expectations for the end. But at some point the movie became one of my worst stories. It is so incredible that how Malary Dos is managed to drag the character of Kenneth Brangh with his nose. The final measurement of the film is flexible and flat like a beer, which is very prolonged outside the Sun. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst grishma-movie and it is not that they are surrounded by the talented film. Do not waste your time here!
