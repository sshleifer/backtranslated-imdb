I did not finish this movie for some reason, it was awesome and it was only acting. I was not sure what the film was about TB, it did not get much knowledge and violence was not horrific. I used to practically want to nude something like a film (lol) but due to what was happening it was just sick. All the letters bothered me and it was full of loud shouts and the camera was vibrating in part and it was like a blower's sigell with the project but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and please like my time again. I will not recommend this picture to anyone or even consider it. (N)
