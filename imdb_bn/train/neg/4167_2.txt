I was interested in seeing "Mr. Fix Brick" because I was a huge David Boronius fan. However, I was nipping 1-1 / 2 hours. The courtyard is enjoyable: Borian's lens valentines is owned by a business called "Mr. Fick It", where couples help their girls to get them back. Among the problems of <br /> <br /> are movies editing, scripts, and acting. Although I was delighted with Boris's role in his other film (in addition to the exception of the film "Crowe"), it was frustrating. Occasionally, his character was attractive and others, flat. Support cast reminds me of the soap opera day players. I do not understand it was a big budget film, but the scene is cut and music seems to just do something right. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Look at your own risk.
