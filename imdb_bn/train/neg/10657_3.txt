I had great hopes for this movie and saw it with so many prospects; Basically due to Kamal Hassan She is an amazing actor who has ever identified her foot step in the ray. But this movie proved one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After watching this film, the film's atrocities and violence and the watch is very good. <br /> <br /> Progressive, Raghavan, a brave police officer. Who is engaged in the investigation of silly serial killings. Raghavan has found the connection thread in this case effectively and is close to solving the murder, and has kept the Saiko killers, behind the bars of two mentally disturbed but meritorious medical students, but they escaped and became victims of the murder. Finally, Raghavan kills both of them after spending many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killers prevent the viewers from going to the theater. Murder and sexual harassment and rape are very clearly shown, which can survive without the film. <br /> <br /> To even imagine, the thirteenth child is going to see the movie in the theater and they are not beautiful in the picture. Director Gautam must understand that society and its audience also have some obligations. Of course, I'm not going to watch movies like Gautam's name in the production list.
