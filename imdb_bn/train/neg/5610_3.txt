This documentary starts with an interesting generation - it is a playful and credible argument that the history of Jesus is generally believed to be probably a legend. Sadly, though, after making this film with us, the film completely replaces gears and becomes more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and easily targets simple goals. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with the writer / director church (he is a former Christian evangelist and some have made some angry) and this film seems to be his liberation. The first 20 minutes will be interesting to watch, but overall, the movie is frustrating.
