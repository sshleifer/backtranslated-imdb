Disney's Wicked Live-Action After George's jungle, I had high expectations from this flickr. Main disappointment Thread bare plots, bad acting, bad visual effects This film relies on Lang's one-liner, stupid (and pointless) product place, and the gadget is the longest most annoying side-stick in the car. I take two kids to see it and where they bored their mind. When the only smile from this movie is laughing, a bad standby shows that the man hugged it!
