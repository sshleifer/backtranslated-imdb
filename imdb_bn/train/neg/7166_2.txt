This movie could have been very good, but it got smaller. Chess special effects and so played. I could have looked at the past that the story was not so shy. If there was a background story more, it had been better. The center around an evil dragon witch associated with this woman who gets a migrines from the plot. The film continues and does not clearly explain anything, it only puts plodging. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely stupid, as most of the movie. This movie was potential, but it seems something really bad for the TV movie made. I will avoid this movie.
