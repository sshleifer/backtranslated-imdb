When I was released on the theater, I saw this movie as a child and it is so bad that it creates a family joke. If the ranking is empty then this movie will get it. Dinosaurs were awful. The storyline was ridiculous. Acting is not really worthy to say acting. The only reason to remember the name of the movie is because the reason my family still speaks to BAD.
