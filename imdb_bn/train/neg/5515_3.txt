This cartoon can be said to be a lot better; Background rich, smooth colored and nicely completed art deco full details. During the animation, the normal studio value is up to, which is clearly higher than the current day. However, I found it tedious for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: This is certainly not on Brad Bradley's normal criteria. Although this is probably considered the inventor of the "Great Gatsby" setting, it ends up being frustrating, sleepy, repetitive, and monotonous (not as repetitive and neutral as the fifth Symphony testimony of Beethoven). As most of the people (with me) close their eyes, most of the cartoon scenes will be missed by the audience. <br /> <br /> Story: I'm not a secret mystery which is not already in the plot summary - the country is good, the city is bad. This is a common theme among both animated and live movies, from this era. This is a wrong place for a rural idea atheist, which at the present time, reflects similar nostalgia for "values" that were never present.
