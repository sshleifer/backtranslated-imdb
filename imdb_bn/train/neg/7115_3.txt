All right, so during the hockey offer to anyone who died in fear of the fear of cinema, the coffin is free, so the link is funny. And so the first "skull scene" is so drawn and non-suspicious it's fun. The real plot of the film is somewhat modest, there is at least some real food to think about character behavior, and plot twists are just as good as awful Flickr. Acting average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Together, this movie does not fall flatly as 1/10 movie. It is not terrible enough to get the lowest ratings or even the second lowest. If I only read the screenplay, then I would say it could be an appropriate movie. It's just the terrible aspects of the movie that destroy and produce. So it's a bad movie, but there are many bad ones out there.
