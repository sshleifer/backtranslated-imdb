I was so disappointed in this movie. I do not know much about the real story, so I was interested to start playing in the film and educate myself about a little bit of history. With such a powerful truth story and great actor it looked like a sure combination. Well, screenplay has failed them somewhere. It was so scattered - about her childhood in this childhood? His love life Her own inability? His ability to speak? His passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to include everything in a good story, but this movie was not there. I see letters that were unlikely because of their letters, but because of their personality. Other small consistency: 1. heavy tool soundtrack. It's seventeen years - we already got it! 2. If he is such a remarkable public speaker, then why do not we treat more than a snippet here and there - even in most Montage?
