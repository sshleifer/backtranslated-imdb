So I have heard from some people that this picture has brought tears to their theater. For the first time I saw it, I hope another romantic, tears, Barbara Streisand film; We are doing something like Way Way Way I was certainly wrong. Chemistry was not intact between the two main characters, Ester Hoffman and John Howard, it was impossible to connect with letters. It was not romantic about anything. Streissand's character has fallen into an alcoholic drug addiction, which could not sing a single song without hurting me fast-forward. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she pays her five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about the death of a star and a woman who can not realize it until they actually killed it. The parts of the film began to pull and I asked myself when I was finished. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was completely expected. At the beginning of the film there was a completely clear reaction to his helpless behavior, and when I died I did not feel any emotions. It was not a tragedy accident, it was originally an ass. Not to mention throughout the film, I was confused by his beard. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie is Streissand songs. The end of the movie was singing the song "With One More Lock It / Watch Closely Nieu" when the song was a great reason for the 3/10. That was the only part of the movie in 7 minutes, I actually felt emotions without irritation and anger.
