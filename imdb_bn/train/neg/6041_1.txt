Very sensitive research about this story about three women: Muriel (Charlotte van denin find) is the largest, Laura (Els Datermans) who is 37 years old and Mary's oldest mother Martha (Frieda Peters). They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Essential Laura wants a child. Murriel came from the village and wanted to change his life in Brussels. When Martha was young, she dreamed of her young man. Actually nothing happens in this movie, so wait for something to do - for example an accident - which can make this story dramatic. Over time, you discover that director Dorothy van Dan Bergi wants to develop psychological portrait of only three women and does not do anything else. This movie is frustrating because you expect that women can not learn from their experience which is not in this case, so one is left with an empty feeling.
