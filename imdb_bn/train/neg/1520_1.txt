Why did I waste my time with this movie? There was not a fun rig or line across. Slapstick was not even funny lightly I really, out of piped out vacuum control vacuum? Why is the name of the National Lampuna associated with this national film? Even the Christmas holidays were even better (I was really thinking the picture was so funny). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
