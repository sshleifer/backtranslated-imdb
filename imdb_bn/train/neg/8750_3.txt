Eldelfo (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, relies on her mother to help in living and hiring a satirical NYC apartment. She is a beautiful neighbor known as Angelica (Jennifer Bels) who may not be able to marry, but Alfofo would like to star in her movie. When Al was unexpectedly financially promised to finance a film from a strange person in Joe's name, he thinks he has made it. Whereas, Joe takes a piracy stolen as part of a financial support as well as an adventure. Will Aldolpho be completely filmed without a moral backdrop? And, what will Angelica play in the film? The views of these viewers, a horror movie. The script is uncomfortable, with a plot that willyers willyers. Beals its line and Buscemi all real snarls, though desired, non-script. Boring elements and basement letter boots have a good deal. Finally, the production prices are very poor, the film always shows at the second rate. If you have time on hand, it is still a good idea to not miss this film. But, if you are a strong glutton for punishment, go ahead and see the thing darn. Beals do not look beautiful, after all.
