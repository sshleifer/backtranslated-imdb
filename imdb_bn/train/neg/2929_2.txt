Not funny - can anyone link to Monty Python? That's ridiculous - there's no smile. It's not funny. Above, but ugly, just because weird is strange and it seems to me that these people were some time all the time. Unfortunately something that is not funny to them. <br /> <br /> Anyway whatever efforts should be given for it. Indeed it appears to have a smile track - or is there a? Hmmm .... Since it's very cheerful since it's a controversial question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I am doing this wrong - maybe it's a little bit of exercise. Some artworks - in which case something goes, never remember. <br /> <br /> But these boys are playing women with high waves, reverse nose. Come on !!! Not funny <br /> <br /> Only Monty Python is the only heir to intellectual intelligence and Stephen Colbert and probably John Stewart.
