They simply did not make the letters wrong, only voices do not suck, the writer does not need the importance of only girlfriends, only drawings are crude, but it seems to have been made for 1-6 years of age. I never saw this show which kept me, "The family was a matte", because I liked Robin's character. And sometimes I think it's a general copy of Batman's animated series. Example: Bruce Harry Dent's friend at BTAS, yes? On the story of two episodes, he was transformed into an unlikely villain, tofus. In the story of "Shaw" Bruce Atan and a friend of two episodes, he was transformed into an unlikely villain Clifes. It was a small example (it may not even be true), but in short it is the best effort of a Batman series. And that's saying something.
