Can anyone really see this room if it is not around the little kids nude? From one of the filmmakers to the point it's one of the worst movies it's probably faced absolutely terrible. Wake up a few days later and thought that I would make a movie with little girls and say art, trap them in the rural areas and there is no story or explanation about how they came in or why they did not appear. P * Ron film does not need anything like that because there are live or parents somewhere. I'll comment on the rest of the pictures but I've ticked the spoilers so I just want to avoid, avoid avoiding and find myself to find a proper movie
