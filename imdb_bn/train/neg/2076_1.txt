Well I would say the worst movie this year has probably seen! Curiosity was extremely unhappy (it was not expected from PG movies) (PG rated in Canada) and they were not funny! I hope at least some good acting with this wonderful cast but I did not get it. I'm huge of Rain Wilson fan and for the first time I was frustrated by his performance. The characters of Luke Wilson or Uma Thurman are also not very good at choice and I have not been less aware of any of them. I did not expect the same as I did before that I liked other films by this director (for example, for six days, seven nights). The price of this movie was not more than $ 10 and I do not strongly encourage you to watch this movie. Guaranteed that you will be like me as I begging for this movie.
