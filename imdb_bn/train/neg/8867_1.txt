Oscar Peterson This picture is unique. His uniqueness does not fall into the story, because half of the volume has served us a relatively unfortunate plot in the production of Hollywood, but it is related to the equal transparency of all aspects in a complete and vague way. <Br> <br /> The dialog is worse than embarrassing. The rolls are thrown into the mix and the mixture of unrealistic direction. Bosanians add a strange element of humor to speak English with Swedish languages. Unwanted lightning and camera work are covered on turkey film cake. As a kind of surprise for the audience, some of the least inclined slow sequences you want to expect at least are. In order to insult the injury, the whole thing is cut by someone, without any timing. <br /> <br /> "Bad guy gets good after hearing bad people's speech" is the scene of the church, which is always the worst manager at the time of Ed Wood Dehron; Move on Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
