Hope to have a good movie in the theater near Sky Captain in 2004. Almost every review of this movie was positive, the effects were tempting, the previews were convincing. No need to say <br /> <br />, frustration does not really describe the feeling gained from this movie. It was angry. <br /> <br /> Out of annoying and bad writing, this image gets more than 2 out of 10, because everything in the film was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and theft: This was theft. More importantly, it seems that filmmakers do not steal a point to progress or move along the plot. They just stole that they could. At the beginning of the movie there is no literary meaning to show a clip of The Wizard of Oz in the theater, in addition to another scene of the same movie theft (which I will not elaborate). Not to say that every idea of ​​the film was not original and the old concept was not spin: from the old Superman Cartoons Memorabilia-ray robot and its latest film "The Iron Giant", the silent martial artist's monument used in numerous films, in recent years In "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace", it is best known as Dr. Blood Moulle. <br /> <br /> The subject of the real movie, most of the performance was completely wood. Perhaps the reason is that the entire film on the blue screen, computer imagery stores the performer with everything. Actually, it is not an excuse for poor performance. If a person was a child, they realize that lack of visual references is not an excuse to try. Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The drama is only real people here. Almost all opponent robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the movie can be counted on one side. If the robot is attacking the entire planet, will we not see the people of humanity walking from them? The sub-performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting something here, really, here, really. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the worst movie, so I could not give it 1. Rather, this film was an example which was wrong with modern action films: Filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but it became flat without artistic outlook or any kind of originality.
