Brent Kennedy was a very good manager, but you did not know this by the wooden mess. This film is not only cheap but it is cheaper - most fight scenes have been lifted from "The Last Command" at a much distant place since 1955, and this footage shot 32 years ago, shows the contemporary from anything in this photo. Indeed, footsteps shot for this movie are incomprehensible, confused, and incomprehensible, like the rest of the film are lazy. This is a bad student film look and feel (and the budget does not appear to be a whole lot more). It continues like molasses; most of the time, the top ham or under-the-top komatoz is played - even though Raul Julia gets better than most of the rest of Castro - and this is a boring full historical mistake. On top of that, it's a long way. If you're going to create annoying films, then do this in an hour or an hour and finish it - do not extend it in three hours. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960th edition, or even from the 1955 film, that the film stole its action scenes. It is difficult to believe that six producers have taken it for the film to be produced. leave it.
