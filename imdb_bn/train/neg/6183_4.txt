In 2005, George W. Bush began with the second term as the President of the United States; North Korea declared its occupation of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a second illness; And Into the Blue is a movie. The existence of this movie is not as bad as other incidents of that year, but the film itself is sad and probably the worst since that year. Now, in 2009, there are other US President, another Pope, New Korean Nuclear weapon ... and film Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it says the same: "Get your fingers cut Better than getting a head cut. "This signal is really bad film which keeps me extremely indifferent and reluctant. Cast 2: Reef TV series is authored by actors who are completely lacking in credibility and drama, but those who are suitable for showing their body. Chris Carmack (OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Chunky), Masha Thomson (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (Hill) brought hollow and annoying performances. I liked some of the previous films of director Stephen Heck (especially Critters and Bill L. and Ted's extraordinary courage) but in this film he can not create the tension, emotions or entertainment of the lowest level. The characters of this movie are not only poorly edited, but they are also boring. After all, I want them all to have cinematography from this movie and it has been created by a technical team that produces promotional videos for Hawaiian Hotels. Blue2A: Reef is a horror movie that is better than the original movie, but which I said earlier, nothing is the same, similar. This costly movie costs all.
