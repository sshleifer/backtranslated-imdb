Unfortunately, this movie does not offer any credit at any cost. Nicholas Cage, as far as a wooden actress is concerned with the woodwork, with different skills in the screen, from non-plated to top. Supporting cast is not a good one. <br /> <br /> The scene is similar in appearance to the visual progression, but it is worse. The audience is not given enough detail to allow viewers by what is being sold. It turns out that this is just a bill of poor products. Unbelief can not be suspended, no suspicion can be given. The only protecting aspect of this movie is that it should be highly visual, such as a medium requirement, and any place that should be scanned. <br /> <br /> There were many smiles in the audience and in the literal sense, the last <br /> <br /> Frustrated! Wait for the actual arrival of television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
