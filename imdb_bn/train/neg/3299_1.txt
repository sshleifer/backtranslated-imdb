This will be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad movie but I'm caught by surprise or not believe it or not. The storyline includes traditional, all clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The conversation is so bad that you are really laughing when other semi-bodied actors are trying to create a true sound of it. The film is not so good, the music is so rare that it actually makes me angry, the actors are not even trying to make the script almost impossible that they have played for 30 years, and for the so-called steps, you can expect more that the scenes are actually managed for the lack of "action" Do it. <br /> <br /> Why am I not going to get such bad films, who is this shitty financer? Where's screening? Why do the actors take the mission to the impossible script in the world? <br /> <br /> In addition to the desire to reach the theaters, there are millions of Hollywood-movies in this theater, even for direct videos, it really shows than the professional. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about it except the title, explaining all about it, I could hide 2 hours of my life.
