One of Boris Karloff's real clinkers. Originally death of Karl (see 120 years of age) is a scientist who needs cash to finish his exam before he dies. His fund was taken by someone else who moved to Morocco, where he went to the south of France where he worked a physician while extracting sufficient amount to prove his theory. Encouraged by money, he made a deal with a cotton baron young man, who is going to die. If he helps the husband with his poison, he will fund him so that he can take his money and take a gigolo (who I think is married). If you think that the movie you see is wrong, I got to read it, then read about how other people posted for posting. Why? Because this movie got me lost in two minutes. I did not understand what was happening to her numerous letters and multiple converting plot lines. Little Spade is not called up until the end and out by a lot which I really do not care about. It's a totally strange interest for Carlof's performance. To be honest, I had ever seen him suffer in the wicked area of ​​Lugosi. It's not every scene but a few, and it makes me wonder how much they lost.
