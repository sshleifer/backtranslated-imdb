I was looking at the 100 below Imdbs because I thought I did not see anything as bad as an outdesk or roller force rimica as ID Plus 9, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur beat both. <br /> <br /> I have seen so many innumerable movies I've seen that it is the worst movie ever. Bad directives, bad characters, horror, horror stories do not have any reason, but Sam never said anything positive about this film. Sam was a terrific annoying actor, but his guidance was so bad that he could only overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work. Unfortunately I will have to give at least 1 star but be eligible for it's continuing star.
