This is a pretty bad movie. Intrigues of the plot are Mush. I guess production quality is okay, decent photography, disobedience and all that is. Mark Hamill was terrible. I do not care much for her, and this movie makes that idea legal. He never had any surprise other than his other career in "Star Wars". I'll just say "buah-bye, mark", because he is well versed in ambiguity. On the other hand, very little Anne Potts stole the show. She showed all the charm, beauty, and acting chops in one performance. I recently saw him in "Texasville" and took note of his looks and looks. It's interesting to see him ten years ago. However, if you are not interested in Miss Pots, shouting for the mountain runs away from this film.
