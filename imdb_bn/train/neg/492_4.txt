If you are behind the first Barclock artist Artemisia Anthony's real story, you will be disappointed - but if you're behind a logical body-ripper associated with an art theme, you've got the movie. <br /> <br /> This image is a primarily erroneous painting that almost cries me in Artemisia uniarchy's life. (Type in Artemisia error on Google and see some vs. fiction articles.) However, from the technical perspective, the film was right: set, costume and especially the Chiroscuro light helped create the experience of the century at the beginning of the 17th century; Although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccessacies let it down a bit. <br /> <br /> How did I see director / co-authors Agnes Marley at the time of his film's safety? Perhaps he refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which was unfortunate, because he could face it, he was.
