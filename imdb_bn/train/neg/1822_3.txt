Again greetings from darkness. What ever happened to the great Barry Levinson? He gave me two of the best choices of "Avalon" and "Dinner". Along with this there were some fine films ("Ryanman"), but till now have provided some of the interest. I believe that what you can say about any comedy is the most annoying. "Jealousy" annoying definition. Ever since the great fan of pure slapstick ("fool and dumb"), I was surprised to see just how bad this movie is. The whole thing may have 2 chocolates - if you can concentrate for a long time. The best part of the movie is the continuation of the title track of the song song redbone-equally. If the film is written along with the song as well, then it can be tolerant. Rachel Weise is a wonderful actress and I realize that they all want to make comedy (even Julian Moore), but in the real world one weakness is revealed. His role as SNL caster member Emmy Poehler turned his trailer princess to the top of his role. The film's disaster was Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first thing blends some promises together, but then its chemistry disappears due to poor script. This script is like most of Jack Black's character - not a bad idea, but there is no hope for success.
