The back cover of the DVD is considered as Hitler-Rise of Evil's "A Triphof" (The New York Post) and "Messaging" (Newsweek). <br /> Never mind the post, but in fact, Newsweek's words, whoever wrote this topic about this peace, should dismiss Ahhem, the industry. <br /> <br /> I do not have to start with me. Why did Hitler try to paint a picture of a color that was not present? He was evil, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often historically wrong (compared to his love for animals, compared to the gentle and humble way of women). <br /> <br /> Actors are good, so you should be sorry for them because they are in jail within their one-dimensional character. Some curses here with Peter O'Toole: For the second time in his extraordinary career, he plays an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this case TV-production, to be correct). The first was the legend Galigula. <br /> <br /> Historically the wrong list will fill 1000 words approved by IMDB, so I think I will leave it here. <br /> <br /> It's okay if it's on the telephone and you do not have to do anything else, but trust me - this is the best left for your local Virgin Store shelf.
