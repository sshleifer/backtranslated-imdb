A big step down after this amazing enjoyable root. This seagull is not nearly as fun as part of, and instead it takes too much time on plot development. Team Thompson is still the best thing about this series, but his wiseracking in his entry is toned down. Performance is all adequate, but this time the script gives us down. The mere routine and the plot of action is only gentle enough, so I need a lot of smile to entertain during the movie "Transcer". Unfortunately, the smile is less and far away, and so, this movie is the best spectacular.
