This is ever the biggest shame in TMNT. Thankfully, Venus Canon is not officially available in TMNT. No woman will be turtle, it has moved away from the sad story of the 4th generation unique mutants, who never have their own family, they will never go away again. The biggest mistake was to get Power Rangers to cross the TMN with a horrible episode; The voice of the turtle was wRONG and they all acted out of character. They can do such good work, advanced designs and animatronics and no Venice. <br /> <br /> Do not get bored with these people ... it's harmful stuff. The lip was looking fuzzy slow and irrelevant. They are completely humiliated labor. Chief Baddie, some dragonland dude was corny. The turtles looked a bit like the hanging things of their body, what was around the rope jungle? Stupid looking sculpture plastrons! <br /> <br /> If they looked natural, acted in character and were released from Friday, stupid kidneys got rid of cartoon words ... and good writing could have been better.
