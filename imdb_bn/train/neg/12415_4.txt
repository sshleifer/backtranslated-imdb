I do not think "Baranabi Jones" was a blood, standard detective show, which according to a Queen Martin show that the law was not more than the murder, the law was the final character of the killings, the law was not the third. Plot Twist (another character murdered), Act IV was the resolution and Epilogue Betty (Lee Merivithor) asked her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Body Ibsen) how he found the offense, and then someone said something strange at the end of the show. <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> One thing is to remember, the wonderful theme song of the great musician Jerry Goldsmith. Curiously, the opening credit sequence wants to shut me down and the show was in the air for seven seasons. I would admit that Ibsen is very good to see Ibsen in other roles except Jade Clampet, despite a bad accident in Ibneen. Update <br /> <br /> (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with the musician Jerry Goldsmith on his YouTube album of archive of American television. Let's just say that I am more like a Gold Myth than "Barnaby Jones."
