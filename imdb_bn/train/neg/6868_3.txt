All right, accepting as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'm going to be a little favorable against this photo. However, it seemed that Boake Yakin's sole purpose of making this film was the Orthodox-binging. With our wigs, modest dresses, and individual seats, we already have a pretty simple goal. Yakin it's not past the surface. As a result, there is a more lethargic film than Swiss cheese: 1. Ask Sonia Sonia to love her more than Geo or her parents. Then he deliberately disobeyed his father's command that he could not swim due to his poor health. Sonia burst into her son's bris. Why is a laughing lady of Monsiea respond so strong? It is hard to believe that he had never been present before. Let's face it, even the Reform Jews keep Bris Milla events for nowadays. 3. Mendel was sleeping during his chason class? She was convinced to satisfy her wife's feelings in bed and stop him from kissing on the street. Especially in Boro Park's busy street! 4. Sonia and Mendel were married for more than a year, and now they have noticed that they could not explain each other? The little thread - The arrangement of marriage does not mean that the girl should take the first set with her parents. If the marriage does not work, he will not leave the society. 5. If Sonia really wants to get involved in the jewelery business badly, then she will not have to go through her intellectual brother. Finance female doctors, lawyers, teachers etc. Sonia has become even more mad than sympathetic. Instead of controlling his life, he returned and waited for the incident, and then complained that he did not like the result. Who is not standing in his environment; That stereotype is pandering. Really, I think he got what he got.
