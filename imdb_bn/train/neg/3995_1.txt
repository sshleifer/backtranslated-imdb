'1408' cheap fear strategy is the latest hodge podge. The fans of the date-movie-styled dawn can sometimes look in your ears and shout in your ears but the audience will be deep and frustrated to search for directions. <br /> <br /> John Cassack is a writer who has been a career in writing rumors about his experience writing a book in the book. In spite of the hope that the relatives and the owners of the house roam around, they make the believer an abusive believer. When he learns about the history of the room 1408 at Overlook Hotel - do not wait, that is, Dolphin Hotel in New York City - he has decided that it will create the perfect finished chapter of his latest book. But, in the hotel owner's game Samuel L. Jackson tried to disturb his guest by describing how the torture occurred in the theater after the hotel was inaugurated several years ago. The story is simple and we will sit through the foreshadowing ramble of Sussex, as much as possible, Jackson. <br /> <br /> Another thing: be afraid! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, at this point. And if followed, the cheapest "bouse" is more than that which is so frequent and arbitrary that you can expect them soon. Room temperature changes automatically. Drip the walls with blood. Fearless writer can not open the door etc. And an estimated one and a half hour after reaching out to the audience, the big thriller promised, you can sit and hope that at least you will end. With suspicions of dreams sequences and other derivative time-waiters, even before the end of our film, we fail to disconnect our doubts, we finally have something to do to reduce the film completely. <br /> <br /> Despite the grand performance of Cusack (as always), who originally added the whole film, one of the silent role of the note was lost (that is, Samuel L. Jackson). The real mystery here is that the movie got so much high ratings rating. Ballot-Stuffing Scratch?
