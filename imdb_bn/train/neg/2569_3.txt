Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is gently touching in the 1970s in Turkey, but the script is so long and humiliating that the young man of Gouldy Haunton (even after his Oscar win) can not start dragging it out of the ground. As a skirt-chasing celebrity at the age of 40, vendors mostly feel embarrassed about the degree of light. <br /> <br /> The best 10 = best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young study type. <br /> <br /> I hope Haun and the vendors have been well paid, because I did not see any reason for such rebuke in the 1970s (a very good year for movies - Catch-22, Musash, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, five Easy pick and much more). You can not win them all!
