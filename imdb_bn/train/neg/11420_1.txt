St. Elmor Fire University has no effect on living (most of us are for general public). Why is this garbage even made? Who can really relate this? Who lives like this character? I'm really sorry for the actors to deal with such horrific scripts. This "film" has some talented young actors who have done a great job elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This is the only joy of Sir John Hughes that it is expected that Sir John Hughes laughed at a screening of his professional breakfast breakfast in the same year. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the same mistake because you enjoyed the 80s movie. It's really offensive to that genre
