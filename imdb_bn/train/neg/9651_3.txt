The movie is total shit. Our two good actors who have played and attracted the main female audience of an actor Salman Khan's meat. The story is a shit. Scatter the letters badly. Talking non existent stories. What to edit Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star .. It's a dream in itself. The movie drags along the point of frustration. In the whole role of Arjun to bring manna to London, let him suppress his girlfriend and do not play OMaili (Bumble with sinking system) unreasonable. Salman Khan is very painful on top actor or fading. I think this producer looks like some good films of Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all the best directors are falling prey to the box office ... the Mumbai media created the dead bodies. This is another shit film in the link of "Wangkhate" with a stupid actor like Salman Khan, which does not have a good Hindi movie. He was good for Indian cinema, because the Titanic was in the winter cruise business. In a positive note, I like Bhartanatam dance of the character of vanity when he changes the western style dance when the teacher is not looking.
