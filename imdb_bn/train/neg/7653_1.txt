First of all I want to say that if I could honestly rate this movie from 1 to 10, then I would like to give it a -4. It's not a serious critic, it's just that this movie is bad. From story, direction, editing everything is horrific. Half of the beginning of the story is not even close (you can not expect much of this based on video games, something I was not aware of going to movies) but the direction and editing has become worse. The movie goes to the scene that is cut at a peculiar point and is completely unrelated to the previous ones; Some, like fast sex scenes in the middle, do not even show how the stories show no feelings to each other. You can see the scrap pill in the film for one and a half hours and you'll still be frustrated. True, if you pay to watch this movie you are wasting your money and if you do not give anything, you are still losing one and a half hour of your life. So please do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
