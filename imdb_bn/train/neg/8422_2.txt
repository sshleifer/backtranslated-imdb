Before I start, I want to say briefly that this film is very well-formed and well-connected with itself and well-connected, including Whitaker, who deserves his nomination. It is extremely entertaining, and so on. . . FICTION adopted in the right context as a work, it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is dangerous to sell a work like people's true words. I firmly say that the film does not have any of the credits that tells us that the main character, Nicholas Garringen, a complete discovery of fiction. Rather, it represents this character in the real historical setting and allows an unknown audience to guess in real life and what they see is true. I am not concerned about combining truth and fiction - but such an unfortunate thing is to do such a bad practice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The country is rife with the suffering and suffering of the people of the country. Hollywood has long tried to enjoy the suffering of people in these countries. But Hollywood also has its eyes toward making money. The only true way to capture all the tragedies that happened, but the West can enjoy it for themselves, or at least it has been captured in an honest documentary. <br /> <br /> But these imagery of imaginary characters can do so only in the real historical settings. At the end of the day, they decrease the audience's presentation to make their own decision for the audience, and say more about moving from image to image and holding onto the head, "Look, we've told you bad!" After sitting through the film, anyone who wishes to see the documentary in the DVD can find its preliminary example. The most striking picture of the film is the care of Eid's second wife, Kay Amin, when he died in search of his betrayal. In the film, we see that its organs are reverse and re-connected in opposite (legs and arms on the opposite). This director is sure that Amin is you, as sure as Gungans say, the bomb is bad! But if we see the documentary, we know that this is nothing but a mythological incident, at the time the Health Minister was sitting, it is not true. <br /> <br /> So . . What . . They just make these things? Why? Because Hollywood gives less opinion about our intelligence, so why! They do not believe us to come to the right conclusion. Let's see, he is murdered and destroyed, enough to reach the conclusion that Amin is not like a person in the media - we do not need the inspired image of the Chensso Moss of Texas to strengthen it! And this is the tip of the iceberg. Also casual viewers are not explained that the lead character Garygin himself is imagined. There is no Scottish doctor under Amin Wing. In this way, Greenery was obvious to us that it will help us to understand the fool's western African world. The producers think that we will not be interested in this until we are interested in a film in Africa. (Wickedly, even a title character is portrayed by American-American actor!) The problem with this is that this film is not a release of Amin and its regime, but rather a exploitation thriller to come to a white West Africa. The wrong reasons, the cost of three innocent lives, even the various terrible mistakes, and then "release" yourself yourself. Actually, I want to say that the true tragic death of Mrs Amin was a result of an effort with the imagined Scottish doctor - it seems to be almost modest - it seems to be becoming a fun joke for the occasion of entertainment! I really wish to stop jerking around us for our money in Hollywood. I first frustrated the tremendous tendency to do this with a hearty heart, Ron Howard and the lovely sweet adaptation of the life of Akiva Goldsman, which removes the dark side of the human being in order to present the only oppressed hero of America. Not enough. The sad fact is that Hollywood has been selling these faxes for years, and the visitors, who are unfamiliar to predictive and understandable, too lazy to investigate for themselves, buy this fake portraits hook, line and syncer. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure Amin is being turned into a villain that he is not. My point is that so many people's cruelty to the truth is so disappointing to tell us, why would Hollywood go to such a fictional length? Why is Hollywood continuing to insult us by holding hands through these films? Why can not they believe to think for themselves ?? We can not just establish honest screenplay on screen, and can the audience decide for themselves? I always look at Hollywood's certified "true" movies to support myself for the sake of investigation, and sometimes I do not want to see what is on the screen.
