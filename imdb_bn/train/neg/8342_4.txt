Salvage: 10 out of 4 Groundgay Day met a Christian Coalition horror film. Okay it's not bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstone's Lorraine Curie Lewis) is disciplined and potentially killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is quite annoying and cruel). I probably said because he woke up and had all the dreams ?? Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem of the film is that this fifteen minutes plot (completely good for the first time) is repeated repeatedly. And Claire wakes up every time and every scene is definitely a dream or an alternative reality, I care about what happened to Claire and ultimately I am surprised to pull this lump twist together. <br /> <br /> was rooting for a sensation (which earned honestly even more knowledge) but instead got a very clear one by half wonderful endings (gram or bottom thinking) Yup film collapsed faster than Dono's directors. The last six finishes of the best of awesome films, the real attack of physical graduates, my happy birthday, because the audience did not expect the interpretation of the left field. (The hack was even worth 13th jolt at the end of the end of the last Friday end) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A note piano soundtrack (though the featured songs were appropriate), the obvious time padding (clear dishes, clay clay subpages), in the same way as the "serious person" in the clay, it is a serial <br/> <br /> <br /> < br <br /> <br /> <br /> <b r /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very clever by both and almost Savvage enough to cure only keeps your interest if they see that they are going to fix this mess. The problem is they really do not.
