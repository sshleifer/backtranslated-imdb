The Crowking Tiger came along with the hidden dragon, much talked about the revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe it. Now those who make movies in HK, they have given new meaning to the cross word. A perfect example of time runs out 2. Ikon Cheng's name is a draw, here, but he mostly flipping the pictures gently and flipping a coin. She flips the currency over and over again and again. Why? Who knows? San Lau is a coin who flipping the cute-spanking boy after the coin. But who knows again? A female actress, a beautiful woman who runs any kind of resources and has to pay ransom or something, but in most cases it seems she should be in the spa or shopping center in front of the camp. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no gender. There is no comedy. All have a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who care?
