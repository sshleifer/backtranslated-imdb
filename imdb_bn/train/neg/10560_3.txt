Here, many of the critics, whose opinions I respect, hold this part of European slavery in high esteem. Personally, I do not like it. It is an innate effort in an atmospheric time crossing between gender and violence. Jess Franco makes this kind of film at its best. Unfortunately, the notorious exploitation filmmaker Joe Di Amato is not. D'Amato's most famous films are notorious for their high gross outings. This is not an initial film by her, her more infamous "Anthropophagous" and "dark farewell" that has not continually despicable scenes. Finally, it is an incompatible movie that does not allow viewers to engage in any way. Apart from the Seedge Factor, it becomes very annoying. I said, others have enjoyed this picture, but I found it as a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are several plus for the film. Eva Olin (from "Candy") is in it and it looks pretty hot and is often nude. However, civil movie icon Claus Kinski was completely destroyed in a sub-application without any connection in the original way. She seems bored with the role and she does not have manic intensity at her best. Music scores have some nice moments of nice and funny funchers. Yet, it is a chaotic and unmatched film that drives incredibly annoying. (3/10)
