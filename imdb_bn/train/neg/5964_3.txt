I have seen the title version of the film 'Horror races to grave'. In the question, the horrific medieval magician Spanish played by the legendary legendary Paul Naschchi, he is playing with Abanajar in Church Hall Patto. When he was a silly descendant (I think he played with Nasir), he got up from his grave and returned to his ancestor's house and reunited the wizard's head and body, which was separated from him by the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Clearly, if the head and body return together, all the hell breaks and many people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer has a lovely assistant here. This one else is awesome by the awesome Spanish, played by the beautiful Helgo Lines. In the film line, she gets her time off like every other woman. There is a lot of nudity in this movie, not just women - we can even see the dance body of the dancer, which is not a beautiful scene, I can tell you. Most of the sex corners of the film are laughablely ineffective. A particularly interesting scene where NASCI and LINE discuss their bad plans, and then suddenly they both decide to keep the rope of the oppressed young blondishers. <br /> <br /> It is in beautiful places - especially the moment of the Herschel Gordon-Luis-Esquier, where the line puts people's hands in the chest to remove their heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the photo is a very effective body that goes to the end. They are quickly scared away by a fire, and do not bother coming back. Which is a shame. The scene where Zuma's emergence is the most ridiculous moment in the film. It all happens in long shots, and we see some statistics shambling from the distance until we've actually received a formula until something is happening. There are various garbage moments like this, thanks to the poor editing. When a worker falls under the hypnotized spell of a head, his face becomes bigger, which seems permanently permanent and does not work for any purpose. <br /> <br /> Not everyone is a great movie, but a lot of entertaining. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed American version that was probably broken into pieces. I know that the original Spanish version can be a wonderful composition ...
