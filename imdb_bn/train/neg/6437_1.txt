Spoilers <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing happened in this movie, except for a woman bloody. Second, it was not scary. Third, it was the worst soundtrack ever in any movie. Let me elaborate. The sound is edited by Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure, so let's go with Bavis. The film gradually gets more quiet and people make volume and explosions, force you to start the volume (I have seen this in this room). Then Beavis slowly heard some really loud with some volume / shocking images, forced you to reducing the volume of fast again. This happens so long, please, the movie ends. I can take pictures of Bevis's strange way behind the two-way mirror when the test team is directly reaching far away. If you have children and like to watch horror movies after sleeping, it is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here is a thought ?? If you are going to create a horror movie, at least 19-year-old blonde girl who shouted off the lungs just before she could shut her sweater, before throwing the shadow of her wall. Eating live outside the camera range, the cat is being thrown to scare the audience in the camera, a little scary humorous smile, or a monster that looks like a stage covered in aluminum foil (lost space in a la TV). These people did not try to frighten me. They just wanted to hit my ears.
