Without repeating what has been said about this movie, I want to add that I was looking forward to watching this movie ... Cast / Location and Excellent Director Michael Winterbottom etc ... There was a vague shadow ... from the beginning. Not ' Living around different areas (Italy) Reduce loss of ... or perhaps I saw it? As a result, I waited for the story to be published there and put a spin on what we can expect with this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there sitting there ... and guess what? Nothing will really happen! And I mean nothing !! You do not even have the chance to go to the characters because they are 1 dimensional and neutral .. You have been inspired to believe in the motion of the film that something will happen to make the whole movie change its head ... With the local Vespa boys, there was the chance to direct the film in the disguise of big girls, As a result of the little girl's philosophy of her dead mother, I became fruitless and vain exercise , Parents tried to be influenced by one of his female students. His age felt ridiculous. It seems that the script was last remembered where they decided to end any frustration of the story and it did not have any effect at all. When the credits started (unexpectedly) you can not help but feel looted at your time, sitting in the junk of this junk.
