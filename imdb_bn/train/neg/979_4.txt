Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start the basics. Everyone says Star Wars and Star Tray are the best science fiction films that start at the beginning, which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this film, Solitte Green, is a much better choice than that series. SYLENT is perhaps the best secret of science fiction. This is one of the most recent, yet one of the most forgotten movies, but the effect of its setting is becoming more reality with every passing day. Charlton Hesson overdramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, is far superior to Sohel Green than anyone else and touches his final scene. <br /> <br /> It's 2022 in Manhattan, a tremendous fate of the world's fierce and deterrent (strawberry jam costs $ 150 a small junk). A big executive officer has been murdered for swillant companies and the police has filed a case against Thorn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are researching the film, then the secret of swallowing is not a mystery. Swimming is enjoyable, but the full screenplay is a joke. It's as full production as cheap. The drama on screenplay and actors created the film, but it was completely ridiculous. Everyone seems foolish and nobody knows the rules, especially Thorne likes to take the police to the apartment, looks shamelessly around and steals anything they want. Character interaction keeps your attention in movies, but you still realize that Sohlin Green sucks. There is an enjoyable piece of time you have, but do not expect anything more.
