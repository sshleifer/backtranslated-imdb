Although I recently gave a positive review of Operating Pettocot, although I did not really like this movie despite being very similar. Both the acting career grants were both just a few years apart, and both were WWII comedy. However, the overall tune and style of the films were quite different. For me, Kiss for him, like a cheap movie - with poor writing, little power and some broad performance - even in comparison to the operation Peticotate. I think that at least at least this blame lies about casting Jenny Mansfield. It's a budget film look like it really came from a third budget studio to adjust its huge talent and limited acting capacity. Thereafter, there was not much chemistry or energy to add to Kerry Grant - an actor generally preferred for his grace and class. Sir Laurence Olivier's pair with Marjari Mine.
