Once upon a time, a science fiction writer wrote a classic book called H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called "Little Fazi", which was a man who discovered a little obscure humanoids of the other planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but many Hollywood and today's writers started plundering his grave before his grave was cold. This book has got ideas from Avocus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An intelligent repoff like "Little Fuzzy", I wonder why I have ever noticed? <br /> <br /> But do not accept my words for this. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
