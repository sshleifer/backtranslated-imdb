In a small space of spacecraft, the crucible land in the world, when the earth rapidly increases the weight by consuming the earth. The only part of this stupid drivel that I've enjoyed was all the coolest classic cars. There were so many holes that these dogs could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing actually made 20 million bucks? And who was the salary of McQueen 3? All was overpaid overwhelmingly. The 'giant' looked like a big beetle and 'teenager' looked like they could come to their children's age. And those explosions from the shotgun; Sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. The end was desperately trite; Clearly the producers kept the door open for a sequel .... and there were many. Frustration
