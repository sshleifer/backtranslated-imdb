To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this movie is about 80 minutes of drinking annoying characters or making bad jokes. Music is just awful, humorous fun and not all female characters are slutty idiots or total geeks. I think the film actually writes a 14-year-old boy, who thinks drinking alcohol is designed to please the men and those who oppose this view are all called gaiacs. Also, this film has nothing to do with the original American pie films, besides the other name and Mr. Levenstein is like this little character. Only good things about this movie are beautiful looking girls. Do not watch this movie and do not make a fool by rating 5.4 because it is clearly overrated and not worth anything above 2.
