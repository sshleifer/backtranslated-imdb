The dark in-game alone is my favorite role playing all the time. I faced the PC screen on the whole screen, trying to escape from the palace and was really surprised at the time when the monsters were charging amazingly. Now, remember - I'm tired of "computer-game-generated" movies. I do not remember the unique success story of this new Hollywood, although there is enough entertainment to watch. And yet, I'm such a big fan that I can not resist. My reasoning was that if the platform is similar to the movie, then it would be fine. <br /> <br /> People, I had 90 minutes in my life (which seemed like 300) that I will not return when. If I had that opportunity, I'd gladly spend reorganizing their SOC drawers. This is not even "so funny it's funny" category. Christian Slater was a little more sensible than you think even joining this stink bomb. Now, his red ... I'm not complaining about his presence. However, if this chick has to show a sex scene to play a starred role - which I fully understand and support (Hey, I'm a man!) - I saw most of her body press conference. <br /> <br /> There are no plots to talk about. Do not waste your waste on pitching it in your time. The credibility of the story has gone down: 'I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinsky.' Acting but some height above 'Street Fighter', which is one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend such. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend video games. It has many good stories, acting and many more thrills. For the film, here's a spoiler - it stinks! Wait for the porn version.
