What is this A Canadian-produced junky flick that I did not hear before. A dead body has recently been working on the body of a deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback that shows how the man came in there. Basically, he and friends went to a cemetery on 13th Friday and raised his enthusiastic chanting thanks to the dead. Return to the morgue where our bodies return to life and kill the dead and the owner (who comes out of his eyes). Final WTF? The shot has a straight jacket funeral home owner and shouted, "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, his eyes are back. <br /> <br /> A little while in 58 minutes, it's definitely a diversification in the zombie movie. It feels so much, but what kind of transcepts me that I could not stop showing. There is one in the movie "If you see this picture then move away from the screen" gags. This is the image of an old man who is becoming ill in a theater (predictive?) And when he pops up (only twice) then blood flow starts. The scenes are pretty pretty poor for duration. There is a great gossip where a zombie threw the right hand of a belt with his belt, but - when he gives a fake hand to kiss on the frame - it's a left hand.
