It was almost impossible for me that this image would be a bust but I was really frustrated. For a few years, as a connoisseur of Peckinpah, I found this DVD, I got a great deal to sell and thought it was a shot price. Pikinpah fans have intermediate credits among some of the well-known opening credits, people and animals, but when we plant a bomb here, children in our school are unaware of environmental sound. Fantastic mystery Then, when Peran, the ear and the duel travel to their next mission, Bubal bows on Duval Cane that on his night his date was an STD, he was hiding only through his purse, when Canon was close to him. Upcoming smile is fantastic, and at the minimal cost of Angle Dickenson, Brian Depalmer has clearly paid tribute to the costume dress. The problem with The Killer Elite is that the film is flat after the first opening. Bring me even Alfredo Garcia's main production cost, a bold call about what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as a complementary lecture material, but once they are finished, killer Elite closes.
