Although a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you avoid it well. I saw this one on television, so I do not have to waste cash for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although the first 30 minutes or more is credible, it gets even more incredible at the end. This is very suspicious, if L. An experienced soldier like Watts violates the direct command. Even if he wants, the rest of his platoon will be. They know that he has given them direct trouble, and they know that if they follow him, then they will surely die, but what is the head, he is ours. So let's do what we say. (Remember the direct commands). However, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They can save a few villages, where genocide of total population is being done by the rebels. Well, they save dozens of villagers, the rest have already died. Its strange part, they took the trucks behind the rebels. They go to the foot instead. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for this. Anyway. I think I have achieved what this movie has achieved. <br /> <br /> Why this movie has insulted the brain and it is completely unbelievable that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so much rebel, being hurt or killing themselves. In the end, they opened a few comrades. That is why they have to fight against 500 or more soldiers. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight with an army of many, kill hundreds, and only separate a few. And they have ammo round and round. It does not run out. Grenade and clay mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where they get this thing Does it carry or almost? They even got a laptop that shows the activities of their enemy rebels. And this laptop is a battery that can go for days. Really? <br /> <br /> I think if you completely shut down your brain and acknowledge that rebels are a bunch of idiots, then you can give high ratings to this movie. If not, leave this one. It saves you time.
