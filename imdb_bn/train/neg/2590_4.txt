American pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first I believe the actors have no work and what they are doing and instead it's only a college party's rebuilding brown. The story was established as two new college students (young stiffer coordinates), the dreams of being present in the college are perfect night party, sexuality and of course warmth. The plot comes stupid and away along with the original pie. Actually they never saw an apple pie anywhere in the movie. Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent free. But please note that this is not a waste time until you enjoy full-blown nude sex and uncensored sex movies with crazy water. I myself am a teen and I believe Ivan the Almighty has even had a better choice instead.
