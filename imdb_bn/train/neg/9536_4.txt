Best of the 4 best, 3 better than, but only. Basically, I say this because part 4 is not against part 1/2 (i.e. 3), (i.e. they have no reference to Tommy Lee's siblings) However, I like Russian plot line of the story, And especially partly as part of the Seven Ol-Thorsen Boris Since and since some scenes of war, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very significant (especially in view of the impact of the aircraft). Also, part 4 is not saying something like moral or part 3, there are some well-known actors (Hodson, Tharsen) in part 4, but the series is nothing to start (and even these characters Have a very small role). <br /> <br /> Well, the best of the best shows, and the truthful, he can not afford a movie. <br /> <br /> watched on the tape, rating: 4
