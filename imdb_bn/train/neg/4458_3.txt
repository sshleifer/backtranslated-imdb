I've seen most of the French movies - and enjoyed - there was more talk than the action, but okay. I found them with interesting, good pictures and intriguing actors. (However, I am surprised at one stage that Gerald Depardie was not in every French film ever made!) This picture was the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then the talk, talk and more lecture was done ... which is fine for a play but not for the mystery of murder. After a while, I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film was almost like a game with almost all the scenes in almost one room. So, if you love plays, you should love it ... but I want a little more bank for a murder story.
