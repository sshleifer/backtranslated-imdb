When I searched for this film for high and low, I actually found it when I was expecting at least, playing Sundance one morning very early in the morning. In the last years of the TV show, why have I finally searched for a small vanity project created by Chuck Barriss, I have no idea. The film is simply horrible. Police with a script that is part of the week. Of course, the film's highlights are seeing real actors who were "too hot for TV" or were rejected for some reason or another reason. That part is still awesome, but the camps were bad which was enjoyable in their own way. Looking at what I was looking for, I can see my life again today? Do not regret !! Do yourself a favor and see the old copies of the "show of a dangerous mind" or a much better one. The girl was excited at just joking around the pops, but the JP Flashing in all the possibilities made me barbarous by the audience who suffered to see the morgan. On the heights, I'm very happy that it was a huge flop because it was a huge hit, then "$ 1.98 might be a beauty show movie" and my friends would surely have brought the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My grade: D.
