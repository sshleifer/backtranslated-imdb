There is no difference for the film, the book was good. Does anyone know where it is pictured? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. So now I look like a dummy, but I still think my comments will be submitted. And yes, British Columbia is beautiful or they have taken it from the coastal setting of South Carolina? (This question is standing) This place was essential for fabric and its change was part of my frustration with the film. Oh, I read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here are my other main problems with the film. Kim Basinger was very awful and I did not have anything to illustrate from the book. I know that the book was books and movies; Well not so good. The character of the book is very sympathetic. Also the book about the primitive image of the brain, evoked rusticity Although the "castle" in the film was even more impressive, it distorted the feeling of the story and seemed strange to the characters.
