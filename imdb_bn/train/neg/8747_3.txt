Anti-trust Rachel is a great car for the leg cook, but the director can spend her best scenes. In that scene, he is just a zombie. He is related to a sub-plot that is similar to the sub-plot of "Get Carter", but he operates sub-plots of "Gate Carter". (I blame the director) Director HITCO paid tribute. (This scene was Ryan Phillip's characteristic person who would not be able to believe Tim Rabin's character, at least I think it is respected to Hitkoc. The DVD shows the scenes that were cut. I think the director must believe his wit and listen to the test audience.
