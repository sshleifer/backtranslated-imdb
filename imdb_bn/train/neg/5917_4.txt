The film wants to extend the film that criminals are a product of modern society. Therefore, thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of this film, Karl Punjram (James Woods), three and worse) can be fully responsible for their work? A fun idea, but it is very difficult to bring on screen in an intelligent and mentally satisfying way. And here's the killer: A journal of killing is too small. Although the picture tries to show the behavior of the pajamas from the point of view, still its flashbacks are seen with the spirit of its violent youth and effectiveness, the viewers never perceive that Panjamam is a victim rather than a criminal. Of course, the system is corrupt, with a brain occupying the entire bay of Levenworld Prison (where most films take place), most prison guards are jealous, and jail director is something like a meglomaniial discot. But why does the new prison watchman Henry Lasser (Robert Shawn Leonard), who pays such regrets in Panjam? Even after reading his horror diary? The film gives some explanation: At least witness Ponzam is decorated with the most tragic (and stereotypical) patron and is influenced by Panjram's intelligence (although this thing is not very clear why this person feels so smart). Surely it is not enough to be sympathetic to such hostile people, even though this movie can reduce its crime and highlight its personality? At Kamarama, Panjram is quite faithful, and the viewer is given the idea that he is less than the tyranny of Panjam that he reads. Is this guy so close friends that he faces them who feel remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is less, a product of modern society, seeing the appearance instead of the substance. <br /> <br /> I can suggest channel thrones and Christina Richie performing monitors, which often manage the same theme. More Integrity and Opportunity <br /> <br /> BTW: Looks like the shot for the killer TV (not so good)
