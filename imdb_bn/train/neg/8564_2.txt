The movie itself is so kind. It depicts deaf people intensely on hearing. Indeed, some deaf people are aware of people's dating, but they certainly do not get angry like Marley Matlin's character. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance to the street in the street. Above all, the film itself is more annoying than pain. It's so annoying that I want to believe that it's an insomnia-cure film. If I have a sleep problem, I can only pop a little less children and see. It will let me sleep <br /> <br /> Remember, this deaf person is talking.
