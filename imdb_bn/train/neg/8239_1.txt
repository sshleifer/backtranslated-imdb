This is the most awesome movie I've ever seen. There is no idea that I'm not respecting to publish this concept easily. <br /> <br /> production quality is harmful. Cinematography has no pretense here. Camera work, scripting, acting and sound are incredible crass. I think there is a plot, but it can be done within 10 minutes to see it. The strange neurotic girls have no credibility in this piece center. <br /> <br /> I will request someone to spend any time or money in this title. It's really rogue. <br /> <br /> JDD - 14 December 2008
