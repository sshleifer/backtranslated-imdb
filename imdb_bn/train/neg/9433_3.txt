I bought Unhinged because I got suckered by the gory photos on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, look back at the box. All killings have been shown and I can honestly say that they are still looking very good in frames than the movie. <br /> <br /> Say this, look at the plot. A group of college girls slid the road into a rock concert (through a deep, dark wooden way in the longest ever driving sequel in Silhouale). There is no visible damage to the car, but apparently it was enough to keep a character in the characters of a comotose state for the rest of the picture (or perhaps read the script, and have already reduced before the movie starts). <Br /> <br /> The two remaining girls woke up in a big, isolated house. The house, however, is more imaginative and more dramatic than its presence than the film's actors. For some reason, though, this house is not going any way. The only way you can get the main road is by hiking five miles through the wood. Girls spend an old-looking dog (who seems to be seen by George Washington by dragging) and equally Homio, to hear strange conversation between the girl of sexual abuse. Girls were apparently not too quick to return from that concert that they packed more clothes than the cast of the island of Gilgun for three hours tour. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The murder scene, we do not care anymore. We just wish someone will suffer us to suffer our sufferings. Unhinged finally deserves to be that much better film that wraps with a very striking end. Ultimately, though it was over, a good idea of ​​the film was first written and then the writer tried to create a movie to move towards it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is an intriguing movie with a bad performance, inactive instruction, and a plot with a hole more pit than a leopard (sorry. I'm sure that came from where). Understanding how bad this movie is, how much time can be understood, for any reason, the screen turns black for about two minutes and the letters talk about something memorable. Do not waste your time. You just feel unhinged and want your time and money back.
