Sarge Fireball made a very definitive critic of this movie on the revival of the movie "Rev. Knight" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). <br /> <br /> Critics show how France was behind all the circumstances of the United Nations. <br /> <br /> UN soldiers were in hazardous condition, when French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the massacre. <br /> <br /> Previously, 10 soldiers of the United Nations were killed <br /> <br /> This way the UN troops decided to save their lives by driving cars behind the French truck. <br /> <br /> Thus, they failed to give up Teesi. <br /> <br /> <br /> But we must remember that the French soldiers conducted this situation.
