I kidnapped a family of three small children for one night and their mother showed me this week to catch up at Wal-Mart. Three children actually became physically ill. I'm sure it was a pizza they ate, or they all picked up from school, but it could really be this movie. Absolutely boring. Anyone can produce this power of this trash is beyond me. Thankfully, when I was responding to the child and watching the strange acting, I stopped the film. For any parent there, I strongly advise you to refrain from watching children from watching this movie.
