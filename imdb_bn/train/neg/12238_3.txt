There is a possible concept, and it was fun to see both holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> The film does not need to "explain" given in the blinking nostril film - The Force Star Wars films need the explanation of "blood pressure medicalians" Was not there. But mainly because of the complex complex plot of Winterbolt to destroy Sinta, the film kept me cold. He has the power to give advice in the mind of the human, so why is he not doing things in a circular way? Rudolph breaks the nose of the nose, creates Rudolph, threatens to dissolve the frosty family ... Pinky and brain ridiculous exaggeration plots and "Phineas and Ferb" Dr. Dofenz Hartz (which is intended for purpose and purpose humor) is easier and straightforward than Winterbolt That is what we expected to take some seriously. <br /> <br /> A character especially (and funny) strange moment when a character drops two of his guns to the bad guy, such as Boumanga. If they do not want to shoot guns in the family movie, but understand why the gun is first?
