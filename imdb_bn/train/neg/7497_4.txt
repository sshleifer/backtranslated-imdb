After watching the movie trailer and asking Spike Lee to find out, I was excited to hear about this event. I was not alive at that time, I did not live in New York, so I hope more than a history lesson. What I got was some interesting acting, many sexes, and about 30 minutes worth of movies that actually did something to do with Sam Sam. I think the film is not about Sam's son, but it was a chic in the summer of '77. The labels disappoint me. <br /> <br />
