"Trigger Man" is clearly the most annoying and siliest movie in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more interesting. <br /> <br /> Actors are appointed at uglypeople.com. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Together, walking more than three parts of the "ring of lord". After the first hour, I started to read a Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible <br /> <br /> Total waste of time and money. I can give 0 out of 10 stars, because it is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
