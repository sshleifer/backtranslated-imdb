In the unlikely case, some intentions are reading these comments, I would like to offer some suggestions (free!) From the viewer's point of view. If you want to make a serious foreign adventure film, do it. If you want to make a spoof of foreign adventure films, go ahead. Do not try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, following a stupid "comic relief" character that is dead and untitled and made with a tree shaking and dropping coconut on canobl's head, you see that you want to make any kind of movie. This one is annoying, scary, cheap, racist .... you get pictures. Some smart moments and nudity from Kathy Shawr (quite devious paths) are very rare for your hardships. Everyone forgot about the existence of this picture. (* 1/2)
