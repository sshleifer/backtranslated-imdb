I like this episode where Jim is Greenman. much better! When Jim tosses the little guy through the window, then the face of his face is infinite. Then when he began to address the priest on his wife, he knew that he was a P-woman? Great writing with great acting and great cast would see this a must. I'm trying to find a specific picture from that episode. I want to use it as my avatars on the message board because I think Greenman is delightful. Where can I download a picture of a gym like Greenman? Can anyone point me to the right direction to find a photo?
