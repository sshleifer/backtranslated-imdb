If you like films that ramble with spicy little plot exposure with spicy sex, this film is for you. Plus, the lead actress / actress (Newcomer TrancexLic) has an attractive screen presence, but it is not enough to add much more than a light-hearted movie - if that is the case. Originally, this movie is about 3 social outcasts (transouse prostitutes, male hustlers and Russians, gay immigrants) who have developed a bond in some way. Why is not clear. We hope these mootits are with the original honest people who have the power to love while laughing at their body on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith really loved her ninety few Chinese babies! The filmmaker has shown the stylish, unpleasant aspect of our lives, when we want to believe in the bottom, all these seriously damaged people are actually naturally in their normal range of a trouson that helps them through their life. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately it is pictured as the real look of life on the wild side. The sum, no plot, no real and no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Of course you just do not want to revel in the cone !!!
