Until I made a mistake, I hired a nightmare on Elm Street 3 many years ago and there was a music video, I was sure that it was known as Dream Warriors, and finally I hired it on DVD. That was one of the most fun things I ever seen because that video was there. Stuffs of the 80s are so funny, it's amazing, but not more fun than over 80 rap videos. After the credit, VHS version of this movie was released by the Dream Warriors song, and all of them were defeated like denim jackets, and there are no shirts below, and Facebook's gene shorts, which are dried like Daisy Dukes. I can not imagine a rap group may be more stupid. <br /> <br /> (at any time) I was frustrated to find the DVD in the DVD version, so I was all about this mediator Freddy Krüger series installments. Movie character starts with the same concept as Part 2, witnessing the death of all kinds of major characters in the main character, and then comes out of a trans and finds himself with a bloody hand. Christian Parker (Patricia Arquette) has received many nightmares about this infamous house that Nancy Thompson lived, then moved to the bathroom, the handles of Sync attacked her with Freddy's hand, and then she stood in her bathroom and tied her wrist and tied her wrist. From there, the movie becomes a installment in the normal mental hospital. <br /> <br /> "Larry" Fisherberg, who was tired of working hard as a nice guy in this film, always tired of playing bad guys in his role, but when the hard work is done the patients want to bend the rules a little bit. Not surprisingly, the speed and the range of the best performance of the film is what it does. Arquette later became an acting actor, but while acting in this film his acting skills were not perfect. The character of the film is mostly all the patients in the brain hospital, which Kristen is placed after her wrist cut. All of them are brutal and non-cooperative, almost no one believes that they are really there. Finally, they realize and they are dreaming about the same person and they are able to satisfy the staff because of no violence in their group. <br /> <br /> Heidar Langkampp returned to his famous role as Nancy Thompson as a result of Freddie Kruger's childhood experience, this time as a dream researcher. It is no wonder that he may be related to violent Christian and other patients, because he has experienced what he is doing right. There are some interesting killings in this installment and the technology used for special effects has taken a huge jump. Christine is a big, insect-like Freddy, who tries to consume a scene, in a scene where a television becomes freddy and with mechanical weapon, he is entertaining some patients there and punishes him a bit. On TV, but there is also a vague vehicle scene where some boys have been battling Freddy Krüger's skeleton, which is trapped in a trunk of some cars in a car junkyard. And one of the more jealous-trend scenes was Freddy, who attacked one of his dream patients (a famous sleeper), tearing his muscles and waist in his hands and feet, and surrounded him like a doll. Och <br /> <br /> We get a cleaned out of this custom Freddy's past. We not only meet his mother, but we have also found a situation that Fredie was born by more than 100 people. In Freddie's war, patients use all their bands together and their dreams, their special powers (most of which reflect their flaws in real life). A student bound in wheelchairs, able to walk in his dream, the other has the delightful ability of his 'wizard's master', the other is 'beautiful and bad' (there are lots of his makeup, his hair stands a foot high Mohawk, and his knife). Glossy, but the film fails when it is only one of the patients, no one can speak, in the dream, till the end of the film, he has no power, when he suddenly finds out that he can speak in his dream (to fix this day) Right moment). His dream power was a bit clearer, but it was released for a long time, but collectively now you see why this movie was titled Dream Warriors. <br /> <br /> It is not completely weak entry in the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually quite good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne showcased wonderful acting skills at the beginning of his career, left overshadows the cast, and rehash the movie is not the first two of the movie ?? Friday 13th film is more than Elm Street movies. Characters are not significantly enhanced to create many tensions, so most deaths are a creative way of killing someone in a horrific film, which is more than the harmful losses of one's life in characters. We know for the winners on their evil and came to the original. But then again, many horror films do not take their characters in time to develop in such a point that when you lose their lives you will lose them, or they will be at the edge of your life for your living. But it is important to remember that some of the horror movies which are often the best about the best ??
