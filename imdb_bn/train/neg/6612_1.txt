Yesterday I downloaded this movie through the Internet, was good quality! I was watching the movie with high expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially in the film Amitabh Bachchan is acting as a villain. Although at least actors like him were somewhat valuable in their role. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to overturn a villain, it has been proved that no one can compete against the trial of Amjad Khan's magic RJV for the past to rid the razakars! Sholay is a milestone of an old Indian film, an all-star, religious dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that still hits with the current generation. Good actor like Ajay Devgan's films have been spoiled and his performance was not that of an average politician an actor who did not know what to perform. Nisha Kothari has proved that she is one of our worst actresses. I do not know he still has no excitement and passion in the songs of RGV's crew Ummila and the debut. Mahanalal tried his best and Sushmita Sen's work was good. I liked him in this film, there was a total jail in the original Sholay
