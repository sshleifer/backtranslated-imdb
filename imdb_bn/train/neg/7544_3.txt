First of all, this movie was not bad. It was entertaining ... at least probably due to all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the real, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the strange Christopher River film. There are two plots in two movies, but both of them are scary feeling feelings and unwanted comedy. <br /> <br /> The intelligent man feels a mystery / thriller / male, please do not be angry with women's movies. I did not know the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice was a little off. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his magnificent evil spirit goes to an isolated island, Samarisel, when he receives a letter from his long lost mother tongue in Kulografi. Those who adopted her daughter's colleagues by the islands and claimed to be hidden. <br /> <br /> Since Cage is a police officer and a tired policeman, he goes on a semi unmarked island and does not tell anyone in the real world about his position. Stupid <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cage is on the island when he learns that the lost girl is her daughter and that lucky man is deceived for coming to this island as a strong victim during the festive season of the island. <br /> <br /> Male does not rent so well in this photo. Feminist display a sick twisted? <br /> <br /> I think the movie is sometimes ridiculous, especially when the cage pursues some women and revolves around the beer beer. I think there are many tracks in this movie. I found the whole idea of ​​angry women sitting on the road street on the street street without any care for women, but the way this film was portrayed was just odd. Although most women have had some shocking injuries and have been angry at them, it is obviously a form of sexuality. When I was reversed, I hated the movie. This movie is only something to see once or twice. It is not a thriller. It should be classified as weird.
