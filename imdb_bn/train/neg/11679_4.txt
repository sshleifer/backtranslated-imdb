First, this film is a "thriller." It is not "gripping, taut." It may be based on scripts, but it becomes difficult to enter at a slow pace. <br /> <br /> The plot is very interesting and impressive. Unfortunately, how do we get an impressive * idea after the picture ends? It leaves us with a two-hour sequence and shows some music scene with non-stop music that does not capture viewers and "shiny vixen" scenes that apply a little more intelligent sense. <br /> <br /> I hope this swift thriller box has been promised. It has been an outstanding film. Instead, Spike Lee finally plod along.
