This film moves 2/3 people to enjoy stupid travel. Sadly, the film is 'confused' till the end. Although I know some of the challenges of the competition are the standards of friendly 'friendly' films that I painted in the characters of each other's tinkling characters, but eventually the film is very dependent on the sequence of cracks and I have lost interest. <Br> <br /> Filmmakers have done a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we have seen who they are and they both have been identified before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's what about Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate deal 2. his relationship with a psychoanalyst 3. Investigating by internal affairs 4. suicide investigation <br /> <br /> If you add concerns about the case, you want to take congratulations and retaliation for his father's death. Now a few of these things are combined and are even together, but all the plot elements are combined in a long and unhappy one that combines my long-term and annoying moment and gives me a shit about the time of breaking my antenna and what's going on. Excellent screen-writing acrobatics can not overcome bad film creation. <br /> <br /> Because a ridiculous Chase sequence was not bad enough, out of which there are four separate divisions and could have been around half an hour, it was not bad enough, Joe Powellan fields left behind the perpetrator with the gunman about his real estate contract Talk. This extra curriculum makes the plot line and comedy criminals to make me absolutely meaningless. We have already forgotten or are not taking care of the plot of murder at this time because many plot-lines and back-eye candy submerged us beyond all understanding. <br /> <br /> When I was going backwards and how they destroyed a decent story, I will not. This can be a very enjoyable formula film, but it becomes much bigger for its Brits and it becomes an unnecessary waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett are doing well and a small look at Gladys Knight is remarkable. Sadly, this frustrating movie can not help a frustrating film from forgetting. <br /> <br /> It's probably better than "hull" and "Lara Croft 2", which still does not make the film look good. I once heard Harrison Ford claiming that it would only make films that would make money, I'm not sure whether it is true or not. It is true that you do not need a great movie or great actor to get big box office, this film does not have a major role. My advice to Harrison Ford: Keep Indiana Jones locked, because at least you can still run.
