I would have enjoyed this movie for Jason (Herb) there was nothing for constant harping on the test. The critics of the first seven Samurai complained of accusing Tosiro Mifun. Nevertheless, the more critics of the movie saw it as purposeful completion. Jason Evers is not exactly Toshiro Mifune, and that's just overacting her. <br /> <br /> This B-Classic was the most performed actor, subtraction Evers and showgirls. If you look at this movie, you notice almost every line by Ever has noticed, until he is smoking and smoke is running out and his nose is running smoothly. <br /> <br /> There were special effects for BA movie courses. In the dark, my mind does not have such a great thing as good or bad for this movie.
