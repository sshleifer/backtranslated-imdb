Amy, Posey and Rachel have no movies in this movie? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' This is good and funnier. Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is embarrassing for all of them. It's a cliché from the beginning. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least one idea. This movie does not use cliché after cliché rather than idea or script. It uses actresses' predecessors instead of character development. Bad, sad, and garbage. Now I must have clearly ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? It is another example of sloppy coding as IT ops manager.
