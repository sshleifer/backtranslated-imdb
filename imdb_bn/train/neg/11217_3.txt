So the wife and I finished it, stopped it, despite threats from both of us. In most cases, the most annoying part of this film was very less excitement. The act was violent, at the point where we were actually shining bad scenes (for example, the lady of the church) several times. The deceased sister was using her living twin in an unusual way to communicate, but then she sent a useful information that tried to frighten the hell out of him, which saw a lot like the ring. Then the police are involved - which I am sure they will have DNA on all the insertions they get - instead they make a terrible plan to 'get' the cover of the accidental death of her sister. The movie fades after that which allows me to kill him too because I call it a terrible plan. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad end
