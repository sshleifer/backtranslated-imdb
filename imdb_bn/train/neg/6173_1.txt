This film is a brave attempt to portray Regina's administration as helpless and knitting on the left side of Hollywood. There may be some mistakes during the crisis, but I am not sure how much the amount of filmmaking of this lamp film is. My first reaction was that Oliver Stone was directed to this movie, but I was wrong at the time. Apparently there are many others.
