Why such a generic title? Santa Claus ??? So soft and unpredictable. Films attempted before the holiday holidays that attempted to try, especially 'Santa Claus wins Martianas', at least its campaign, and all the stock footage was entertaining to use ... I feel happy for some reasons. But this movie just screws Christmas on the butt, and screw the joy of all the kids. Santa lives in space? Is his enemy a devil called pitch? Mariline Magistrate to help Santa? How is this Random? Well, since it was made in Mexico, so some of your images could be understood. I had to admit painful for some time just for that. It was an all-out cluster of madness! However, despite all the problems in the movie, it still looks like a Christmas movie. Good winner is bad, and thanks to thank Chris conquers the Santa Clausians, still a part of our heart, or perhaps our heart in the universe, or good for every good girl or boy in the world. .. apparently. So, I think you should always try to be one of the worst holiday films ... though it should face any smile on your face.
