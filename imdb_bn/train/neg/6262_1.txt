I agree with the reviews I've read here, and I do not have any words to define a Turkish, but in spite of all, I can still find a reason for movies that are still available. Did you reinstate the happy days that the video was a rich business and many movies were created for the sole reason of the video storage shelf? This film comes from that time and I can imagine that this was the only reason it was produced and simultaneously with many, many, many other stickers. Do you think "Rambo" imitation? And Z grade so many slashers, I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie, I can say that I do not waste my waste while watching it because I press Fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just a very interesting scene where a guy was hugging his head with a head that exploded because you noticed that they were made of plastic Was done. And finally, well, it was so badly damaged that I did not understand what happened. Similarly, I did not follow non existing existing schemes. But boy, despite this kind of movie the video was a big age.
