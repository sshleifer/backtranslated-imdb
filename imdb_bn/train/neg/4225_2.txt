This image is another Christian promotional film in the line of Omega Code. This is not necessarily bad, but for the truth that it is the most promising movies to offer to sincerity and reality. If you enjoy stereoscopic photography on the street and you can change the life of a Gospel, then perhaps you can enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent the cross and switchblade or mission. When will the Christian director ever learn that sometimes people say bad things? It was frustrating to show offenders who did not allow me to swear (Huh? Criminals say bad things?) And flat characters I could not really say. Also, if the film is shown in some T & Now something that I want to see. What did the film's counterparty wafer thin story compare with The Bondok Santos and the Sting?
