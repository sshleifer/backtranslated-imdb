Are you kidding me ?! A show highlighted for anyone who opens the cans and the envelope for the food? How talented would you have to do this? He may be able to cook but it is not imprinted in this half-hour murning of stomach painful production. I know he's Martha-Stewart-Esquiera Empire. So Warren Buffett but I do not see him with opening the opening of cream jewel and Alpo opening cans. <br /> <br /> There is a nephew in her name ... Bryce Brycer? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Silicon should be in your spit, not my TV. This show is a cartoon network, not a food network.
