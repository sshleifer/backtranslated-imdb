Someone will tell Goldie Haun that a young man was like a gamin 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies of the Liberation War in these years is an illogical disaster, which allows two leads to keep their trademarks as a common practice for bad trade scripts and bad.

He was the only actor who was less or less obsessed with this confiscated mess, his only mistake was that the rest cast would sink the picture.
