I got an opportunity to watch this movie inefficient and steady, for the sake of Rih and Raves. But since it looks really slippery in scary, it stopped back and went somewhere else. Before sleeping at home, black rains, predictive dreams, raw dirt they were scrapped before being screamed. <br /> <br /> How frustrating! The face of Chamberlain, almost obscure mask, presented a small but confusing disbelief, which I saw myself that the film went on to wear. Instead of what may be the oceans of Moon in the background and instruments, a coincidence design was created to beat terror on its head. The idea that modern people could form old deities is that the indigenous people believe that the red-white white men were the first priests and the other aspects were passed as well as the shopping lists, compared to an indication of another dimension (dream time). <<br /> <br /> [Speaker] In the final scene, what the director wanted me to say was not clear to me. Have a big wave? So what? How big is that? A tsunami? Yes ok It's not devastating but mysterious. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That would be a great darn big wave. Why? Was the world a bad place? It does not seem like this movie is so daunting. Actually I do not think the wave has been closed, since the shadow was hit by the curtain which was thrown by the waves. Was it just the Burton's Apocalypse? Hack, those who lose it will happen every day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burton's wife is scared! Charlie asked him, "Who are you?" And after a while it becomes really annoying. Unfortunately, the movie does not follow suit.
