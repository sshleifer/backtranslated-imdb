Well, how did I know about this "The Mole" donkey promotional "Lord Motion Picture"? I mean, when this "dinosaur" costume was shown, I realized it and the main singer of that time made his appearance, I was hamming the word "hard rock hello" to myself ... even though I hate that song. "Dark Flores" is about a young autistic girl who is going to tear out of his protective father when he is in the hospital, and the rest of the special elevator will fall in a short time ... when they come to find someone who is almost unknown to their floor It is quite surprising. The hospital is empty ... without any variety of monsters, they do not seem to be suppressed for any reason ... They walk through the Halway and the Sierwells, and they are miraculously faced with all the band band of heavy metal bands. Lock costumes ... Here are some really memorable moments about lazy acting, lack of cows / nudity, and completely shameless promotional edges, reminding me a lot about "meeting with KESS Park feeling". Yes, remember? I do not want to ... I just recommend avoiding all the fungus in the cow's house films and will not listen to Lords because they are the Gavar Repost Band!
