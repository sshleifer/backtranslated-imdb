I will not consider myself Leonard Cohen's greatest fan. But he is an important poet / musician of my literary / musical tradition. The most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's own life and career reflection. Warm and gentle <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians present in the concert do not interact with Leonard's music / literature method conversations. Nick Cave, Jarvis Kakar and Beth Orton were exceptions, though Leonard considered Rupus Wireless's interpretations of his songs as extremely valuable. <br /> <br /> This picture was particularly unsuccessful for viewers. Who is Leonard Cohen and how these musicians are associated with him? A lot of things are said about this, but the audience does not draw attention to Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident with interviews with Bono and Edge. They view Leonard as a special icon, but Leonard Cohen can not translate the exact value. Cooperation with U2 is a Farce. The complete live registration looks like a job job. And like the whole movie, Leonard Cohen is only a part of her and can tell about her own part. <br /> <br /> The complete montage and screenplay are like a high school external project. The effects of echo, slow-motion or flash images are kept sick. The camera work is somewhat annoying. The part of the score is probably remembered by any association that I could have expected. The filmmaker seems to be joining psychological elements in the film. Probably a reference to using LSD once. <br /> <br /> Some strange humor ... at any time Leonard says how he influenced the type of musical instrument. Initially, he could not remember the name of the genre, finally he said that it was Punk, punkster really raised his music. The next scene in the picture is a live cover of 'I can not forget' ... <br /> <br /> "And I can not forget, I can not forget I can not forget but I do not remember who?
