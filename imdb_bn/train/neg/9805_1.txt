I could never understand the popularity of the soap's Power Rangers Show, which is the second edition of the Japanese version of the most popular popularity in Japan for the last three decades! American version, characterization, special effects, etc. were completely lost about the version of Japan. <br /> <br /> Of course many children will say that power rangers are the best but they will be wrong. <Br> <br /> I'm sure that I want to speak Japanese, they will know how good the Santali is in the American version. <br /> <br /> Power rangers are completely awkward, instead try in Super St.! Looking for a better show, try Voltron instead of the third level!
