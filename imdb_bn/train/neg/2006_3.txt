It will help to know why it was taken so long for the 'House Next Door' book as a film adaptation for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason is that the 'house' design can be a problem, the life-time film is really so ugly No one can imagine that I can buy it. It's actually ugly that somebody came and it was made as soon as it was <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horrible genre books, but when I came, it was hard to do it almost ten years ago. The main characters are not to look for any kind of privacy in human life, and it One of the strengths of the book, they will not conclude that architect, without any evidence and analysis of such well-known events in the book of architecture, was a giant (Or Satan's personality). However, it is mostly a downbeat book, and I do not think that their life time runs to appeal. Perhaps someone will come along with another version of the year's book. A good house .. Music music .. The screen and the dark light ... of course will help.
