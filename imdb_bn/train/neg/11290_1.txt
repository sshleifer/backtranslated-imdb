The worst movie of all time. Even Ifte Koto could not save Turkey. I have heard that this movie was originally thought to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Shark Treasure" to take advantage of the "Jabs" promotion. I think there was a shark in this movie; They were included in this "thriller" that they were supposed to sell tickets. Did not work. Anything "good" happened in the movie anytime, the crew of the crew made a specific brand of beer with each other that was set in the movie time. G, what seems to be a sponsor of beer? Can they make it even more obvious? If they have given this thing only once in the breaking of the beer. That's reason enough for celebration.
