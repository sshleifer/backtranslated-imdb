This is one of the most dumbest films I've ever seen. It almost never closes the thriller and drives them all to hug. <br /> <br /> There is no good line or character in the whole world. If there was a plot, it is a thought and so far as there is nothing good to say about acting, so I do not say anything. I honestly do not understand how such nonsense is actually produced and is actually released, some believe that somewhere, 'O my God, it is really shameful' and it's a day to say. The way its bad guy is downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a different movie, at least if you download it, your time or money has not been lost. Do not waste your time, it's painful.
