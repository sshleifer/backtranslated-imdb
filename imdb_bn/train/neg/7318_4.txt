This is a sad, shallow, naive, and Brooks psychologist film editor and Harold, the most vague look of an impossible impossible relationship between his bodied girlfriend. Both zeros have chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything other than looking nice at this stage of his career; But Brooks' character is also interesting and not as favorite. There were 15 static, exciting moments in the status where Brooks, who had been separated from Harald, became frustrated with his apartment in depressing conditions, became unhappy - unbearable. <br /> <br /> Joyfully and unimaginably Joe Junker's book "You are so beautiful", there is not enough material here for a feature film. There is nothing in the periphery of their relationship that these people exist in the real world. I'm sure that Brooks's intent to highlight a white bright light on the matter and, in a way, cancel it; But what you're going to do is write and play here much better than what it is.
