Discovered channels / animal planets will be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy is modeled after the series "Walking with Dinosuars" series. Although it is 100% fantastic, it is presented in the same real and archaeological way. Even mixing imaginary dragons with the extinction of T-Rex and Dinoos. As it appears in an educational channel instead of the science-channel, it provides an air of authenticity in this show. <br /> <br /> Its event goes as entertainment for about 7.5 / 10. But the manner in which it is presented will give me 1/10. Do not make mistakes, I do not have any problem with my imagination, but the way they cover it is wrong. I can see really young kids and gradually adults believe they have found a dragon and it is real. <br /> <br /> I think this "walking with dinosaurs" weakens the great cause because now you have to see how the fantasy of the mini series is with a mind.
