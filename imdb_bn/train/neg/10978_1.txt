Generally when a movie gets a vote, it is easily disliked and irritated by anyone but it does not have a low rating, and so it can pull it as soon as possible rather than lower ratings. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonnter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film. It does not possess any and it does not have a chance because it does not really try to do anything. There is a bad D & D novel kind of plot that does not hold together and there is a complete lack of overall performance. It is clear that anyone involved in this project did not make any serious attempts because of it, because even the spontaneous independence of the spontaneous people will be even more hard work. A really terrible film.
