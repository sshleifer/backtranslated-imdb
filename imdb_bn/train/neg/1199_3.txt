This horror film is really weak ... if it is the right film then I am commenting. As a family taking a cute little German Shepard dolls really goes really frightening. I had a German Shepherd and it's really a good dog. Although I do not want to get one of these movies, rather than the comedy "K-9" That's another story together though The most horrific scene Finally, the film is not really terrible and it's really greasy. Also, we see a guy holding his hand around a lawn shower. That's about it If the father suspects some, as if his family seems rather weird, he finds somewhere that if you put a mirror on them while you sleep, you can see if they can see. Even with television standards, all really weaker movies ... which work on television movies are good as "this house pacesed" and there is also a female and another ghostly house film about this strange creature, which is better than that. This one is really rather dull.
