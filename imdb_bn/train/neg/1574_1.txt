There is no story! Plot is hopeless! A stuck accelerator, no brakes, and a detached automatic transmission gear may not be good impression based on a car with a lever! I could stop the car in a minute or so I was there at the police station. I'm sorry for the actors who gave such a poor script. Some scenes with the action were very dramatic and so far as you can get from reality. In addition, there were many mistakes, for example the runway car's hood which is 100 m First it rolls over the windshield, as it really does, but then it closes later. The car was later on in the movie with Hood ... <br /> <br /> This picture was not boring, stay away from here!
