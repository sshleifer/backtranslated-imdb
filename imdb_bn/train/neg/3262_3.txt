Shortly after the Reserve, I was fortunate to meet George Pala (and still signed by my DSRTMOb Poster) and asked him why he chose to "camp" this movie. Before studying, studio "knew best" and how "someone would not take such a film seriously," the two studio Flex stuck and gave me lecture. I was reading Bantam's prints for a few years thanks to a friend (1970's comic participants would remember Blackhawk and his band? I was with him in a few years), and we had high expectations from what we got <br /> <br /> < br> Flexes stressed that no high courage would ever be important, and so the only way to 'camp' was the way. Many other fans jumped on me, the flame was changing as much as possible. At the end of a little incident, Paul came to us and apologized, he wanted to do better and better. <br /> <br /> Star Wars False Lied False, and one year after the death of Pala, Spielberg and Lucas prove that Doc Siegge may be the next major movie franchise. If it is not for Flex. <br /> <br /> Drag the memory or history of the dock, and the movie will be there <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and By informing Indiana Jones, the inevitable comparison can survive, but it should be done with utmost sincerity and sincerity for the recovery of the glory that we should expect from the first American superhero. Syndentes: Yes, there was a second script for the Evil Archbishop, and it is much more serious. Yes, there were footage shots together, but most shots and very little establishment with the actor. And, yes, there's a one-sheet sheet of _is_Ron Eli jumping over a brick wall and blasting at some of his shoulders with a specially constructed bronze pistol. Eli wearing a dust on a button below the white shirt with a bronze tie, and the word "save DOC: Evil's archive ... coming next summer!" PostScript: If anyone knew that studio flexes were with Georgie Pala for the Convention in San Diego in 1975, then throwing them into pieces near the polytheists and telling them that they are polytheists. At the time, they carry the Drukkobbus and Fu Manchu strip and baggy canvas pants and the Paramount portfolio.
