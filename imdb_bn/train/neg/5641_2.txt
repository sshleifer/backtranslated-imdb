Thousands of stories with predictable, natural drama have been told, in some stereotypical sexual scenes, Paranayi of some characters, 70's style adjoining Violin horror music, which is sometimes ridiculous, I could not help myself shine. <Br> <br /> I usually like Defo, and it should be said that the acting is not bad at all, "plot" develops at a reasonable speed and guides you from time to time. It's fair that it's all predictable, I felt I was seeing a new movie instead of being made for TV drama. Maybe the style that the directors wanted should be said, but before watching this film, the review that I read here is written by anyone only involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if I could wind back the clock I did not go to see the movie. I will wait for the point of application at your video shop, I'm sure it does not take long.
