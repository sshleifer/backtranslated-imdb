What a terrible movie I love the monster flicks but I can not see horrible acting, half of the cardboard characters and abysmal special effects. There is no reading about this movie. Characters come from an endless supply of suicidal silk sheets, or else they are empty, unknown shock dolls. The plot formula, cut and paste, is the standard science-run-amok drivel. Even CGI is awesome Depending on it you can not provide some good eye candy on the movie when it's good. No wonder here, just the same old same. This is one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Cromman has to pull from a light post so that the children can use him as a pin.
