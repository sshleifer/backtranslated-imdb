The only release quality of this movie is that it is bad enough to be a comedic. Each of these movies looks like a pornographic drop out. I actually saw low budget porn acting well. Although I actually paid homosexual porn after this classic scene: Jim: Look at your donkey, Nick: You're watching (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first verb sequence shows how production is terrible, but it's really fun kind: good guys have transformer weapons! At one point, all of them have fake HP MP5 sub-machine guns. Next scene, one-47 transcript! And then, to stop it all, they are not swapping in the scene with some weapons M-16s !! I think there was a lack of budget for their guns, good boys and bad boys could not go in. The scene is strongly coordinated and fake as all hell. To blast for yourself, you have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade. You can not turn on any type of shoulder missile while traveling around the helicopter. You throw away the weapons that suddenly do not appear again. When a gun is out of bullet, throw it away still quite stupid. There is no idea how long you reload them. Big slow truck driving around the first gear is made for awkward action scenes. I really can not believe this kind of movie is actually produced. This movie will be lovely to be nitrous oxide or maybe drunk.
