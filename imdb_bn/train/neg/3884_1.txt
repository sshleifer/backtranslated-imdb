Many years ago when I was seven years old, I could think of it as impossible to see a trailer for this movie. It appeals to the stupid feelings about my curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. They are the smartest adults, they tell me, "Of course not! It's a bunch of trash." Of course, I was disappointed that I would not be the first child of my block, "Incredible Mailing Man" <br /> <br /> A little time passed - maybe a few days. I have forgotten about "incredible matting man" and my disappointment has faded. Twenty-five years have elapsed until the first part of my thoughts reappears. Surfing through the channels on the digital cable, I found a movie lost this long lost. My curiosity became a peak and I finally decided to take part in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. "Incredible Mating Man" is probably the worst movie of people. It looks like "DefCon 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddy Got Fingador" films as Oscar nominees. I have violated the lack of atrocity for almost two hours of my life. The story was inappropriate and the effects were even odd for 1977. How did this film convince a movie company to overcome me? <br /> <br /> Do not do the same mistakes I made. If you do not want to watch this movie, then listen to your parents. They were right.
