Although most of the movies are very amateur, Kosher's assassination scene is played, but not untrue. The laws of kosha say that when a blade touches its skin, one animal must be aware of it. The Kosher killing scene is right as anyone knows who saw it, or the pet movie shows kosher killing, which is cut into the neck and it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering from harmful cuts. We must remember that history has written the winners. Did anyone even allow thinking that the Nazis were probably right? <br /> <br /> Did the Nazis banned this deadly religious assassination or the Jews are still practicing it?
