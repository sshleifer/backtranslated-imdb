A mythology is always a risky business and I think this effort should be appreciated. There are a lot of talent involved here. A great many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I really could not enjoy this movie based on these three topics. <br /> <br /> First, these parts change incredibly between tones and quality. And unfortunately, some of them clash with others. <br /> <br /> Different, different sections feel support to me. Like a good story seed that never gets pale. I'm not talking about good ending here (but even the last time), but rather they lack basic development or even strong setup that attracts you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its residents were properly illustrated. <br /> <br /> What remains with you is a high quality small film which may still be of interest to some, but will leave the audience unhappy.
