No smile Yes, I saw the ruins of this whole train, but later I did not think if Clice had come later in his senses. (No, she was not.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The humorous level of this event is targeted at children, but the issue still does not come. So who's for this? Those who repeat the repetition and the drag-out, enjoy prattles, drug joke (catching as a short trip back to '77) and other "less" comedians. Three stogues are still funny, and as a child I had mine. They encourage some efforts to work with Jokes. This is however sloughed off the schl off. I am afraid that it is the end of civilization, if this thing is really taken as appropriate. Later you will tell me that Tabloid TV is popular. :(
