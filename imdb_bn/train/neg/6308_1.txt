As a complete sign for the content of this film, I was aware that the US Navy was segregated during WWII. Bringing this truth to the world is a very brave attempt. However, the movie is unfortunate, the aspect is non-existent, the acting difficulty, and the script is a one-click cliche. I can honestly say that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was sitting and started from the beginning and started in a poor way. It could be a great movie, many of us outside the United States were new, unique and interesting. The sad fact about this matter has been put together. It is unfortunate that such a true story, which can change the attitude of the people, has fallen on poorly managed movies in the low budget. I hope some time in the future, one of the main studios will accept this theme and judge it.
