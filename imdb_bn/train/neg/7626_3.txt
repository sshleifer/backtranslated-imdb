After the RAB's hearing of this film over the years, I finally decided to rent it. I am glad to be free from the libraries in the local language. These steps were slow, annoying, unrealistic and made in no sense of plot. Two hours later, I was ready to take the west side of Texas west of the west and threw those characters out of their misery. I understand the taste, understand but believe me, I do not understand all the hype that I heard about this movie. Dallas provided a better description of the life of Texas as this movie. Hire it if you want to understand how movie studios can make enough money for critics to please the bad movie.
