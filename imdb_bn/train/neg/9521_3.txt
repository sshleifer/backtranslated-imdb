This movie has received many games in recent times in the days of HBO or cinemax. Because they think they're interested in comparing the same name as Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hendes. The only reason to look at it is for the interesting Matt Lattanzi. Ish! Although I want to say that Math was a little more than a tooth to play in a high school. If she was a woman, then she would have had to play a high school mother! (Only me, or does his girl Shelley start to look like a dual?) Yes, who carries the plots? Typical teen highjinx played by adults
