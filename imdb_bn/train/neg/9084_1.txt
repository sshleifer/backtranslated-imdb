This was the most movie I ever saw! Molly (molly hal) can not do all this! There was no emotion in all the emotions Blah Blah was like she was reading a boring text book. The smart kids and the kids who like to eat (where names were impossible to remember) became so annoying to make me crazy. Whenever it was said, it was about some scientific thing or food. Mollys dad does not show enough passion about missing his daughter. The police officer and Molly Father said the same four times. It was just awesome. Everything is repeated in many ways. Beatrice so happens to be something bad for him to happen. I just lost a moment in my life seeing this movie!
