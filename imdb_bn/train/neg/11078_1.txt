Honestly, where I can start! It was a low budget, horrified movie, it was very impressive that how it completely irritated us all by smiling! The sword-fighting scenes were not even a war of swords, they wandered around some plastic swords bought in Wal-Mart, and they started trying just what they were doing and they looked like a struggle! My family and I had a really good action movie mood for a day, so we decided to go to the store and went looking for it, and there it was Sauutoth Island movie. I mean that it looked very nice but when we saw it in the house I was virtually dead after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh and the story of the film, story board, script etc. I do not know why a director and producer have ruined their time! But if you stumble over this movie then you will not get it !!!!!
