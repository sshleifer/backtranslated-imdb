This film is absolutely no imagination available on its premises and it is not available to take effect, but after seeing this so-called comedy it is not only the two things that can not be remembered. The story is about analytical insurance risk manager Ruben F. (Ben Stella) about Net-Piki, who cheated his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing), a day after scam instructor (Han Azeria) in Hummanun. After returning home, Ruben and his best friend Sandy (Philipp Simmur Hoffman) went to a party and went to school in Polly Prince (Jennifer Anton) many years ago. <br /> <br /> ***** ALERT ***** Polly lives in a forgotten and vulnerable and helpless life, which is the opposite of a person in Ruben, but they start from date and begin to change as a person on Ruben As if he started to try something new like Salsa Dancing. And eat spicy foods. But once Lisa comes back and wants to marry Ruben, she really does not want to, but she does not want to marry Polly because she wants to leave. <br /> <br /> This picture was written by John Humberg's second directive, which wrote two generally unclear screenplaces in "Junkandar" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films seem to be more classic than the old piece of drill. It is very easy to say something funny but I am thinking about this picture, why it is easier to understand. This image is completely and completely completely expected, ending with each scene as it is only due to the ridicule of the script. Hamburger also writes written without any thought of trying something different to think of written composition and sometimes seems to be trying to generate the same power as "There are some about Mary" but instead think of the event incredibly compelled. Does anyone really think it was fun to turn blind? If you are, your easy! There will be extraordinary mental lectures among the character of the film which will have to be summarized all but clearly that all of what they have achieved exaggerate. Stylar does a lot of work, but maybe he should work less and wait for good scripts to come in his way, because this film does not work as a comedy or romance.
