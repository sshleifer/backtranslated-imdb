I was writing about how great people were in this movie. It was awesome! Acting was the best sub-par. Teenagers earn a lot of money because of Leonardo's movie theater seven times in the movie. Where do they get the money? However, I wanted to know more about the Titan; Why was it sinking, what was going on with the mind of the people? Even a little conspiracy element. Does anyone understand that some people were not in the ark, because there was a fire before the ship was set on fire? No, because what you are seeing is not because a rich girl falls for a poor boy and she has her nude color. (The cone junky that at least tipped you that the movie was stupid?) <br /> <br /> Although I have cried a while during the scene. The scene shows the water filled with the ship. It looked like a pool! I am thinking of making all this money in the movie and even they can not see the water from the sea as real? Unbelievably ... <br /> <br /> Oh, when the ship was drowning .. just ridiculous. It was the worst movie in Pearl Harbor's "Not to do with Reality" section.
