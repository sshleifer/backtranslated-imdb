Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his drunken drunk, Kate (Eve Logoria) looking for the last minute arrangement of their reception. It's a frenzy in their morning wedding and caterers, caterrers provide a miserability about their needs for food presentation. However, fearful fear, "angel" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, comes without wings. In a subsequent battle with the sculpture, heavy "ice" girl falls on the Kate and sends him in the Hereafter. Now, one year later, Henry's sister told a gentleman that Kate wanted to start dating and move forward with other women. Nevertheless, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) became interested in Henry, her food supply partner (Jason Biggles). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to threaten Ashley, because Henry has no intention of holding another woman's hand. Can anything be returned to Kate in heaven for good? This is an unrealistic romantic comedy, the one of the worst fans ever seen in this dedicated fan. No, it is not thrown, because they try to use things. Lumberia is beautiful and funny and very excitatory, drunk and offbeat style and humor is similarly contagious. Biggs, a fun thesis, too, is completely wasted. For Rude, a very gifted actor (see, Entrust, Fake Up or Cleus, please) He works hard to everyone, and in fact this clanker is the main reason to watch. Let's go a long way to make her common, look, and simple cute movie bearable. However, a winner can not change the absurd script and the terrible direction, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a gray-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before giving it any meaningful spell. Even there was a free ticket to get inside, be careful that this movie is a death experience for those who love and cheer the movie.
