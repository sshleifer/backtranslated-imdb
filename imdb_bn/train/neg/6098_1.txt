Scoti (Grant Kramer, who will be starring in Big B-movie "Outside Oll Killer Clowns"), agrees to learn how to 'Dial' the three middle-aged boys in this 'bad' comedy. '80 is not bad in Lingong, which means good. Bad as bad "Friday 13th part 2" that is directed towards men from Friday 13th part 2, and then when she wants to touch her, she goes back to her, and the token fat slab, because 80's sex comedy will be without any fat slab? Well there are two of these. This movie is mostly about 80's sex comedy barrels. And then came in this context and said, <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> I candy: Countless numbers to count, even you can see that the lady looking boobs, "Bella's party" think of the point, but not funny, And very boring. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Movie
