Generally I'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighty and early 90s movie that is now shown ... but this movie is so incredibly horrible that it can test a true patience. Girls dressing as girls have died - but so pathetically do not. Cori Haim's performance was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. The number of actors / actresses in this piece of trash is # 1 but it does not have any free quality - stay away!
