I have been allowed to write 1000 words about this image, but a word can be enough: annoying. Habib and I do not smile so much in this real horror movie. We looked at each other with our best "what ...?" Expression. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. The killer tomato was funny, but this is just sick. What kind of image does this kind of mind produce and then keep it in the movie for others to see? What kind of mind does this innocent, weird movie contains, and then it's packaged for children? Parents, if your child still believes in Santa, then do not let him see this movie. Preteens can see it - perhaps "what ...?" Expression on their face. If you decide to grab this movie on others, you might want to spike them out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst movie is made.
