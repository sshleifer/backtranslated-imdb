Sincerely, I've never seen the worst movie at the Top 5. Partly, because it takes itself very much in opposition to the light-hearted trash, these films want you to be emotionally involved, feel for letters and take care of the plot of plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> ***************************************************** ************************************************* 1. Intrinsic and complete Non-sensic plots. 2.) Material "MTV" camerawork over annoying style. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie about church conspiracies, stigmata, or occupation. So guess what? They meet them! An atheist gets possessed by a dead person, then a church conspiracies exposes so that its stigmata displays. How a regular person was able to overcome through death, and through his royal power, can not hold other people, explain it and even do not speak. Now, just saying, he gave him the stigmata. Why? Why not just spit it? Instead, we treat strict voices, caricature messages and screaming about writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent person, because the adult woman was also spreading in one spot after another, when the tired, harsh, "wrist" was saying that we all heard countless times. It started to fall into my second charge, because whenever the youngster gets the stigma, he also flows in the air, denies the laws of gravity and throws everything around him and earthquake? Why would this happen? Who knows?! I think the director looked "cool". <br /> <br /> 2. These movies have dozens of slow shots, of course, birds are coming out of here and flying and the most annoying, water-pumping. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! Continuous! Logically, the place will probably fall apart with these many holes. The end of this complaint, in the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera falls on the reverse side, taking the water to the slow speed !! Why!?! I have no idea! It does not have any relevance and again, I'm betting it because the director thinks it's "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters said that he became a priest for explaining the science hole. This does not make sense to me. I think going to church will be enough, but no, he has to go to the whole rigger of becoming a priest. I just do not buy it. Secondly, there are lots of plots, some of which I would extend below. For beginners, when he gets the first stigmata, the scene ends with the senseless bloodshed on his bed. Later, he is in the hospital. Ambulance has called? On the other end, when the character of the "scientific pastor" mentioned earlier is holding the girl talking to the soul. He said, "Take me as your messenger." The sound is not a word for quote, but you get the idea. His reaction? "You have no faith, only doubt!" So, he was an atheist! There is no faith in an atheist, even then a scientific priest! And then, the purpose of this film's conspiracy, this Lost Gospel (St. Thomas, I believe) is found in local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill this document to suppress it, but you can buy it at a bookstore. Perhaps it seems to be held in an alternate history, where it is not widely known, but the film does not try to tell it to us, or even suggest that it is an alternative form of the disclosure of this document. <br /> <Off / Off, this movie is a spectacular degree terrible. It is my pure-kindness, which I think needs to shame every opportunity I get. I hate it Final grade: F.
