As a resident of Kalamaju, I was looking forward to this love in town. But, what a disappointment! Although the performance and production costs are not bad, the script is horrible, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is annoying. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that husbands without husbands have nothing to do with children. I can not believe how responsive it is to women's views. Has the author been living under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed watching my favorite city on the big screen, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassing incident after the city's name.
