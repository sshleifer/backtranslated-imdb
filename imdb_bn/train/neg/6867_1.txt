We can start playing wood, but this image is a disaster. After growing up in New York, I can tell you that this movie is insulting for a community that is known to the community or people. I'm not the protector of culture anyway, and it is found in my own imaginary, ridiculous cultural representation and a hilawyweight piece of the language that anyone who sees Sinnfield, is wrong. This is a wide waste and even worse, the results are not obvious and clutter scenarios are ridiculously bad. Who does this work? Someone <br /> <br /> <br /> The author's name is Israeli or something of that nature, but it is clear that there is no source for the subject he has written about. Looking at his bio, he lived in New York and was amazed how much he had connected with the community. Even medieval films "Between us a newborn" is better and closer to the truth than this drake. Reading this guy's credit is not a surprise that he wrote scripts in all C grade movies that present the stars in any way. Shocking She probably knows someone because this script is a bad dolph for Lundgren film.
