My favorite Lord, no movie! Let's first talk about "special effects". Do not blame me here, I am not one of those influential people, but I was really thinking that the great great past, especially the 60's practice. So for some time I thought they had recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them to cut and release forever. But as far as I know that there was no cell phone in their 60s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for is a good story with a really good message. Acting Secondary, Secondary Secondary, I do not even remember a little inconsistency. However, this bad performance, incredibility, etc. has been added to make the bad movie worse - this has happened to me with Celestine predictions. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was really good and although I am not among those spiritual stuff I can see a way that it can be brought across a credible way - the movie failed to do so. <br /> <br /> can be the single reason though this one. If you really love Chess movie it will be right for you. If IMDB is to ask for a glass instead of the quality of the star, then I will have to rate this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> (Look at that one comment - ridiculous). Celestine's prediction is at least a certain degree of recreational.
