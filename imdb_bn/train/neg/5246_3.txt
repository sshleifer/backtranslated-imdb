Wow, the most obvious thing about this episode was the value of the house 40 years ago. I'm not a fan of the episode I'm saying. Stories / actors / etc Their salt is valuable, they should be able to publish a lot of stories about reading it, I have to remind people who can not think of cuff and rely on telepathters. The psychobabilization was tedious and annoying, but enjoyed some, it is not my cup tea. They could keep the story but at least it could be credible and attractive if it could be a psychiatrist or journalist or something in a newspaper. Lowering small things like pujotas, which have a single half-round driveway, it seems that the car that he was standing under the park parked his park, because it could not be seen on the street or in the property. Flash Editing, while reaching the driveway (the 100th time that seems to be), the only two people who look at the 24m30s reach the driveway of a lonely house because they walk on the car? Dolly Close Ups were completely eliminated, as some junior high drama students discovered zoom function for the first time in their cameras. I could keep putting away, but this episode might get almost annoying as well. It was dragged and the real purpose was to fully use all the stock footage shot by Yel to drive the New York convertible drive. I was completely expecting to see the game of Criclera and a beautiful jingle when a voice told us about 8 track players, auto top etc. My only good thing that I want to tell about it is that it suddenly disappears. No loose ends tied up, nothing to explain or cancel. Many do not notice, I suspect that most of the channels have already been changed and eventually closed.
