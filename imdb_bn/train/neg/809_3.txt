I was expecting something from "K-911", I wanted to say that it was like a beautiful movie that I could get. I always love dog comedy movies. But it seems that James Lie's can not be a movie. The plot was quite long and chemistry did not really start with the love of two. The author is not going through this directive, despite this, James sees total sexist scenes in the movie. James just really ticked me off for half the film Dogs were real stars and they were surprised by the congratulations. It is so sad that <br /> <br /> <br /> I am glad that the IMDB is not just me, it is a beautiful stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize that this was his brother Jim, who was talented, there was no crime, but not everyone could be his star brother. Ashleye Simpson Do you want to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
