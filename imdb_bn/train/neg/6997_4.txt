I saw this with an increasing sense of obstacles. Why did God try to escape from Devil's Island in the form of Ian Hunter? And what is he doing in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in a mysterious way, but helps the thief, murderer and prostitution to find forgiveness, forgiveness and heart changes in such a place based on god .... It is rarely a popular movie in any case. Whatever Galeb was fascinatingly missing in this portrait, Crowford was never as respectful to me as I was, and the whole scene of the film seems to be made 10 years ago. "Stagecatch" and "Mr. Deeds Goss to Town" have been compared to contemporary movies, it seems prehistoric.
