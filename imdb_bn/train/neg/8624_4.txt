The acting was not great, the story was full of simple turn and transparent characters. It is on the one hand the reaction of the right-wing Flemish block voters and the clashes between Moroccan people living in Belgian city Antwerp. Is this political analysis? Is this a Belgian West Side Story or Modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (it seems like there were directors' questions). However, some of the scenes may work like a Ken Loach film set in Antwerp. In the end, this city has become the beginning of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block Party and struggles with many problems and tensions between populations and cultures. Making a movie about this situation is very difficult, and unfortunately it does not succeed. Still, it is telling a story about a very real and complex situation in present-day Belgium in present-day. Observers try a few foreign visitors to try and enjoy and understand that this is not really an important film, but it is the social division line behind it that has hired 10 million people in Belgium in the 2000s. <br/> Dries von Dongen
