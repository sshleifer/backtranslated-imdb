I saw this first of these "8 Films to Die Forge" collection and it certainly did not want me to see the rest ... although I heard that some of them were suitable. I do not know, it was not terrible but it did not do much for me. Due to the loss of child labor, mother and father, your fundamental disadvantaged cannibal family died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they could bring home food sources whenever possible. The best part of it was Goth Sister, who would certainly invite a friend from the school that will never leave. However, there is certainly a slaughterhouse shop in our basement and so on. This family is sorted like the white-bread edition of the Swar Clan, they are nasty and they do bad things but they are not any spirits. I've seen a lot of reviews that I like, and I guess I did not know what I missed, but I think it's very medium and I will not recommend it to anyone. 10 out of 4
