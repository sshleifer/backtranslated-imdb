I am surprised to see that an earlier critic described this movie as "pure visual joy". From "High Art" to "Seven" was the most reliably depressed interior. Someone can forgive Shady and Mitchell for the first time to go to B & W. Of course, before they do this, one must see the Opium-Den groups, who live in people who are not visually profitable, but in some way can support better medicine practices. The familiar movie age girlfriends / boyfriend does not mention the start ice strokes, those who are well aware will be thrown in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also said that Shady's character has retired from professional photography for ten years. Did he retire at the age of twenty?
