Considering the limits of this movie (the entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only 5 or 6 actresses total) it should have been made better. If you have this limit to make a film then how can the light be so bad? And the actor was terrible, telling about the hair below from Clark's acting, except that it was an enjoyable movie, there was no substance in it. Well it tries to try, but really fails. <br /> <br /> It tries to self-render in two parts, but the lines are distributed so badly by the actors that it was bad. And the main character Nile folk, what a compassionate looser. Apparently 10 people made this movie and they knew each other, and perhaps it was a real rock band that they had, but sadly, these people do not really know how terrible they are around. It was created in 2005, but all of them think it's just a pre-grunge era smack. Thanks, I did not pay for this (the redeemed on the Strong on Demand!) but it was under the title "The Possessed" Studio 666, it's not important for what you do for the title, it is to help Can not It can be a very well-made movie - There is no excuse for making this bad film when you have limited parameters, when filmmakers make it, that works within the boundaries that things you control and stuff you can do well with Can work. Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video, Wow was bad, I fowarded that through fast. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 fair, if you are in the whole B-movie whip I think you should go and see this.
