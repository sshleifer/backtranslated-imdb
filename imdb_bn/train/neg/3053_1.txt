How nice. Who said Edward D. Wood Junior did not affect anyone? This steaming pile point is a perfect case of ass emission; It makes "violent years" like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" Keith Richards's Worst Flashbacks Look Like My First Night Out I have had a nightmare, you know, sleeping and bullets are sweating, which Santa Claus will not come near to clear Vicerial terrorism from my very clear clean soil. However, I can think of some parties where this film can actually work well. Also, if you are looking for a perfect example of VHS tape Santa-devil decitimation, do not look again. Do not check this movie, as I have notified the MST3K version now available. Move over the devil, here "Santa Claus".
