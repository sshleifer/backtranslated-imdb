I can not criticize this movie for the next few minutes, but I know that many people, like me, depend on IMDb.com to help determine films. For this reason I am writing alone. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like the Asian version of 1976's "Incredible Torture Show" (Urdu "Blood Shrimp Freaks"). Http://www.imdb.com/title/ttt0077247/ Torture, hijacking, assassination, cannibalism ... Sure, here's a third-grade script, a kind-hearted act, and a failure in black comedy here with the failure of failure. <br /> <br /> This movie is held in China, yet everyone speaks English. There are plenty of girls in this movie who are scared by the slaughterhouse of dogs in the market, but sexually excited about entering a porn parlor. A boy walks around and wanders around, walks with his friend boyfriend (how to find the only amazing thing in this whole picture). This picture is absolutely awful, even for a B movie. Even if you want to download it free, it will be a shame to your hard drive.
