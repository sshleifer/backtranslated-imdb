Read another review, I think this movie will actually be better. I enjoy the movie "B", but it can not be classified as such. Photography is probably the only half good thing in the movie. But a lot left to edit the preference. It was very sticky and staccato. Nobody has done an awesome job in choosing music and sound. The music was awful, especially some of the atmospheric or scene setting. The acting was good, they could have pulled off the movie. Unfortunately, I saw porn flicks acting well. If you want to watch a "B" Vampire movie, see 'Blood Relations'. You will be much more entertained.
