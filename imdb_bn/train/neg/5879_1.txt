I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really half of herself, half of herself, is she faking or being natural? It does not make any difference whether she is walking on the roof or even changing the pattern of the film. Brian Cox played really well. I almost thought that he always acted in such a tricky, dishonorable, dirty neighborhood where no one really cared for hygiene. For Gonyith Paltrow, the question is what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> This picture is quite sick and obnoxious. Who would give such a shit to see?
