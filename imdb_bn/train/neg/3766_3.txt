I went to see this movie to find out that it is not going to be great. But what I saw was horrible for the words. I did not mean to be harsh, his movie was terrible. Overall it was bad, I meant a special effect, the performance was not very bad, but it was not good, and it was a good choice to sask .... My opinion is the best sasquatch movie Harry and Henderson. It's not violent or horror, but it's the best illustration of Saskatcheck. At least it's not a case and some half-ass ass cgi stop. If you are frustrated then only anyone in the movie can see this movie. Or go horse monk, it's a lot better.
