True, the setting of Paris is great. The actor fined. The story is a turning morality game. Is it right to say that if you want someone badly, then it is okay to hit another right? In a real romance, you are disturbed with his wife and want to dump his family, and want lesser checks than the woman who encourages him to fix. So if they are the appropriate look and Karen Allen shows off her body then? Characters are still self-absorbed and condemnable. Perhaps the moral of the story "Get what you deserve". I give it a 4, just for possible scanning through the "male interest" bit possible.
