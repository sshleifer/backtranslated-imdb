Has anyone here understood what kind of movie they are making? Now a former marine officer should be assing a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right? Wrong It was the target of thirteen thirteen people with a number of bad taste moments. It may be very foolish at this moment, but I have found the voice of Dammon Weiss to be excited out of the belief. He speaks like that in real life? If he is sympathetic to me, I will not get any money when watching his films
