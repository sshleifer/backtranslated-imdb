With the help of such movies, you are going to get a general joke about ghosts. Eva as a Scratch is pretty funny And other actors do a good job. It is lacking that direction and story. Jokes can be ignored that it has worked well. The problem is that there are just many jokes. Sure I laugh a few times In addition to the conversation, the film did not have the ounce of creativity. I do not blame the director that it uses the full potential. Eva certainly has some junk skills to show more but do not get the chance to do so. Overall this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. The other that it could be completely excluded.
