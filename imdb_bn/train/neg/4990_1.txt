I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante, but this is just bad. And MST3K is not a bad way to enjoy watching it fun. It's just annoyingly bad, as you can not find anything to enjoy for it, you make a hard effort. I'm really sorry to waste 2 hours of precious life on this shit. You can tell by seeing it that no one was asked to do the work and everybody knew that this film will only bury their careers. Apparently "Walking Tall" has earned enough revenues that anyone has decided that they could stop their investment. This is not the worst movie I've seen, it is so bad that it has removed bad films from my memory.
