Although there were some fun moments, I thought the film was quite tall. And it ran, got it bad. Once the action was entered into the Valley of the Monument, I saw myself increasingly stupid and growing gorgeous than the inconsistent touch of characters. <br /> <br /> The girl's character was particularly incompatible. At first he is in agreement, then he invented the truth and he bile. Then he returned again, then again in their desert. Then she returned again. There is no clear motivation for his decision. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many missed possibilities. I used to say that the film is much less than the sum of its parts. Obviously, those who liked Rapo Man were interested in it. There is no match for investigators 22 investigators.
