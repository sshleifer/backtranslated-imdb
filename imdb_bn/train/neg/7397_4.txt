I've seen this movie several times in various short film festivals and it has always impressed me that I saw a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> is very well produced and directed for a school-film, but the story ... needs something else to be a great and interesting film. Team Walker needs some input methods in the character. Some of these Portuguese short films are missing - this script is always the place of worship. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
