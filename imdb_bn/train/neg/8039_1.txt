This piece of crap is a piece of annoying film like crap and whole house repeat. Not everyone should be thinking of seeing this piece of stupid work for everyone who wants to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie. An F-My Opinion I have a question, what do they think? Let's make a list of: 1) Bad script 2) Bad script 3) Bad script 4) Bad acting 5) Bad instruction and last but at least a bad script. I mean, I do not want to make rural villagers, but I saw when I was frustrated. This movie should be banned in a box, locked and drowned under the sea. So please do something like this again, please !!!!
