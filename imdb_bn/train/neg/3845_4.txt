Although Bate did great work like Davis Milledrade, I felt that I did not see this movie. At the end of the film I felt that something was missing in it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bate Davis has done a perfect job, and he hates me and always loves him. Leslie Howard was very good like a boyfriend Philip Kerry, and I loved her so much for her terrible demean. It is a sad fact that when someone loves them with bad seeds. And especially if it's someone like Phil Kerry, who is a sensitive person, but he's sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting comes through the platform and not the The last scene was particularly good, but I'm not the one to give it up. While others may think this film is good, I was one who found it. I should recommend those who like bad seeds in this movie so that they can see what they might be if they love that terrible person.
