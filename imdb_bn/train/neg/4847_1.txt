Naturally, I'm making crazy dashes to watch movies that are not yet seen in the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I really thought up my lane. I do not understand why I got this movie for my life. There is no story !! A group of people around Iraq! One day they are spreading bombs here. Tomorrow, they are trying to make a fire around the countryside, not themselves low and sniper fire. Do not wait here, they are back in Baghdad. There is no solid story in all. The three main characters are so sophisticated that they are mere caricatures. By this I want to say, we have sweet kids who are afraid to die. We have a strong military man who wants to be real and only safe. And then we have such terrible cowboys who are not following the rules, but there is a soft spot for a small Iraqi boy who is trying to sell soldiers' DVDs. Do you think what's going to happen ??? Well, do you think that cowboy soldiers do not follow the rules, make the child infected with the sweet child? Yes why Do you think the Iraqi child is a soft spot for a cowboy soldier who will kill him and make him crazy? Yes why There are no stories here. Scripted and expected! The camera is shaken much closer to show "arts". And all of you think of such a great war, rent "flower metal jacket", "dirhanter" or "platoon". Do not waste time or money in this annoying movie!
