I think Seagal's night will go quietly. All I've seen directly compares to a few weeks of video releases, compared to its relatively recent 90-year-old hits. <br /> <br /> A secret organic lab is creating new types of medicines that make up a jack. People are adrenaline systems where they become psychologist killers or something. In any case, the sigal is supposed to stop the infection or its end or partial closure. Silal went through the hit squads like Jellybeins, every time I saw that he was managing the new face, it became difficult to follow the development of character. I know Steven's athasama prevented him from screaming at the top of his lungs, but why is he constantly being dubbed by some words like him? Usually film plot and action sequences can save time from complete waste, but it did not even stop. As I have said, it is much better than a horror movie, and rather than knock-out of the vacuum. The problem was not really terrible and Sigal was coming out of the entire place because infected people were thought to be the speed of the light movement, but the 40-year-old 280-pound Siege killed them singly? I think the only highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes where new recruits asked Seagull to come with Strip Club. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
