Sorry, but Kim is doing a good job of moving away from Basing, at the moment I saw one of the worst thrillers. When the logic was removed from the crowd of 4 young people outside the mob, the security forces fired. Yet nobody seems to mind. Then, instead of screaming for help, or instead of running back to the mall, they fly in the middle of the male and boys do hot pursuit. I can not even describe the foolishness of running away from this woman, carrying a red toolbox, shouting for God's help, and then after killing others brutally, showing sexual relations with one of them. Believe me, this is bad and as well as a bit tasteless.
