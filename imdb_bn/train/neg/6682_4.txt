This comedy is not really funny. This is a romance that does not have any effect on stereotype playing so much. It's a copper film so derivative - yes, even back - it has no snap. <br /> <br /> Cast is enough. It is difficult to say more than that. However, the nice key player is unfamiliar. MGM A, Robert Montgomery acted. There might be a number of actresses but there is no time to work with a businessman's wife. <br /> <br /> We can express gratitude that this small known movie is currently unknown to actors today. And production quality is not horrific. It does not make any real impressions. <br /> <br /> This is a generic Nokf And who wants to?
