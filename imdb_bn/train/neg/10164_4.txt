I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and could not decide about it. We were not allowed to get enough close to any of the characters in order to care for them. It was probably that we were not all our own "bubbles", but these people did not force me to become worried about them or to wonder about their fate. For more than an hour, the letters were not very well developed. Many times the factory equipment shot (forklift, conveyor belt, cowboy) is shot; And surprisingly little of the lifestyle-looking doll dolls, with most of the characters made for a living, was somewhat interesting than realistic people. An interesting test, but somehow it did not quite come together.
