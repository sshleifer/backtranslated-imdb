Well: <br /> <br /> effective color scheme. Good dress Top groove set production. Good detail CGI buildings and vehicles <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> All the CGI actors mix the fifth element with the terrible mix of final fantasy actors. CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Defective reasoning A giant pyramid shows up and nobody researches it, does anyone really even question it? And there is no explanation for throwing God Horus out, or why he must do something as overwhelming as Jill? <br /> <br /> <br />> Awful scripts. Many unnecessary uses with many ideas that are not completely realized. Some points in the dialogue were almost ridiculous. Random characters and events that are not needed. Soft Characters Jill was supposed to be this mystery, but apparently he was just a mystery to the author. He has nothing. She is reluctant and annoying to watch. He has no material, no texture. There are no redeeming attributes of his character. Indeed, there is no character in the whole film whose purpose is, no goal (apart from obvious to Haras), no motivation. They are weak and ill fable. What is the screen writing - no matter. Horus does not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy. No one can understand whether Horos or Jil is the main character. That's the problem: Delegating half the characters of each character means that the author never invents one character, never achieves success. They walk around who cut out the cardboard and are talking and talking quite a lot but nothing but fine set pieces. First time director pacing. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching movies to write this. It's annoying because I can not pay attention. Everything is flat Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no clock value. Threadbayer Story, Sub-Para Character Development, Cornish CGI does not store excellent set production.
