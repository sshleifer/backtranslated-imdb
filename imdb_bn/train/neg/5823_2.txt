"Drawing Limit 9" is a kind of movie that loves or hates; Thankfully or not, I kept it with a strong feeling of wasting time and with the stuff thoroughly with the "poorly executed" campaign. Aesthetically, the film can be fun, especially in its first half, until it can be expressed that each step pictured works as a metaphor for various aspects of wheel hunting. Then, Japan may be a little ridiculous to see the daily affairs of the staff, but later it becomes clear that there is not a single campaign and no single frame exceptions on the screen. I use the word "propaganda" because the film originally uses an old morality instrument, where the "good" and "bad" action is not extinguished but it is set in stone. Perhaps this is my, but I think that such kind of art is shallow and prevalent, even when it is the greatest (no restriction here) search for the protection of the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is an original sin when any film material is expanded without any argument to expand only. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" can be easily adjusted in 75 minutes, but it is 2 and 1/4 hours wide length. Yes, there were striking shots, but these were not enough for a 15-minute interval without notice. The film has no standard view and there is no evolution of characters, but it is not a documentary, rather it is a conceptual installation. This is an unusual form for a movie, but it can still be seen as art even when the concept is simple and naive here. OT: I also believe that the director should have some honesty and do not pretend that it can be delivered in less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the music score is similar to most of the wheel words. How wonderful <br /> <br /> 2/10.
