Well let me and a friend rented a few days ago because we want to keep track of B-movies, because we do their own work. However, cover blood and strange fangs and stuff ... and looking for nude girls with Tom Savini! There is just no way this movie could fail! Right? Wrong !! It just feels like a waste! There was not really any story, the dialog was terrible (who's there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, actually they lacked any personality ... the effects were terrible .. And what's happening with the terrible people are long Long long shots, nothing is going on .. eyes and stuff are in extreme bonding? We were waiting for the whole movie to do something ... something is going to happen ... but not ... "Oh, here comes out! Oh, they are kissing ... Again ... Violence ... ok ... nothing It does not happen ... again ... oh, now they roam ... and the eyes have closed ... again ... oh, Tom Savini! ... OK, okay, maybe something cool or even interesting Will .. no .. oh! Cool! A shattered head! Last ... oh shit .. "And finally, since I'm so filling I say myself! Give me a van, six actors, a weird house, Tom Savini, bloody and bucket, and I can create a great movie that I ever see ... I have made a movie with a zero budget good effect in two days, good Acting and scripting better than this ... What is this Johannas doing ?? Easy to make cool movies! It can be so big ... I'm really annoyed!
