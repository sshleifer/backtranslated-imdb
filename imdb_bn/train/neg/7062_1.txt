Well, maybe not, I've seen the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> This is not absolutely sensible, no plot, no characterization, no acting, nothing was there. <br /> <br /> I saw the first thing I saw here 28th, 2003 ** Beware, this is a spoiler alert There are many things I know about complaining about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> Well, the film has started and the letters have been introduced, but there are no characters explaining. As far as I knew the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. It seems that he lived with himself ... then he was a feather boy ... Then there was a very distressing madina in his mother, who lived with him. All his friends had apparently no parents and were themselves alive. <br /> <br /> Now we have come to a major plot point, this crazy man has gone out of the crazy shelter and is running very fast. Now our main character is obsessed with this man and he draws attention to the film's aggression. I think I've missed a major plot element here, there was no reason to get the original character hooked. Even if that is not the point, why are all his friends suspicious why 5 minutes ago, why suddenly he follows him and what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues and it gets all right. They are pushing into school, Allah Allah But wait a minute ... All of a sudden everyone knows that the main character is running 'show' here. Waiting for a second, do not say that madman especially the main character? <br /> <br /> Another important plot element has been dropped ... the madman can not be insane ... everyone said he was not mad. But when the story is gone, he clearly out of his mind. But I thought people were saying that he was not ... Hmm ... <br /> <br /> Now the movie is closed. That was off? What was that hell? No question was answered about the original question of the last character, it did not answer any question about the madman. Are these people in the same situation? If yes, then there are some basic story lines that do not affect it. If not, what is the time when you say "two weeks"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I still think quite a lot. It's 6 months down the line, and if I get it free, I can give it another chance, but I doubt it. I am very doubtful.
