Daniela has some problems brewing under her striking outgoing. When he finds out about a distant relative (he is similar) that he was burned to be a Vernon, he starts to lose his mind. When he slashes out horny men's beads and their throats, he goes a bit feral. He eventually finds a man who helps in keeping his inner animal, but when others lose his joy, he stops his violent and ugly revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Weorolf Umma' is not very difficult, a good crowd film. Bad acting / dubbing / production and production can be just by harping simple glasses. But it comes slowly on itself but enough nudity to stay awake?
