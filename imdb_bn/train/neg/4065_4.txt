... via Eric Stenchen in the same psychological antics. Especially the gifted director has managed an extraordinary special movie, but I'm still sitting in closing credits, if there is nothing more than to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After catching him (although he volunteered) and threatened to have sexual relations with him (another incident he was willing to do), he revealed that he kidnapped three people who in the past had resisted him. Then he decided to kill him (Hu?) But he died instead and died instead. The girl's heart has torn (or something like that), and she gets angry at the unfortunate chops of the buzzement. <br /> <br /> Ok, the text is bad: it is long winded, loaded with ten cents <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> I said, <br /> <br /> To make a picture: Home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery footage is just a humiliating insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: Get it ... 'budget', which was the punchline. <br /> <br /> And still things were a charm. In the 70's, such films were associated with the real budget and talent in the theater, not even in this day and age. If you want to see such violent, sexually exploiting trash (do not lie, do something in us), then all of these will be yours today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some good items on the shots menu. <br /> <br /> This is not good and it will not be remembered, but Joe Di'Aatos' indigenous people made such a movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
