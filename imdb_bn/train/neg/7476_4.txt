Peter Jackson's early films from Evil Alliance carries great debt to Bad Baste and Branded. I must not agree to enjoy those movies and I say the same about it. Jake West is a director who clearly feels his own motivation and wants to steal those whom he saw. I mostly lost significant significant amount of significant cinematic Hollywood movie notable for James Cameron Alliance. The amount of blood and beef shown here is not funny, the end of the film is tired and pulled. Perhaps it will work well like a small film. The actor is poor, the direction is weak and the plot is not existent. I can see what the director is trying to do, trying to pay homage, but did much better than others presented here. 4/10
