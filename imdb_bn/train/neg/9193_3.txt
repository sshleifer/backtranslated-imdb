OK, so I'm not a big video game buff, but the game house of the dead is actually famous for making a movie? Surely, as far as they went to the video game clips across the film, just as there is a certain view of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look just the same. The screen, with your permission, holding any weapon and walking all kinds of aliens or dead or sniper or whatever, whatever happens whatever. <br /> <br /> It is an attractive place for the body, the children of college (as the children of the college being loaded, as some children could give up to $ 1,500 only for the trip after missing their boat) to try to go to this island. The year is trying to find the island. The first thing about death that seems to be about death is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror films are nothing more than creative ways to get creative in creative ways, in the same situation. At least in this case, they were on the road going on the way to wear girls' clothes. They look cute looking places around the jungle in a little halter-tops, but at least they worried they were dressed for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard, who distributes an utterly horrific performance, is far away from all other actors overshadows the movie, saying the most striking character in the film by far. While changing their expression in the well-known actor film, I can not bear it, it is rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally as a well-known actor, that he has shown this harsh fisherman with scary voices. She does not rasp even well. Before shooting, he seems to be eating a cinnamon roll, and eventually some powdered sugar or some breathing. The real hard, Clint! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the teenage actors have acted who are naked for their portions and then die. Nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider some for a minute. These kids give almost two grants to go to the island to go to the Rave of the Year, no one finds and says, well, who wants beer! Even the man who pulled hundreds of pieces of money from his wallet did not even think that he had got a whole time and not a single person. Here's your input to the input sign - there's alcohol! They are the party they come for nothing except themselves! <br /> <br /> They do not just start drinking, do not think that the whole party has abandoned the island, but when one of the girls goes into a dark wood, then where are everyone (each other's girl and unintentionally dragging together ), The guy and the girl who are behind them decided that it would be a great idea that they are now alone that strip for a quickie They hoped to find the island empty, and now with the rest of the others, they have left for some time, they will have some privacy because they have no one else. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I've reviewed this movie for all those who hate it now. Yes, in order to show shots from the video game in most movies, yes, the movie was loyal to direct / direct the video game. Of course, it was a stupid idea. I can not imagine that this little nugget has been able to recognize it, but worse than it was during the matrix-style bullet that was thrown over over over over. For the first time (at some point I got persuasive and chessy for a movie like this, such as a shot as it was originally), it is a target for the strategy of the shot instead of a dramatic meaning or creation. No excitement for the photo. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes a zombie movie scary and reaches the edge of your seat is that they are gradually coming to strangers after living, but alive. Very fast but getting tired, going out of running places, and with a terrible lack of which to stop zombies. The first two movies have worked well, the kids are scared and they do not move around after being on the island, but since they travel with a smuggler, they see themselves armed forces. And I mean that very firmly. I mean, these people take everything from the machine gun to the grenade, which will remove most of the tires of upcoming walks. <br /> <br /> Then tell the techno-slash scene to you. Since Rave never happened, and I think that Ubay Bowl thought that people would not be frustrated when listening to a techno music in the movie, in the middle there is a scene where all the people are fighting with the living dead and surprisingly enough it is a music video. Shots are quickly and quickly edited together as soon as the blast bursts, as long as it is nothing but poor shot blurts, most of the time around 5 frame long (about 1/6 second) screen spanning across the screen. Music Glossy, I guess, but this is not a horror film, because it completely removes any feeling of secretion or even the intensity of the overall effect because you do not see enough to respond to it. You're just flying these screens all over the screen and wondering what the director is thinking, when he decided that doing something like that in the movie would be a good idea. Many people compare this film with Resident Evil, most of them claim that its compound is copied and they are just right. I am thanked at least here, as the Resident Evil was not in the case, it is not a virus created by some people that has transformed people who have been able to infect others with others, their vampires change the way they make others vampirere. 28 days later there was definitely a motivation for this film, it is very bad that the dead room is not a single thing, it is based without some interesting idea to put quick shots of video games, if you forget. I really think it should have been a much better movie. Obviously, I can not say that I know a lot about the game based on it, only titles and movie posters are eligible for a better movie, but unfortunately I think it is often more often than with horror movies. When a movie comes, it's really sad that a horror-horrendous horror film is advertised and the most awesome thing in the whole movie is a close shot that offers the possibility of a single pic.
