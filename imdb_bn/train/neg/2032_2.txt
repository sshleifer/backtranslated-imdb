I have given these two stars for awesome DV shots transparency, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This image fails on all accounts. I can not recommend it, because it is not poetic, not silent either. Not dramatic, neither suspenseful. Not controversial, nor general. It can only suggest good faith in an incisive piece that any awesome or exploited favors. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this, whoever you are. . .please, stay away from these terrible products. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
