Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to create a documentary about Leonard Cohen, then create this about Leonard Cohen! In order to anger the audience, it is filled with enough Leonard why they think about listening to all these singers (some suspicious ones) about them? Puleeze .... sounds like them junior high reliving their diary entries - care about you, what about Leonard? Guess, people will make a documentary about you if you are "nothing" worthy of you. I especially feel parading of U2's members are insulting so that it adds credibility to this movie - no. Leonard does not need to broach or ask about his spirituality. Film makers could have broken their spirituality through filming. G, what an idea! I would offer Rufus WineRoot and Jervis Kakar for their cover of Cohen Tune - The other performances were a bore and some unbearable. <br /> <br /> Kohin fans will not say I warn you!
