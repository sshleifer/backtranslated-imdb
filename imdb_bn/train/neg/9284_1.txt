Man, even with Plan 9 out of space, is better than this movie. This Flickr does not have enough plots for half an hour, but they have been able to stretch it for an hour longer than an hour. Jett Lee and Corey Eunen are quite good, especially in the exaggerated battle scene, but the story like The Legend of Fong sai ek is much better than the tragedy that will be left to the left.
