Until you're twelve, this movie is not really worth it. It is certainly not a good idea that with B-actors, a low-budget movie and a form of fantasy sometimes requires intense CGI work. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoyed the bad movie mockery. I do not know how bad though. It is portable, until after 2 hours, then it really starts to burn. War style go into normal battles to abide by the laws of physics, and wars fight. There is no real explanation for the transfer. It's a plot, but again, it's probably a kids movie. It seems that the obvious moral lessons of the day which are called Sesame Street or something, as it is being published. It is bearable. But if you say, better, no.
