One word: annoying Later, I was advised to read some articles about the philosophical meaning of this film, but it seems better to report the film's reactions slowly, slowly and slowly, under the symbolic symbol of the film and slowly and lava-flowing persecution. . After all, goes to watch a movie with a syllabus in hand? And this flick was dull. Beginning of the film, Lead actor Claude Ledu, the film's eternal, awful voice-over, faces a truly vague pain and the same annoying mask. Filing over others might work better than respecting the audience, because they basically say the same thing: The priest of the amber court is a wicked man The story is about a tortuous pastor who tries to help the tragic rich family, his characters do not do anything remotely attractive or sympathetic, because the family is an unpleasant peer group, and the priest himself is a dirty insect. For the last 30 minutes, some breathing messages about grace and a person's equanimity suggest the pain of one man, but due to the temptations of Laddu and unclear theorem in Robert Brasson's script, I think, finally, this is the end, let's have some ice cream. The fans of Brasson show interest in fans of Paul Shader, just to see how many elements of character and their own scripts and movies, especially "TaxiDriver", "Rising Bull" and "Light Sleeper" have been set up.
