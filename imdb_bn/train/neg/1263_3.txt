There is not much like watching monster robots fighting on a desert landfall, and the robot war is distributed. Of course, acting is weird, dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it's a giant robot! Special effects are quite good for themselves. They are certainly not as polished today, but they have computer graphics on computer and instead use minicars, so it's perfectly good. The film's short runtime, its losses are easily ignored, and in some enjoyable parts it has a certain tongue-in-cheek fun. I would suggest this in a fan looking for obsolete hours of any fanharted hours of monster robot or sci-fi sci-fi.
