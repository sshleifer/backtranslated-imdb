This film can be an interesting character and can give some insight into it, but the real problem of this movie is that it does not have any of it. It does not give any insight, or solves the problem. This is just an example of 'old' male sexual addictions and the problems of daily life and family problems. Why do you want to see this? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> You will have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathy for him. She is just like a dirty old playboy, who is a constant seeker for women and sex. She has sex with different types of sexual intercourse three times a day and not only with prostitution. <br /> <br /> It does not have bad visual style, though it all thinks it is strong. But in spite of this, it is much better than direct video productions. Who knows, if the filmmaker is given a better element to work with, then the film was better suited to the belief. <br /> <br /> The story really laughs. There are some pointless plot lines that are often more ridiculous than actually being supposed to be. I'm talking about the whole Ordell plot line for example. The story got worse when filming went ahead. The story also says that the whole incident happened, which is happening and with its psychologist, the main character sessions seem a little cheap and easy. <br /> <br /> But as bad as the movies are concerned, this is not just one of them. It's not as good or bad as any other random start-to-video flick, with the same concept. <br /> <br /> It's still weird and quite surprising that they could throw Nastasz Kinski and Ed Beggie Junior. An easy small tiny production such as this one. They assume really frustrated for the job and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
