As far as I love Rodney Dangerfield, it was a terrible movie. This plot was like a holistic rip in several movies, but unfortunately they forgot to rob a good joke. In addition it is annoying and annoying and that kind of being. If you are looking for a good smile, hire a copy of the personal appliances.
