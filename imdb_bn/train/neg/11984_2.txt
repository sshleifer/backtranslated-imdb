Esse! Another one who is "stupid by the fool" by the DVD. I expected at least some kind of action with beer, cat, and cover such as. I'm nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Otherwise it sucked. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, talking to himself (though I think he can not just play a movie and can not do any dialogue with the cell phone), his tall stairs are standing near the tree, a rack threat , Munching over the worm, and kicking a porcupine (a dumbass). And he does not easily pull that that quills ... they stick like fishhooks. At least he fought beer (weakly) several times. <br /> <br /> What was the flashback? It's been a bad movie even worse. I wanted to watch a live movie, some dramatic BS about a child suffering from divorce <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have a baby or something to eat. At least that has been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time during this time.
