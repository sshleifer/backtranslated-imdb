Contrary to its title, this film does not offer any torches and thus an indigenous dish is organized for the audience. All humorous, memorable, dramatic, mechanical, stage-based, Pakistani dramas available on the video, with memorable, or even modes. Everyone is screaming, screaming and doing strange things for some reason. It looks strong as a direct lift from Hollywood's Boing Boing. John Abraham is almost so natural in his movies, full satisfaction here. If we keep the morality factor aside, we can even see the malicious facts. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts are normal, but try to lift the film in vain. At least, the letters of the three girls should be reversed to bring some interesting stuff, but sadly, here too all the brainless, explosive bibbets (3b) are those who talk, behave, and even shout with similar shouting. Do the main holes of the plot pretend to put three girls in the same house, so that they will not know about each other? To do some sex, for something else? The same can be done in a few other ways. Therefore, audiences will not be able to easily diabetes due to such dramatic reasons. But of course, showing big meat and tempting promotions are always there. Many movies are a great primary. Now those who call it a casual comedy, I call it a merciful taste. As the music of the movie's listeners must definitely go astray and they are immersed in a poisonous, strange and shocking type of humor which is not such a character that they laugh at themselves and themselves. Looking at the frustration we have seen how stupid we are that we have to endure something like laughing?
