It was not a transposing or Ga Raci movie. It was a big Wannabee. It wanted to be a lively, nervous sunny, urban life-affirming film, but it's a camera quarrel, more mess. It is much easier to imitate anything other than creating real stories with real characters. From the beginning, I did not care less about what the letters were or what was involved in them. They were always always hit, pissing, or cry over each other. Simply, they did not have any substance doing what. The characters in the dialogue are meant to be hip, publish, instead it comes out to trite, and after another view is predictable. I know that the audience really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
