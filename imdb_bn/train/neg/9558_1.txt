I think it was a kind of series and since 1983 it's going to be original. But a series does not accept the original plot and it is destroyed. <br /> <br /> I was actually expecting this movie, but I only lost my life for 95 minutes. No doubt - I'm actually stupid, poorly played, and so filled with technical errors, so I can not believe it just as a computer geek. They tried to make a generic war movie and a mix in 24 hours. But this is not a low-budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a complete waste time. Instead get the original. Theme is still valid. Do not let much power on a machine. And acting and plot much more exiting and mandatory.
