I saw this image under the title "Tide Up". Usually I've enjoyed dolph movies, so try this one. It was not worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about visitors enticing the box. Do not be fooled. It's the best one poor film. The acting is nonexistent. Plot, what's a little bit in one, very predictable The place seems to be cut together in the movie. This stinks up to the only plain place. There is even a cheap night rental price. As a bit of the dolph fan, I waited to see him in action. At the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. Best to avoid this film, and spend some other time spending your time.
