I thought I would disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest an annoying bit boring! Although he was trying a little bit, that is, without registering the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and Dibna (Mira Sorvino) relationship, the lifestyle of Richie (Adrian Brody) and then the local mafia kind. The story is good, but ultimately you have 2 or 3 stories. With this kind of provocative murderer, Mr. Lee could not do more to that side of the film? <br /> <br /> There are some good points though. All scenes with 'Sam of Sam' killer David Barrowvittes look very nice (color saturation etc ...) and the performance is good all the time. <br /> <br /> Overall I think different stories will work well without their own or other killings. It was not just strong enough in the last phase. <br /> <br />
