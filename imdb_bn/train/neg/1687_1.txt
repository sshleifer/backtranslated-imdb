If you go to watch this movie, then you have said that the movie theater, director, producer, actor and the person you are going to see! Sir Mitchell Geller, to keep your name and face on this poor excuse for the movie. Japanese actors used to communicate only in Japan, instead of trying to "act" in English, but it could be even more terrible. At the end of the movie, I wanted to boing ... the real disappointment after all hip promoting TV and movie trailers to promote this lump money maker. Sarah Michele did not really do all the work for making this movie ... She just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste your time or money in this picture.
