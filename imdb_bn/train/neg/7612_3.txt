I can not get past this movie's message. It is very clear to ignore, and it is obscene because it lost its meaning. I did not read the novel, but Pollack's picture is open with a view of New York's CIA-Front organization, which has been broken down by two professional killers, under whose leadership Max Win Saindo, who killed half a dozen Kuikki staff members, we came to know and understand. An elderly female receptionist of staff, a warm elderly professorial guy who reads the cap (what the rage?), And finally, the beautiful Tina Chen, who looks at the copier, sees that he is going to kill, and say, cruelly brave , "I will not scream." Von Saido sympathetically responded, "I know." These killings are completely unexpected, barbarous, which we are aware of, and obsolete by graphic. This is a brutal scene. <br /> <br /> There is no way in which Von Saido and her pregnancy can be freed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Then the script turned him into a perfectly reasonable, sensitive person. "Good to live in Europe. Things are not so early." Or whatever. I swear I'm not making it. Pollack wants us to believe that being a decent mass murderer is better than a notorious bureaucracy. That message. If you forget, you have to write it. Just like mental childhood do you have to turn to normal values, not to mention common sense, as opposed to upside down? I understand that the thoughtful adults who hate the government in the United States hate it, and who only see danger everywhere, otherwise explain the knee blurts for unreasonable events. I know that those who think that way, they mark some of my closest friends as numbers. However, if some dislike this dislike, this hatred, if it intensifies, must be beyond politics or ethics and in the state of mentality. I do not believe for a moment that a man who kills people for money is better than a government official. How murderers are disadvantaged and civilized and I do not care if I know how to reach Louvre on the metro. Need any medication or meditation that is purveying the message. <br /> <br /> I want to be able to argue that the product has nourished its message as thoroughly, but I can not. It has been quite good. (In some ways it's worse, because it makes the film less scalable.) Even New York City shows photogenetic on the screen. And as a photogallery of New York I've been thinking for a long time. Robert Redford did a commendable job in the context of his character's initial shock and confusion, but then became a telecommunication semi-talent. And, man, she looks right! Her dress is okay. Even becoming its rimless glasses. And its peacoat It's not everyone who can make a fleet motor jacket look glamorous. She looks very handsome, fragrant. I want to see that. I would like to wear a tint with a thin shirt and such as pan ache. Faye Dunaway has his role okay but it is not very credible in a role. Would someone sleep with a man who kidnapped him and held him by the gunman? Even if he looks like Redford? If someone is mentally hurt, after the relationship of the conflict ended, what did Redford ask him to say no to anyone about what was happening? Cliff Robertson is nicely the best. She does not take one or two extremely good double. Mailman fantastic. The battle between him and the crowd of the Redford crowd is very beautiful and once, we do not know how it will change, because Redford (later a book reader) does not hesitate in this mercenary cruel barbarity. Assassin This is one of John Hobson's final roles. Shame She is a magnifier on the screen. And what's the end of his life? A friend wanders in the streets of New York, losing her, around her, she was known for most of her life. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is run very well, but I can not ignore that harmful, dangerous message. There is a similar problem with Lenny Rifenstahl's "Will Win". Or his Olympic documentary, which is looking at the footsteps of the announcer, among which Jesse Owens is heading for leadership and disrespect, "This Negro is dangerous."
