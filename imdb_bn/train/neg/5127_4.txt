She did not have any stars in this film, but she had a great cast with great supporters and Jean Tearini before growing up. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Kerry, Bruce Cabot, Joseph Kelly and Cedric Hardwicke, you actually expect more from the movie. Most of it I suspect, due to second-rate scripts, Henry Hathaway was a well-appointed and well-established man. <br /> <br /> This movie is right before WWII-Americans enter the war. Bright is trying to control their African colonies, while the Nazis are trying to create problems among the locals. The photo is a double dealer in the white man - the work to destroy the British Empire! But, beautiful girl playing with (!) Lovely tearny, good Ol 'helping to save that day for Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers were tall with the empire and in the 1930s and 40s, lots of pro-empire films were seen. Nowadays, with the changed sensitivity, it looks ridiculous to see the happy black native of the Queen and the country - and it's hard to root on both sides! Yet, on this day, this promotional group was effective in reducing support for the British - although today it is seen that the film is suffering from long scripts and silly casting. The brightest moment of the final showdown film between George Sanders and the enemy agent. After so powerful scenes, a very bad picture just speaks and speaks - some of its punch loses.
