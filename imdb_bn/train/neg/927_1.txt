I really want to say, how the Charles band can give the full moon head a total sting-ball like Democranacus. I should not get green light to start with it. The story is repetitive, the weakest of characters, then no other Tireranus any real story then he is a bad dude Then they went out to find its way for a bad end of writer or director. It's just a bad end, the emergence of Demonicus. The last survivor escapes from a lethal cave, then comes life in a picture of a chimera, I can cheaply add him and leave him behind. Then he is walking home ala FUNHOUSE. A statue destroyed a century ago reappeared without any reason for its fall. I mean, that makes no sense. What Charles thought was that these films could be made with these four movie companies, they were disappointed for the film. They could ask me, I was better off than Damnicus. Thank you Turkey.
