Treasure Island DVD to watch any film production course! This is a textbook example of not making a movie. By watching the film and listening to the writer / director's comment, graphics show huge detail about what he knows about the characters and what they communicate with their audience. Call me as an old, but I think movies are the means of communication, and if the director does not know what the director is talking about, the contact is not completed. The purpose of the director is to eliminate the movie "Hollywood Convention". Among those conventions, laziness, the nature of the concept and the continuity of the transparency. The director itself realizes that the audience often can not understand the points where he can deliberately avoid "Hollywood Clich". However, he never realized the idea that Clive is present for one reason. They are shorthand for quickly and clearly conveying complex ideas. They are good at avoiding them, but they have to replace the same concept in any other means of communication, not to be excluded. The film is built on a intriguing premises rich with potential. Two dolls are allocated to create personality and background for an unknown body used in an unauthorized mission on WWII's Closing Day. Soon everyone began to start their personal fantasies with the character and their discoveries became increasingly real to them. Any less disagree with the traditional story "Hollywood Convention" could make a great movie with this idea. This picture is certainly not! Dolls can do everything they can to keep up with these characters, but they are always defeated by fun and confusing scripts. In particular, I am increasingly influenced by Gonso, who observe the dead body. In many Muppate films, she always stood as a very charismatic doll.
