This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to watching a good movie. I'm like someone who started the movie and did not stop it until finally, but I was not forced to stop myself. <br /> <br /> I did not stop the only reason because I was a huge Christian slut fan and I wanted to do it. After watching the movie I was really stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies of my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting something ridiculous. If you were not in this movie then I would get bored of my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins will have to act. I did not get the plot even when the film was over. I was both confused and annoyed.
