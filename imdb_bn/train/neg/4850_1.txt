Some unreasonable movie spoilers include. <br /> <br /> From the real-life experience, this movie continues to be disappointing from the very beginning. I am currently working as an infantry man in my second visit to Iraq. There is nothing for this picture to happen to what happens in the real life. Some names from the beginning: Bomb Cart, Eode Elements Rolling exclusively without an escrow, EOD Staff Sergeant VBC switching to Schnikant, inserting the whole time into ACU, where I leave it to me, 2 dollar Haji Copy, Sniper Scenes. The listing will continue, however, it is unnecessary to list the wrong list of what happened with the 2-minute period of some more errors. And the point has been created. <br /> <br /> This film is for people and critics that they have no experience or experience with any intelligence or military force. <br /> <br /> Military background or people of knowledge will be frustrated by the army.
