Cement Lady A real course on social anthropology in the late 60's. Writing, not acting, is at the center stage. What I said - pure camp! If you are woman or gay ready to be offended. Broad and Dame are represented in standard terms and for gay baiting and bashing what they did (camp-based). Although some amazing performances by the extraordinary character actor are mostly close to the line, the competition is closed. Action scenes are hypocrites but Dan Blocker likes to see a tough guy, who likes batting hard. And Lenny Cajon and Rakkel Welsh are the impressive tops of their career. It is amazing to think that at the age of 28 they were old and 53 years old. Musical score, wait. . . Was there a score there? Well, you get points. See it with friends who want a good smile. It's full of them.
