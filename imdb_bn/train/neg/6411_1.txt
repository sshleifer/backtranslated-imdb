The return is one of the films that are movies that love movies and at the same time mislead them. Sarah Michele Geller is a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill the vampire or not get naked throughout the movie. I was willing to place it with this, but I was never willing to make up with the worst editing combined with the Nondescale flashbacks. Finally when he was young, he crashed his car into his car. Or maybe I was wrong and it was a flashback. It is impossible to say this movie. Can you believe the same cityman who created this shit in the dark army? There are many good ideas to stay at home and to watch the dark army on the Si Si Channel. That movie was on it: a dude with a chainsaw for slots, zombies and a hand. One of these things forgotten was not even there.
