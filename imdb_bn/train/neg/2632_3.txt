It saddens me to rate a movie with my favorite actor, position and style, such as Douglas, Swirland, Washington, DC and political thriller, but 'Sentinel' really diminishes. Like they had a great idea in front of, signed the right cast and had great city shots and then the rest of the staff took a holiday for the improvement. And I hope I can blame it with another soft performance of bison (not only that I think he is one of Hollywood's worst actors, but I've still played for more than a decade that he was the only one and definitely the only bad actor of the film, Confidential 'Oscar won.) But he was not the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as '24' again Jack Bauer? Jack I missed his old 'A Tie Tie-to-Kill' or 'And Good Good Men' days. Douglas certainly had a break from acting and called it. Plot: Some people, some secret service betrayers, the President dead and Douglas (suddenly) want to create. Will anyone believe in him? Indeed, no spoiler here: as soon as they came through half of that subplot, you know it before it ended. Why did anyone else to die for the President? Will it be published in the novel? There are many plot holes, many doors are open and never closed and very predictable 'Sentinel'. If you only watch a movie a year, you probably do not know what the copper is, but anyone who is familiar with such movies, or even the 'law and order' episode will know you in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, cinematography was good, and despite Saderland playing Jack again, he still got it.
