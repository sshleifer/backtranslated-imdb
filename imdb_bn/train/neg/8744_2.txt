I accidentally end up watching this movie. I'm not sure whether I'm still regret it. I felt that I saw a film made by students in the film school, which is mostly not cut. It seems to be a Hollywood clich√© imaginable, when our corporations suppress us with the message 'Final Bad'. Subtlety does not know this movie. As far as it goes, it even drives its own spoilers to supply. <br /> <br /> The story looks like a computer fantasy fantasy world. The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet a programming genius and a clear hacker (I think), many other dancing-fantasy-original facts which you will see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I knew that it would be a Z-movie when I saw Nedi Belaami ... she had a good tip off. <br /> <br /> It can not recommend one, I'm afraid.
