There was a designation with Bill Shatner about a game show and in such a way that there was a title to deal or no deal and look at 1 vs. 100. So, of course everyone had to protect everyone to see what was wrong with this issue. New game show. What a disappointment! Ben Stein is so Stoky and Nassely says, "wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing you liked this event was that you know it will end. It was good to go to the dentist throughout the entire hour ... You are watching the clock within 10 minutes that you think, only a minute has passed (but looks like eternity) You glanced at the last watch. So, why did not I just switch channels? Well, perhaps for the same reason most people ... are not out of optimism. I mean, someone does not really want to be a program with Bill Shatner who can actually be a BAD. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> My main complaint was set to set so dark. Seeing it I feel depressed. You want to get a little excited, but there was no one there. There was not enough light to get the feeling of energy from the audience (who you could not see). <br /> <br /> Network: People are not seen playing games to cure their insomnia. .. They have to be excited in the watch game and have a good time. Please all of us please and vault lose this.
