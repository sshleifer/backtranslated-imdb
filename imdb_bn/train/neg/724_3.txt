The concept of Sarfarina is a word, which seems to be aside from the musical perspective. It is trying to combine African music with a story that described the black man as being tortured by the film and forced to describe it. Each conflict of two elements is very embarrassing and the film does not support the change in Jabailation and terrorism so rapidly. If it was only a drama reflecting these conditions, it could be a good movie, but the soldiers shot the children in school watching the scenes could not sit well with the song. Apart from the poor edge, the acting is not the best, as well as Goldberg as well as the middle part of the slope gives a moderate performance. Overall disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
