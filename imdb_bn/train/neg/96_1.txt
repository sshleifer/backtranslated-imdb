Oh wait, I can! This movie is not generally for film snub, unless you want to define your general movie definitions such as "continuity editing" and "geographic match". I could not say where I was in this movie. They are present in one second, in the next minute their ideas run as a modern SUV in the 70's and 80's style dresses looked like me. I think. The acting was horrible so I could not pay enough attention to it. I got it only attention because it has a 3D which I did not see. If you are a B-movie buff, and by B-Movie, I will use BAD movie, but this movie is for you. This home-movie and all non-sense styles can keep you awake until you can laugh. If you taste more for gaudard and ant√≥nio, then exclude it.
