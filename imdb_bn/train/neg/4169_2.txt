Because I gave it a 2 just because of Natya Masti (as Vampire que quintana) is very sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are very few arguments in this movie, but most of these sci-fi flops are vampires. The film probably tried a lot to break away from the story of the traditional vampire. Unfortunately, it went very far and the whole story is not just illusory, ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A good Vampire movie should be more intelligent that you do not have to see many blood - we all know When a vampire will jump on someone who he will do vampires. A few moans or screams are needed to describe it in the scene (like one at the end when Quintana tries to seduce Rosa, it moans something needed, left your imagination). However, it's just my personal taste.
