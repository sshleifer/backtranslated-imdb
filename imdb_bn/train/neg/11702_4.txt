No, I did not read Steven King's novel "Thinner", but I stopped the film version. Awesome movie is an acquired taste. He appreciated a hero as an audience of regular movies as he tried to achieve a goal. In horror movies, visitors are invited to taste the character's death. Directed by Tom Holland, less lean but transparent revenge slips "slim", no one wins, and everyone claims bite given on them. Newton England's attorney Billy Helek (Robert John Burke of "Robocop 3") is a weight problem. Although he opened the bathroom scales of 300 pounds, he happily married with the happy married girl Heidi ("Jei Jean" of Lucca Jenny). <br /> <br /> Fat does not mean stupid here. Hellak showed his ambiguity in court when he won the merciless verdict of the disappointed Mafia Principal Richie Genilie ("House of Games" Joe Mentegen). Driving home from a victory festival, hit an old Gypsy woman beyond the street and kill him. A cover-up happens, and Helle's friends find her soup. Angered Gypsy father Taduz Lemk (Michael Constantine of "SkyDoo") cursed a serious lawyer and two officers with a curse. Suddenly, Helk finds himself pounding in the pound of how much moon he kisses. When he requested the revengeful Gypsy to lift the curse, elderly people refused. Undoubtedly, Relay Resorts from Relay. When he struggled with GPC for the removal of Helek Hex, he learned that his trusted wife turned his attitude towards the city's attention-makers. <br /> <br /> "Slim" is not just ridiculous as the faint horror flick, but filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women. "Children's Play" (1988), and Tom Holland, directed by painter Michael McDowell, has presented such a slipsped script that you can not see and see Bill's dessert only. "Slim" boasts few shocks and less surprises. Movie makers can regenerate the King's novel, but they portray any sense of horror and humor. Holland and McDowell introduced letters like Mafioso, then unknowingly closed the hook. A small character appears long enough to die and has a chicken head in his mouth. <br /> <br /> Stereotype behavior of letters may also insult the listener. The "thin" woman is looked after as Vinceen and the man as swine. When Helk ran out of the clinic, he parked his doctor's sports car in his house. Her doubts ripen into jealousy and she cooked up a project to curse this wife curse. Lack of any satiric odor even in the end of the premature death. Actor Robert John Burke has done wonders to see Oscar winner's special effects wizard Greg Canam of "Van Helsing" and make-up artist Bob Laden Matrix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
