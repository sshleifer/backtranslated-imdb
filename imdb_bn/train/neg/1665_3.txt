It was a decent movie, I actually enjoyed it. But the end is so sudden !! Absolutely no closing and leave it to the end of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What will happen with her boyfriend? He hooked up with Grant? She comes to the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously his performance will hurt the angle of the angle a few, but nothing is shown as he indicated the reaction. There are so many left in the air and it is very unhappy. I do not know whether it's trying to leave the room for a signal or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think it really makes the movie fun. I was very frustrated.
