When two of your actors have two Tower Houses to interrupt each other, at least you can expect a fantastic camera and an incident in this movie where 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan is romantically a 34-year-old. Actually there is everything in the name of the plot instead of "Chaney", it has turned into "Kum" writer-director R. Balkee's first attempt on this subject. <br /> <br /> Believe that when two senior actors love this extraordinary pair Then they come up with their knowing and bitter-sweet moments, and this is the slow you but the first half can be found. Local areas captured in the rainy season are impressive. At the end of the first half, the romance is completed and the mission is completed. There is nothing left to say. Therefore, a strange opposition in the second half comes as the father of the girl, because she goes for Satyagraha, it is a test of patience. An equally strange measure about how he gives it. The result, the second half dry, flat with no power. There is a concubine with a baby girl who has died of cancer, it is not too much effect. However, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performance.
