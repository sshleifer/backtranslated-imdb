What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this movie - after looking at the preview and thinking it might be "funny" Wrong! This movie is more than 90 minutes long. The actors are trapped in a bad written script and can not find. The trick is weak and tired, and Wilson's nude can not retrieve any part of the film. Special effects ..... I hoped to see the umpire and the cable in half its bright scene. And when the influential people can not influence superhero-flying bullets or fighting scenes, they cover everything from the cyclonic whirlwind of the blurred screen - which hides the terrible effects. Wilson's Sidekick was a long march for a man and there was no chemistry with Wilson's umma or his colleague. The sex scene was not sexy and the funny scene was not funny. I just guess this is very expected from the actors. No character was really sympathetic, so I did not care about a flying shoot about them anymore. The only memorable performances were kids and G-Girl was seen as a teenager - at least they had some chemistry. Above all, a super stinko movie - I do not recommend it as even fare - it will still be waste money!
