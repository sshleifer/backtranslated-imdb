I like Chris Rock, but I think he's lost in this picture. The idea of ​​heavyweight remaking can be fined, but filmmakers have followed closely the plot of Turkey. When Dr. Eddie Murphy When Delilit and Nuti professor rebuilt, he reviewed them completely - so they became morphy movies / vehicles, not just a tip-off remake. That is why they were successful. If Chris did the same thing, it could be a very good movie. Some smiles come when he is preparing his step-up - so he might have also done a concert film. The body of the white man who lived in was a truck driver or hill. So why not Hollywood junk like this? Because people go see it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us a better movie! Do not rebuild that movie that was not like that first!
