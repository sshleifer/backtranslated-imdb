The real release of this film is the true story ... Otherwise, this film was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was sticky and very tacky. The story was beautiful, but it was very difficult to see because of all the awesome performances. I would not recommend watching this ... The only release quality of this movie was that the actors were somewhat interesting ... especially Ryan Bauer, who is playing soap opera star. Some good things have been done to edit, but there is a continuation error in all places ... I'm just sick of seeing bad movies and getting tired ... can we get good soon?
