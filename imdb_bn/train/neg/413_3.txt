This is a movie that gives you an impression. What is the story writing story of the movie? <br /> <br /> The incredible visual effect .. very well played, especially from the shoe. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is just poor and so, everything fails. <br /> <br /> What would you do if this image has the power to disappear? Well, our mad scientist can not think of doing any other work here (played by Kevin Bacon) but can rape and rape women. All of this may think of his supposed "talent". Did he try to gain extra strength? No He does not bother research to return to being visible. The man is basically a crazy madman. <br /> <br /> Add to this, the lab atmosphere, all of your young boys .. They have thrown jokes around. If it was not all white coat and tools, you could have these "cheers." It would seem to be a bad imitation. Very irreverent and poor personality and very little care. You think these guys have nothing except the lamb for the Hall Man's wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the film becomes very small because the "thrilling" scenes are written very badly and the performers are just screaming, unjustifiable behavior is complete "This is a stupid thing that I must do People can find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> If you read the real book, then the scientist (can) goes after women, then his pea There are many mental skills and thinking trera boring. In the film, canon is only a sick person, who goes around in the crowded market and surrounds her body in women and closes it. Just sad
