Oh man, what is Sam Marovich thinking? Was there anybody involved in this "film" thought? Marovic is the chief of almost all of "Ben and Arthur": directors, writers, producers (also producer producer!), Cast, lead star - you gave it its name, he did it. And he (Morovic) sucks more than every section of the film produces occasionally sucked. <br /> <br /> So what is wrong with this image? Everything. The film is about two gay boyfriends, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Morovich- * Groen *). Ben and Arthur want to get married in the world where everyone hates homosexuals. To make some worse, Ben's crazy "ex-wife" (they do not divorce completely), Tammy (Julie Ballencope) is crazy that Ben has kept her for another person and Ben claims he will return together (say that he might be Gay, too!) And Arthur's Christian devotees, too fanatic, brother-in-law, war criminals as Victor, cruel to Arthur straight He tried to kill him kicked out of the church. This film is a lot of fools (like Ben and Arthur will fly Burm and Arthur to get married) - They go there to Alaska Airlines and there are palm trees in Vermont, they go back to the plane of FedEx cargo - I hope they are a piece of wood , Plus a lot, much more) and plot holes (Victor Arthur "The Final Plan", which later goes into "Final Law"); And (internal) drive in the same intelligence, Blah, Blah, Blah). "Actors" is all very bad and the way, the way over the top; The script is ridiculously terrible (such as an example "I do not understand ... you do not understand! I understand that, it does!") And there are many other mistakes that I can do with "movie" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "Ben and Arthur" and clearly commented on YouTube.) Mourovich is atrocious and his arrogant person blinds him from what he looks like something terrible. <br /> <br /> Finally, forget about the bad movie you have claimed, that's the worst movie- "Paris and Hilton movies like Ben and" Ben and Arthur ", like" The Dark Knight "looks like" Arthur " Will push.
