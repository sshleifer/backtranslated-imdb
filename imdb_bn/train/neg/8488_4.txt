This film should be great, with virtual reality, computer possibilities, contact with the past, the ongoing struggles of expressing your identity in limited society, and the impressive Ada Byron Loves, illustrated by the impressive Tilla Swinton. But if you think possible, terrible, terrible! Acting - Sister Swinton and Karen Black as well - veers from being violent to be tolerant The construction of the plot is curious to say at least - the modern day programmer is not a neutral one note character, but half the movie is set up to set up its character, and then when the admiral is finally appearing, it is describing events in his life, not to present an engaging story (Swinton Although this pulls off). Only an icon from BCL's history paper, you can not fully know him as an actual person. <br /> <br /> Digital effects like digital dogs and birds are frustrating and confusing. 1997 and 1985 And, finally, the script is just bad. Bad, often induced dialogue - especially the fight between the programmer and his lover, which makes me blurred - the cold and remote characters, and the zero attempt to create strange ideas. Programmer successfully communicates with a person in the past! Wonderful! But it rarely surprises anyone, and his boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Even though no source was given to us or why it might be dangerous, and it does not seem to be dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Also, despite its love for computers and ad libasas and math, it is related to scripts Nobody had any knowledge of mathematics or computer - any reference to these issues has been added as a complete jumbo, which denies any suspension of disbelief. A scene, in the end, the film is quite good, Tilada Swinton's psychology expresses her grief over the weakness of living, but she expresses her joy in that life. <br/> <br /> <br /> I've been frustrated in this movie because it's a missed opportunity for an interesting small culture movie. If you find it interesting, you might want to rent it, but undo it. On the other hand, see Orlando, much better than the sex roles in history, with the performance of Sinnanton. At the end of the movie, Gaga asks that her memories can not be saved (which I think was the best scene in the film). <br /> *** Terror / Question: * * <br /> However, modern day programmers think that the memory of her little girl has been transferred (hence the film title). Am I right, does the programmer violate the wishes of Ada without violating it? Or is this another confusing plot that I am misinterpreted?
