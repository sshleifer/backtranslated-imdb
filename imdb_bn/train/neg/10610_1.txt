The mind has a signal of Universal Soldier merged just about what boggles. The original star Dolf Lundgren will not be able to reconsider his role from the original, because of this obvious tax right-off, the reason for being self-righteous is already less. Strong attempts were made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts specialist Michael Joy White. Their credit, they give a better sense of tension in order of their actions. Bill Goldberg feels that this film has his life time and he has created a fair stab to fulfill the role of the comedic villain. For once, its role repeats the same line several times, and it is not annoying. The problem with the viewer's view is that none of these gentlemen has the feeling of comic timing or silent humility that makes Landgren so happy to see almost all of his films. And there is problem problem. You do not want to see Van Damme film because you want serious steps. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I only saw the first, whose production price was so bad that it can only be surprised if it is a strong joke. Matt Battlaglio was so horrible in Luke Lover's role that once his career came out to welcome Jean Claude Van Damme's approach. The film ignores direct-synchronous tales from at least direct video, and instead sets an entirely new story after an eventatic event. After years of investigation and explanation, with minor changes, the Unisol project is still moving forward. For one, the new Unicols are stronger than their previous cousins ​​and resistant to further damage. For others, all of Unicols are now under the guidance of a supercomputer named Seith. In the early part of the film, Seth is essentially a series of abstract graphics in a glass dome. <br /> <br /> Since the film has been running for more than eight hours, it is quickly said that military funding is being cut. The Unisol project will be closed on the Chipping Block, which means that the session will be closed. SETH, in any way, has meant that this conversation is very important, which is never explained, decided to force the army against the people who want to stop UNISOLS. Its only problem is that each one has to put a code on its system to automatically stop the automatic shutdown. The two person possesses the code of question. Seth murdered the first and ordered those who created the films of Van Damme's plot kit who would guess in five seconds of second. The rest of the movie is going from Winn Dam to Uysol's attempt without being seriously injured. A mistress is knitted into a concubine film with a girl and a reporter, but it adds as much of the story as the acting actor Van Van Damme makes. <br /> <br /> The picture is loaded on the shoulders with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transfers his command module between Michael Joe's body, how do we talk about human speech? He is telling his foot soldiers how fear and death will be human weakness (es). G, Seth, do you mean they will not be our strong points? Everyone is joking, the film's short length is the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. Basically, we have given a very thorough explanation of how Unisols works, how they work and in most cases, how they have brought the state. Here, the author believes to accept that the audience knows what Unisol is and how they work. At least for a moment, basically, curiosity and astonishment were created after the film was removed without the explanation of the character when the hero is located on an ice floor. Here, a villain is shot with a gun that throws a huge hole in his uniform (and probably his body), to stand up to swim every time. <br /> <br /> I keep score more than one, so movies are so bad that they are becoming strangely entertaining. You can see it in cheaper, find yourself lost. Such a movie that gives me the grief for the mystery science theater.
