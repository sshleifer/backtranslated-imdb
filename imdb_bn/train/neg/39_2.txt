An African actress was kidnapped in Africa and she was taken to the forest detained for release. Someone to go back to the producer and bring her back. Everything is complicated, a ugly face, which likes to eat nude women, cansball in the forest that worship "god" <br /> <br /> This is a poor lazy film. There is plenty of nudity and violence not to mention violence against nude people. This is a exploitation film designed to appeal to our deepest dark areas, and if the film is not so annoying it will be a classic. Despite cow, face confrontation, nasty sex and abuse, and ugly giant make this film face Snuzer. All of the pens off the pensing and it keeps you out. There are multiple plot lines that seem to be happening separately from each other, even though it is ultimately a story. Worse, almost no one is saying anything. In the most dialogue, "I will do whatever I want" or a letter protests. It's a cool and immensely film that if the hunter does not have to scream frequently, I recommend it for sleeping support. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid if you do not need to sleep. Unless you want to watch the euro-cannabal movie. VideoAssia (It is only published as part of their Terrorist Tales series), their print is strange, which seems to be the result of acceptance. They have a printing from Japanese sources (there is fogging) to crop the subtitles. Were not printed on their print titles.)
