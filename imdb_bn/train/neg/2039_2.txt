This movie was almost helpless to sit around. I can think that it is shot with a home video camera and it seems to hold this film for more than a week, but the characters do not change clothes at once, but the act breaks the fourth wall for me. . I saw good acting in grade 4. As well as the plot that is unrealistic If the person suspects that the man surrounded him, I was also disappointed that all the killings were made by gun, what kind of poor It is not a copycat that does not kill a Russian gun, the authorities knew it was not. Another thing that really bothered me was the Dissociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, when it was the name of the book that is not the name of the disease for the diagnosis of mental disorders. Overall, I think this film is not a film that can be reduced to low budgets, not as low or they could be sure that they were good actors or even more proud. Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and looking at Easier Rider in the low budget, many people went to a low budget route to use horror actors.
