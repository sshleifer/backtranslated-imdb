Shown in 1975, do not see this movie. If you do not see Sholah in 1975, see the janati. But do not see this movie. This movie contains all the elements that might have been wrong to create a rimak in Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Babban's child has played the role of the best psychological villain (probably 40 railways that should not be burnt). If you remove the rest of the movie and watch Amitabh turn around his character, it will still be worth the watch. But as insp. Narsingh, Mohanlal does not do justice to his genius. Ajay Devgn (Hero) is extremely hypocritical and I think the only reason, Raj raj has played Prashant Raj because his youths have similarity with Amitabh. Sushmita Sen is pleased with her, with compassion and makeup. But for the "highest performance and any role of today" the prize must go. He led his acting in such a way that even the high school drama would also overcome its performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to this movie. :)
