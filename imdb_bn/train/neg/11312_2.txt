This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines the theater, film, and epic story elements. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The most vulnerable films are reluctant to do anything; It's camp, morality, and epic never ever observed any of them. For the story itself, Cer√©tien de Troyes trembles in his grave in this nasty adaptation, which makes love, helpless innocuous parallel the most irrational and rude crunching. <br /> <br /> There are probably two types of people who can see this, Francophilus or Earth derifilse. When talking like the next, I found the film incompetent and incredibly involved, the disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
