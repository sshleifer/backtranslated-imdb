Lorenzo Lams is a kind of CIA agent who captures some foreign beauty named Alexa, kidnaps his daughter and forces her to fight against her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also credited with a dash on board for the credibility of the talented group. I'm certainly not Lorenzo Lama, or the fan of his movies. She stinks. But O.J. Comparison with Kimmons of Simpson and Lamas's Kimatos, Lamas A, Jane Cloud Van Dam thinks. O.J. Because of the new interest in the Simpson trial, I only saw the CIA, you see because you can not escape from this movie if you have parental cables and additional channels. In 1994 you can go to a prosperous community and some moron this will be playing on their portable TVs. The film itself will make a collection and plot of the Lum Action sequence, although Oz Simpson's Shock Value Fireballs and jumping after exchange will give some liners some uncertain humor. Also Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant Where was it a whole camp classic? <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
