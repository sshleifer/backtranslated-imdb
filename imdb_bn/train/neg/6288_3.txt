After reading a few comments here, I am surprised that the episode of a twilight zone called "Mirror Image", which was played by Mera Mera from the 1960s, was largely not recognized as an extra fairytale. Rod Sterling did much good work in 24 minutes to create effective work stories, compared to 88 minutes in San Elis with this exhaustive graduation. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and undetermined end, but in a feature film, there must be more materials and the story should be understood. Sadly, the substance and sense are missing from "broken" two things. Yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some more observations: Although it is clearly a contemporary story, there is not a cellphone in the film's character! And even though a car accident event is going to happen, there is no reference to an insurance company, the person running another car, or to report to a police that was needed. My suggestion: Avoid this blog and see the original instead!
