Just seeing five eyes, I'll be honest ... I did not like it. I could read so much good reviews in this movie, but I did not get where these reviews came from, <br /> <br /> I have had a lot of time for new filmmakers, and I am sure 'the director will do well for myself, but The main problem was their budget, two cameras were used in the whole movie (which was right) but they actually looked like cheap cameras. There was another problem, you screamed all these girls and started shouting together, everyone was talking on one another - it is impossible to hear what they are saying. It was a good idea for it, in a nutshell, they carried a parked car and then ran, after a while they were behind the car that hit, which was driven by a mad lady, who killed them Want to do so and have plenty of potential to do so! ... and on the other hand women have many possibilities to escape, but not! <br /> <br /> Very annoying ... I just scrap this one!
