I have never heard of this, then found out that the fatal lens is what I heard but did not see. Connery's presence has happened to me to buy it, and it's not good. It wants to be a cross between Dr. Stranglebov and Mash, but it's not funny, until you find the General Ombot (?) Funny name. Until the last ten minutes it comes across as a flat 70 thriller, when it is vivid. There are many flat views between Whitehouse's president and his colleagues who do not work. The initial cut was very long, and the first half was done to get involved in the story of nuclear bomb release and suicide bombings, which I think played to laugh, but not funny again. Location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV. I could not believe that the person responsible for key largo, crossfire and almer genetic has done this. Just smile: Connie throws her wig before placing her helmet and before jumping from a plane. It will never say again look like genius.
