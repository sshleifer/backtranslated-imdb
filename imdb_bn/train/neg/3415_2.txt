In the standard view, this is a purely horror movie. However, it rates the near perfect score around the weird comedy scale. I can think of a few real comedies that give me as much smile as seeing this movie. Andy Griffith's ghost wearing Native American girl dance sent me to violence every time. I can not afford gas or power driving for video rentals, but if you insert 3 gold in the morning and check on the TV then check it out.
