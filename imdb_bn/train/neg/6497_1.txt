I actually got a lot of hope in this movie, so I accepted what I gave with the grain of salt and hoped for the best. Throughout the film, I had to give up only about 1/3 of the way, the film is simply a mask of stuff that is causing the offense and it is all disconnected. I like movies that you think, but this film was a bunch of ideas thrown together and sometimes it was not connected. <br /> <br /> It does not feel as David Lynch-esque, since someone will trust you, it's somewhere near some other than that trippy visual. This is not a conspiracy or a plot in the light of truth that it is not a plot or story that you have destroyed 1.5 hours in the film. Acting was good, but that can not save the lack of stories. I agree with a comment I posted earlier ... "It's like someone else's head ... they're victims of drugs," does not understand anything in other words.
