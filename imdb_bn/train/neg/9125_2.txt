One of the fun things about being young is that it can be easily fooled by advertising. I talked before another movie, in which comedy movies seem to be more fun than it is. Seeing this ad in 1981, I think it's going to be a great funny movie. I and my brother who saw it and saw it with me did not know that the TV used in advertising was the last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of filming, I can assume that something else was not funny! The last scene is, thank you young man, Dr. Fu Manchu turns into a long beard old man, like a bright young Asian / rock star, in Elvis! (Backup singers have no less!) <br /> <br /> Peter Selarar took his best thing for any reason in the 1930s but his "comedic" moment The rest of the actors were very soft and my brother and I just smiled. It was normal that we were expecting a "Pink Panther" type comedy, Peter Seller was so cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> On her mood, her appearance was more entertaining than the corrupted flop. Yet, I do not blame him. I do not try to make this a good film to blame everyone involved. Two big generous !!
