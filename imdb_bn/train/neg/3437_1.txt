I saw this picture yesterday. I must admit, it was not my cup tea. Although it is supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But I saw it, I was thinking ... 'This movie is not making any sense ..' Where did this man come from this dark quote? Where were the two boys leaving behind the girls? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers have ruined so much time and money in such a film that it is bound to be so barbaric. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror flicks I saw. At the end of the film, I said to myself that I will not see it again. This poppy show in this film, I decided to thump it down! Count me out of this one! 10 out of 0!
