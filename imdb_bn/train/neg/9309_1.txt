Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There is nothing to say for this movie. The basic plot is that a man (Brandon) takes some friends to visit his cabin to stay away from the weekend holidays. After taking the girl out on the street, things are starting to get worse for all of them. <br /> <br /> The solo story (Brandon playing played by the actors, I believe, though I can be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and it's acting accordingly. "Clown Killer" is a sad excuse for himself a psychic killer. Many dark, mysterious, but mostly intelligent hunters, have instead given us a brutal, nursery rhyme, which seems to be passing through a small medieval crisis. The only theme for writing this statement was sex scenes and any of the movies (the quality of the movie led me to such a kind of enjoyment). <br /> <br />, this film falls below every possible set quality. Confession, I shared a few beers with this close friend, so we could combine some relative entertainment value from this movie and it is only significant that the SIC Who got the shame of two ratings. But in reality, (and with the benefit of the hedays), one star rating is more than legitimate score for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 star among ten
