Your first formula is that it is a Chess movie that is not in the video, it is not in the film. The story is slow, and production is amazingly sloppy. Note that, for example, when the title couple visually landed in Vermont, they went to celebrate their relationship at a civil union event, when the plane is coming to an airport surrounded with palm trees. Their ceremony - The tropical plant, including the Vermont-Lake, takes place in a garden, which will not last five minutes of New England climate. Still another aircraft trip, the established shot took off a FedEx cargo plane. Perhaps they could only travel to Sterege. For the plot, this film can convince you that the god of warter, Arthur's fianc√©e, Christian Vetter is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally set up Victor with a Hitman to kill Ben and Arthur to "abandon the soul of sin". Evidently no one in this church has listened to the Ten Commandments. This was not for Jamie Bret Gabbel, who was wonderful as Arthur, the film did not have any freedom fighter.
