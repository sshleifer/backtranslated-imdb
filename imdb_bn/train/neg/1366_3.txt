** SPOILERS ** ** <br /> The real fine Sun Yang (who looks like Elizabeth Taylor, who hides her hair in some scenes, looks like this) In this movie, her opening moment is interesting. Waiting for a bust signal sitting behind a police car, his face and body are intense and confused. Unfortunately, the stern demoner never changes when the bus is over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The open, emotional, and always at ease ... she can feel the feeling in him and there is no clear obstacle in its manifestation. She is an open book. On the other hand, young people work in spontaneous, self-conscious ways that your neighbors may expect to work, they suddenly throw to act in a movie. Basically, he has no formula. <br /> <br /> Through this major void looming in the center of the film, we're going to be thinking about the insights of the story. For example, after kidnapping the kidnapper of Miss Young, he wandered back and closed the door on one of the left. Imagine, she is wearing only bra and panties, but in the same situation, due to the psychological prisoner due to returning to a moment, would you go to the door or take the time to wear her dress, open some clothes and get dressed? I would assume that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some kind of mixed feelings, the character of Miss Young, but the young can not express such complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some dominant moments in the movie, such as brief interviews with the criminal's past victims, but overall this is a useless attempt. It was very bad when composing a composite image of Comic Book Style films, which absorbed its limitations with some humorous (Batman and Dick Tracy), because its flashing touches impossible when playing real people. Trying to see Miss Young, at least this "thriller", is a tragic scene.
