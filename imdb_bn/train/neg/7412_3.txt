I love delicious awful flicks. I do not care whether the acting sub-par or the monsters look corny. I love this movie without being surprised at the very beginning of the film. See, I do not need a 10-page register or a bigger letter by explaining a plot to me. But Dark Flowers "What about this movie?" A completely new (annoying) level. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
