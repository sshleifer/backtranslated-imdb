"Whipped" is one of the most horrible films of all time. This is an average, scary piece that forced me to stay in more theaters than any other film in 2000, probably "The Greenwich." This is not because people have been told this, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. This will be a small film called "High Fidelity". Although the film was honest and sympathetic, "whip" was poisonous toxic poisoned, hostile, disciplined film. Avoid it like many plagues, unless you see "comedy" really bad.
