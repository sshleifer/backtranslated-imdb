To be a Buster Keaton fan, your heart is broken on a regular basis. Many of us face Keaton in one of the brightest features of the first independent production film The General, 'The Navigator', 'Sherlock JNR'. We can recognize him as the greatest figure in the comedy history, and we would like to see more of his movies. Here the heart disease starts. After the Steamboat Bill Genre, Keaton's senior Joseph Seinck pressured him to sign a contract, which kept Keaton under MGM's control. Keaton became just one more actor for the rent, performing another script. Then her drunkenness became worse After the Steamboat Bill Genie, Keaton never made the first-ever original movie. Some of the sources describe an excellent work, which Keaton claims was made about * * MGM: A parody of the 'Grand Hotel'. Biographer Tom Dardis has convinced that Keaton has created this story. <br /> <br /> Keaton's long-standing deterioration has increased her heart for many years, sometimes she came up with a good movie ... as her short comedy 'Grand Slam Oprah'. I'm looking for missing footage of Katon's dramatic scene with Spencer Trasy in 'It's a Mad Mad World': A sequence in which Tracy telephonates an old retired crow (Keaton) and tries to help her in the case of smuggling goggles. . The footage has often gone forever, but I see. <br /> <br /> 'Talk easy', alas, one of Keaton's films since its fall. MGM is trying to build up Jimmy Durante as a new comedy star (who, incidentally, plays three years after Smilger Grogan). Unfortunately, MGM tried to create Durante by grouping him with Kiton, comedy style was simply inconsistent with Durante. (I am both a fan.) Throughout his career, Durante was stealing a ruthless scene: Praise, he knew that he was built at Keaton's expense, and Keaton was the only co-star whose Dur Durante tried to stop ever <br /> < Keaton is often cast as a victim of cruel conspiracy. 'Easy to speak', he is an educational and humorous midwestern college professor called Post (because he is one of the woodworkers) who received a letter that he has inherited 750,000 US dollars, which he has to travel to New York City. Does he call a phone to verify it? Does she even check the postmark? No; He took his life out of the savings bank and went to New York. As soon as he leaves, the post manager acknowledges that he has written a letter of forgery to the professor post from his net. <br /> <br /> The post, who thinks he has spent 3/4 million dollars with Jimmy, is the one who is trying to revive a musical, but there is no money. These two bright comedians have failed to interfere with the characters that are playing onscreen. Keaton is knowing everything is playing one of those eggheads (eg Mister logic in 'Viz'). Durante is one of those annoying hepcats who is unable to make straightforward statements a game because the script requires him to always talk in slang. Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about the meaning of Durante in a meaningful curious dialogue, but - instead of coming directly with him - Durante must be increasingly using terms such as 'Kale', 'cartwheels' and many more such slang terms ... Of course Keaton There is no idea what Durante has over. I'll give Keaton credits: Perfect for its own dry and dusty female voice, its flat Kansas accent, the character that he plays here. <br/> <br /> <br /> The Sydney Tollar is impressive as a bankrolled (excited) stimulant director, revitalized by Professor Post just a year later, a lot more vivid and more handsome than here. Henry Armeta, whom I have never seen interesting, is also less fun than usual, providing a running spell with a stupid salary. Thelma Todd has influenced me in an extraordinary version of his role in 'Horse Feathers' (a very funny movie). My favorite actor, actor Edward Boffi, was lost. <br /> <br /> The part of the 'Easy to Speak' problem is that the help letters behave completely inappropriate ways. Keaton's lawyer Keaton looks at Durante's theater with urgent messages ... but he is not there, so the lawyer met first to reveal him in the first total stranglehold of Keaton's private business. (The lawyer, the fire, the buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - The man who thinks of bending this musical instrument - it enters the changing room of the girls, and all the chorus girl immediately jumps and keeps herself covered. I know that * Modern * chorus girls will never react like this and I doubt the way chorus girls behaved in 1923 ... Certainly 'angel' does not control the pursuit of their looks. <Br /> <br /> The speaker is coming. Almost 'half-an-hour', weird 'Squeak' easily came in at the Gimi Durante Piano, grins in the camera, and does not have that distinctive little flock of her head as she begins to play a melody. At this moment when I think, for a long time, this movie is finally going to postpone it for our entertaining purposes. Hey, no. The end of the most annoying movie of all, which uses the single maximum hackneyed and impossible cleary in the comedy: one of which completely reduces the inability to become a star comedian through his own incompetence. (Keaton will be forced to re-emphasize this clip of the 1955 episode of 'Screen Director Playhouse'; Chaplin has already used it in 'The Circus') <br /> <br /> <br /> I started crying - Anger and sadness - at the opportunity to 'easily speak' In most cases outside of reverence, I would rate 2 of the 10 points out of respect to the work done by Keaton, Durant, Toller, Briff and Miss Todd. <br /> <br /> <br />
