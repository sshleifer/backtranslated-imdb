Think of a budget version of China's Syndrome that a movie student John Waukee has featured and you get 'Power Play'. The idea was good, but killing executions, acting and dialogue solely, does not mention violent crime and order of disaster, which is used for the lack of substances and the development of more interesting parts of the film. <Br /> <br /> A newspaper investigating the disappearance of three members of this guerrilla activist group has said that they were absent mysteriously after the collapse of a suspected power plant office due to the magnitude of the earthquake. Rather, the company's drivers were going against the more brutal cluster, instead, the murderer reporter, circulated around the city to "clear" that the trees could have any perfect evidence of flaws. Unfortunately, there is no real concept in the emergency because the characters communicate with many dialects, silent dialogue and many terrible acts. Note that viewers, this may only be attracted to the film for Action General Appeal, it is compelled to count the counting of a mounting body and to bear ridiculous amounts of violent shoot m-ups and earthquake disaster scenes. All the focus was kept in the wrong place to pray for forgiveness for lack of direction and pray for forgiveness for the more interesting size of events. The filmmakers gave more attention to the thriller and gave more attention to the development of this story's corruption aspects. False villains, a naive reporter, and those who try to warn the reporter of doing wrong-doing afoot. It is formulas, but at least it has been entertaining.
