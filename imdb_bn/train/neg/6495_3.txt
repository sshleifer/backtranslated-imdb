I hired the movie that I showed on the trailer, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack agrees to create a movie with David Lynch and Timothy Lyrry, this will be the end result. I do not think I've seen a movie that looks like an episode of LSD trip just after the road. <br /> <br /> This is a bunch of pieces where the real characters flash and out, or different reality, and the film does not end in the last 5 minutes, where it suddenly gets to know. I wrote a sharp review on my movie review blog which basically gave up everything, and I will not do it here. It was a well-known piece of film, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and tell me, if this film has a release feature, then it's music. It fits perfectly. Some conversations are incredibly good, and incredibly all the bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some part of this movie, I really did, and once you end it, think of what's actually going on. It is unfortunate that you have to go through 2 hours of crazy to get a certain point, which will reduce the impact of the whole film. <br /> <br /> I can give it 3 out of 10 for general truth. The problem with this picture is not acting, everything is everything.
