This movie director Tim Burton is one of the key to acquiring a well-known title to another character, to take his little perspective on the screen. He did it with 'Batman', 'Slip Hole' and now with this. This is not a rebuild. The only thing with the original is that it can talk to Symians (and Charlton Hesson creates a camio). Burton rebuilt the whole story, drink it for today's mass spectators. <br /> <br /> The origin of the apps was a product of its time. In the 1960s, America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a distraught time to inquire and reconsider the social rules of souls. It was a civil rights era, where the parties claimed to be less than a few years ago. In that context, Pota's metaphor was, which reflected the philosophical reflection of the rival philosopher's existence. Pota was an extremely intelligent film that raised difficult questions and had been fairly checking the repression of American society, the white man justified his intelligence to a species that considered him to be inferior. Colonel Taylor (Charlton Haston), Dr. Cornelius (Cardiac McDowell) and Dr. The conflict between Jirara (Kim Hunter) was thought to be both excited and intelligent with fine and clear iron. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, a product was in the sixties as the pot. This is Apes for Dummies. For the intelligent dialogue, politically correct platits are replaced and it is more focused than material, it is JavaScript and Jejon. The 'wonderful' finishing is completely inconsistent and does not contribute anything to the movie, except for a cliffhanger who sits up a seagull. When the original pot ends up, together with everything in a firm scene, Burton's ending just makes fun of the audience, saying, 'I know something you do not know, and you have to wait for a bevel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (although I continue to dislike his dark appearance). However, progressing in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insulting zero scripts progressing for thirty years. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to a giant movie. The band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) are supported by several turncotes and for the furious apps battle (especially Helen Bonham Carter Arri). The presentation is a formula with a lot of violence and simple, suitable for today's fast food mentality. <br /> <br /> Playing mix. Mark Wahlberg is the only outstanding performer, a fine actor. Walters in Wallberge, being played in the role of Suleenia, are awesome, but hard to rush This section is an inspirational protagonist, not a profile of Wahlberg's report. Helena Bonaham Carter is a brilliant actor, whose character is so disconnected that its power is so far below. He strives hard to do anything with an impressive character, but his explanation presents a cross between peace demonstrators and a sick teenager in love. <br /> <br /> then Team Roth. Its a virtuoso performance, saving the film from the complete destruction of single handed. The charioteer is as violent as the helpless General Thad. He creates one of the most terrible and despicable bad guys he can remember in some time. In addition, most of his physical performance, rendering a chip-man is a perfect cast that almost anyone can believe that species exist. <br /> <br /> This picture is a great disappointment. It's pleasant entertainment, as long as you test your brain at the door. I rated it a 3/10 From a technical perspective it is probably much better than 9/10. But the story is an insult to the original franchise. Using a familiar title known to attract throngs to the box office, it is another effort by Barton to spontaneously, so many people can see what he is a genius. Of course this is true, but it will be huge if he uses the talent that most of the film uses to make, instead of the easy-to-use pop-up pop.
