Did not know anything about the film or it was based on a best selling book. It should be guessed from early sightings, best guesses, cemeteries and deaths. It lasted for about 15 minutes when I got a chuckled suspicion that the film was painful. I will not tell you how bad the plot and the acting were, but the person who gave these two stars more than that, must definitely work for filmmakers. I saw that the hero could not enter his cinnamon in the hospital. She came to her suit, shirt and jeans hospital and / shirt. He did not have the right to his honesty. I got the Christian theme, it's hard to miss
