Edison has a nice reason to go straight to the video: it will be landed in theaters with a growing cold. The movie was completely long lasting and dangerously annoying. Just below is a groove (thanks to Freeman and Spesy, who apparently had two weeks left before their next films), bad guys are laughable and act as uninterrupted as the acting of Justin Timberlake. I hate to hurt people, but as soon as he realizes that his fight is good, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all bad ... just the most. I used to think that the LL Cool Junk was one of the shots that was the leading person. She is worthy of it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can work. Kevin Spacy is almost always enjoyable (you can see him often shouting scenes), and Freeman's Flickr has the ability to do three stars (among the ten ... it is not good). When it is said and done, the final flaw of the film is that it is a pseudo-verb PopeCec is a mundane and annoying part that anyone who fails to stay awake. It fails to give any good shit to anyone. All in all, it's just really annoying. That said, you are enjoying insomnia while this rent.
