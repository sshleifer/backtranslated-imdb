This movie had so much potential. Anyone who follows Jeffrey's story knows that many details neglected in this film are ridiculous to it. Dhemar's long-time and effort was spent on the use of homosexual tendency and its use of alcohol. Where was the development of character? Any villain's source is always interesting and Dahmer had no exceptions. Where did the teenager go to the movie while killing and revolting small lethal creatures? Instead, we're supplying a dyeing array of flashbacks that try to explain the source of the killer, but fails to deal with Dammar's main point of growth. Also, the details of why the country was so excited with this story - how did he preserve the body in his apartment and how many lengths he had measured it to complete; His will for his cancer and the flesh, etc. I could go, but there are many loosely points in the movie, focusing on her sex and not enough for the cow - when you hope to see the title "Dahmar", the good thing in the movie.
