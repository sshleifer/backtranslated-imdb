... Not all Disney movies are rubbish. <br /> <br /> However, I have seen "Legend of Bogy Creek" and absolutely love the film. I heard it was 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found this one copy and saw it one night. I can not see how they can create a scary G-rating signal for the movie. The original is a movie / documentary about Foucut Monster, and anyone can be scared. "Return" should not be met for kids and by anyone. I do not remember the plot very well, because I've taken a while to look at it and I will not see it again, but ... these predators are coming to the city and they are trying to kill Bigfoot. Three small children are roaming around to stop them. A big monsoon comes through. The hunter is protected by children, to get hit. Then they all hid in boats and wait outside the storm with a big chunk of the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot came and really made some sick. I do not want to end up ending for yas, but it's not scary. Well ....
