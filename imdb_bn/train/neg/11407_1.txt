This movie is a perfect example of a great book destroyed by a movie. Jacob I've probably ever seen perhaps the worst movie. There is no tale, the plot disappeared, and the edit is awful. It's all off, music sounds straight from a synthesizer and incredibly awesome. Bridget Fonda's acting is decent, but everyone else's acting is completely amateur. I would recommend this film to anyone who is studying to be a producer as a producer without making any film, because it is bad cut-scene, bad change and acting should be shot again! Read this book and do not waste your time with this movie.
