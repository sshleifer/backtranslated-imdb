I was interested in trashy cannon flick in this movie. I was completely frustrated. It was similar to frustration, 'On 13th Friday I see: Jason has taken Manhattan'. <br /> <br /> <br /> then it grinds to a halt. The charming breasts and the mad 80s fashion can not help this movie. This is the only thing living in food in the island of Piranah! I'm not asking for a cow's cannon hallocost level, but I was looking for cheap over-the-top drying gore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , I do not really think it really takes time to take time to do it. I used to show it at a party where nobody is aware of what is happening and you just want something in the background. But I will not tell anyone, "Oh, boy, you see this movie." It's good enough not enough attention to pay enough attention.
