They made this one fantasy, from Mannheim Cassidy and Sundance kids from the Snowy River and meet with romantic touches and playing with the daughter of a very rich girl of high rich girl. All right, there are many stories about Ned Kelly, but there are many well-documented information, still leaving a place for artistic creativity to create a good historical drama. I mean, not the story of Robin Hood, not the Arthurian legend, it is not Boulouf, whose life has spread for many centuries, 99% of his life and time entertainment is not estimated. It's alive just a few months ago. During my execution, my own grandfather couple had already been in school age. <br /> <br /> So it was my stupid idea to imagine this movie fantastically. Recently, after reading Peter Kerry's novel "The History of the Kail Gang", I was hopeful that it would be on the same vein. But not really, Mick Jagger's mockery. The 1970s Kelly was probably close to the reality, and overall a good film that is not telling the whole thing for him. <br /> <br /> It costs me two dollars for the DVD rental! I'll give it 3/10, and some nice shots of Australian shrubs make me feel liberal.
