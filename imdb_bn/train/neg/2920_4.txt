How nice! I wanted to know that this is a small world and we all interconnected. Do a waste of 88 minutes. One sentence of John Dunne puts it much better. "No man is an island." The acting was not bad. The children gave everything to them, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow it and the only real "hero" of the film ended in jail after painting a meter maid. I do not know. I just do not get it. Well good
