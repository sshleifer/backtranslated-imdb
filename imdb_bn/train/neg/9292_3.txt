After all, I also want another hero of heroes - a wonderful work of art for the action genre. I only saw part of the Crowking Tiger hidden dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than the hofde. <br /> <br /> The basic elements from the heroes are available in the hoofids: Great Landscape, Messaging Symmetry, and Acting Acting (I mean, if you do not understand a word, but without subtitles, but you still care about it - it's good acting ) <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What started with political conspiracies wanders into a love story Bad, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. You have three characters, I guess, fall in love with each other - for some good reason The film originally fell apart after fleeing the prison (I fell asleep for about 40 minutes). It's almost as if they changed the author at that time. How the remnant of the movie is a character "like the wind" Ick Also, you have to instantly expand the mistrust of believing in pieces of action set. This is not unique to this genre, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for action and then when the war broke down, it was not really good. In the beginning you are involved, but then this movie just runs out of gas.
