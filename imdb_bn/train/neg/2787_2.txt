The number of Kader (Prince), a singer, his number on the path of becoming a star. Then he fell in love with Apollonia (Apollonia Kotoro). But he must beat his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior <br /> <br /> I saw it in a theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of the prince. I liked the three biggest songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy", and "Dove Cree Cree". The concert scene of this movie is great - full of strength and tension. Unfortunately it is a very small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is crystal clear and long ago - and much better. Subplots, nicely, are badly managed. The love triangle between The Kid, Apollonia, and Maurice Day is so anticipated and tired that I was actually humiliated. His wife needs to beat her father for the story, but the scenes are so poorly managed (acting and directed) that I can not believe it. The script is terrible - lousy dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And here's a lot of misogyny - Kid's mother is being beaten; Adolonia is a child hit and (for some reason) Apollonia Strip and swimming in a dirty river. Williams and Princess characters also treat women in an awesome way. <br /> <br /> where this movie really fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince (easily) I've ever seen acting actors. His empty face and wooden dialogue delivery were so bad that I could not believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scene but that's not really that much. "Dramatic" scenes work so badly and it is directed that they revolve around this movie. They just wanted to make this a concert film. I give this a 2 - only for music.
