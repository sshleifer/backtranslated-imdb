First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What? The world is trying to sell fragments of low budget on TV late in the night due to the annoying, aggressive sick garbage promise that no normal human soul can surveillance. <br /> <br /> What's funny about a dog being hurt, a grandma is shaking his head ... a man is pulling his hand and two girls are going to the bathroom? What is hell in this world that people find comedy in some illness? Anyone who thinks such an element is funny, even the earth should not be allowed to walk. <br /> <br /> But what I've heard is not even objectionable ... So ... they promise to give comedy with a bad trunk comedy ... and they can not even stop it.
