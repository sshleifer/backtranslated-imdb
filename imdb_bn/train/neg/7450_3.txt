I have seen this movie in movies a couple of years ago, and one thing surprised me so nasty that I can not see any freedom fighter in the movie: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman who is not smiling or smiling when his smile and snow fall in his trademark two . Danny Glover was cast as a bad guy, but - again - most of the viewers could not go so far to believe in that land. Also, Jared Leto as a former medicine student was not credible. The killer was not very tense because it was very early known. The last, not the dramatic or the excitement: Anybody around me thinks about what's going on. We could all wait until the end of the movie. After all, spend on a frustrating evening movie.
