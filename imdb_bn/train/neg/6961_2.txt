I agree with this comment on any comments that should be hot with Tiger Lily in this film. <br /> <br /> It should be one of the worst French movies to be seen in the long run (actually with Brotherhood also <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really fun and original idea is funny. Especially in Antônio Deacénance and Gene Rochford, I was very disappointed to see them compromise with such a poor film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> And famous parents can take you to movies but they can not give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this picture, if you want to laugh and laugh then look at the fun one rather interesting LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN
