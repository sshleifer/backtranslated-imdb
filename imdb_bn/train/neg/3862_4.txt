I just saw it. A couple of sunny, but nothing to write about at home. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. (Long) DVD Gag Reel almost completely fits its unregulated smile. Selma Blair seems to punching a time clock, but then, his character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" I guess? Jim Browlin was amazingly funny. (Babs being married can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. Lily Miller, who plays Julia Styles (cheerfully), 10 things I hate you here is also interesting. He was great, but the best aspect of this film was the casting of Julia Styles. I could spend two hours watching the laundry in her house, and I feel exactly like I think.
