Volleyball styles are oddly ignored by most screenlines. Thankfully, the highly acclaimed director Nelson McCarthy came with our best-ever second best volleyball film (less than Side Out and better, well, umm). However, this movie does not cover you. Shotak Holz hit the star Kozi as a modern day and is coming. Using high-tech gadgets like computers that are less robust than my gamebooks, Kozi is able to help FBI agents in tracking someone who does not make any obvious offenses. The film carries the film in its own right, along with other film stars Dennis Richards, Geo Negro's short teenage and a provocative, ugly and annoying girl. Any fan of films like Matrix or Hackers definitely will definitely like shot shots.
