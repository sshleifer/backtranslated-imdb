(This can be a bit unexpected) I want to say that I did not see the whole movie, or I could not do it because in the first hour I was going to be incredibly frustrated. Of course it's a problem, many believe in a great book, and it turns into a Disney Made-to-TV movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great story that children and adults can hook. Plus it's built in quality sequels. But there was no way to go to Disney-Fanning. The problem with the film is that the book was so disrespectful about the changes that they made to the story. It's a complex and emotional story for kids. There was no reason for Charles Wallace to be completely "mentally", because it was the easiest way to explain. There was no reason to write a war among the three Miss W.W., there was enough tension without the story. There was no reason to remove the glasses from the mag ... which was a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg in our book. <br /> <br /> I can do nifty for a few days, but I think it's big things, like the industrial side was off. For example, how they saw Camaretz, seeing his strange dark sky. The laziness in the book is that the camjotage can be the world. It looks like the world. It has people that look like humans. The sky is blue, grass green, and the children are playing. But some close a little off. Instead of sending the lesson in the book and using the film's overall aspect, the directors chose to make Camojotose completely different. Of course the text is that the Camjotage can make the world very well, if we forget how we love. It was so nice that in the beautiful afternoon they are not going to bounce the kids walking down the street with the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> I did not see the end unfortunately. Maybe someone could tell me how Disney finally ended. <br /> <br /> Overall an artistic frustration. <br /> <br />
