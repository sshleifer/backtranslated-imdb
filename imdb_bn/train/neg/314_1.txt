I've chosen this movie for $ 5 in discount book stores, Adam Sandler is a great actor and I think it would be a good movie, not good. There was absolutely no story line, bad comedy, and another comedian said "The F-Word" that he said he would not bother me, but it was at the top. And the study was worse than the lack of lines when Sendler would start talking to the camera in random parts of the movie, it reminds me of the striking Explorer when they look around and look at the screen and ask you questions. And finally, they randomly keep the women's bikini shot random times in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it means wasteful
