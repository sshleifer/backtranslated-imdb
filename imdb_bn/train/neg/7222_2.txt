Several times to see Nike Bilal's comics, I had to watch this movie. I thought it was a great way for the artist to spread the art and ideas to a broad audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! There was a true torture for watching movies. The possible possibilities of the concept ... however, the film leaves a lot of ways to be desired, and basically those who see this movie go beyond the fact that it can do better. I do not have to give advice on whether or not you watch this movie. The possibilities you have already seen that are reading these pages, or you're going to see it - but be prepared for the worst in 102 minutes.
