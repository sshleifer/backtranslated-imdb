After reading the book, I loved the story. I was disappointed by the film that there was a lot of changes. It is understood that although books and movies were different, it was a different story, but only a few stories of name and book remained. Read the book and there is a better understanding of your movie. The book gives you a good development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and you care about them. Location was actually in line with the book's description. Some characters do not include. Television has so great books and stories microwaved, it's a perfect example of that. Input from the author is not always a good movie insurance but it can sometimes help.
