If you value your mind do not see this movie. At the end of our collective philosophy, mine and my friends assume that each of us lost 5% of our brain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I now realize that instead of rebellion, this film has created a deep hatred in me. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people will say that this movie is not taken seriously. Only if it does not take seriously. But it does. This plot is a warm version of the Blade Runner-esque universe version that mixes with cheap rubber suites, which are popular in bad dinosaur movies. The conversation is not only emotional and meaningless but often literally painful. Hugh Goldberg is also not trying, but George Neuburn as the voice of Theodore Rex's voice is like the fingertips of the soul. And when her Juliet Landuya was once again closed as a British accent or Richard Roundtree (Uka Shaft) blastering commissioner, you would be drowned in the growing feeling of incredibility and confusion. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depth of foolishness that mankind can fall.
