102 Dalmatians [Walt Disney]: I was not fond of the previous installment and this was the first weakness of this effort, a terrible story, terrible to be played by Glenn Close, who made every scene hamas as he plays his own entertaining, and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors . Dogs are the only "actor" that seems "real" and it is expanded. Here is another waste attempt. Grade: D.
