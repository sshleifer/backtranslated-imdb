I was "a few Americans" growing up with the amazing creation of Gary Anderson. Thunderbirds was a great series for that time and it made a great move / adventure movie, if only the authors could notice that it could mark it. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be a thriller, but I did not expect to see such a low-end group. Good to be lost in space, this can be both apparently stunning and exciting. It should pay attention to the more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... to save people in distress. Instead, it focused Alan on saving his day instead of his brother (who was cut, though the original vs. the original). The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I do not care too much for the original character, but I'm thankful for the movies. They stole grief! <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed more for higher-technology than Thunderbird's story, even the screen time was not enough even as I was concerned. I would love to see more of the cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
