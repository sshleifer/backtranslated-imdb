Vampire saibarga ruled the world, and using human blood as fuel, but in the face of the lens against Gary Henriques and Android (Chris krisatopharasana) and Trojan Women (kathali Long) of the change of power is a power to be transferred. Daniels (who played the hilarious film saibaraga) to answer all questions without the rest of this awesome film in question is the most interesting country singer Chris krisatopharasanake Cyborg warrior who to cast as much as the idea that he will get well. No, do not get me wrong, I do not kristopharasanake bhijilyanta or anything, but I can see that as Cyborg. Miraculously suspect that it was written for dalapha lundagrenera, but lundagrenera should have the wisdom to do it. However, despite the crushing molding, krisphapharasana easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. Kathy Long in a performance she gives a lot of people and inexperienced. (And krisatopharasana playing robot) kastastapharasana interest, despite a few moments. Lance henarikasena are slimming and Gary Daniel is broken, but the failure of the failure of the Knights. If you fear the worst, who trembled and wept, thinking that it was a good idea to the paper. (This is a film which is fighting for a separate krisopharasana with a byakapyake Robot), in the worst if it is the end of a series, but with gratitude, although it is still not implemented, I still have nightmares about the possibility of seeing an event. <Br /> <br /> * 4 of (bad)
