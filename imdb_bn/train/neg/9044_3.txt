I really wanted to like this movie, but most of it has been borrowed from theft / other work - some of the most painful explanations of the loan. The New York Times review noted that their singing frogs are memorable among the famous Warner Bros. cartoons ('Hello My Baby, Hello My Darlin', 'Hello My Ragtime Cheek ...'). But I challenge anyone to look at Fox / Blue Sky Animated Feature Robots (2005) and do not find the laughable match: The story - a young inventor is growing up, and an innovative corporation distributes all the great invention. <br /> <br /> Citizens cape - Very similar camera corners hold extremely similar futuristic city environments. <br /> <br /> ... Robots ... - Robinson's family servant robot robots who designed similarly, and using both movies <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 90's, in contrast to their entire catalog of movies, which had several clones of each other, stories and minor changes in ethnicity). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to be unable to say the story in their own language, and instead of continuously send flying objects and words to our direction <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > Most of the rest of the movie is cast. Some landscapes look like CGIs in the mid-90's. <br /> <br /> Movies are actually open to open with a classic micky mouse. At the end of this cartoon, we reminded that Disney has never shown interest in innovation or good story - they think that it is a sufficient proof of their quality to get something big on the screen.
