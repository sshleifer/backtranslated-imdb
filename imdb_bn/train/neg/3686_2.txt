I'm surprised that everyone (even the critics) thinks this was a good movie. It was the most cluttered thriller I ever saw. We have a 'bad guy' who wants to be able to do something good or result in a 'good man' (or girls in this case). In this film, the 'good girl' will use her memorabilia and skill to defeat the 'bad people' and save the day and her loved ones. Use charisma, courage, even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? Well, a young girl named Lisa Ryder is showing a young man named Jackson Ripner (beautiful name) at an airport. A compromise leads to the other side and fortune is to combine these two sooner it seems. Sitting beside each other, fortunately all the way along ... There is more to this curiosity? What could these two mean for each other? Do 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounters? <br /> <br /> Okay, as it appears, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him in the murder of Homeland Security Director from one room to another, so that his people can attack him. Oh, if he does not, then his father is dead. While we may never learn why and why the real reason behind this crazyness, but Jackson explains how it is going to happen and why he needs help for Lisa's best help. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats her evil plan with her memorandum and stabs in the process of her neck, makes her travel to the chair, and hits him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and earlier, he was walking on foot through the airport of Miami, where he passed after 911 posts and stole a car which he later used to drive to order his father to be killed. <br /> <br /> Yes, okay <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it's weird that a man like Jackson who can get high-tech surgery, A hotel manager needs help. He could not just tear the bombs in the building? Keeping him and his team safe without any third party? And why do characters like Jackson explain what they're going to do to someone who is threatening? Is not it easy to stop them by this same person? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best to consider the movie given to them. Rashal McAdam and Silian Murphy are still acting. Also, I believe that Jemima Mess (who played 'Love Cynthia') will also go further. It is very bad that they were all stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2
