This is the first bit for me, for the first time I was disappointed with Team Burton. POTA is not a bad movie (great set, dress and great performance), but it can be made by the off-the-shelf Hollywood director. Panning was very weird, the last third was just waiting to finish the film, by myself and Cast. Team Roth is nice, perhaps the only joy in the film. Come back to the team.
