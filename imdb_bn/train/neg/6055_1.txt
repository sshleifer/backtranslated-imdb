I originally gave a rating of this episode - I now wish to think more about it. I wish they had the negative rating option. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I was completely amazed at how wonderful the whole thing was from the start. I love Ron Perlman and John Carpenter ... What's wrong then ?? The episode of the last season was dragged to handle the problem of 13 abortions. I think Mr. Carpenter could create such a gray area this season that you can not see immediately if he is pro-choice or anti-abortion. I sat down and thought that he knew that he was very contrary to abortion - you got this thing most clearly when 'mother' shot the child to death and 'dad' who left his mother while in shock, would die. But you also see it with the character of Ron P. - I think that if someone gives enough evidence to threaten in the past, then issue a ban against them so that they will not immediately surround the police. Instead of protecting us with conscientiously (dealing only with it) I do not think of anything that has a strong point of view, even if it is not something that I disagree with, but I think it Not to stand with that scene, but rather than trying to sit somewhere in the middle <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the politician However, there were issues aside, this episode was not bad. The music was retro 70's and just did not work in plain. Acting (other than Ron P) was poor. The effects were horrible - it was better than just showing the giant instead of showing lum's excuses for a giant. <br /> <br /> All this saying, I am glad they are the master of grasping graduation- I do not think the best mind to sit through some really poor episode to find out. It's a bit like hiring horror movies from the video store - every time you get a good and makes it worth all. I agree with the poster that perhaps the name should be changed from Masters - some of these people are not eligible for title only. (Let me hate this stress too, even John Carpenter has the title, he is a master and through)
