The only reason I saw this is because I found it in the local library (and they will undermine them in vain for inaction on the public), and in spite of a lot of mais and donkeys, I did not realize that the fast forward button was my friend. Dangerous direction, pedestrian camera work, often bad-to-near-passable acting, impressive impacts and one of the worst screenplaces I've been annoyed with bringing life (for example, terribly uneasy and diverted) long, long time. The best smile really comes from the "Making of ..." feature, in which the poor Saps, the HDV mess attempt, is involved in justifying their crippling efforts, as if they were working on something special, instead of forgetting some next week. Wait because somebody wanted to make a little "birdie" headen, with some people, "why the 13th of the weekend" holders! How does this pass, I do not know, and be honest, I do not really care. See your own risk, and do not say you are not warned. This made her sweetheart, craven film at the worst time. For some pretty nude women it gets only 2 from me, even then only.
