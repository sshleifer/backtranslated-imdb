One of these movies was where I was just staying in the bar. <br /> <br /> The picture is quite annoying. What stories are very flimsy and you have to guess at it mostly. The film itself involves itself with fierce camera tricks, which seems to be the intention of creating magazines and it looks like a student film. I said it was boring? At the end of the movie, when all the letters suddenly died, I did not care less because I had no emotional attachment between them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about it. For the first time I saw walking from the movie while acting, but I believe that it could be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A kind of picture that you can threaten naughty children.
