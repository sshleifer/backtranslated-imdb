(Some potential spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not very sure what was thinking about the DreamWorks when it decided to plunk down $ 80 million on this extremely tired and lame animated Flick. They will probably be more than enough to bring it to viewable viewers (mostly family) droves. Well it started working on the first weekend, it created $ 26 million, making approximately $ 38.1 million. Total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the visitors who came in the weekend saw that I saw what I saw, when I saw and they spread the word. This is one of the main link movies, except for all other animations, most of the script seems to be three years old. <br /> <br /> This film is only about 80 minutes Long, but it seems like a three-hour epic. There are some sticking points for me, one of them is a shocking statement, and it is so clearly written. At one point, he escaped from some prisoners and although you can see that the horse is clearly frightened, the commentator pops up (gifted math damton's voice) to clear a wrong notion (which only happens in montsets). Brian Adams is one of the constant pop songs in the song, now I am a fan of his music, I think he is good, but true in Dreamworks, it seems that the audience will be able to handle 8-9. His song throughout this small movie, I certainly would not have been. Finally, and here an explosive, a horse is shot by a member of the horse in the empty area, no less, he (the horse) falls into a hefty river, the soul (the film's focus) tries to save him, but they both fall on the waterfall which is at least 50 Feet may have to drop, but later, in the movie we see that this horse is alive and well. I know it's a children's film, but even a little bit of that reality is not acceptable. <br /> <br /> Collectively, it's really a hairdresser. Brother, I'm not saying kids will not enjoy it, but someone else is waiting for the end of this watch to check their clocks. Certainly this is my top 10 bad list this year. - ** In 4 stars <br /> <br /> <br />
