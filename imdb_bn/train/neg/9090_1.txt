A campaign film for the Palestinian "cause". If you look forward to a biased documentary of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you have to look elsewhere. If you are anti-confined (or just anti-jyestist --- no mistake in destroying a country?) Or uncertainly, in support of Palestinian targets (such as genocide, the destruction of Israel), this is a documentary for you. The college campus near the UK and the US should be for an entertainment evening. However, a wise and intelligent person will be angry with the false numbers presented in this video. I hope those who are not actually aware of the situation are not contaminated by this anti-Semitic neck.
