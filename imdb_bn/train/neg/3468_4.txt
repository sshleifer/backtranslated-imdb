A B-grade actress (A Merciful Deva-Is-Mowly Ringwald!) Has published a horror movie that a filmmaker is trying to produce her mother (a horribly shameless Kylie Ming!) 12 years ago! This is a strange plot that can say at least, since an Australian horror fan knows that this trend is tragic for women's directors. There is a curse on the film because the original set had to kill some psycho killer in the original. But he returned, because he needed exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on "set". Cut is an unusual effort in modern "slash", but unfortunately it can not bring something new or exciting to the table. Actually, it's more than half of Wese Crayven's 90s movie. Many movie names - without a drop called "Scream" (this is not the Australian name-dropping - Jane Campion ... see how it's not funny) and many are "It's Real or It's a Movie" La "New Nightmare." Bad to edit, boring music, ridiculous effect, almost everything bad about this. Thankfully, the film may have a sense of humor: At one point, a disciplined girl from the movie crew told the owner of this house that they are acting in this film: "Do not worry, we would treat your house as if it was our own," which he Responded, "It does not mean anything to me, you see that you live in a dump!" And molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to sue this rented rental. "Have you got any food coc here?" (He's in the film professor's car) And "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" (The first thing he mutters on set) and "Where's my agent?" (Oh wait, that I was thinking for him.)
