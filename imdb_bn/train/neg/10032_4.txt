The storyline was right. Akshay Kumar was always good and it is the only good thing about film. Kareena Kapoor is bad! Her size was so hue and tears on the grime but she did not look good leaner. I do not know why Anil Kapoor played such a bad role? There was nothing to do for him in the movie. This does not mean that an actor role must be admitted badly because of the Yashraj film. Ali Khan said okay. I think Indian directors and producers have started thinking of Indian customers as many intelligent people. What are we Fool people !!!! Do they think they will show 2 men in the SWAT squad on television and we believe in them. Indian police are so stupid that they try to catch some criminals ... they take a whole team of 100+ policemen and there is no one around the palace. The actions were shit and I have not seen such bad actions. Akshay Kumar was shooting at 30-40 policemen in the middle of the circular ... and he fired at them. A bullet of police did not touch him, but he killed all the police. Shit <br /> <br /> I think the war criminals should retire about this scene. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you do not see this movie.
