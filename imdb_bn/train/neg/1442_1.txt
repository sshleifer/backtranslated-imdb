This is the worst casual crap. H. Ryder Haggard's novel is very entertaining and dramatic. This unmanned filmmaker will not follow it closely. Well, the old novels are not perfect and it's a good idea to create their free versions, if they have their own ideas. If someone can do that, change everything and replace them with unhealthy and accustomed clich√©s, which should be with the original. If they make this image at least twice with less bad actors and if cardboard made hats are inserted inside the studio, then it would have been done. Bit has no imagination at all fatigue. These are only bought or watched by the collector of Victorian novels in the film. <br /> <br /> Just do not think a hint, and a mocking, those who read their novel understand what happened and if you decide to watch it on TV what you can expect or - God is forbidden - it's banned Waste the money by buying. The old black magic sorcerer of Gwang book and some precursors of galooma have been turned into beautiful girls!
