I want to keep my reviews small and easy, but this pretty much sums it up. You can not beat the original two for multiple reasons, including Chris Columbus's guiding talent. <br /> <br /> This movie brought horror guides by more horrible acting. I do not believe these people are considered as actors. <br /> <br /> To survive and watch the watch is painful. The story was a complete joke about a secret chip and a troubling search for the Russian terrorists to complete it. Terrible, rent a real tower and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The movie was not set at the time of Christmas. Home alone becomes a moral or intriguing with a chaos from a Christmas time family comedy movie!
