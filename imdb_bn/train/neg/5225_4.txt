This is the lack of continuity of Drummond entry. Most of them are silencing, suspended marriage, etc. However, this is happening in the near darkness, such characters have been an endless series of events from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. Also there is a clear suspect in Leo G. Carrol who looks to even look at. He is a stranger and rather works suspicious, but Drummond and folks do not seem to pick up anything. Nevertheless, it is such a reasonably good action and a pretty good finish. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but Rathbone is like Nigel Bruce in Sherlock Holmes flicks, she is so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine someone with a taste or intellect around her. There is a history behind him explaining how he and Drummond collaborated.
