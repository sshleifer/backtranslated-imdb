I have seen a lot of good Korean movies which are thrillers and movies with dark overtone, but it sucks a lot. The director seems to be a sadist, who happened to get someone to produce some junk The film has no entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I really can not believe anyone making such a movie. Although the acting is okay, the line of the story and its feeling is very awful. <br /> <br /> I'm sure, I'm not going to watch any movie this director. No idea about making movies, and the disappointment of the thriller moment. With all these psychopaths visually shot shot scenes destroy rocks and show more blood and violence, which makes it thrilling. Very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend removing all such films.
