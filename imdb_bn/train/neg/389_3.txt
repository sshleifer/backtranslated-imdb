I learned that you had discussed before Gene Simmons and Vincent Pesto that they would like to see how many episodes are present. Not only was the emphasis on switching the female team for the gene and throwing himself in his sword? And big pussy? What was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" Double episode crap? Mafia sneaking sits silent! The big name voted off just got the money already received for their charity and got a custom designed exit. Hmmm ... this is not the reality but the drama drama! The other show in Mark Burnett, "Survivor" raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay suspended his departure when his child had just some time before birth. <br /> <br /> Echo!
