This movie is so aggrivating. The main character looks like her 35 years old and I saw Scrooby Benpole with more than this guy. Plot twists are so predictable It is not worth watching for the humor factor. <br /> <br /> I also got some of the worst conversations in three years, "go find a small animal torture" <<br /> <br /> I can not even continue, this garbage does not see this trash, it was created within 8 days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main character for drawing a picture is called a phagote dude. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unwanted ones
