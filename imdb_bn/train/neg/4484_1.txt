As soon as I started watching the poster and started listening to the film, I was very excited. The matrix was incredible to see and I could not wait to see the second, especially after other films started watching trailers for it. However, when I saw it, I made the theater very frustrated, with many other filmmakers working in the theater with me. The movie's action scenes were always amazing, there were only very few of them there. In the first movie, the war in it seemed to have started, but the second had many more (and many unfortunate) promotional views. Plot sum, it was not that many were not expected. The purpose of removing the machines was excavated in Sion (it is not a mockery, not everyone sees it commercially). The movie dialogue was absolutely horrible. If you are not the head of psychology, you probably will not understand what is said in the film, and because of that it will not only care about it. It has become a part of a romantic movie, which is the events and events happening in Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as a bad-ass like the first movie, he feels all religious and preacher. Personally, I would not have to pay to hear it or listen to it. The film was a deadly waste of my time, and I do not think I can see the first one. Basically dialogue and constant annoying and dry psychosystems from every character, I quickly lost interest in film and pushed me closer to the edge in the scene of a small battle, and the end of the film closed me directly. What is the end of the movie with "conclusion"? That's how the people come up. I'm surprised if Wachoski brothers have to burn oil in the middle, but they have to come up with that. In conclusion, the movie was bad and it ended.
