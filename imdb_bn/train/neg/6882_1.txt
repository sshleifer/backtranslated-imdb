I hate the painting of Puerto Rican with Mrs Perez! We're not all veto - and we can not speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for uneducated people you run. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is economically good than any other Caribbean island! Am I happy, like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, is free from American influence? Real poverty reduction is not the criteria of poverty in the United States. We are not harmed, we are stable, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestors include strong African roots, but not the "black" root - I do not match with Black America 9 studies). <br /> <br /> Pedro Albizu, Che Guevara and Martin L. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Create Cuba today, why Cubans make their life risky for the full boat to come to America - why did Che make such a good place for them? You had a great, awesome, brilliant idea, but you politicized it too much. We have a lot to boast to the people - do not let the shame of our people oppress us. I'm not a nurican, and probably because of that I can not share your opinion. I'm Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I'm not a victim and I have achieved many goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - the history of less politics is the victory of more stories - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damascus Maldonado
