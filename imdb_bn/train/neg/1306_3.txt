(Ur: Demon III) <br /> <br /> Made in Italian TV but shot in English and it can not be a signal in previous demo movies. It was simply titled, The Ogre, which released director Lamberto Bava. <br /> <br /> A family in America rents Italian villas for summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has a fearful dream that this little girl was going to the old wine-solar of this Villa and this cocoon-shaped frame hanging from the roof was faced. It glows and covers in cobwebs and has what to look like hanging spider or insect legs. It drips looking like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course husband does not believe in any of this. The villas are just old and creaks and makes a weird cry in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears to be something like the 16th Centaury costume it looks like a wolf head and it is attracted to Orchids's fragrance. <br /> <br /> These movies are not really bad, and at least the dialogue is half-cute without ridiculous weird phrases. . There is no real force other than a rolling skeleton in a basement pond that is actually displayed under a modern swimming pool. After being managed by family zip Cherokee, the OGR only goes a long way. <br /> <br /> I saw the copy of the Mridade DVD was flawed, with the film being black for about a second for a couple of seconds, an error that I hope Srik has corrected since. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava, where he explains how it is not a seagull, etc ... Other Shakeik DVD releases with some trailers. This pretty standard stuff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
