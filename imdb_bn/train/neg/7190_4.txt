The 7-inch 5 Ive Plot is a cruel phone game involving children of college, which unexpectedly throws them on top of their heads (if they do not have terrible fans). The 7-inch 5th story, on the other hand, was a horror movie which was a small promise, sadly, he got mad by writing bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of the shameless, old-fashioned childhood slash has begun with the false beliefs of his filmmakers, the viewers are slowly watching one glance, The film is crying each other for most of the time. Each character on the screen is a different type of young holes on the screen (except for a police detective exception operated by Roger Hour) (in a minor role to add the only star power to the film). <br /> <br /> Carrying a complete shoe film for male and female, black and white, straight and gay, shallow and curvy college kids. Bad, because a party has gone to the satirical story with the game, most of the time these scenes are completely filled with this little ***** DS.

Wonderfully, the throw of production is fairly capable of throwing. It is not that the actors are not capable of expressing realistic human emotions; A brief overview of this moment, along with the screenplay (new adventures Vashan New and director Hooks, who played far better than the camera). <br /> <br /> 7 inches 5 I can rarely recommend, her familiar premiere and a few thrills can not overcome the bad taste behind a story run by a mask of unexpected characters. In this intelligent honeydew, the real mystery is why one should take care of a group of young people who can not like each other.
