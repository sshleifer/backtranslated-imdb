Firstly I'd like to indicate that my younger sister always knows the show due to watching it. I find it the most annoying program in TV. There is nothing funny about 'jokes' and the laughter of cancer is unbearable. Shown will work much better if a live audience is pictured in front of it. In this way, smile will show how to show 'irrational'. But I give credit for acting talent of young actors. It makes me sick, but I think they will come back to the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. Show links with overall annoying voices and the style of CBBC presenters. Why today's youth need to scream so much out of me? All that
