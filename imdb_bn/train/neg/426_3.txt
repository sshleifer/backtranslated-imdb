Do not get me wrong, the movies are beautiful, the stunning shots, and the elements dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I was very angry with what Disney actually did. <br /> <br /> BBC Worldwide was on the planet and many more. It was fine. It was an overall feeling of balance and displayed the whole circle of life and death. There was tragedy and win, loss and profit. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> There is no editing of the Earth's Disney. They tried to make it a movie that Americans would talk about. They made it dramatic. They kept one on top of musical score for our frightened. They make predators worse. They made evil of the WALRUSES. They showed face to face as negative. It is doubtful and tries to be successful, but the cost of balance reading. The film was one hour and the negative painting level and only 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I am for everyone to prevent global alert, but it was on top political and environmental junk. This is another topic, I went to see it on the big screen, but was frustrated by the quality of the photo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good lesson, good sound, and (if you have a Blu-ray, good photo quality) .
