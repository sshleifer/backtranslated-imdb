When I first took this photo, I was excited about the basic idea and I would love to see what would happen. I love it when I'm an animation fan and successfully merged with live action footage. However, I enjoyed the animation of this movie. Although it must be said that performance of the actors was excellent. Visual appearance - with animation co-pieces gave a nicely unqualified air. However, it is visible and unfastened between the scripts both overblown imagery, lost quality, that you were practically hammered on the head with. This was the most annoying about the significant lack of critical plot. It seemed that this plot was disciplined at irregular times throughout the junior, which gave a stouting effect to the widely dispersed fragmentation from the flow. The voice over from Felisberto - especially one at the end - felt like a great effort to fill the gaping hole in the platform, in which the entire beat thing was ignored as well as well as well (and even that was not the proper maker). I'm scared that the whole piece is best arrived, a 'reasonable first attempt', a teen who has spent a lot of time in DH Lawrence. Do not expect what you do from the seasonal filmmakers.
