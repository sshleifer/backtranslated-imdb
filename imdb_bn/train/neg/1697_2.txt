I have everything I've ever done with David Lynch's best fans and the hotel room and the 2 hours Twin Pix movie that has been made in DVD. So, when I came to know about it, I grabbed it quickly ... and ... What is it? It is a bunch of black and white cartoons that are loud and turbid. Perhaps I do not know what's good, but maybe it's just a bunch of clues that were open to the public to earn some money in the name of David Lynch. Make it clear to me that I was not worried about the language of the idiocy but the word was to be adjusted so that my neighbors could have it. All of this can have a very frustrating release and possibly remaining in Deluxe box set as a curiosity. I highly recommend you do not spend this on your money. 10 out of 2
