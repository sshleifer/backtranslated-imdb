Irene Dunne finished her extraordinary career with this so much movie. She should have gone out with a bang, she was an extraordinary actor, this obscure, almost unknown film. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is okay, but there is nothing special. It gets quite stupid in the second half as it gets much better in the first half. Maybe Irin could see and leave handwriting on the wall. Even his high patching voice got a little annoying here. He was not happy with this photo rumor! One can see why <br /> <br /> The story reminds me of 1950's television sitcom. While saying this, I think David Nelson was in the film from Oz and Harriet TV show but it became very young Richard Kerna. He saw and sound like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Overall, so the best and a sub-actor ended for a great actress.
