Here is a review for people like me. This movie sucks from the beginning. I threw the popcorn on the screen and began to give myself la la MSF 2000 entertainment. The plot hinges on the event and depends on the fools who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it can happen to him that he can not happen ????? And she's rich ???? And he is a famous psychologist. Come on, man. Whenever everyone is assembled to talk to him, he enters the bar at the easiest moment ??? It was at such a stage that it seemed like face-to-face and semi-decorated movie viewers. Rain will humiliate people. I acknowledge that I hate some people's meat eating habits, warriors, and maternal conversations with tenderness towards furry people. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic But I will give it a shot. It is not supposed to be true words guessing. I do not care. It's all about saying the same thing. Mamate can not create letters; He can do whatever he can, through the various actors, constantly fosters his voice on us. Its actor is no wonder any wooden woodwork They are all confused about being the same character. (However, his subsequent films make progress.)
