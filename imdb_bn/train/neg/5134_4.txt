ScarECROWS seems to cater to a botched horror supernatural film. The Colombian camp hijacked robbery robbery like a pawn in a pendalton. They demanded flying to Mexico, and a helicopter carrying a pilot who was kidnapped by his daughter. Along with a way to decide bailout with greedy robbery landing in a cornfield monitoring by unexpected looking scarecrows. These are not horrible of any run-of-the-mill ... they can kill. Acting is not better than terrible dialogue. And humor trying is not funny. Very low budget and shot in full in the dark. <br /> <br /> Cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Sims, Christina Sanborn, BJ Turner, Phil Genderland and Victoria Christian.
