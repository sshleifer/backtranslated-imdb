I think after the break out of the trash, all the newspapers were surprised at how the barbarian Streisand took the film for the year. Well it could not have been for many years; The drama was only opened in 1975, eight years ago. It was created by great actress, Thow Feldshah's Broadway star, who probably played this movie, but Nuvo ... Great Star Barbara wanted to make his way. And with less music! This image starts from the end of the total disaster. For one thing, when Barbara was aged aged she made it and she looked every minute. Perhaps someone could not swallow him as a young girl interested in reading Tor. And then she gets the camp when she dresses as a boy. I think Straussand can not be disrespected, so he played almost with make-up; She is as prettier as a boy as she is a girl. And if that is not bad enough, the poor woman will always be in the care of her classmate Avigadore (Mandy Patinin, whose best moments are her nostalgic shots) and her drunk (Amy Evving, who is a little sleepy routine, a little bit of her normal sleeping routine). Resorts and he does not know what he's doing). Intel goes far too far to marry the girl; I will not be bothered to mention the "wedding night" scene. <br /> <br /> then there are music. Nine fully-forgotten songs, all voiced by Streisand (probably a look inside her mind), and singing as annoying and annoying at the fingertips on every blackboard. <br /> <br /> Streisand does not show a glimmer of commitment as the manager here; Some visuals (especially behind the patentins), and have a good eye for its balance. The problem of this movie is that he will not be out of his way. I did not believe in the title role for one second; She was never supposed to add songs, and all the mess above that goes for two hours and fifteen minutes. After fifty minutes I was sick of the sad sad world. <br /> <br /> terrible, horror, terrible.
