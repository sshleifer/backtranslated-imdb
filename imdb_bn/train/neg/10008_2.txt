The film is bad. There is no way to say it. The story is weak and old, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what "Walker" will be really careful. I felt like I was watching movies in the 70's. The matter was not reliable for 2007, even in DC. I think it appears to be true for others who saw it, such as worship was low and finally it was fast. Most were not for question-answer. <br /> <br /> I do not think that Scradders are really thinking ahead of time. The scenes began to grow in a small way so that they would never end or know without ending them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you are trying and guess what is happening. I'm not really Woody's (Carter) personal life or boyfriend. What were all "artistic" male slavery and torture pictures (from Iraq prison)? What is he thinking? I think it was a bad attempt to try to create this dark personal subscription life for Woody's character (Car). It does not work. It does not seem to feel truly sensual. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this picture was the Woody Harrison. She shamelessly played her character (car). You got a great feeling of what could really be "Walker" (say 20 years ago). She was great and probably will not be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> For Lorraine, Lily and Christine ... annoying <br /> <br /> <br /> do not see it! It's painful! Until you get a true Harrelson fan.
