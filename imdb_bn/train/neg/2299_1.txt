Before I begin ... tell me that I have full faith in God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Kay is now out of the way, I just want to say that what these morons in the world call themselves "host" are they doing ?? The last time I checked the host, did not behave in a discriminatory way, the TV does not spread hate rants, or the unfortunate spirit that drives the channel, tries to throw away its own beliefs. These are all crazy, stupid, conservative, bumping of the Bible, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson every day. I am for freedom of speech, but since it covers a person who most often says that if you stop the way of his ideal life, have you sent directly to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion causes problems of SOOOO due to many problems. One day in my class room we had an alternative teacher so we decided to show some TV because the education did not give us any work. And we saw 700 clubs against the wishes of many (of course, many of us), must of course be involved in the abusive Pat Bible and are engaging in the Bible, and he said, "God said homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a child " OK." WTF ??? Sincerely, if the host is trying to think of another's sexual orientation as a huge sin, they must take the host, tape it, and drop them from the cruise linear between the Arctic.
