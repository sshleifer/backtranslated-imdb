Karl Pope played JJ, a newly encouraged food critic whose astounding, tolerant mother came with her. JJ, at the moment of the Aggaste event, then the owner of the business Alex Blackmail blackmailed his mother's entertainment instead of reviewing his "death" restaurant. Alex is definitely warming up to his mother. There are many problems with this movie, characters are universal 2-dimensional JJ is a self-service, hateful character, her mother is superficial and shallow. Magazine JJ colleagues are violent and convenient. More than 50 women are unable to make their own message without the support of men, bad, bad, BAD Actually dull, uninspired the script. New York City's settings only save movies for mercy. I would not recommend this film so.
