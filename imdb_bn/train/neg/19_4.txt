I'm a big fan of Arnold Vslu. Eventually he saw him as a star of a recent movie, only a little part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I admired the film in college and I did not like what I can say, the image was created in a deserted area of ​​the city and there was no background traffic or hidden loos. <br /> <br /> I say that the actress leaves something that is desired, but Arnold is a wonderful actor. It has to be frustrating in a frustrating way and some of the supporting cast might be preferred. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vslu, and he made the film visible. Otherwise, I wrote it as another laughing film. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but lastly the actors were pretty good. But the sound effects out of the shoot were quite bad. There is some consistency in the film (continuation) but considering the low-qualification of the film, they are neglectful. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this image for everyone, because it was in Earned Vossu. <br /> <br /> Jackie
