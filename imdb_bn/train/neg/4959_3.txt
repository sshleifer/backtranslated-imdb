Remember the best Ol 'animated Batman show from 90s? People who appreciate that? People of all ages who can appreciate? Batman has been shown as batman rather than a batsman instead? What could be your relationship with villain? What was the villain with the true purpose? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. So this draws. <br /> <br /> Truly, these people know something about Batman? Have they even watched a Batman comic before? Do they understand Batman's "detective"? Putting 2 Formulas together does not make you a detective! This makes you a little clever monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the main format for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin stole something. 'Opening Security'. Batman is where he finds dead bodies. Batman goes there and get into trouble. Business Batman finds out the obvious / stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes Penguin did something obvious again. Batman follows. They are Kung-Fu (by everyone, and I mean that nobody is known to some of the others). Penguin of the Batman Punch. He got knocked out go to arkham. (Note: This is usually a different villain for each episode) <br /> <br /> Just as you noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "The clown leave this piece of cotton candy on the joker, perhaps he's the oldest amusement park"! Yeah, maybe he was there 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I've already mentioned this but everyone knows Keng-Fu! Even Penny! Where are they thinking? (Probably from the Jackie Chan animated series that made it) <br /> <br /> Is it really annoying that the show is the only step? No memento None. If Batman needs to think, he will use technology, then do some kung fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, do not forget villen. Finally, will Batman be without his funny gallery? <br /> <br /> First off, I would say, Cundo for the basicity. I do not think the other Batman media joke and the terrible closing monkeys, an emo-like radler and toxic Ivy like small (which is confusing when you think its sex is not meant) is its main strength? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Man-bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with some obscure reasons. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. why. <br /> <br /> Looking at a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But most shame is Mr. Fridge. <br /> <br /> Do you think Emmy Award? Winner of Batman's 'Hit of Ice' episode: Animated Series? Who is Mr Fridge aiming for his crime? Was the episode so good that it was used in its original background (crazy scientist) comics? Is that a target, with a victim? Heck, even Batman and Robin admitted that, p. Oh Movie <br /> <br /> This series is called "F # Sync" and frozen a jeweler robber before his accident, only with the wealth of his mind, then frozen and able to cool him. Then he was stolen by Johar for no reason, when he said, "line of words like an ice day". <br /> <br /> Perhaps they saw Batman and Robin later. <br /> <br /> But hey, look at the bright side. This series does not mean anything to the villains, which means that you are a good person. Good for you
