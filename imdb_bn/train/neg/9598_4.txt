Robert Columbia has two full-time jobs. He is known worldwide as a global broadcasting TV reporter. Her exploitation as a less well-known but equally endeavor is her full-timer. <br /> <br /> I dubbed 'Vivro Dual Vivra' with the title 'Live for Life' in English. Some lives! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a woman came out of her way, one by the way, and the wife of cheating at home. It helps Robert a glib liar. Among his most useful lies, 'I'll call you tomorrow' and 'My work took longer than planned.' He spent a lot of time and money in the air, train and hotel rooms for the legacy of Liaison. You will be surprised when this guy gets caught under his pants. <br /> <br /> Some people may feel his life exciting, but I think it's tiring. His wife, Catherine and all of her attractive and desirable women. But her lifestyle is so violent and she is so treacherous, she thinks she is enjoying these things <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> There are no divisions or extended sections with French only conversations. We see interspersed war, torture, and soldiers training tutorials with live action. When Robert's flight comes back from Africa, we wait and wait for the taxi and taxis in the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Anne Giddaradat is the standout performer in this movie. Hers was the most interesting character and he played it in perfection. Candice Bergen looked good at the start of his career. I'm basically unable to find fault with Yves Montand's performance on what was left an inferior. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques. Pans around the camera room as a hotel room scene, Robert and his ownership reasoning. We catch their eyes a little while passing around the house. In another scene, a sleeping car was placed on a train, while Robert was lying on the top, while his wife was down. Robert gives some important but annoying news to his wife, but because of the train plate we only hear her part. I thought that his wife was unable to absorb every word because of the news's frustrating nature. I liked the exciting Safari scene in Africa. Seamatographography of the scenes and those who were fantastic at Amsterdam. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project of the Library Congress. I've done the project fifteen: 50 of 50 years have forgotten a significant movie. As the best I can determine, the film did not video, broadcast, or distribute anything in the United States after its original release, which I identified as forty nine. In my opinion, it is deserved to be available again. <br /> <br />
