Jack Black can usually make me sniffer easily to breathe, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Instruction, writing, lack of plots, constant mugging (inspired by constant on helper and direct camera shot), and a. Average of batting 050 joke, it was still a silent waste of time. The idea is thinking, but what has been possible losses due to the lack of comedies and the worst side of the side I saw was wasted. <br /> <br /> I portrayed this picture of Mexicans very negative. Although it is no doubt true, I do not really want to call this movie a racist. I think this is a "creative" group trying to find something deadly. You can hear them crying behind their cameras: "Hey, it's a weird Mexican!" /> <br /> The absolute charge. When you reach it, it is someone who has spoiled good money and time to see that these harmful refreshing beans should be offended, IMO
