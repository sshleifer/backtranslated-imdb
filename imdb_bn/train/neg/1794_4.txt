Not your standard vamp story, here's a bram stoker or anne rake. A real original vampyre story These vampyres do not bother those genetic mutants who sunlight. They are pure evil <br /> <br /> The image is not perfect. There are many obvious amateurs of actors. Van helsing games and vampyre chick are quite good at those who lead the rally. The film is fierce and violent that can disturb some people. It would be difficult to understand a lot that is loaded with scientific knowledge and may be annoyed with. I have sold cute performances and good performance in the couple. Can not say how successful this media should be and if it is big budget, it can not be distributed to a public
