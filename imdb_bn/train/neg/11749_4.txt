Phil the Allian is one of the fun movies where humor is based on the odds of all instead of the actual fifth. <br /> <br /> At first it was very weird and very funny, but the movie was not like progress. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget movie (it's not a problem in itself), some interesting interesting characters, but eventually I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this movie will now apply to Steiner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> Somewhat similar but try well "brother of another planet"
