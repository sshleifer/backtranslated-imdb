If you want to see a picture that is curiously shot, weirdly engulfed, this man's (and a woman) unexpected story, who enjoys wearing shit from each other, if you want to enjoy a story that goes to these two people No, one boxer and another gay man, then you have to see this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I often got hurt badly and started spending myself like a director. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the plot or for the great acting, it is a horror and a movie of Gokh in astonishment. Many like watching an aircane accident or a train debris. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie, a good movie, a "B" movie, or even a medieval movie, this movie is not it. <br /> <br /> To those who are watching this picture An alert, please do not eat before. You might want to be mad at the end of the photo.
