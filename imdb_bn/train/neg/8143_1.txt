I had a different dissatisfaction with this film at the 2006 International Film Festival of Vancouver. I had attended this festival for more than 5 years, and of course I saw some poor films. However, a brand new reaches in 'First Bite' movie. In spite of being shot in beautiful places, occasionally, pretty well stopped with excellent food, as long as the movie did not, I was begging for begging. The lead actor, David La Hey, failed to show any character throughout the film, which initially featured a great chef. Additional sub-plot, such as eating disorders, developed so badly and did not completely fit the film in any context, they did not fully fit. <br /> <br /> A theme of the mysticism was used as a poor effort to achieve nothing, to conceal a movie, go somewhere, and completely frustrated.
