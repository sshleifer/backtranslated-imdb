Now look, I will not lie to you, but I received this photo from friend $ 3.99 because it was Danny Firth, the lead singer of the famous popular metal metal band "Cradle of Firth". I certainly expect her superiority of violence and pride, such as Mr. Firth can be portrayed in the plot line <br /> <br /> But dear God, I was so wrong. This movie has serious bites, big time. A low budget movie (Wake up, wait, create zero bootgag), it is probably the lack of special Howard Stern Orchestra musical score and Spillberg special effects. No, it's a camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> See for example when our star and violent fiend, Mr. Firth, violently killed a mugger. An occupation of the neck, and the blood spits out, but oh my, there seems to be a juice packet filled with fake blood on the human shirt. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> My final comment: Stay away from it well. It is blood, pregnant, breast, and hey, even an ironic story to go with it. So if you like scary violence, no voice is near (yes, there is no sound in this movie), then buy it all the way. But if the shoddy movie is not your thing, then avoid it. Do not waste your money.
