If the movie is a wonderful experience for you for the first time, but if you have never seen "Moving Picture", then you will think of this movie as the god's child. But if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney Dinosaurs, then you will not be very impressed by this film. Dinosaur Heck Barney is more realistic than Flickr's dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movie. I just saw this switch "The Giant Gilla Monster", and I liked that movie better. It works as a B movie. It's good to encourage the real litter giant like the Lammar Dialogues, hockey acting, the influence of cheeses and the monster! Carbon 3 not only packs a b movie punch. It's something gorgeous, and that Polchek guy comes close to something funny but this movie, almost .... flaccid. This is a little engine which was not possible for dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you will not watch movies. <br /> <br /> Some people may feel dry and enjoyable with wheat sheets. If you are one of those people, give this movie a shot.
