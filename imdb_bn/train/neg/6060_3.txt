This girl is there and she is walking in the forest but she is standing at the clinic of this woman and she wants a miscarriage. Her father is out of a van and she is all angry about it. The whole episode takes place on the abortion clinic and outside. I'm not really pro-choice but I wanted to choose this episode. I laughed laughing while the baby came out. The part where they worked ultra extreme was very funny. I feel really sorry for the poor parents of this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and did not really blame him for what I did. I do not know what has happened to her or what happened to the other dad and the girl waiting in the end. I just smile very hard and I would recommend watching "Choose Me" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode but it was not that great.
