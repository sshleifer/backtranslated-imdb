Everything about this film is hog wash. Cruel acting, horror dialogue, ugly native girls This movie sinks into confusion !!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must be a holiday bender. Robert C is completely lost and there is no source of what is happening. The worst of college kids. No acting talent at all, very foolish reasoning, and right down right dumbbells. Special effects for birds. The so-called security forces around the park are on the ground: stupid, with guns, Walkie talkies are in vain; And a computer system with a roll of toilet paper that is The park is under construction and nothing works; Why bother to invite prospective clients until everything is complete. The writer must be the first victim of the mess with the producer and the crew. Other planets include a septic tank shot to see the whole picture. What a gem Convicts have to see it, so they can commit suicide.
