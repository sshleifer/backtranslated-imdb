Maybe it's not fair, because I only gave the film halfway. <br/> <br /> Terrible acting, camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is simply unrealistic and chessy. For example - during a Coke contract, Coke is kept in a briefcase only - I'm not an expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it is above the word 'crunching' above and they use the sound effects using the toy guns. <br /> <br /> Most Bad movie
