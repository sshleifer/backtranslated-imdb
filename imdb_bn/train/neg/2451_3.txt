This movie creates more strangers than I saw. Really, if you're a Tokyo fan, rent it just to laugh with your friends. I can not seize the billions of millions of mistakes ... I would say that the movie (whatever it is for me) has lost the main point of my favorite character to make Sam a fool fool. Shame, shame ... 3/10
