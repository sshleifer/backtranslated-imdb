Although more than 180 films have been selected, this 'Sukubus' is often named as the best Jess Franco film. Heck, even legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang, mentioned in his personal preference 'Sukubus'. So, maybe it was mine but I thought it was a horrific boring and very confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and Janine Raidood performs an SM law on stage. It is unfortunately, all downhill from here. The character of Reynaud is a maneater who finally killed some of his lovers trance. Franco works with a nice budget and works well on beautiful locations, beautiful photography and a musician musical score. If it is not for loud and strange stories, it can be its greatest movie. It seems to be psychedelic, but I say that Sophomar is a good word to describe what it has been shown here. At half time, you have no clear formula and not exactly what has been said, even the smallest running time of 80 minutes seems to last. This is not my best film in French. I would not even suggest it to suck the die-hard fans. If you are looking for a higher Jesper Franco movie, 'Las Vampires',' Dreadful Dr. Try to get your hands on 'orphan' or 'female vampire'.
