I wanted to like this movie, but many elements destroyed it for me. Using full and sticky editing of fussy lenses did not make me feel like living in moth, but it reminds me that I am watching MTV for a few minutes. The movie never seemed to go anywhere and the acting was really a wonderful example on the acting. I like movies that give us a glimpse of the weird underworld, but this picture can not decide on the worse serious comments on the horror of a bad movie or addiction.
