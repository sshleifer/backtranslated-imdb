First, there is no mistake in studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. There is nothing wrong with making such a film for trying to present the gospel message. So my capability of this movie is not his sincerity or desire. As a Christian, though an atheist, I believe that there will be a big misery and I believe that the Christ will return as much as he has said. So I disagree with the film's disapproval, because I do not pay such a low rate to this movie. <br /> <br /> No, its movie's sincerity or its message will make me so low, but rather its lack of production value, terrible scripts, moderate acting, and kind FX. This movie is mostly with the majority of Chassis CC sheets of the 1950s. No, this movie is out there with Plan 9 of the Out Space space. This film has failed well in the age and probably it was determined by the time of creating a sequel. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse Generator Movie producers can not learn to make films from the last time, but they failed. Learning from these non-left series, the Apocalyptic series and the Omega Code series failed because they solved the problems of FX problems and dated issues, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting woods. <br /> <br> There is a great budget with great Christian movies, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the crew of MST 3 did not lampooned this absolutely.
