Stephen King's short stories are mostly gems, original ideas that do not take long to develop; Basically thin and meaningful - sets them to a harmful number of pages quickly, you read it, and you know that it's over before you start. They are similar to a carton of McDonald's fries - they really taste good and you know they do not have nutritional value (again from literary point of view, they do not say anything more about the state of the public), but you still go to scarf, not just a pig And go for extra-size extra and fill too much Grease ("Greets of the Great" King's novels The metaphorical metaphor of the prose is not enough to read one of them and say - pop-cultural observation or just enough with cute Yankee acids - take the story already!) He wrote four books of short story collections. I have read them all from Nightshift, everything is over, and they always show the skills of their expertise in the form of their skills, which are sometimes poor people in their tome-size novels. <br /> <br /> But his short stories do not exceed their reception ... which brings us to nightmares and TV adaptations of DreamSpace ... <br /> <br /> How are they going to hell (series producer) usually 15 pages Turn on average stories of 50 minute episode? How do I say - two words - "Stephen King." The stories with their names are probably not cheap, and enables more than one-half hour of more than one hour of advertising, so ... a 24-week episode booklet doubles in length, and twice the amount of commercial time ... Q-Ching! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste the time of enriching the plot of these stories - this review reminds you that you've already read stories and / or saw the show; What follows is my response to TNT which is presented ... My assessment of ten percent (first to worst) in four installments: <br /> <br /> Battlefield - in no way classic, but hey, William Hart How can anyone argue this episode without any dialogue and open its trap? And the tongue-in-neck references and the destruction of Zuni puppet killer from terrorism trilogy, I knew this mission with producer (and the author of the teleplus author, Richard Mattanson). Fatal actions were done, but at the same time, fun. It takes more time than going to the heart's apartment, but it seems to have fulfilled its purpose. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Umani's last case - William H. Because of Messi's performance, initially liked it. I think the author / Umni will soon be present in the Private Eye / Umne because he knew the true reality of the real story and the King knew little story (probably half of the audience, if not more). Chandresakesk Setup was due to obstructing the author's reality, so let's go ahead with it already, and the tricky and tricky hard-to-reach reporter 'cut out the private dick beta. Once the author / Umani's family tragedy started, I thought that the show has created a mental connection that feels sympathetic to the audience (at least), real life, trying to save Messi's suffering from the sensational use of his imagined creator, life <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, after the twentieth century, I screamed on TV I was ready to do - OK, we already got it, younger brother Mega Mena Genius Pradigyi Extradrinna! We're telling Ron Livingstone a camera ("Time is going out for me" - not fast enough, I thought) that the young quiz child is going to discover something really bad for humanity - we know it because he has already made an aircraft but almost died because he A tree can not run it from the path; And, when he taught his chemistry, he had flown his chemistry lab (if the end of the world is only under the supervision of some of his parents, he can be prevented). So much time was lost for Henry Thomas's uber-genius, when we finally got the solution to his discovery - the end of the world through unknown images - how can we see the earth "ending"? "- A reporter begins to forget about the cheap video shot that he's reporting, and the short announcement of the verdict comes in hand." Oh, and my parents' old singing and singing. "My story is that if your story is really" totally messy ) "About me, I want to see the" mess "because it goes to flames and crashes and burns. Talking about the end with a whimper To say, actually, 2/10. <br /> <br /> This episode has completely stopped me. I was happy to reach the hotel, playing assault and ticlail, lunch time and taxi (which was half the episode ), If they end up in the end, Crouch cools down the episode during the end, but it is tragic, it was not only horrible, it was practically ridiculous. Cat ... Wait, it's rolling around ... Oh my God! Look at this scary eye! Ahhh, they could cross the long road in the light of day to illustrate the crowe and order in the night, when you find things that might be strange When you see them in the shadow of the night, it can become a scanner. But I guess that did not have enough shoots in London that night. On this page, tourists are not scrambling in scary places and this is a scary story about scary things that may just hide around the corner. The only terrorism in this adaptation was guidance and acting - who were really awesome. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Overall Series Average (so far): 4/10
