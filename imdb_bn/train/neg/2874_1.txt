This movie started quite irregularly with women bound and mentally tortured. Male full front nudity, parts of dead animals, nipple licking dogs, ladies losing control of his bladder All shots of a gray cold color. Effective, but a little more. Then we continue to see the history of crime and the history of crime and the crime history of the BT. Tensions are completely psychological and killer scenes enter their victim's home and talk to them for a long time and it is unclear. Here we can not see fancy or good imagery, it looks like a shots with your home camera. It does not look horrible, but it is quite unusual for a criminal to be busy for some time before killing his victims and it is quite unusual and cool. This movie does not really have any drama. There are few police scenes in a while, but there is no excitement for the killers. There is not a lot of pressure in this story. It can be a study of an effective psychologist thriller, crazy. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with actual slaughter footage. It spread throughout the film and suddenly got up again. Sometimes you do not know it coming and do not have enough time to look away. And that I must deny I'm on the horror movie for the lowest budget, but I do not tolerate animals suffering. It is unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. I'm glad that Liongate publishes any content that no one else does, but they could edit this film or animal force. Stay away from this garbage.
