Aggressively trashy karate / horror thriller graphical loads of serious violence and gratuitous nudity, and a thoroughly annoying and bizarre "plot". It will appeal to low and low-grade entertainment, which is particularly strange, but it is frustratingly bad and I must admit that I was not indifferent to this fact. (* 1/2)
