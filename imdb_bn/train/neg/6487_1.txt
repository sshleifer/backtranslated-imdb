Well, thank you so many Disneys for destroying favorite memories used to use the favorite movie in my form. I was about 5 years old when I came out of the original film, and it was one of the first films to be shown. So, now I'm 16 years old, and feel a lot of jokes, I decided to hire this movie. In this way, I was able to poison all the memories of the original film with my apologies for the movie. This movie takes things that make up the original boyfriend and ends up in the end. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate their daughter Medieidi and show them everyone on the sea ... Broadway style! After the number of musical instruments ended, in a few minutes, the seafront saw Morgan and threatened to kill Melody unless Tridon left thirty. So, he gives it even without a fight. Eric stands shaking there, although Ariel introduces how he uses the sword and can save Melody. Morgan escaped, so Ariel and Eric decided that Madonna would never be near the sea until Morgan was caught. <br /> <br /> Well, some notes will not really happen. Eric is a total wuss. She really has not managed to do anything. Ariel is not something to sort. Melody manages the screw handy. Plus, animation is a new low point for Disney. Air fight with computer graphics backgrounds. The single opportunity for character development is wasted. Blow the song. Look, do not waste time. I am sure that even little children are getting bored with their skeleton, because nothing happens far beyond anything exciting. They do not want to sing. If you manage to catch a copy of it, then throw it into the sea and hope someone does not find it. Ever.
