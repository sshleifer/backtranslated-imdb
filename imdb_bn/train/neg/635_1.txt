Luis Renaar received an Oscar for his performance in Good Arth. Unfortunately, its role is no need. He did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luis's character was then a slave who married Paul Muni's character (he did extraordinary work for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but their role was very convincing. I hope Paul Muni has received an Oscar for his performance, because Louise earned it for his Oscars. She must be a successful actress, method first in the method. This is what Hollywood feels like that often. Al Pacino played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luis' performance as a needy lifelong, and when he died, he did not change the expression from an earlier scene. She remains the same throughout the film; He only changed his expression or passion twice. His brilliant performance was so subtle, I think I do not see it.
