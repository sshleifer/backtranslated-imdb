Although cast is not something special, all works well, the story sounds like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist; So what's wrong with that? The special effects are really bad for getting started (if it's made in 60's), but it's just no excuse for the scene in 2003 as poor for it. It makes me laughable that the DVD cover is highly proud of 'Special Effects of the Zipper Creepers'. <br /> <br /> The second part is weak, this picture is not a summary of the story, the devil (or giant type creature) soul of a doctor admitted in hospital should be severe or frightening; This is not simply so. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty poor movie, though portable and sometimes hilarious, it's still probably the best left. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
