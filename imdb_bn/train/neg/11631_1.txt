Today I wrote this review on the Uvi Bol and the anger of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> 911 changes everything. It changes our perception of security It changes our understanding of human and human evil. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, death and destruction out. Films such as this movie and its films create controversy in front of the filmmakers and critics; Most will be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has shrunk to a new low. Even less than the low-brutal barbarians who suppressed the most barbarous acts of brutality and cruel cruelty. It's all Uwe Boll behind. I am very angry in this movie. How disappointed they are to the lost family memories? How dare they brave the courage of the brave men and women, who risked their life, who were trapped in leaked towers in the wreckage days of ruins?!?!? How do they try to ridicule as well as capitalize on a national tragedy of a mourning and tiring post 911 world?!? How to ... dare ... they? <br /> <br /> Those who have this glory also see this moral mockery, I say with my energy this heavy heart: Remember. Think again about that day and ask yourself as a wise and moral person. Think again of that day, ask yourself whether this day is disrespectful and disrespectful to the lost life. Think back to the days of family families that concerns the family. Think back to those days of those days lost in those two planes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Remember We respect the memories of missing life in 911.
