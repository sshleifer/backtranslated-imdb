My wife and I really like to see the stupid horror / sci-fi movie and see them with our friends for a smile. We have seen it at fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it is a good way. Everything about it, acting, camera-work, story, dress, just cheezy and low budget but it makes it so well. I think in one scene the actors actually looked like walking in place. I really hope that the person who created this movie was not serious because if they had it, it would only be sad. If you just want to see really stupid horror movies to have fun then I recommend this one.
