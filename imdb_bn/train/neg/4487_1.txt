As a fan of science-fiction films, I was aware of the Matrix since being released in 1999. From a little bit I will allow people to tell about it, I think it is very original and sophisticated. I am Alice in Wonderland fans. I can not quite think how I miss it when I released it. With the upcoming release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> Frustration was too big. The matrices' consistency (the controlling device against the movie) was tricky. Parallel world's philosophical premises, alternative reality shop shops. However, I could still buy movies in the film as a fiction, if it is firmly in that style. Unfortunately, it has become a standard, "Do they or they will not escape, will break, save them for the rescue, etc." To make things worse, it turns out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts movies are actually two different types. Pure, one or another fan, does not work in two blends. It's like mixing science fiction with romance. You do not have both one or the other, but the same movie is not both, nor at least, the same movie is not the same amount. <br /> <br /> If there were such problems with the Matrix, the Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problem. At least thirty minutes of the film was the sequence of martial arts or chronic car-chase. (This observation ignores the question made on the basis of negative reviews of every professional, film: If the New Superman can do the thing, why would it be annoyed in war? The answer is definitely the theater of young, male population groups.) Then there is a "love-free" approach. The plot device was worn by Richard Wagner almost a hundred years ago. It was actually well managed by Die Gutterdamerong. <br /> <br /> So those who leave the Matrix are reloaded. Martial arts fans probably groaned through trite, but argcan sci-fi philosophizing. Why do scientists fanatics suddenly sit in a fun and funeral. Most of the viewers are probably disturbed by the stupid romance aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> When you see Matrix franchises movies, what are you seeking for your profit: science fiction, martial arts, or soap opera? Not every one bit for them, much for them, each for each afficionados is not a satisfactory film.
