This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba parks and the "Wild Western Canada" which was left behind was again brought back to the world. When Archie began to write his story for papers; That day was the idea of ​​destroying the desert and transforming / exploiting the people of the first nation. <br /> <br /> The image goes forward and asks; Why will an educated, clearly talented English become an Indian? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie as a living picture of my "Cigar Store Indian" photo, it is very woody and not real - it is very well played in Mr. Braunson's part. He portrays wild Indians in the dance scene for tourists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gray Ole-Canadian Canadian Native Native Frontier But Myself is both well-done. I saw a documentary on Gray Oil and I think it's a good big screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> - I thought the final scene to meet the Archbishop Grand Council of Chief was a great moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Very nice Canadian Lake scenery and the original "Gray Oil" position. <br /> <br />
