So an old security guard and a man died and then Kevin, the world's largest war. Kevin wants to influence her incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virgin girlfriend AMY She returned from work ... a random house ... she found her "friend", sexually misleading red short KYLE and really rebellious sluttish DAPHNE. They soon joined Dafen's boyfriend, Trigger-happy sex-crazy Machuoula Lankhede. And the title creatures, have terrible little dogeared dolls who kill people with their heart's will. Kyle's heart's desire is in spandex, in line with a horrible, lucky woman. Nick's heart is to throw a grenade at grade school cafeteria - I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat a skinny waist with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgraceful whore. Daphne is already a disgraceful whore, so her heart's desire is not there. Really a really violent band with the way the song is really funny. Hobgoblins go back to where they come to fly from then randomly. "Citizen Why" can not hold a candle in this truly great piece of American film.
