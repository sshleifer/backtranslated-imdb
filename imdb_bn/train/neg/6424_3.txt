Be a broken photographer and his agent (Tom Wood and R. Gross) is forced to stay in an auto storage facility run by a terrible and awesome manager (Ron Perlman), which they come to believe that the serial killer is being terrorized by the city, "Costume killer "(The name was named, after injection of the victims with Windex, he dressed in their stupid costume ). They firmly believe that his life story will create a great movie and Miffitt Wangby will gather a group of filmmakers (John Conindin, Joe Pantioliano, Crusty Swanson) and discover that the filmmaking industry may be killed. There is more to this movie, but unfortunately it goes to the admin room floor and it shows that (studio studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our losses (and the actors, who all work well and deserve) because it is made in an exceptional black comedy, but it only grows in the middle film. <br /> <br /> If you're a Ron Perlman just get the price for its performance. His comedic timing is wonderful and has a great opportunity to give some great impression (he said in the Halloween movie that he will need intervention when he goes to Jerry Lewis mode). She's just fun to see this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> David Duchess also played two graduate (but staple) roles.
