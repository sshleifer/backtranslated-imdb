This is a weak film which has trouble crunching and renaming problems. It does not work at all. First of all the drama is wrong. It is very slowly moving first and then early and unsatisfactorily to the end. But there is an uncomfortable moving in style (and that could work with cuts). It starts with being a thriller to face and becomes a stomach instead of irony. The finishing may be fun, but it is so stupid that I almost felt that it insulted my intelligence (whatever it is). So the film tried to be everything but did not really succeed at any stage. You can see that very unsteady character development. Connery plays one rather three roles as you get an impression around.
