Oh my, where started ... this movie was just awful. Writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing in this movie is that it laughs me! I was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly did not get that! I did not think it would be fair enough. I've seen many bad horror movies. Actually, my goal to watch my horror movies, even though they are not terrible. At a stage in the movie I commented on "Blood of the Syrup" and in special features, they admitted that it was a syrup (brand name die syrup ...) in this movie, there was all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer, Stupid moves) but it was completely lacking to do it well. The authors will take some classes or just give up!
