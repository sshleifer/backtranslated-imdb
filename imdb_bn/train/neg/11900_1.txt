What a nice Yet another movie about America that has been visited almost half-a-dozen times here, a piece of a day, and believes that he thinks himself as an "expert". Sheesh. I should return to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as "Nazi Land" or something like that. WIM il boy, you should combine with Lars Von Trier and make the latest movies about Americans. Of course, we all know that in order to create a "real" film about America, we need European "barbarous" leftist worldwide. <br /> <br /> Yes, all right. For a continent that did not begin for two world wars, Europe has confirmed that there are many opinions about America's wrong "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> PSS. Do not worry, Wyll Boy Boy, UC-Berkeley has lots of Americans who just like your movie. Of course, this is the same person who thinks George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and an image of soup cancer "Shear Genius" !!
