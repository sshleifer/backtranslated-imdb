I got it as a Turkish movie and I was not frustrated. Acting - While others are in other movies, it is clear that they wanted to work hard to do this bad thing continuously. <br /> <br /> Plot - As soon as I'm generous, I can say that the script writer originally started with a plot, but neglected from him would be good. The Chinese broke the pledge when the computers were broken <br /> <br /> - The nature was now hated. It has failed to flow with any rhythm or cause. The majority of the lines by the letter was the best suppression of imbecilic. The script works hard to be able to think of a character as memorable. I saw other movies where the additions were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Directing - If you can not copy the style of your favorite manager with your own capacities, otherwise you will make a failure like that. It's good to know that this photo is giving 10 stars to your friends / family
