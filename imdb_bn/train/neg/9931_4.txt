With the June Vincent, "Black Angel" is a small key, trying to rescue her husband from an electrical chair as a woman, when she is convicted of killing old contacts. Dan Dury (the husband of the murdered woman) decided to help Vincent find the real culprit. As a suspect, Peter Lorr has an ungrateful role. This film looks like a cheaper programmaker and does not acquire anything special, dramatically. It is quite happy but after some time, it maintains knowledge and makes the solution of mystery bigger, which gives me the "pause" response. That finishing alone could completely shrink the film, but before conclusion what is not very good. Vincent was not very good to play a scary heroine and good guys good guys. I love noirs in the film, but this one was a real disappointment.
