I got lured by the title ... I was expecting an insightful and playful journey into drinking, instead I got rather annoying and uninspiring stories about a terrible scam. <br /> <br /> The leading character is not given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify poetry such as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was embarrassing because the story was good, an excellent effort to illustrate the internal feelings <br /> <br /> The sad fact is, the general idea seems to be even better, "I'm the way I am, I'm on the same path. " And in the lower class class, ludicrously bad attempts to make some kind of poetic edge worse make things worse. A fast fix reeks from the exotic clich√© of "Poette maudit", a dull movie seems to be smart, artsy and meaningful in a cheap way. <br /> <br /> But "16 Years of Vintage" is very smart, artistic or meaningful ... the main character does not always develop, and the weak attempts of change fail without good explanation. Initially, the initial attempt was made of blue. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> Jobon gave more importance to the artistic aspect of the story, and neglected the others, we had a movie that was happy with the eye but inspired the brain.
