In the late 1950s, a very small entertainment British film about the German Police Commissioner He feared the ghost of a joke that was killed under SS under Hitler 15 years ago. The ghost comes back and wants that his murderer wants to live with the Jews as a Jew, he must be killed for those murdered. <br /> <br /> Oo, German police actually knows the name of this ghost because she did the last thing before she died. He said, in Jesus, 'kiss my ass'. The policeman did not talk to Jesus, so he asked all around until he found the meaning. The 'kiss my ass' has impressed that everyone involved in the murder, the name of the trick, the Chingis learned someone and remembered. <br /> <br /> There are some men killed in the jurisdiction of the Police Commissioner, and there are some helpful sources. The men were killed with a set of knives missing from the local Butcher. The commissioner announced that his knives were absent while the Commissioner was in the shop to get a lever and onion sandwich, so the commissioner was suspected. The first man dies while loving the Butcher's wife, so the suspect is suspected. But the slaughter maintains that if he kills everyone who sleeps with his wife, then he will be very busy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that he feels very good nature He was just in a light car accident. I can only assume that it is a British movie and it is known for being a very modest man. He used some of his material from his study-up routing, and I could not find it very funny. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 4 because it was just stupid. I was supposed to be a little more serious than it was. The film has proven to be the mystery of the murder (where it came from?), And it seems that Chingis was more supportive than that. The film gives me a little look in Jewish culture, but it was only skin-deep. Do all Jews love lever and onion sandwich? Do they say 'Shatup' and 'Masuguan' in their daily vocabulary? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the center of a Jewish community in Berkeley, CA, and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not completely gray or white. (I have no gray or white hair.) We had 18 people and after the film they used to stay for about 20 minutes for the film's discussion. There are two major concerns expressed: 1. The film was very light-hearted and could not understand the seriousness of future generations, and 2. Holocaust survivors are dead, do not know what will happen to future generations. I thought this second concern was ridiculous and I told them that they do not need to worry because there are lots of literature and there will always be people who like to watch movies like me. The murder of 6,000,000 people by a very bad man will never be forgotten. I write this last paragraph because they accused me of telling others about that day's experience.
