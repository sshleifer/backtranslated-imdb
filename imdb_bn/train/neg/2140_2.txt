The Assassin Hauser (John Cusack) mission is threatening the Middle East's oil minister, whose name may be Umar Sharif (Nikov) in the country of Turkey in Turkey. Hassar's trade shows grow as a producer and go to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a mockery may be so much that it will be very annoying. Here's a lot more: Government, politics, music, war, people are not usually accepted by society, and I've mentioned "war". And, we have here - a very annoying movie that brings life to the border of a very bad nightmare. I'm still asking myself why I continue with the DVD. Also, there are many cousins ​​family members that John Cusack simply feels embarrassed by the family, or is he just me? <br /> <br /> It was a cousin film, when a little offabout, in the end, was good. Not here. Believe that John Cusack put his hand on writing and production in this world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Possibly. It takes too long to set up the hit, which is basically forgotten until the last 15 minutes. We already have all the nonsense banners in cast. And, chemistry between John Cusack and Misha Tormai? I do not think so, but you know: boy ?? Girl thing ???? And they need something to take more time. Yes, what they were supposed to say, (Offbat and annoying) Duff's performance and Kingsley was good. However, when I saw the character of Dan Icod, at the beginning of the show, sitting in a toilet with a dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank. I was not wrong. I'm sure someone would praise this effort, but if there is still a rose by another name, then there is a mess. ?????????? <br /> <br /> I remember why I am continuing with the DVD now. I hope the story will be out in a way and save yourself. Have never been <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
