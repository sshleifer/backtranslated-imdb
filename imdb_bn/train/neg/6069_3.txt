It does not surprise me how it can take a nice actor and misuses him in such a movie. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood actors, but he could not even save the film. In fact, his character is similar to that of Cape Fear, which was really good, but I can not stand it even though the performers can make the same skilk of multiple films. I believe it gets old, and that's the case here. There is nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipps looks through your characteristic baseball player, and its pride. De Niro plays a blind fan, but his role in this film is less amusing than the other. <br /> <br /> However, De Niro is in this movie, because if you are a fan) he sees everything bad that looks bad. But see De Niro at its best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cap Land", even if you go back and see "taxi driver" or "godfather II". Do not waste your time with this drill. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
