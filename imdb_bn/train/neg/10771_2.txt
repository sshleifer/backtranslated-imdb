For some years the children did not see the films, so came out for the first time "Hey Time Tigers" missed. (At the age of 70 I made arrangements for the film, "Warriors", "Man Who Die King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" etc.) Now I try to check out the old films or short films and, despite being less in great movies, I want to find them in my career. Just a few minutes after this movie, I could not take anything else and wanted to see if I was a young actor in the film and saw something bigger than that - at least I would be interested to see his appearance as the plot and acting are not working. Let's see, I've been credited as an electric gaffe in the name of Weis Craven. He has already made his first two or three shakas, but Freddie Kruger did not create or created "Scream" films. Maybe he owed a favor and helped on this photo. Fred J. Lincoln was cast as a vague character in "Wonderful" film. 70 years ago F.J. Lincoln, appeared and produced adult films. She was associated with adult spoof "The Ozporns", and not only delighted in that titled fun than all "Tiger" efforts. The fact that an adult actor has been setting up a children's cinema can be an indication of how this wheel has been sleeping.
