I can not find al pasino I see him at Godfather, Scarface, Carleton Way, and I think I saw one of the best actors of the past 30 years. Then I see him for two bucks, Sunday and revolution, and I wonder what the man is thinking. <br /> <br /> I stopped the revolution a few nights ago, and I thought I'll invest the next two hours this hour. Flash a news here: Want to talk to the prisoners? Be sure to keep an eye on them ... they will accept something. <br /> <br /> I will not reshoot the plot because I do not have any logical plot, but it happens during the American Revolution and the passino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to be involved, but ultimately does it. Although he has no money, there is no education and dresses like a cave man, very hot Natasha Kinski does not fall in love with him because of any kind, because he has only two minutes of dialogue. Instead of "Al Pasino", acting in this movie "Al Smith" has destroyed his career. The scripts were awesome, but the abstruse performance of the passino and the obvious mesh accent makes it even worse. Donald Sederland's role was ridiculous. I can not really describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but the movie 5 likes to like. Actually, no one is talking much about this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous generation in this movie is how to run each other in the battlefields of Al Pacino and Kiskski. It's a starbox like the full north east. "Hey, you're here to meet again, another milestone 100 miles away ... to see you after a few months". <br /> <br /> I will give a star by this IMDB, because there is nothing here for a negative score.
