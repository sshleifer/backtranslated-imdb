Very disappointing movie based on James Mikeen's novel. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando's performance was even worse. His southern drill was ridiculous. When I came to visit, an elderly woman spoke like a gentleman and I saw myself smiling. Brando, so great in previous movies, here a sunny stock is reduced. Tiren Power in "Prosecution's Witness", here should be nominated for Best Actor instead of Brando. <br /> <br /> US government and Japanese women deal with racism in US movies <br /> <br /> Brando was rock-full throughout the movie. When he found love with a woman in Asia, he proceeded towards the opposition from this relationship. Seeing his thoughts and speech, it became difficult to understand how he could help new ideas. <br /> <br /> Only Jehovah knows why Red Button and Miyashi Umki helped Oscar support for their performance. Nothing about both performance was equally impressive. The appearance of the Umikei on the screen was brief and no part of it was depicted in the picture. This film has a good performance Miko, who showed interest in Brendo's love. He showed great passion as American opposition to finding love with Brando's character. Hugged her with the sadness she had with her face to defeat her father and brother on 11th of the first world war. She realized that her dance did not survive her life beyond this existence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Ten Commandments" to the first mother of the mother of interest in Hebrew mother Jacob. Ricardo Montblan had lost his performance together. Patricea Owais as Brando's first love, showed her performance depth and consistency.
