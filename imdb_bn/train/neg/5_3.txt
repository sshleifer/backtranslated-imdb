I essentially skimmed through the movie but the plot was enough to catch enough of the clock. It was boring to me to tell the truth and it was not understandable in some spots. The only reason I saw this movie was to see Chess Crowford! She was very hot, but this movie was the weird kind of her hair. But still hot. However, despite having hot chats, this is not really made for the film. I think this plot is not bad but what actually threw me was that they were hooked like every sentence. Is it not difficult to express your anger, is not it always the word F? Drills were boring and in full blaze, the camera vibrating thing gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> Although the plot was okay, I found the film on a bore and dramatic. That's why I only spent in scenes with CHACE. However, until LLL is not valuable to hire, I'm a die-hard fan of a certain cast member like you. Oh yes the cast was hot. Girls were hot !!! But chess is the best!
