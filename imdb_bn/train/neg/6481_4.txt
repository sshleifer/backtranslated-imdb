Since I was young when Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies, I was curious about her signals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Little Marmod2 is initially targeted towards younger children, because it is spontaneous, reflecting a child's own perspective, the music seems to be animated and less dramatic and broken to the last. <br /> <br /> Little Marie 2 begins when Baby is presented to her family by the mailerie. Without a scene visible to help the drama, a giant tent catches the child. I laugh, wait a minute, not funny, the baby is being attacked! OK, I'll stop laughing. Because of Morgana's fault and her spontaneity, the crime took away the possible drama because it was very fast. <br /> <br /> Melody seems to be supernatural about this feature, which I imagine most kids themselves. This quality of Melody's character evidently came out in the end when he killed Morgan without an inch of fear on his face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melrie has Ariel's problems in many contrasting ways. Queen Ariel restricted him from the sea like his father, and King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Both Ariel and Melody are rebels against their parents. <br /> <br /> The first song is more emotionally running. There are a bunch of lyrics in this sequel, but many orchestras did not go into it. It's great for young people, because it does not take an orchestra to influence them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and up. Sequoil is a bounce song and everyone ends up drinking water. This must be targeted more towards the kids, because the end of the attempt and you are flying away, these are the last pages you are thinking, "it's time to repeat!" Finally, this movie is fun for kids, so we should make fun of them.
