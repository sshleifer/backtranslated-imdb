Well, here we have yet another opposite reverse film. Despite rejection of the gender reversal, there was much value observer. However, this is not one. In the previous review, I think that in the late 80's I made my point about the general fall of enjoyment for the haym movies. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> About the 'only girls' of a high school boy (Cori Heim) who dressed as a girl and joined another school, tried to avoid the bully. He joined the cheerleading squad and made friends with fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicol Agart). Obviously, he can not hold the sheets for a long time. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a complete quiz, and it was not funny. However, judging by most reviews, it's like a fan of Alanis Moriset or teenage queen, like Nicole Aggett who want to see it. If you find a heme feature (or role switching comedy) but do not see anything more than 1989. It's a helmet carrier tank.
