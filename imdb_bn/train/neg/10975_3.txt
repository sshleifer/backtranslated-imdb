This movie hit - now it's straight up. Inside this scene there are some scenes of gems but no one can break the fake plot. Colin Farrell looks like "12 monkeys" like Brad Pitt and works the same way. I usually hate Colin because she is usually a fairy but she is right in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie- = A child who threw stones with a windshield of moving cars and another with a difficulty. Let's face it - there is no emotional idea about what the movie meant to say or where it wanted to go. The characters in this character are connected to some level, but are not eligible for a script. The whole thing is weak and dot and then there is a occasional OK. But overall - as long as you can see the signs of Irish, do not get disturbed and you can see medievalism and it is retrieved by everyone who sounds like LOOPY CHURCH LF - which has become an American film that has successfully turned into some real movie.
