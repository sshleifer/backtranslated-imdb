This step is about bad as they come about. I'm obliged to give it a 2 for the scenery, however. There are many memories in the southwest, including the Monument Valley, one of the most exciting places in the United States. This is the most popular, starting with John Ford. Actually a scene with Chris and the girl was portrayed in a place called John Ford Point.
