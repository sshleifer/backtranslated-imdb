I admit, while coming to the age of Hippi-Deepi, I am a hunger for such films. I can enjoy much more than the "normal" people of the hippie genre. However, this movie is incredibly dangerous to everybody. <br /> <br /> Every imagination of Hippie's fascination is presented as a gossip, when he quietly carries a flat land and kills a short long hair. This movie is so horrific that it is not even funny to see it as a cave on the extras of the hippie drone. It's like the left wing version of Dragnet, except for professional actors. Only because I gave it two stars because there are some ambiguities in the soundtrack's interest, as well as I could not find a selection for negative adults. <br /> <br /> No actor, almost any plot, shiz, even a script ... you've got it, an "art" movie .... all done at the slowness of this root canal drill, just fill the time of each False view drag. <br /> <br /> Imagine the weird wrapping industry of life, the star of the movie "ineffective" joins a commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his colleagues was killed and sent to jail, in which case of suspected weight loss Was killed. "Accident" ... and just think, he will have to leave this legacy .... Oy vey
