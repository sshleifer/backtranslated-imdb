After the success of "Paris, J. T.I.M.", a group of managers decided to create a similar type of acetylgy style film together and based on New York. Contrary to the original film, the story of this film comes from time to time and seems to go very fast - when you feel that it is reading a story, it has ended in many cases. And, often start and stop and then start again - with the story woven together. As a result, a story is complete and there is no title for it to formalize the structure less formal. <br /> <br /> Sorry, however, "Paris, JT" Aime "was hit or missed (mostly in case)," New York, I love you "was missed. The nature of the story can be very sexual but very sweet - and often quite terrible. It was a wonderful lazy and unintended movie with only a few exceptional stories - and perhaps it often seemed to be more frustrating. Now I realize that it was a good quality music, but its great voice really started to spend my wrist! Among the best stories, a young man who told a girl in a wheelchair told the story of promotion, the couple were talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though it was in the first movie) and the crossover old couple It is so sad that I loved the first picture so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respect what I have tried, but I just do not like it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a recent movie, it was unusual for our smoking anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get a DVD, there are additional two sections that are not included in the movie. Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool Fedora) is a hotdog ... and there is absolutely nothing for about ten minutes. Another film that spends a movie that illustrates the world's film - with a very sad couple.
