While West James Arnesh became Western, this film went on to become the worst Alamo film of all time. The story is terrible, all of it was wrong, and cruelty to boot! Continuous four winds are cast. Does anyone catch the cannon sequence? Mexicans were stupid enough to touch the fire of thornbush, perhaps possibly mud and Ramrods were trapped outside the tube. Come on! Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer will be away or something. Or just from their mind!
