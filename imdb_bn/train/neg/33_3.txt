This is the greatest thing of all time in the TMNT franchise. When I was a little boy, I came out and I thought, because I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> I remember this scene when the Mafia Appe forgives him, there is. It's fierce. Many fans hate for a series with female turtles, but it does not bother me. I did not even think of it until I read about the show recently. Above all, it is sad to forget. <br /> <br /> The only song was theme song. Happy happiness, they have it ... nanana ninja ...
