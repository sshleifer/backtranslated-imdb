Tube Hooper made a great movie, so I was sure that it could not be a BAD. I did not read any reviews and tried to see this strange humorous movie. Sometimes I used to laugh, sometimes I used to fall asleep, sometimes I almost crow for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I've rated this 3/10 because its "Awful" of the 1990s and there have been many fun or fun things happened. I was thinking about the film "They can not just add anything else to this movie ..." but they did. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is what kind of a firestorm arter clone but genuinely 't It is based on that idea but all that is This horror, comedy, strange religion / theme of the subject, funny ghor, simple effects, drama, horror, incredible script, etc. And more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Story: The ultimate weapon by using nuclear power or something trying to create a government and fails, the child during the process was born for 2 tests. After birth, after singing in the mother's womb, both husband and wife get burnt and it is a consistent combination The government tears the whole thing and puts the baby in the other people ... and after x years the child grows up and understands that he is born for a cause and he can burn things with his own brain. Then everything does not understand anything incredible dirty. Actually when the government realizes that "he can now use this fire thing right now" they take him to a normal hospital, where he is going to use this man's nuclear toxic element. They can kill him, or they can not shoot him! .. and arm, I suppose that's enough to say, I promise 100 more curious things in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want a good smile to see this one. God
