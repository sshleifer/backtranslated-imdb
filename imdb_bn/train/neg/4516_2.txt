I bought this DVD, bought the scene disappeared, and I did not want to. The script requires some serious revision because it is considered to be a feeling and full scope of scandal compared to the book. The light is awesome, very incomplete, but if it was that I could ignore it. The scripts do not pay much attention to the letters ... it is not a identity in different characters that it is difficult to separate it (especially in the air - no idea who dies). <br /> <br> I have long felt that the key to a good movie is to reach the audience to take care of the audience; If you do not have anything then you have nothing. There was no focus in the letters - you would never know them - they did what they liked ... what they did and what they did. The series is divided into 5 hours long and 6 parts. I'm surprised at what you've done all these times if they do not elaborate the letters --- they put plenty of fillers in it .... I spend at least a whole hour watching their land and say they will turn off LOL on their plane (I really need to see again and again over we ???). I have given this a very high rating that they just had to improve our knowledge of the letters.
