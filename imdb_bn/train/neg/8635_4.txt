This is definitely not one of the best flicks of Lucio Fulci by any stretch of imagination. The plot is quite bad, the millionaire has been killed and his spirt calls for finding his daughter. But the biggest problem to me (in 10 minutes of watching the film, besides killing him as well) why would anyone take care of someone? The father (whoever asks her for help in the girl's help) makes it difficult for anyone to kill him, it becomes really big for the father to have him. But someone does not see Florie Flick for a real story, to do this, to write incredible scripts and to play, a porn observer will see. Generally, his films try to compensate for it by adding too much of Gore, but there is a lack of this film. If you are looking for Floral Flick, check out the bands.
