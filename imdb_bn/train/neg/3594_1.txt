This is not a horror film, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, which will be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, terrible acting and annoying music. If you only see the trailer you know enough ... it is shameful that such things are available in VHS or video when not many good movies are available. If you like Vampire then try Italian Gothic instead of Hummer Productions or Mario Bava and Antonio Margarita. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. Ratings = "1" too much! And believe me, I'm not alone in this opinion.
