A real, truly terrifying Canadian-German co-production, wonderful Roshna Arquette plays an actress, whose daughter's daughter again defines the word "Problem Child" - the child's fall on some high-rise and mom's children before the "act" of her father's murder. Now he is moving to Northwest United States, but his child still has a problem that he is loyal to his mother. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Mandy Shaifer (as a daughter) is more murdered than a man - she gives such a horrible performance that she will be able to get rid of. Check out the film, though incompatible with script, vague, and insulting music (for the first time she shows her bikini-clad bod); We are supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails in both quantities. Almost completely boring and even humorous is not bad enough (Archbishop and Schaefer do not really believe in a mother and a girl), all of Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prokovo's condolences, both of which are far more deserving than both, and both (especially Rosanna) sitting in Farragot The only reason for this is <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not three hours later, "false and murder"
