We all saw some unending epic of our time, but this one really tops them all! The film is so long and so slow, that when things go from the perspective, when I enter it, I feel much more than leaving the movie hall. In the length of about 4 hours, it can be made instead of a tele-serial. <br /> <br /> What starts as a committed comedy, gradually lose its speed. Nikhil Advani has created the plot of love story 6 and he can not judge any of them ... there is no connection between them and the links displayed in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to add to the story. <br /> <br /> The situation gets worse by the Songley dialogue (mostly repeated in Hendrik's film over the years) and stupid cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not understand that she really wants to play her role rather than just glam on the screen ... The complete exclusion of beauty except acting skills. <br /> <br /> And then the high-pink Gobinda and my face-twists-good-gym - the carrier's non-living tears, who are already living on top of their lungs to disturb tired visitors. <br /> <br /> The movie is a good part of John and Vidya love story and excellent acting / comedy films. But they are so good in their role that these two couples can only support this film without blurring with the other color cluster. <br /> <br /> My guess - the director was making two separate films (may be more!) and some beginner assistants mixed all records outside of a record. Sort them out, so the director was left without any choice to display it as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> If you want to test your patience only see it !!!
