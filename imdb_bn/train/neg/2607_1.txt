I recently watched this movie and like it is weakly similar to the book. I blame this in poor screenplay and direction. Some parts have been forcibly opened (gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. After watching the film I actually read the book and after reading for the first time after 20 years or so. I found it difficult to read and some fatigue. Many useful ideas have not been introduced for any benefit ... except for the exciting part of the time. For the least say during communalism, in the elements that are considered 'sensitive', I can see the majesty produced at that time. That's nothing else, or maybe I see something different now or both. This book makes many efforts to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a shrinkage of scenes that give some ideas for reading the book. Even this is a film that is hard to see and should never be made.
