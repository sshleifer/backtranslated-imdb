First off, I want to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like her other movies, but this movie is like my summary. Never strap biggest sack Initially, Chris Rock played an ambitious comedian, who was scared at the stage in a comedy named Apollo. When riding on his home, he saw this woman he liked his way home from a gigabyte, and was hit by a truck. After a while, he chose an old, white, and selfish millionaire body. Then, he was dressed as Outcast Music Group, where he tried to retry the scene from the original location of being jockey. Second, he returned to Apollo and tried to be a joke, he tried to stay in his previous body and began to break the white population and tried to be black. Can you get my drift? This movie is terrible, it tries hard to be like the original and the process comes out like coming out. Just take my advice, do not even watch this movie.
