I had relatively low expectations before the TV movie started. Because it was created after the final episode of the series and most of the series has largely gone. There are no presidents Sheridan, Delan, Leniar, Londono, Vier, Gakar or Lita. If you think that, on the other end of the series, the regular B-5 has gone permanently without the jack, the crowd and Captain Lockhey. Now for this movie, they bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 film) to join Jack and Captain and Doctor created a brief and irrelevant look. But due to the old chemistry, this picture has already been severely disrupted. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a solo hunter (Martin Shane), which has taken 5 Babylon to search the world filled with earth. The soul that has been stolen from an hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of wonderful mumbo-jumbo stuff happened but the truth was that it was all pretty stupid and unmistakable. Yes, yes, the station almost blew but was saved and all but honestly I was told it was "a suit there that has been there" - and works that much better in the past. "<br /> <br /> The second plots supplied for Comic Relief were even more interesting, because an entrepreneur had installed a Hollow-Brattle and what the commanders could do about it was not sure and when they tried to stop their stress Then they were flushed with a suit, it was fluff, but it gave a few smiles - some other flashy plots were certainly lacking. <br /> <br /> By the way, Shane has done a good job to play Hunter first - with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery.However, he repeatedly fall out of character throughout the episode. This should be shown and should be corrected. <br /> <br / > So the final verdict is the death of B-5 nuts (like mine). Others might guess that sucked the series - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that will leave.
