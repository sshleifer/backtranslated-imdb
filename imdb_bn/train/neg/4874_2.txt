Not too bad did the animal or Eddie Murphy say something was saying. This movie is just soft. <br /> <br /> kids movie? Well, if you are trying to get them a persecution, then it may be. It's not funny, some of the impressive poor animals, just 90 minutes of lip animation. And lip-syncing looks better than comparisons of older bugzilla movies. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" is a stress-free delivery that puts distressed drops on the edge, which is painful to experience. Apparently, he is trying to change his old manic personality, but what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967, this re-imagination, or whatever it was lost. A city wants to blame some wild animals and blame them for doing bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can do psychology with them. There are no surprises with some fascinating jokes with some amazing jokes. <br /> <br /> Rent a '67 image. Or some old yogi beer cartoons.
