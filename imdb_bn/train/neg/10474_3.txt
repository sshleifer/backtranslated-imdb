The omega code was a synergraphic contradiction model. A bit of good acting (but little to valuable), mainly two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise the condemned acting was bad. The plot line was rather weak, and only partly already based on suspicious biblical explanations. Of course one of the best of the year.
