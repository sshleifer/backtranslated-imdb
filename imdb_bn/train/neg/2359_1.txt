It seems to be the last Freddy film (and it's been for over 10 years) - you think they have tried to get a better movie. But they turned out to be the worst in our series (and saying that many). The plot did not make any sense (I could not remember it seriously), all the main characters were stupid (you really wanted their dead) and Fredri's advertised aspects were worse than usual. The only remote bit about this was a short (and funny) camera of Jonny Depp (the first "Nightmare" was his first film). <br /> <br /> I was basically 3-D in the last part (Freddie's childhood reaccounting) that he saw in a theater. Well - 3D was shy - faded color and image out of focus and outside. There were also three flying poles that seemed frightening (I think) my audience had the opposite reaction. Everyone smiled and laughed. 2-D looks worse on TV. Vain and stupid - too much dust too. Leave this one and see "Freddy v Jason" again.
