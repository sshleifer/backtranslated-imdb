Yes, the only thing memorable for this movie was that it played a young man, Tom Hendles, who would be a popular Hollywood star just a few years later. There is not a movie that is going to show a lot of its talents and the only other thing that can be considered to be somewhat entertaining about this flash, in which he thinks he sees a monster and manages to run. Yes, this film is bad about playing a game that uses a group of people in their fantasies and tries to come under interesting situations. Basically, after a game type retitled here as the cleverly Mazes and Monsters about game Dungeons and Dragon's evils. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that the rosaries should not be fun, until they were going out and harassing other weaker children like underage drinking, medicine, unprotected sex and other popular children. No, these bad guys were playing a game that was needed to use the brain, not in heaven! No, if they have a brain, they can actually think of themselves and can not be annihilated by certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and time consuming. Imagine, it could be a film against addiction, but few lives die, less than a month's driving demands than Dangis and Dragons in their entire existence.
