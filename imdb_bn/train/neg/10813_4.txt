I saw the first half of this version (and I think I saw each version of Jane Zen). Jane's childhood and character development was exceptional. Then, some people said, "oh oh, it's going on a lot," and the rest of the story fiercely hacked. When the main scenery is always included, they are glossy, combined, and in order that they are completely altered by completely transforming the storyline. It would be difficult until such a small transformation or even the scene was familiar with the story that was in development. Big disappointment was open so much hope that at the beginning, and then dashed it to the end.
