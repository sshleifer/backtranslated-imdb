This is not a good movie. Part of the very preacher and story line was sub par. 3D is okay, but not pretty. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young fishes who want to acquire courage and want to follow it. There is a lack of character, I really do not care about these characters and feel there was nothing to be interested in an adult. This is not a Pixar. <br /> <br /> I used to see more special 3D effects. I also like to see mom continuously saying "flies master" does not seem to fly more.
