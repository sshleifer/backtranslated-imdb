This is a poor movie, but I have to give it to the main actress .... Francis Forbes She appeared to be played at least and I personally feel she was kind of kind. Very bad he only appears in another film of the database. In addition to this, the film is full of humorous gossip and forgery death scene. The people have torn and they smell like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you want to see poor horror movies, I highly recommend this.
