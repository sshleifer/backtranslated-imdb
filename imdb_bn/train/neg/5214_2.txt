Mattmorphis I'm working on my way through the collection of Chilling's classic 50 movie packs, and the seventh movie in Mattamphososet's set. Released in 1990, Matamorophosos appears to be the reunion of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also tried a scientist for similar results. Set in modern times, Matamorphisis is not my horror movie. <br /> <br /> Researchers at a university are working to crack the human genome to create a serum to prevent adult germs. The administration pressured to express its pressure; And, by producing some results (or risk of losing money), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! First of all thinking that he did not have any adverse side effects, he finally discovered that Serum really changed him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> can not be played; And, the performance kept me in film with very little interest. The score is pandering. And, science behind the test and their results are not only unfortunate; It's stupid; Is it ridiculous ?? Best. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the last 30+ minutes turned into a gang, which is almost always endless. Without coming too far, I'll call it, "Dr. Jakeel and Mr. Hydek meet animals from Black Lagoon."
