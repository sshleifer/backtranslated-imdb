I usually do not want to write a comment, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is this painted as a soap series ("young and unstable" actually illustrated by professionals), but it also has terrible harm. It has no action. It's full of vain junk. Here is an example: A man wants to kill the main character because he was fired for him. So (after the chummy load) they are here: the guy puts a knife on his neck and says something like "you are dead". Then the main character says: "If you kill me you are dead. I told the police that you are threatening me". So the man (the killer) goes away (just weeping): "Oh no ... the police are following me! !! !! Oh ... my God". <br /> <br /> Remember: just one example. I really can not believe this movie actually exists. So: if you want to see the best movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
