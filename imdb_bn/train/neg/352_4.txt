Casts seem to be at least an average movie. And so I'm sitting for 102 minutes unbelief. None of the side of Ed Harris owns the acting skills. Even I'm usually worshiping Shan Connie, only to have a non-day during the complete filming of Just Kays. During the whole movie, one actress could not believe me once. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story makes a little bit of it. It's thrilling, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is to see only this film if you really do not have anything else useful.
