Rachel, Joe, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are the top form here. They deserve the oscar nomination for their performance. I am a great fan of tv show aswell Their music stone and they're all so talented! I'm also a great commentator for the circus !!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want a club, do not read this! <br /> <br /> The acting is very weak, the dialogue is terrible and the joke is not even executed properly (I feel sorry for the director). The joke was so incredibly bad that 8 little, enthusiastic S Club fans did not laugh to laugh. They thought they could do it well. And they did. They win the world. They became the S Club Junior. Paul, "The fat, ugly one who started a mosh band" would thank him lucky stars when he left. One of the worst movies ever made. Watch this movie! Go and do not see it! You will not be ridiculous! You will be sports! 0/10 Rajshahi
