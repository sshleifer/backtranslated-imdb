Praised Japanese director Takshi Mikey does not seem to be able to move with the torpedo thriller, the adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book related to a new old woman (and child abuser), which is part of a new urban legend: If your cell phone rings with a strange voice - And you see the message 'A Missed Call' - you only hear your own final words before you die Be able to run around. The most successful part of the movie is the fierce satirical behavior of real TV cameras that haunt future victims, but inefficient death (which includes the hidden part of the red candy!) Is frustrating and alarming. The frequent shot of the body of the debris is actually rather intelligent, and due to this overall colonization, the film is finally so postponed. In 2008, the exterminated plots reached to Hollywood, but the US version was no better. **** No Star
