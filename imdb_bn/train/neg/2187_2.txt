I bought this movie on DVD so that I could get an episode of Science Theater 3000. Thanks, Mike, Crowe and Tom Sero can watch the clock because this movie is not about itself. Although there is a plot, a story can follow, and some actors that can work, there is nothing else. The movie was so annoying, I'm pretty sure I can not see it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. In short, it has been said that it was better than the episode of MST3 episode. Mitchell
