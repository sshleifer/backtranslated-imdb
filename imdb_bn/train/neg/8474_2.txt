The opening scenes move as liquid as frozen voltages. In the endeavor of dramatic conversation, I wish I had control over fast progress control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and cute or mangy disgusting animals. This vampire tries to seduce his victims by imitating a lost puppy. I usually counted a body tally, so was a cat (which is not counted), a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in her (which was) and then the plot. Broken artists are honored to use celebrity to create words of a broken arm, but using the term biting in an apple for a deer deaf a vampire is just plain folly. I like the wallock, but this movie has become so bad that we stopped it, and forgot it so much that we stopped it again after one year.
