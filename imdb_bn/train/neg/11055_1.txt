I saw this movie in high definition of television. I am in a wheelchair due to neuromuscular disorder and want to see some films made with physical disability. <br /> <br /> At first I think the main character is somewhat developed and impressive. Disabled and mainstream society spent in the job market during the time of disability and living during the war, his message was superb. And my problem is not with those real people who do this thing. He was a good man. But the film is completely against the message that is completely hypocritical and propagated, I think it is insulting. <br /> <br /> First, they did not play a title role in real physical disability. . Sure he was an appropriate actor, but it is truly and truly realistic in order to promote the appointment of completely disabled people, in fact, unable to do anything in the film. Apart from this, it is further compiled that a person sees a trick in a cradle in the middle of a scene, only one leg is seen. But the CGI of this scene is so obvious that shameful. What? They did not find an epic for a movie? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to make CGI effects than just a real amputee? At that time, I got so much deceptive and full message that I tried to publish it that I came here and tried to panic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
