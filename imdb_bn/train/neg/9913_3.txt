This seems to lose all sense in one letter of those cheaply made TV movies. It is very good to kidnap his father's son in the context of the story. But the story just seems to believe in begging. Whenever a mother is advised to do something then you know well, she is going to do it. It fetched a bit away and is not a viewable.
