In a movie of Goldie Haun and Peter Sellers, you think you do not make it wrong. But what can I say? It was a terrific misfire. This film is about the old gentleman Peter Sellers, who has suddenly found himself in a relationship with a weird young man, who can not mention the attractive hippie of Goldie Haun. The movie is incredibly seamless and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellars and Goldie Haun are very funny people but this picture does not prove. <br /> <br /> that song? Arbela Cinderella is beautiful, but it is. I only recommend this film to people who want to see extreme innovation movies, it's about one definition. I think this movie is repeatedly a symptom from anything else, in its particular test and almost imperfections, the problem is completely shot and it is not right to mention the writing aspect. <br /> <br /> Peter Vendors, especially Hit and Miss, will leave from Dr Strangelov and stay there throughout his career, such as the movie and the Magic Christian, which was similar to one of The context and style, but that movie had some fun moments. This one is stupid, and I'm sorry that none of the great Peter vendors were in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
