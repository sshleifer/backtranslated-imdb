When I first started watching this movie, I had a lot of high expectations, but perhaps it was one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the speed is incredibly slow, so it seems much more (and it is not short). I'm sure that Jane Austen wrote the book, he made it a lot of pages long, filled up with descriptions, and man did not make a decision to read it, or it could drag and lose its appeal, which "Emma" did. Now the "senses and sensibility" was a slow error, but at least it was a vivid line and some good performance! <br /> <br /> <br /> It makes me defective # 2, which, of course, is acting. Although I can not really care for anyone involved in this movie, I am sure they are capable of doing well, but I have not seen much of this in this film. People were trying to become very hard, it was very difficult to become "high class", very difficult to become British (well, some of them), so they all came as a bunch of actors, not as humans. <br /> <br /> # 3 Cast, I said, looks like actors, in fact they are like the way they are playing. Maybe it's a good thing, because the way they played was not really good. Why did everyone choose Emma, ​​for example? Sure, he was good for the rich, handsome people in front of them, but he was a terrible giant behind their backs. If his friends are "ugly", then he is not bothered to go behind their backs. So why is this girl so big? Why do people tell stories, "just to make her smile?" Of course snob can not even possess that right. As Gwyneth Paltrow I have enough problems as Gwyneth Paltrow, and his "Emma" has just changed my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I do not care about this. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are not really meant to be made for big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
