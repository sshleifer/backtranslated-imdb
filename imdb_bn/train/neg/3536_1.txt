I do not think that I've ever felt it down by a film before. After the love of two previous films of Guy Richie (I do not count Save Anti - she was blind), I was looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> Review was poor, then again, I do not believe in the press. It was a matter of concern that the internet was of the fact that it was a distraught affair, so the payment of 4.80 rupees in the afternoon yesterday was somewhat terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm not even trying to explain this film, mainly because I have no clear source and at one point I was standing honestly and asked, was it not with me! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Richie seems to have fallen into the trap of his wife to take him very seriously. It does not seem to be good for making good plots, laughs, graduate dialogues and good movies. Characters. Here is a checklist of films that often want to rob them, I noticed something here: <br /> <br /> Matrix, Fight Club, Bill Murder, General Suspect, Vanilla Sky .. <br /> <br / > I think the most frustrating thing is that the performance of two major actors, Jason Statham and Ray Leitto was really great and it was really spontaneous story and editing / instruction which was the picture Children. <br /> <br /> So big, stop stopping big from me.
