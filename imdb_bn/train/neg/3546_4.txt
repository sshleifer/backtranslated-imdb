Spawn ahead - proceed with your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that once Harry can learn the identity of three blackmailers - relative ease - he's going to cave in on them. And then with the abduction of his wife, the whole scene, he decided to explode (his money) to explode his classic car, which gives us a long jump to the logic. <br /> <br /> He wanted to keep his relationship with the sinner in public with his wife being involved in the DA campaign. I can see this, but why does not anyone rent it to surround this annoying, or even kill them once there was no real blackmail proof (for example, the body of the body?) It was a very interesting movie for the first 2/3 . Then, it sorted separately from the sort.
