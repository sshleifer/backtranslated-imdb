Where was the criticism of democracy besides democracy? Finally, he worked for 17+ years in government organization, where his influence was immoral. Oh, I've forgotten about 8 years, the second most powerful nation in the world. The film was happy to show a young Senator Gore shot, why NASA scientist was forced to change a decision on its scientific paper, but failed to ask about the complications of Clinton / Gore in global warming. Perhaps a select year is too close, or it will hit the chances for Hillary in '08. In any way he is a political coward and party man bitter to the end. He does not criticize consumer goods, does not criticize capitalism, there is no way in the history of the industry which has led us at this moment <br /> <br /> This picture is about Mr. Gore yourself about any real problem facing our environment If Mr Gore really wants to create a campaign movie - shorten it and call it really.
