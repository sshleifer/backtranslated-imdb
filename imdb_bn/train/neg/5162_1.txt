This movie reminds me of "the history of violence," which claims to be a close study of violence and violent behavior, but ultimately, a little bit of nothing is considered to be a cheap worker film, some thoughts about violence are considered as movies. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride went to a small English town and hanging at the pub every day but those who face endless harassment from local drunks and do not have trouble. Do these men have a job? However, Dustin accepts whatever he can take, and hangs in his house till the end of the photo, and beats drunk attackers like pouring on hot whiskey, shotguns, and making feet appear by somebody. The head is caught in a bear trap. The funny thing is that anyone in a small British city needs to fall into the trap of such a large fare but it might put a head of a mental head. <br /> <br /> Sam Pacinpah who made the "Wild Bunch", which also covered the issue of blood that violence did not save anyone. But it was done with style, and you believe it. Straw dogs are not trustworthy. The first mistake of all positions and does not work. Why will it keep in England? In some or some of the 1930's, I may think of the location of some of the inner city or a small town in the southern part of America. Secondly, it has not been clearly explained in my view that why these people are so victims of violence that they may become drunk and feel the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is Sam Pekinpah.
