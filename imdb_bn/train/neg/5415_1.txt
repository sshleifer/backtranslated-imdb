Dil is a memorable film that brings great director like Indra Kumar in celluloid. The film followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja and Maasti, all of whom were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Every successful director has given some horror films, including some hits. <br /> <br /> <br /> While curiously speaking, the audience continued to laugh and laugh. It is a fool by comparing today's comedy movies. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not see it. Because kindly comedy will just cry to you. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is worth Miss.
