Just cut trash. I was a huge fan of Cusacks, the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I could see for their presence, was to reprise the exact role from Blanc to their Grosse Point, less than full and deep quality. Still, the role of movies as a political mockdown is unfortunately being very clear for most foolish to fulfill any purpose. And as a satirical taunting it will be even easier to be humiliating to bills. The imitation is obviously the highest form of chappiness, but it is not seen near the grossess point Blank and in the same league (if your body shows) shows spartanism in political satire, but we have enough to live alone and this one falsely fades into obscurity.
