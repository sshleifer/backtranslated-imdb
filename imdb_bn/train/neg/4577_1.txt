I firmly agree with other critics of this picture. I found it incredibly stupid (best) and merely confusing, misinforming and harmful (worst). Like others, I found this movie as a terrible mix of "real" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, I was especially annoyed by the contribution of Candace Parent. Indeed, I am not a fan of this movie before, but his statement about their "consciousness" was one of the best examples of taking a word ("consciousness"), most of which is a predetermined meaning and it is used to use it as a distorted method Reasons to Blur Instead It is an old Orwellian mind-8 ** that the master described himself so well in his excellent composition "Politics and English Language". In order to understand "consciousness" in this way - in fact, this film is generally referred to as "science-based" (which is its apparent intention) - Stalin used the same language as the label used when it was labeled "slave-states" and "Hitler" When he called a group of his "socialist activists" movement. <br /> <br /> I do not really claim to know Quantum Physics. I know enough about it to really understand that it will take enough research. Ah, but we Americans love "instant illumination", and try to complete this mistake of a film that is this. If the question is asked, it will be a matter, but it clearly tries to ask and answer, which can not make a movie easily because we are far away, far from the answers (if they exist). <br /> <Brahmaputra, however, the film needed a waiver about Murshid Mahesh Yogi (and TM) with several "expert commentators" cooperation, Jazz Knight, who often speaks with his "Ramath" voice. (I'm always surprised at the concept of the 21st Century concept and terminology theory of the 10,000-year-old Atlantan Superman, but again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so in the Ramessa Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I guess That he can exist now and tomorrow, so his financial advice is incredibly bad for his followers Eche? Oh, I forgot, I'm "good" and "bad" advice-makers, so it's all my fault, is not ramthara. <br /> <br /> <br /> What a mess.
