'Flight of Furry' is an awful but worst of all annoying action films - I do not expect much from a Sigal film, I think it is unlikely, with moderate entertainment for 90 minutes or with some stupendous steps - unfortunately it's even less expected It does not go, the performances are very few and far away, this plot (which is full of these movies) O Uncompromising) Unreasonably complex and confusing, huge plot plot is confusing with the deal, really unrealistic - the embarrassing outline with seagulls and its expression of whispering being one of the best in the 3rd raters sorry - I believe it's hard that anything that's near $ 12M I do not have to spend in the deadly world, unless Segar had $ 11 million seagull salary - I doubt it! It seems an hour of interest to straight guys or gay girls that two hot girls end up with a big show in the other without being ending with a lesbian sex scene - this is a medium thing that is not different for many, Michael Dudichoff B-movie I've tolerated <br /> <br /> 1/10
