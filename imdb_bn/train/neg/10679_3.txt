I do not expect a movie like "Episode" of "Cinema of the Fire" or "24", but it seems that this movie has been made for TV and has done the best intermediate work. (Well) Cast could not conceive the idea that this plot was very predictable and that the actors had to struggle through bad scripts (they really tried my best), but instead made plain letters rather than them. When I watched the movie, I felt that I saw it in other (better) movies. In it you had car cheats, big shootouts, romance, plots twists etc etc; There is no one in this movie. <br /> ** <br /> ** Spoiler ** When you talk to Cuban character with another woman, you know who is behind it and what all your instructions are ("you are very close to the President, from my point of view See .. ") Foolish words. <br /> <br /> If I have it (and maybe it is not a good thing it is not) I want to write this plot again: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first woman Order to kill. Husband is tired of writing because he is sick and always check Cubber.
