This movie is a mess. I am surprised to have even released a theater. Weibooth Robin Williams will go straight to the video. It is bad writing. It is indicated weakly. It is a worse offense that has brought an interesting topic and it has been reduced to a ridiculous and boring thriller, which has no tension and no insight and no internal or mental reason. Especially after the first half hour, the film was a ridiculous set piece above that so with the audience I was laughing at it. Save your money. The trailer is completely confusing - it's not suspense and there are no thrills - actually the real bad crime of the movie - it's just boring.
