Spoiler below, but do not read or you will know the terrible destiny that wait for all the plans to hire "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a lunar night, in a remote research laboratory, there are serious consequences for a major medical achievement. A chemical compound made for "hunting and destroying" deadly cancer cells ran out of the building basement from the hazardous waste disposal system. Now, the gems involved in laboratory testing are not the only rats in these features which will become changed species. Senior organic researcher Professor Slate has decided that adding a new enzyme enables its cancer to create "hunting and destruction" formulas for the time required to neutralize cancer. When three different degrees of new blends are directed towards three different rats and the rest of the "waste hazard" in which the fault lies, then there is a dizziness side effect on the night of terrorism ..... Right ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously, This year I probably saw the worst movie. Everything about "low-budget!" Who screams from a terrible role of special effects, which I have seen sometimes. Characters work out in a sterile and stupid manner: The dark halls of the road can be found by walking, slapping and sliding, "rats" catch them, keep them in a small room. <Br. <br /> Some pictures are made cheaply, but this movie really takes a cake. Every possible corner is cut, everything from reuse of previous shots, it makes it big for portraying "lab" hallways from different logos (this reminds me - why the massive building of these two fricines?!? !!?), Music and special effects Which children can be done on a workshop PC. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the most important influence of goat vapor - special effects. Just awesome. Computer-made rats are so fake and standing in every scene, so the left-hander of the movie can even generate computers. And that giant rats suit - OH my Allah !!!!!!!! Seriously, are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a demon? Just unfortunate ........ Good direction, some coworkers look pretty, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Everyone plays. Someone involved with the production care or they know what they are doing. I've wasted enough time with reviews, just taking my advice, it's trash 1/10 <br /> <br /> About DVD: The transfer is reduced, the audio is passable, and the director and his two friends have a commentary track on the disc, who say that they do not have anything to do with the film but the question was asked and commented. These three sub-human bees are so incredibly stupid that they can harm themselves or others before they are institutionalized. I do not want to waste any time on the reader's time or mine, because I'm starting to think more about this movie ... DVD rating: 1/10.
