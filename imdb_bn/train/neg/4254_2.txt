I do not believe that the same man guided this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 is fresh, fresh, and well-written, if it performs poorly. <br /> <br /> <br /> It starts with Dracula's defeat at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignored the story by describing what happened next to him. Following the story, it can make a good signature, but Craven likes to go to the style of his old films, there is no good tie but the main villain's name. <br /> <br /> Even the actor was Dracula. Various (Dracula is going from dark hair to a blonde at 2000). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies.
