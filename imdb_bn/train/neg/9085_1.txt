One of the worst movies I've ever seen is one. Acting was terrible, for both kids and adults. All characters show no maximum, little or enough emotions. The light was terrible, and there was much more mess about the time of shooting the film (in the river scene where they just destroy their boat, there are 4 shots; sheriff and dad in their boat in the evening, in the evening, Jillian and Molly swim in the evening, children of the rest of the day * At night by the river, doctors, Beatrice and Simontan are said to be on the river, but they do not have to sit in the evening.) The best performance in the film was probably from Sheriff, Capi (though, there is a slip in the character when the pulse detector *) when the person dies, it shows the beaps * that the capa is dead, he can still walk beating, and when the nurse is over Pulse will check himself, then it shows the pulse again, and then he dies.) I guess it's not going to be perfect, because it's a dream N film, but it can be even better. Honest for kids, even the observer value. Look at something good, like if you are going to see something like Lion King or Toy Story, but remember.
