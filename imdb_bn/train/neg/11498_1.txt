Gadar is sometimes an example of Bollywood's worst films. Directed by Anil Sharma, who likes to make films related to the period, gives a trash film. The songs were annoying and you do not want to hear your car, full volume, kind of like. Sunny Deol is famous for producing a great movie, where he beat his own 100 bad people. She even kicks a metal prison door (Indian) and kicks away a moving car (Tashee Sugar). I can give another 50 examples of the humiliation of Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know this. Once again the same role is repeated once Sunny gives a benevolent performance. Using a man's violence, claim to be fighting for his country piece. Ashisha Patel suddenly got hit with a wonderful body that I liked the bone. But he could not save the film from the disaster. Usually he is not wearing such a sexy clothes, this movie he is not. Maybe he can play a Muslim, but he does not work like that movie. Overall, this is a poor show, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who love Bollywood actors and beat up 100 people. Give me a break.
