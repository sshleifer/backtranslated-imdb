Action Comedy: This is a stupid movie about 80 genres. It is conceptually similar to Rush Hour but fully action, lacking chemistry and chemistry among the main characters of that laughter. Let's know that I enjoy J Lenny as a stand-up and talk show host, but he just can not work. When he tried hard to work, he was scary - he closed his mouth while talking about his fishing, and firmly managed to keep that trademark scarce, which is not very interesting. And run him (even back then) is not a nice sight to see. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Murita - at least today's standards - does not give Japan's very politically correct impressions. Even the story does not start about. I think it out of 10 out of 2.
