Some people get pounded. The other guy shot him in a simple eye. He got some bodyguards and they pretend to be a killer, but a reporter gets interested. He went to the hospital where he took the fearful man. He roams, and is a bodyguard in the corner, but he does not feel like talking. I can not think why. It's not like anyone else interested. He is the only reporter there However, his editors prevented him from doing this lunatic story. But hey, he anyway He goes to see the murderer's sister and mother. After a few minutes he went out in a big time - some beat their trailer - a huge force of fire. Then he finds the bodyguard from the hospital. He thought he was a hunter in the boat, but after a minute, he was trying to beat three people by drinking water in the Scuba tank (and the boat appeared a big time - huge balls of fire). The reporter and the bodyguard are trying to beat them. <br /> <br /> In the next hour, another person beats on the street, fired several stiffs in the warehouse, some car wreckage and death, a fake suicide, etc. Lotus stiffs, killing all kinds. <br /> <br /> Great stuff, but the reporter and the bodyguard can not understand: why the real man in the hell was suddenly scared. What is motivation Of course, it could help our reporter find out even interested in it. Almost all of these stories are the only journalists. There is no one else in the media. Even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies. Indeed, the real man hacked that there was no celebrity actually. His work was a little dust. He was just the President. Yes, one in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> What is this kitty? <br /> <br /> It should be done. After all there are no TV cameras, no other print journalists, no bloggers ... Only one of the police blatter ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems to me ... <br /> <br /> No! Do not wait your wife to rebel! Yes ... First Lady. The President was fooling around because he was P --- ed. And he gets away with her. He's really sharp, is not he? But how could anyone ever figure out that figure? Why would anyone be bothered? After all, only one reporter is even interested. <br /> <br /> I gave this step "1". It was too stupid to just keep watching. And it just got figs! That's real spoiler! But I told you, you have to believe it!
