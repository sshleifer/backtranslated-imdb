Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> It tried to make a fool about the Sispi / Thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s, but it has really succeeded that you really do not want to see one of them being badly <br /> <br /> It is too long . There is some way to spoof it's top of some flat quality. There is no such view in this movie. <br /> <br /> Protect yourself. It's too late for me but ... do not see it.
