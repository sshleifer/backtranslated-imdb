Do we really need any brutal waste for Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a boomer, although the "idealistic youth" of the 60s was reading Marx, their draft cards were burnt, and generally prolonged the war which destroyed thousands of lives; I was still in grade school. But I think they are good, and only 9 of 10 were fools, until they believed that something was devastating. <br /> <br /> This is another exercise in self-restraint from such a young children.
