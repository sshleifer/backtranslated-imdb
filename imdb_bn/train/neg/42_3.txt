From the three titles of Jesse Franco to the official DPP video nasty list (Devil Hunter, bloody moon and behind bars), it is most probably the most corrupt person to find a way out, it is a very strange little bit unknown by the junk climber, a little unexpected Unwanted rape scenes, and load nudity. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous blonde Ursula kidnapped Bukfliler's movie star Laura Crowford with a gang of ruthless abductors and took them to a remote tropical island. The barbarian clan who worship 'the devil god' who hides in the jungle (a large, naked, wolf who is native Native who loves to eat at the heart of the bride's female sacrifice). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you try to cross the double, you get into trouble. During confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but the native of the island goes straight to the surgery, who show him to his god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs her normal torped styling and loads this ridiculous effort into her usual horrible trademark: shit, crazy movie, fast zoom, numerous crotch shots, focusing imagery, awful sound effects and ham-fished editing . The result is a deadly mess that is a true struggle for starting from the beginning (it took a few things to finish me), even the sight of the delightful bookfiller in its natural splendor is not enough to revisit me this film soon.
