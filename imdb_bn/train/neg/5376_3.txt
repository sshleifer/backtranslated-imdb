Chalk (Uk at the UC X) is a slash which is produced directly as a direct-DVD movie. I call "inferred" because the title of the movie is not in the "V" brackets, which indicates that it was made for the DVD movie (though its appearance too). <br /> <br /> Plot easy ?? A band holds a gigabyte in a former meat paking factory and they killed each other. <br /> <br /> I think the movie can never be a great composition, but it does not forgive for errors. Here. Even Bachelor's party Mossas (there are even fewer IMDB ratings) direct-to-DVD movies have many salvation qualities, and sometimes the so-called "so bad, they are better off" as one of the movies. However, the chalk is far less than serious slashers (such as the Holoene) or very bad "good movie" (like the blue music mascus). <br /> <br /> The movie has started well using a drill to kill a character. The effects of blood are very sugar but very little budget is understood. But, from the next, it has entered all the way. <br /> <br /> There is so much guilt in the shocking that I could talk to them all day. However, some obvious individuals are standing and I'll go in between them. Assigning the band The previous GB seems to start with about 50 people, but after the music has stopped, only 8 people left (and still they all are meant to be locked!) <br /> <br /> The characters of this movie are not all liked. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mothids or just curious. No one is aware of what will happen to them and even their supposed friends even forget them when sending them. The highlight of the film is the presence of homeless people who consider the Houseworking factory as some kind of church (serious!) He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> Many people roam around and speak without any character. The film revolves around 65 minutes of characters around. Characters disappeared for long time without explaining. In direct direct DVD movies such as the Crocodel and the GRM Weekend, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other without getting excited. Extremely Outgoing (mainly from male characters) and one almost fully reflected the results of the war. In fact, the format can be said to be as follows: Characters rotate - The murder takes place - Characters turn around - The murder takes place. You can get the idea <br /> <br /> The conversation is terrible and it seems that some lines are not used, the F-word is not used. Perhaps this was meant to be fun, but it just came off as sad. And many more, we've seen these thousands before (usually to have a lot more impact). <br /> <br /> This movie is totally ineffective for a mystery. The bodies give the only indication that the letters are in danger. A puzzle is running almost loosely and yet character behaves like total morons. They make little effort to find a weapon to leave the factory or protect themselves. And most of the time they are not afraid to be afraid. Ultimate killing exception is when the killer's identity is revealed. There was no random weapon available anywhere to kill the questioning victim. Anyone stalking the character at any time has seen At DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, it makes the film interesting (of course, unconsciously), but it's not funny here. As mentioned by <br /> <br /> and other critics, the soundtrack includes music very bad, even those who like punk rock. Extra it looks uncomfortable dance. Scores (at the beginning, there is no music at the beginning!) Sugarbabe is composed of a band of wannabes who sing very bad songs which do not completely relate to the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the points. Review this. These critics prefer bad movies (like Nyl Music Massas and Bachelor Party Massacus) which are similar to the classic (eg, Holone and Friday 13th). However, it looks like the Chako did not fit in any section and tried very hard to fit. Just like straight-to-DVD movies, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, there are some fairly poor killing scenes in the film. However, when living characters do not take seriously, these scenes quickly lose their importance, because they forget the intensity they give. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> And fans of Halloween and Friday 13th Classic fans should use everything they need to avoid it!
