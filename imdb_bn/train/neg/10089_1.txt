German filmmaker Ulie Lomel feels a terrible fan of impossible. He has prepared unfinished colleague Titan Uwe Bowle for the worst film director Mukut. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lomel is really the new millennium of Ed Wood. This image is ridiculous and ridiculous as EW's best-worst. I was both proud and embarrassed to say that I saw it, the rust is impressive, only twelve can be seen. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dig a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> Start the fun with the cast of international nobodies. Only one person living in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is waiting for an actor or photographer to be discovered, can easily understand how Lomel is able to act so easily that he is willing to touch his direct sunny conversation. <br /> <br /> The main character, A Villains's Beat Cop, is played by a German actor by a thick German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also LA's oldest beat police. He stabbed innocent female driver and took him into custody, then he took them to their home (which is clearly the top floor of a furniture ware), and in view of this, all his RUK partners, LAPD refuses to investigate, so far as his physically located in his apartment in his apartment Nina is going as an attack in style raid. <br /> <br /> set unreasonably bad. The production designer budget apparently includes enough amount for a paint can; "Practical 707" is enough to draw a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Because the actor was clearly unseen and non-professional - the tragedy of the European Emirors (potential exiles if they used to work in their respective countries), Bimbos, Minbos, and middle aged women disappointed - and set any money set, special EFX is spent for location or other production value, but it is significant that they spring for some real police uniforms. Sorry, they could not afford a police car; Uniform police cruise cruise in a shiny new Mercury rental street <br /> <br /> More than half of the stories focus on the dirty work of our insulted German LAPD officer and the vain efforts of two young rooks to stop him. One of the young actors is particularly unfortunate because he is the only actor in this whole world and the film's unclear shot in a real career. Others are properly fit with Rightbill Headdo and torture Brando, who should be praised by him. <br /> <br /> The last part of this movie where the title gets its zombie, after killing our victim murderer, he killed a girl who visited only some Voodoo priests to keep a protective spell on him. Do not ask why a girl from Romania will enjoy her life in the future of the murder, just take the argument of Lomel and enjoy the strange journey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, zombie girls manage to make their appearance. What they did before the death, just as they made an airbrush around their eyes with black-colored glamor makeup. Looking for something like Zombies, they see more like the high fashion models for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this moment the movie Lomel borrows a creative note from his acclaimed countryman Boll, and injections of cheesy euro large scale. Trash technology in soundtracks. We're saying the prehistoric electronic bumblebee sound. Lomel could play enough when youngsters could play at Ibizi's Disco to shake his litter, they might have played. <br /> <br /> Unlike other jamy, Lomel girls say normal and work ... er, as I did before becoming zombified. This gives us enough opportunities in our golden dialogue to shower us with our auteur. Yes, it's a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I will not loot anything by disclosing the end of the shock. I can say that it is fully protected with this great essay. The spirit of Ed Wood survives ... or I can say his joke.
