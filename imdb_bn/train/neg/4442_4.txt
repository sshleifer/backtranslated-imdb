I do not know ... maybe it's because I was brazilian but all the stuff was a lot more. There is a lot of love for music, too many parties, excellent life of main characters (let's not be very sad), and the contrast between the city's views shown by the director is very similar. Everything looks very fake to me: family, relationships, music, "happiness". It just sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. I must be honest: it gave me a little shame, but the music made by beautiful music, gender and parties will not be inspired by life? I'm not that stupid: In one such world people do not suffer diarrhea, deep depression and STD? I like to call the mother of the carriages and talk to all the singers and negotiations with the Spanish people.
