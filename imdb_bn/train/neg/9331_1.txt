Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is completely ridiculous, intriguing and totally without argument. This is a DVD / TV-movie that usually includes all the necessary components, including essential elements for a terrific movie experience: Actors have played, simple steps have been taken from the plot, the girl has her T * ts (why, God shows), why ?? People do not respond to things like real life. I'm not even bothered you with details, it would take all night. Well, okay, if you're walking down the street, two people have been killed, a victim actually dies in your weapon, his blood gets scratched from your head and you have all your injuries, your first concern; "Oh, he left the world, and seeing the last thing, he was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost carrier.
