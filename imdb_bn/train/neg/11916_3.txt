Ish I think it's weird that their ancient book was created using a simple script font instead of written in chains. Acting is so overwhelming at times and so much dramatic at times. Why would a "demonico" kill two suspicious calm doctors who helped him immortal? Just what's it for? And when Lilith's motorcycle is out of nowhere, it's really necessary. We get it! You've spent a little bit of renting some third-rate Crotch Rocket rental. It does not mean you will not show up all the time! The "Believers" layer looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some old minute changes. Scenes are seen where a few people are seen with us for a talk show for about 30 seconds without a clear show and without any importance. Everyone is a mere character. I forgot the forgotten letter and even the more forgotten plot I made one of the worst-conceived movies seen on the Safifer channel. Stay away until you get into the bad movie
