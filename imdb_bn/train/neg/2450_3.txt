I saw the Robson Lord's Peter Jackson version when I took halfway to read two towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The Ring Lord's animated version was released at this time. On the DVD but I said to myself that I will finish it before reading two towers and return of kissing (as I thought it showed the whole triangle). <br /> <br /> So when I finished trilogy. Went and brought the DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I was really disturbed in 20 minutes which was really amazing because I love the book and I laugh that the creator can think of this photo even for at least one and a half thousand books in a 2 hour 8 minute film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Read it on a page, even my favorite character is not that Gandalf seems interesting. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I do not know this movie because the freedom fighter was not a freedom fighter, but it was perhaps better that the creator went out of the money because the film could not be even better. <br /> <br /> I hope nobody will judge the books of this photo. <br /> <br /> 3/10
