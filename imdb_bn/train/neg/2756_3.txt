{Rant Beginning} I did not want to believe them at first, but I think the South Koreans have topped the film and people are even talking about it, so that they can go downhill. Funeral Korean blockbusters have become more generic - 2006's amazing fun and ongoing giant film "Goyumul" (Urdu "The Host") - which actually succeeded in creating sharp jokes from a B-movie genre. Even though their budgets (especially spent in special effects) have become even more impressive. South Korean filmmakers are actually the satisfaction of all the audience and investors, which were created from their 1999 break-out film "Shirley / Swiri", they made a whole series of major budgets like the mainland China, like the whole series of medieval movies. ? {rant end} <br /> <br /> I guess for the sake of making this movie, I've seen the most detailed and fluid digital animation of the Korean / East Asian-style dragon, for the final scene to make money for investors, the date . Now if they start at the beginning of the dragon and give more personality and intentions to the "DrugHart" of 1996, then the film may have some other liberation qualities except the animated dragon. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Has anyone learned that the strategy you use does not have special effects, but how do you use it? I hope they can use more (and better) Korean legends, because they painted this picture in Korean dragon legends and killed many of their international interests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the negative reviews have gone before and the Koreans felt how their song "Aringang" is being played in the very last game. As an animal feature, if I used to give at least 5 stars out of 10, then special effect or action sequence was valuable, but I saw many video games with good camera work and scripting (only low dragon).
