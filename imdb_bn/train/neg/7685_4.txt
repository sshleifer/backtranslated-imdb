Collected from the story of William Gibson, Melandram Confounding, created by John Hustman and directed by Vincent Mineralel! Richard Wymarkmark raised the head of the pouch, the rural nervous sanctuary, where his spontaneous wife fought with the self-appointed queen Beebee Lilian Giss, and Wyommark himself found the stray eyes of Lauren Bacall, who brought her life together after the death. Her husband and children Smooth and muddled, set an arbitrary time and place, and a "David and Lisa" love story hidden in Plush Morass. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this script does not give them anything to build. For one hour, most of the conversations are concerned about what to do about hanging drapes in the library (this thread is not used as a symbol, but it is a red deer in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the lagerheads that separate people from working in the same profession, and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately Minnelli does not publish this stunt, informative, light or entertaining. ** **** to
