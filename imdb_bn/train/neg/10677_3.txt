I paid the last game, never heard of it, but I love political thrillers so I thought I'd give it a shot. After doing some research in the film, I saw it was initially intended for the release of the theater, but instead went straight into the DVD. After watching this, I wonder, "Wonder!" The movie is shocking in its unoriginality. The plot and the character are perfunctory. I figured out whodunnit by half marks but the end was a curve ball. I want to say, I did not expect to finish the way I finished it, but this is not a point for it. The more expected end can be one that is so bad. Perhaps filmmakers have seen how much of the film was expected and so they decided to throw in a twist - even a movie that makes worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I'd like $ 5.98 and back to my 107 minutes.
