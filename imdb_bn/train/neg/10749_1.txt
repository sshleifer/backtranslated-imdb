This movie was probably the worst movie I ever seen. Jump with me right here: 1. There were more jungle with some trees and brushes in Los Angeles. Which is not awesome. News Flash, if you're filming in the Southern California area, the big beer is just an hour away. They actually have trees. <br /> <br /> 2. I had absolutely no bad conversations, without any doubt of writing. Every possible line in the movie was vulnerable, cliche, or just plain fool. For example, the name of the camp is "Blood of the camp" (Pangu), the name of the name "killer jacket" (lame). What is a twin doing in a jungle? Can they find the only mask? 3. Last but certainly was played at least. The worst group actors and actresses gathered together. Shitty line and poor performance is a virtual cornucopia. Then the worst part is to return flashes to flame randomly, where foreign girl is being nude for a photo. It's really a long scene and I was supposed to be sexy, but she did not. Also, it was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me, this tool is supposed to be "Athletic". For example, when he was bored in the movie, he grabbed some stones and started carls with them. Then he is thinking of running for a dress and it is immediately clear with his very "girls" run, that he is far away from athletic Oh and the girl played the cats, the good Lord stopped singing. The song you sang for the achievement wants me to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie for some reason, then at least recommend special features. The group of Jacques, which produces this movie, talks about it as its original story. Indeed, one of the girls says that she lets some of her friends read Scrapplellas and none of them can predict the end. Apparently he hangs out with special kids.
