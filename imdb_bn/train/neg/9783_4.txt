The worst movie I've seen is definitely not very good. I'm also going to play a paintball player, airbase and from the wood to the airbase, this is a big change. The film depicts the same quality. The first of these films began with this film, which is apparently trying to impress or "paint" a man, started to wear a professional team and jersey and shoot mug, autocomber. A guy is a neat sport. There is not much mistake with the film, but how it is felt that it was very fatty. The good guys who are a bunch of kids are not the ones who have a lot of money in the woodworking players and have the dream of getting "good guns". The other group constantly likes them and insults them because they play wood and Blah bahla. Vanatom finds out the children of these wooden kids and trains these cones and gets them to play airbushes and basically defeats all the teams, including "professionals". <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? Good budget is a huge thing, a painted movie will not be bad but the budget is quite low and the film seems to have been done by an amateur. There is no big name in this film and the acting is very fatty. Paintable perception is very bad. They seem to be implying the speedball and all these other shit going on. It just did not give me a real perception of what my opinion was a lousy movie and a paintable. Not all buddies like the true background are good, it is not playing with many casing and bonus balling "respect" and rules. Do not watch this movie and then shouted, "4 is 1 !!"
