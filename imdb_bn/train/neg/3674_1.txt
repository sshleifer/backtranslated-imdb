Note: I will release a key part of the plot, but if you have seen a DVD cover or a promotional material, you may already know it. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be written by an eleventeen year old who is not very bright and he was probably very tired when he wrote. The author does not know the difference between chemicals and organisms. <br /> <br /> Forget about this issue that the UN and NSA Hungarian shows seem to be going on. When this master intelligence agent chases after someone, then forget that they will not give you protection even within a minute (not even gloves). This is the quibbles in the movie's context. In this scientific world, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and goes to the side of gravity. <br /> <br /> People of this photo (with some exceptions) do not deal with human behavior. Almost every time a character responds inappropriate to something. The love story (of course there is a) is that the Opera Scripts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that we broke a free film break in this item.
