It's a good example of how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very brief meaningful conversation, no context for the events, and there is a constant take-over in seemingly relative scenarios. The result is a confused, stupid audience; It is impossible to follow this plot and it is meaningless to hear the director's comment. <br /> <br /> This film tries to do much with human torture and to show what is wrong with its emphasis. Child abuse on It includes some stock footage of real, terrible acts of violence including leaked during the war. Although it works in the background of film, I think the ideas behind the film can be presented without such extreme content. This film is not too weak to be frustrated or easily offended, and children should not be shown under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> Climax is anti-climatic than content in the rest of the movie. If you do not hear the comment, then you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's commentary was a shot, "Put the guy up and let him speak, no cuts" commentary. Although it is not necessarily bad, the director gets angry and often spends minutes in complaining about his college, film situation, alongside producers, bad films and dozens more. Neutral negativity is otherwise stuck in other useful tools to understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was shot several years ago in 16 mm and in Super 8 film for very low budget for four years. For this reason, the video and audio quality are poor. That alone is not a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
