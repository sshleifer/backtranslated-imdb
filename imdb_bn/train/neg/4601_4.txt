I do not know anything about the previous work of the author or the director, so I did not bring any perspective in the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide, I think it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But there was an inability on uncertainty. Every turn of the plot seems to be an excuse for dragging bloody, terrible makeup, or special effects. <br /> <br /> The score was professional and Kari Uhara is an acting actress, but the rest were more than depressing. . It was positive reactionary. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the uncomfortable story, but I will give examples of what I think as an extraordinary Gore. <br /> <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes home to an isolated farmhouse and pulled the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt) from deep fridge. McCain had to kill Wendt by cutting a fungus from his neck. Now he thinks that he must destroy the evidence of his involvement with Went's death. (What are the police going to do, how to measure the bite radius?) McKenna unfurls the vendor's head and neck from the friend's bag, takes the ax, and cuts off the head of the wedt. Part Part Part Aunt Bit puts the chips away at Wendt's neck. The air is filled with frozen meat birds, among which a McKenna falls on the head. (He closed it when he was done.) McKenna then took the frozen head in a small fire. He is sitting on the ground on the head, took the next horse, took some pictures of the woman he just killed and showed him the head of the winters. "Remember him, if we were not for you, we could really make it," he said in the head. "Duck, you always liked the wildfire, did not you?" He questioned. Then he kept his head in the fire. We just get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the pale sizzling flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be such a garbage sensor. I'm just wondering if I'm enjoying this thing. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to go with the rest of the movie. Well, I'll mention an example of an "inability", since I have given the idea. McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark empty shake. He knows that he will be involved in half the death in the coming days. (He is literally invited to do heavy work.) What would you do in situations like this? Here it is here that McCaina can turn into the last night of her life. She finds an exclusion calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbates (successfully). Give that person the freedom medal! <br /> <br /> A giant who looks like a pizza is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often held and wobbly. The dialogue is on line, "Life is a part of ****, otherwise it is the best in all possible world, it depends on your perspective." The use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. Finally a bomb exploded in an explosive eruption, when the hero, McCaina, proceeded towards us. <br /> <br /> He also has some heroes. Before he first pressed a fridge in front of the body, a heavy statue, then a man with a potted plant, repeatedly bashing him to kill a man for $ 13,000. (It bothers him a bit, but it is not enough to prevent him from insisting on payment.) Then, I hope I have direct order, he killed Wendt who broke his neck. Then he accidentally killed his first victim's wife and blamed heavy burdens for him, although he has nothing to do with almost any moral calculus. Then he made Head Hennocho (Beldwin) alive. Then, by disabling two less heavy burdens, he deliberately flushed them, even though one of them is not completely disrespectful. And we are supposed to be rooting for McKenna. <br /> <br /> This is not like the death of cartoon in Dirty Harry movies - Bang and you're dead. This is slow and painful. The first one - $ 13,000 kill-up - is enough to look like what can happen in real life. Being shot in Cartoon by Hitkoc Torn is not really easy to kill. But the scene does not get any importance. <br /> <br /> Some people can enjoy this, especially those young people can feel that pain and death happen only in movies. Here are some annoying elements on the screen.
