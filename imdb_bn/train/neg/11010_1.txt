This movie does not even deserve one. This time there was a perfect waste. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and hateful. One of my spoiler that I think should be read by everyone. Full frontal nudity and hateful language. But it is not that, there is no plot line, the actor is terrible, sounds terrible, actors short time I've been waiting to see this movie! /> <br /> I was the only reason to hire <br Brian Van Holt (who was part of just 15 seconds). I think it may be a mistake in the part of the directors and editors, but repeating the same segment two or three times just adds a new sentence. /> <br /> Like a film Eraser Head <br, probably the most boring movies exist. There is no plot line, and not funny. Although it is not trying to be fun. Do not see any movies.
