Obviously, when you pay an actor enough money they will do something. I'm not sure how much John Rice-Davies got, but he should apologize to his fans for the amount he has earned. The special effects were even worse, the effects of the 1950's B-film and the rest cast performance were even worse. In my opinion, the second best performance in India was bad. The English had been utterly frightened and I think no one could speak in English, instead of just remembering the script, words should be sounded and try to make their character both "life-like" and practical.
