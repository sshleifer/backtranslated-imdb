You will not be able to keep it very much against making it in four days and I want to be a campi (This is not really a campie, in addition to the exception of Kevin Kollisar and Huntley Rotor, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast has played half straight; Riley Smith is very bad.) This funny story has actually been given attention, which kind of surprised me; I feel the absolute purpose of fulfilling sexual fantasies and disrespecting stories with the horror films of this extremely low budget, but they use lots of words like "technical" and "physicality" in the script and point to their point. (Although it is possible to explain why this story may be very few cast members.) No one is worried about this stupid story, and the only things that are attractive in the film are the words Makka and soft-core homeostorism (which is not all that lusty). If there were just some random killings for any reason, I would have enjoyed it more. The film is expensive, TV-quality appearance and acting level. Some "sexy" scenes are okay - boys are sitting on their bed in bed, feeling themselves; Or tied up and made a loud breath, when wine is poured over them - and some of them have fun. And i am Ron Hobber likes digs and a bizarre mockery of a story about religious cultureists with intense gay internals, but it's still not good at all. 3/10
