This picture escaped from the German camp about British prisoners in World War II. <br /> <br /> I "Wooden Horse" is frustratingly boring. It may be exciting, suspicious, and adrenaline, but the "wooden horse" is very easy to say. It's a collection called Plain and Badly Event, with no suspension and thrill. The first half explicitly tells how the war criminals dug a tunnel, but the events were so easy, they did not get enough damage and tied me in the ghat. The next half of the film is even worse, they are just going to another place behind a cat and mouse. And the characters may speak a little less and have more action in an action film! I was frustrated by "The Wooden Horse", it spoiled the possibility of a great movie.
