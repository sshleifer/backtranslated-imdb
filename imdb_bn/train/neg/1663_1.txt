First of all, this plot is overdone - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, interferes with the girl, interrupts the girl, the girl goes away, everyone loves her again etc. The heroine, plus the pain of single-parent and it is expected that you can practice with him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they break classical music. They send the message that everyone is involved with classical music, rude and sticky and intimate - in fact, I do not think the quote correctly, but at one point in the movie I remember, Holly is saying, "Why are they so ambitious ... so classic? "<br /> <br /> I have done it dozens of times, but for this movie I can think that the only reason that Britney Spears is promoted. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Holi illustrated actress (I'm not sure if she really sang songs) had a good word of her, it was not as amazing as it was made - especially when she was belting Was there. She was oversupporting the whole time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 bigger.
