This review has no spoilers because everything has already been shown in the movie's trailer. I am trying to maintain balance in my review because I firmly support local films, but I can not support the response to this movie but I can not help. It is slow, annoying and unmatched. Even "almost beautiful and reliable moments" are even immediately undercut by painful clich√©s and bad acting. India Lopez and Ong Lee Lin, which I usually love, were only transmissible in this movie. The director thought that he was trying to create a Molodramatic TV soap, then decided to take him to the big screen. Leap years should come with a RA rating (terrible horror), but it did not change my belief in local movies. More such films will come, until such other films will be created.
