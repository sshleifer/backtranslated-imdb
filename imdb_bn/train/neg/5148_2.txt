There is a terrible mistake with this picture, which is a script that starts from both start and obvious. Courtney Cox is a comic book artist who fled to a small desert after being raped twice in the big city. He appears quite unhinged (Craig Chef) who is immediately stalked by a local, and who seems to be trying to imitate Mickey Rourke in the third rate.
