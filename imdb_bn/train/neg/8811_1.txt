Spell !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not like it. <br /> <br /> The first reason is boring. Sometime nothing happens, women roam and how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they wash weeds, read magazines, take care of the sick friend and sometimes spend dead bodies. Boring !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: there are many things left unchecked. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, a barrier prevents them and is interrogating them. Who is this man? How do they know something about ill-eating related illegal activities? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what we originally thought never explained! How frustrating is that? Conclusion: I am worried about women, discouraging stories, two adventures, tiring, and unimaginable. The cover art is also confusing because it makes it clear that the movie will never be silenced. I hired this movie based on reviews made by some other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people could enjoy this flick, I am sure now that I have reviewed two reviews deeply in movies so that other movie rentals I'm sorry to see you.
