It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gajra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked pretty surprising. But that was They were not given any letters or good lines to work with. I did not understand what the characters are doing. <br /> <br /> The role of little girls was very good, Patti Henson and the Cologne camp were quite skilled and confident in their little sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is tragic that they are not going to play better and better films. Sadly, I do not think Dori Strateni has the opportunity to play the role of her only significant film. <br /> <br /> There are some fans in this picture and when I started watching it, I was very open. I was a fan of Biggard Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his last movie "Cat Mao" and enjoyed its first "Target" to "Niklaidon". So, it surprised me that I was quite able to keep awake to stay awake. <br /> <br /> It is fierce that this movie is an intelligence agency where intelligence and clients are romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Baugdanovich's ex-girlfriend Cynyle Shepherd had a television series "Munnitting", which stole the notion of Bogdanovich's story. Of course, the series was heavily dependent on the malicious dialogue, it was a big difference when it tried to work with slapstick and a few sculble lines. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is a very pale version of "Paper Moon" and "Watches Up, Doc".
