I'm going to keep this short. This "adaptation" of the wonderful King Book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Quebec and Nicholson fans on this site, and as a result, this movie has been mysteriously found to be the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is ridiculous as Torrence and so Shelli Duval. There is nothing to do with the story of this story, it is an inconsistent mess and the character of Jack and Wendy Torrens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Oh, and those who say that everyone had the right to remove the legend King Graves ... a good writer should not review "masterpiece" like "closing the eyes wide open".
