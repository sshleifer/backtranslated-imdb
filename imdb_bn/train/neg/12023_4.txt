Reed Diamond has played a hungry man for more than a decade of mental asylum, who was surprised by the road behind his blood. Doctors want to test a new drug that will lose their missing memories if it is lost. But when the drug confuses him to the monster, he instead chooses to run away. Outside, when he humiliates a young boy (Gregg Grunberg), his ground does not allow him to go near the dark room on his basement, and usually does suspect work. <br /> <br /> A simple way to identify the path before the release of the film 'Mystery', I have realized enough of Mr. Diamond's performance to maintain my attention throughout my life. (For the sake of full disclosure, I played his role in the introduction of Homesaid and its short, but very important, the role of the shield through Journeyman and Dolhouse) is not a great movie, but quite useful. I liked it better than previous films shown from the director / writer Michael Hirst (Room 6, Pumkinhide 4, Mansito) <br /> <br /> I.
