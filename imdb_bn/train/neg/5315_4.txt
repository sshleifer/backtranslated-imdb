In a row of space deaths, the prisoner called the prisoner, hijacked the racket and escaped to the American forest, where he tried to flee some new adult friend from the machine of "Elienator" female cyborg killer machine. After one year, Fred O'Neill will not be able to help Roy's best film, "Hollywood Chain Hawkers", but it seems like a bit out of date. Just like the previous movie, like a low budget, but not as much fun with me. No actor really stood on me. The image is okay for arbitrary visitors during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for that it is much better. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
