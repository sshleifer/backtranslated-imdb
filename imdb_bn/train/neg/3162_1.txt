I was not even bothered to finish the movie because I was very annoyed I thought I saw it in the movie theater and I and my friends were tired so that we got up and went to another movie. You have to sit in 2 minutes. Again, I think I'm going to shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what had happened till the end and I would not be surprised. I was going to do the right thing and make him happy, I really want to say that you have to be completely foolhardy that it is not known. I know I did not miss anything and if someone wanted to see me in this movie then I would say "on my body."
