I'm only rating this image for 3 cruelty because it tries to be fit. I love to appreciate a great movie and I do not favor towards "male" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film. On the other hand, Georgia's governance is incompatible, weak, poorly written, the illusory example of filmmaking is the worst. At the end of the film, I am not lying or I am not sure if anything is resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the picture is a good story. This story is not weak and ever developed (only matter is deep, because the story is not good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that has experienced a major character change, and the movie is primed for that change on course. Georgia Rule, the change of character was sudden and unused. Secondly, there were many dynamic dynamic characters. Really takes a hard work and time off a good dynamic character (you only got a couple hours in a movie). That means many dynamic characters get very little attention for their personal change. Even if I ignore a poorly written story and also do a hole in weak dynamic letters, even I can not say that I liked someone. Each character was a mess. If you try to use dramatic comedy then it is better to write American beauty. Georgia had a terrible mother, her daughter had a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a man. (I have not been persecuted him, because he is not spending any frustration, confiscation of all, and we are all responsible for our own actions). "Doodle do Diet" Mormon baby should not be involved in compromise with her religion and commitments ... and Simon, I want to say seriously, what kind of people who oppress a 17-year-old girl who sometimes has occasional (unless she An actor or a politician). If you want to remind yourself, this movie is valuable to make good films!
