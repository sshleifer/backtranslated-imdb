There were genuine horror films produced in seventeen years - but this film is not one of them! It's a shame because the child is not good because it works from a modest idea that sometimes takes place in successful horror themes. We have an idea of ​​a revenge child, which has done so well in classic movies such as The Bade Said, and then we have central zombie themes, which are essentially the main part of the successful horror film. This plot basically blames the load people for her mother's death, so she goes to the graveyard and encourages the dead to revenge (as you do). It's all good and good, except that it's annoying! Nothing much happens for most movies, and although it comes up with some beautiful Gore; It's not a last enough to justify sitting through the rest. Places seem to be cheap and movies are all rubbish, the film was clearly shot in the budget. I can not say much about the film because there is not much else in it. The child is frustrating seventy thousand blurred blows and I certainly do not recommend it.
