Curiously, it is not Ryan Roose's eyes and face-body Gorilla - it appears as the central point of "Body", producing the production of Jim Henson through the collision of Francis Ford Coppola. Somehow, countless close ups of Russia's face fell to the post-production stage, and they literally filled the screen so that the poor apes are many upgrades. The strange story of Gertrude "trudy" Davis Lint's rich doctor's wife is a funny story that turns them into palaces for domestic animals and wildlife. The movie goes beyond good intentions ... it drips with positive sincere sincerity. The film never gets caught in any kind of "family film" magic that is needed, and it seems that before both humans and animals are programmed (nothing seems to be real here). In about ten minutes, two chimpanzees roose in the kitchen and start throwing a slaughter knife (it misses Alan Kamming's head by inch); Yet, no eyebrow is raised because it is a day's fun. Still, when the whole poor body becomes crazy during the thunderstorm, the police are called - and everyone looks at the body through the window, when he makes furniture in the living room. The furniture should be less of concern to anyone in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know the balls were in good hands: Whenever director Carolyn Thompson needed a good pick-up shot, he would stop the unexpected Rane more severely. I wonder what was this picture lipstick budget? ** **** to
