Very frustrating film. In the end I did not care any more letters. I was delighted to see Wing Rames in a very small part, and William Messi was always good, was not yet able to see. It starts out strong and just keeps getting weak and weak. Insomnios will love it because I'm sure it will keep them asleep.
