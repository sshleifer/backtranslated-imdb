I was stupid that I was actually sitting and saw this. I love independent movies, horror movies, and generally full zombie thing. But when you add ninga, you should never exceed a line which has exceeded a line. I hope this movie will be a great time to make it, at least it was not total waste. Although you do not know by watching it. Script? Are you kidding Acting? I think the plants are also fixing. Cinematography? Well, there must be a camera. Duration I do not think there was any real plan involved in making this movie. This kind of total waste which I will not prolong by further comment.
