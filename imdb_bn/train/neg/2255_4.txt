Was this movie stupid? Haha What is the depth of this movie? No Character development? No Plots twists? No It was simply a movie about a very fictional Springer show. It shows the length that some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagen worked very well like Jolly Pressley's mother. Jaime .... well ... serious! This flick was not so much as a "breakthrough" film, but it was intended for a trailer park (I live in the trailer park and we do not have anything like this movie) where everyone is sleeping with everyone Otherwise, all girls are pregnant by different boys, and all the boys rusted out '66 Ford pickups (too much, of course, but when you mention that trailer park shows everyone in the photo). Some people analyze the film (Case-In-Point: Star Trek Freaks). I watch movies purely for entertainment value; She does not seem to have different hugs in different shirts in different shirts ("Gough" Kenie's shirt falls somewhat, can it be good? Of course, but it was fun like hell.
