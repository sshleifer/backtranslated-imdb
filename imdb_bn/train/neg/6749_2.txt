This mess is not so bad as it is even desperate. <br /> <br /> Debbie's talent in this movie was completely destroyed. She is not even villenous. The rest of the actors are like pornographic vans and the plots are so tall, I will not even mention it. Make a favor on yourself and avoid the last credits to perform the upcoming band-to-Marlow "Better Than Sex" This is a disco candy song of 80. Gambleing & Tempo songs about gender are beautiful. The way is more entertaining than "bleed". Keep it like this, when there is a copying tool in the video, you decide to record the song at the end of the movie, you really have "BAD" movie.
