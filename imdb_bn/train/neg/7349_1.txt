Polyester was the first John Watcher movie I had seen, and I had to say that it was also a "bad" movie that I saw at that time. <br /> <br /> "talent" of the water team, I've definitely worked for food, and Waters is willing to say the line. The story about the movie, terrible, acting, camera, editing, and a woman played by 300 pounds Transvestite was completely unreasonable. <br /> <br /> She said, I would suggest this picture because it is very funny, and you will not believe the shit that poor Francine will happen. Her son huffs feet in the grocery store stores of sluvery and unsuspecting stomps. Her daughter is the sluttiest slut in the city. Her husband is a hobby of a visitor who is embarrassed and insulted to weak Frenchins. <br /> <br /> Francis' only friend Edith Messi, perhaps the worst actress. Edith is watching and he says she is reading a queue card lines and never saw the script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the trails of Francis, Waters lived happily after the end of a fantastic Hollywood and everyone (who lives)).
