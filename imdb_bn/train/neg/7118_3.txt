I could not say whether the "Screaming School" was trying to end up with a hitchcock rip or try to respect modern adver Allen Bo. These days, someone will cut it up a bit and it will be presented as one of the episodes of the TV texts from the old "Tales from the dark side" ... but only after a comprehensive rewriting <br /> <br /> The tragic thing is that trying to get out of the street from this movie looks like a beautiful, nasty little story, and actors certainly do their best work with both their talents and components. But the director did not know how to phase or in the dramatic scene; Special effects do not work; Screenplay has telegraphed the plot points of its stradders so clearly that a bipartisan saw them come; And the German "Umpah Band" was playing the music while trying to threaten the soundtrack audience. <br /> <br /> they tried; They tried really hard. But it's only interest as a piece of time. I think a very young person who has not seen too much suspicion or fear can get a "Screaming School" charge, but the young one who does not get the most likely subtext or intrigue motivation ("Mummy, why is that wonderful man trying to frighten the terrible cat-cat lady?")
