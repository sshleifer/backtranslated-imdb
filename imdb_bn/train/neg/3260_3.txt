Doc Savage: The Bronze Man Man is a terrific movie. Written badly, played too much, and just plain silly. That's said ... it's actually some enjoyable movie. This movie is seen in a group of cheap beer supplies. This is one of the movies like "Santa Claus Martianos" or "Yor, Hunter of the Future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right groups, then see an explosion in this movie. It's campi. It's a fun. It has a theme by Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, then look somewhere else. 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I heard that some studios are exploring the possibility of a remix ...
