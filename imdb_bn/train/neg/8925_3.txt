I do not like mother cinema anymore, so I am grateful that how the Hollywood leaflet pushed at that time. Miss Welch's dress has become a symbolic picture, though I must think that many people who recognize this image actually saw the movie and to know what it was like. <br /> <br /> < br /> I do not think there was any good age for FMC over the years and years ago. Sexuality movie cartoon is a segment of comic books in history, where it has been given appropriate credit for giving big stars, which were then harmful production. However, IMHO, the film is very curious, very hateful, too stupid to escape, and is so busy that it is trying to condone, busy, or fail to entertain ---
