If you are like movie-gear then enjoy the original ingredients and intelligent secrets ... then look elsewhere, kids, because the slipwairs really suck. Usually I say more than that, but ... wow ... it was bad. When Charles wanders in the house, I especially love him, he is frustrated, and then he walks on a walk. Where is his car ?? However, just do not see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but the words escape me. Jumping on cats. Being stabbed by a guy's corn. Cheesey line up sturdy "Wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I take that back! See it as a writer who owns the cemetery for Stefan King's Camaro. She is actually quite good. Even with guest appearances of Mark Hamil and Ron Perlin, the King gives the best performance of the film. But, that's another ... wow ... BAD.
