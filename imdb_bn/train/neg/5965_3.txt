In 1454, the wizard of France ended the killing of Allaric de Maranac (Paul Nasse) and was tortured by the Mob de lancer (Helg Lynn) on his accusations of magic, vampireism and licentrology. Before they died, they cursed the next generation of their executioners. On this day (70's), Hugo de Marranc (Paul Nachchi) and Sylvia (Bitsby Ruez) and their friends Morris Roland (Vict Winer) and his favorite Palla (Cristina Surin) go to a session session, where they are the soul of Alaric de Maranac . They decided to visit a real estate Villas de Sade in the village Hugo family, to find an ashram with a secret billionaire. They found the head of the Allaric and kept them near them, made the earth alive again and gave locals death for the sacrifice of Gore. After the death of his father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) thinks that her the hamster's omelet is hidden in a love; Together with Mary, they tried to defeat the Alanic de Maranac and the Mobil. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I bought a pack of 9.98 US Dollars with Paul Nation's five DVDs; Despite having no references, I decided to take the opportunity. The first DVD is a trash B (or C) movie with an uncut and restored version of "Horror Rages of the Grave", which immediately reminds me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed by terrible screenplay, direction, performance, cinematography, decoration, special effects and versions, and many nude women. The result is simply lovely and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
