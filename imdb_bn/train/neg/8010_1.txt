I was very surprised by positive comments because there were four of us who saw this screening and we all went away. We personally felt that it was not easy to see through the painful slow and complete film. And we really try to stick it with it. In particular, those who really want to like it because of their personal experience of sexual intercourse in this group, they do not like or depict. I said, "It is good to see that this film has really resonated with many people on board and critics, this is the beauty of the underlying art of film."
