This picture was terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is used only in the tricks box used for movies made by it, like a child with many toys. There were endless, annoying repetitive descriptions, slow speeds, frames frames, flashbacks, and integrated images - one of which made a bad movie better. <br /> <br /> It is called "Alcohol in 16 years", but there was no drinking or drunkenness and there is no screenplay for filming around the whole place without any coherent ideas. The story was badly written and highly motivated and the side was equally poor and shameful that John Jawson gave more money to the film for more films, before he had acquired such knowledge in creating a garbage group and TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I finally found a great struggle to see it but hoping to be better than that I went to bitterness, but it was really a waste of time and I was bored well Not close
