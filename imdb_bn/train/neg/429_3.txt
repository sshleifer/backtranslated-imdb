I was interested in seeing this movie getting its star, but eventually it all distributed. It plays a lot like the Greek tragedy of corruption in the big city corruption than a modern thriller. It is the complete fault of its predictions and mysteries of the greatest error. We know from those guys who started from the bad guys, and they followed along with falling like Dominoes. The film avoids unreasonable violence and sexuality for its achievement, but has forgotten the option of good, clean romance or tension in any other way. All smell of a good, flat decaffeinated food col What happened in New York "Q & A" is a very good option, such as "LA Confidential".
