I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities looked awkward. Also the crowded characters looked very strange. Warren Batty did not act terrible as Dick Tracy, but it was not one of his best performances. Madonna should only sing. Glenn Headley did a good job in this movie. Because of the amazing performance of Al Pasino, I gave this movie 2/10. It was not a high note in his career but he still did a good job.
