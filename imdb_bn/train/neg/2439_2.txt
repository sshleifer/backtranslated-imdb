Donner von RAVERWARE's "Intensive Care" is easily one of the worst horror films. This extremely cheap Dutch Slashy Flick offers a lot of cows and strange conditions. A horrific experienced George Kennedy was completely destroyed like Professor Brookner. Unreal, acting slow and humorous of Climax. A car accident in a famous surgeon. He lies in a coma for seven years and then he is awake and goes on a bloody rampage. "Intensive care" is definitely influenced by the American slasher film "Halloween" and "Friday 13th" series. The killers are delightful and the dialogues are painfully stupid. But if you are in the right mood you will see this piece of trash. You will laugh until you get hurt with it - you can trust me!
