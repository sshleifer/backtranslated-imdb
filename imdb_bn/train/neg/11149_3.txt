Repeat: full moon An animal, a huge violin, is hunting. Not for meat, not for blood (although it does not seem to bite on the path), but for the partner. She is searching for a girl. Although no girl. Girl that girl is pure (and a velvety, though she still does not know it). Three, check it well, two policemen (after the first scene) and an old bag lady knows everything that can stop it, or even kill and eat many people around the moon. This special powerful warlock, Darkul, the girl is shutting down. If he gets to him, mankind is ruined. Now the police have to find the girl, she must convince only one person that a Verrule, who wants to rape her, and possibly kill him, but she herself is a Veruful And then they could stop him ... <br /> <br />: For these boys, for teenage boys. A lot of scenes with more or less important for semi-naked girls plots. Mostly less. Well I guess some need to fill some time because the plot (expected) is thin. And unfortunately there is little to help break apart the plots in addition to the girls. One usually activates two main themes. Nudity Check out. And then special effects. Hmm ... there are some good effects that you can influence. They are not very special though. Actually, vomiting, they are very bad. There seems to be a lack of movie funds. They can not afford to wear clothes for some girls;), and the effect is cheap. Variance and conversion of some of the human forms, of course done by the computer, is really bad. You could ignore such things. But the Darkul itself is very weird, and you will not see any killings. Just after some mutated bodies. And there is astonishingly little blood in this picture, in which the film should be honestly sinking in blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time they do well, but unfortunately characters (or actors) can simply lose it. Some of these laps may be associated with the above mentioned problems. Like poor effects, or poor budget (?) The reason for this can explain why valuable little shooting is being done, even if the letters are armed like a small army and the goal is in a straightforward vision (and not moving). But hey, when you are in real danger, there is nothing that will save your life like a good one-fish ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the moments that can not explain when Cop, Steve, He knows how to deal with the problem, the variobolite, when it changes, it goes away, that VERBOL is coming for the girl who is now with her, and she can not There's. But sure, it lets the makers finish more ... <br /> <br /> But other actors in any other movie do not seem to try any other effort. Well <br /> <Well /> Well. To give a short conclusion: I recommend not a movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
