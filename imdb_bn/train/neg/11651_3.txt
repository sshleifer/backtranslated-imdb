In less than a year, the film can explain its shortcomings (81 minutes - with the last credit, so the actual movie about 76 minutes). But it can not be explained that the lack of the previous film's lack of light <br /> <br /> Gag is quick and sometimes fun. The only real part is the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods's Exxist's Mac Van Psydor's Character Screenplay and Bit and Piece Spread Through Film The attempt of Charlie's Angels was closed, which was the first horror movie and matrix scene to spin off, essentially re-establishing the scene without much humor. <br /> <br /> Today's young man can not be related to 70's obscene incarnations of exotic supernatural horror films and perhaps 80's 'pollutarists' etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hopefully scary movie 3 will take some time to sit together, which will make spoofs more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, though, more than the end of the movie promise, more than the younger actress Anna Faris (whom I admit to be very hot in Segalel). Just giving her the casting and acting ability, I give "3" out of this movie "10".
