Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams, I think it is necessary for the film to appear on the first screen. Wow ... I can not imagine more mind-drunk movies. Basically, the movie takes a bad joke after the other that your uncle Arti will tell you after dinner and make them dramatic. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in 30 second skits. <br /> <br /> I'm all for a satirical laugh, but this humor was not fun, or rivaled ... it was just minded. Apart from Robin Williams, there is no freedom fighter in this movie, like me who only want to keep every part of the film in their own hands.
