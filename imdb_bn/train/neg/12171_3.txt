Having a slasher film aficionado, I will usually sit down to see every slash movie I pass on my retinas, which causes a better damage than my brain, I will say. When the channel was surfing the other night, Slipway Camp II had to come out with me. Of course, I heard of the slideway camp franchise, but I did not want to see it, but really nobody was seen in them (for shame, I know). I think that since I did not see the original, my criticism should not be taken very seriously because I think it is wrong, totally deliberate by the franchise's own design. <br /> <br /> Now I I think the Slopeway camp franchise itself is a joke. Hell, even the name comes close as a deliberate joke. Shibir sleeping away? It's good fun. I can only appreciate the film for seeking a few together for the awful pricing of the refined camp, but since I can go about. The performance of this movie is presenting Macbeth's original 13th figurative figure on Friday. Camps need bad acting, but come. Wicked out-of-touch-wheel realty killer with Pamela Springsteen did a better job than my interest in killing his whole interest. As long as the comedy goes away, I was shy a few times, but it was less and far away. Finally, Jack II is quite boring, and I really want to sleep in the camp. Deaths are definitely the stage and the mesh that you can barely appreciate them. If you are looking for a slashar film comedy with good camp, I recommend the club's draw. If your channel surfing takes you across this one, check it and see what happens.
