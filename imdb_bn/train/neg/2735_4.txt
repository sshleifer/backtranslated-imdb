I thought it was not a great rap-cap episode that I saw (though my watch partner Brendan Fraser gave me a tissue at the moment ... * laugh *). Outside the continuous fragile "Coxism State" of Cox's Bazar, he was very nice to see, if he was for a short time. I also enjoyed trying to keep episodes included in the length of the character (or height, JD case) and the first episode of the young girl. How can I be good on the way to Chavie Chase / or Matthew Perry? The prototype chemical slides introduced (already acknowledged). The little side note, the song from the Janet-inspired Dance Montage (now stuck on my ground) was Martin Sexton's "Dinner".
