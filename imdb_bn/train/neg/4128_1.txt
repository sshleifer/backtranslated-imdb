This movie is the most terrible one I've ever seen. Only dialogue is not terrible, it does not end. You would think it is finished, but it does not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I do not know that I will never see it again. Someone who takes a romantic comedy, takes out the comedy, then decides to downplay the romance, leaving the pieces of the broof on the way to our screen. But do not take my word for it, find out how terrible this movie is.
