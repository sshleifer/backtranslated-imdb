Apparently Hollywood is simply paying a camera and the ability to talk to someone. This movie was mind badly in the movie. Welding was terrible, acting unclear, and holes filled with stories. Script? Who needs script? I was surprised that the film was not verbally odd as I used to think, but I got enough shot and enough shot to finish my life. This movie was like listening to the 19-year-old street races, ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling a story. Due to such a bad writing, I thought the two brothers in the film were the first lovers. Respective scenes with the main female actors of the film forced me to think about Herbie: fully loaded. Such a greenhouse which later models itself ... Only authors think that they were serious.
