Thank God I saw this in a friend's place and did not pay for it. The plot is very transparent and the whole movie feels like an episode of a TV show. You have no knowledge of computer or electronics, see. You would think your intelligence seems as an insult. <br /> <br /> Also, actress has turned many music into VJ Apart from Amanda Walsh porn pornography, what I saw shows the worst performance. He is lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. She is the one that carries the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate watching this movie almost two hours of my life has been lost! It's a shame that they could call it a signal, because I was a fan of the original, which was really good.
