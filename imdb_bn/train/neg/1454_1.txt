I recently saw this movie twice, and I do not understand why the makers * will make this rib. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler & # 39; s environment and I mean that they reproduced Austria during WWI and inter-war times, at the end of 1890. I do not understand why they portrayed Hitler as 100% purely evil, crazy, unfaithful, mentally unstable embryo. He was certainly the very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man after all his dark sides, no doubt. But why does his name in heaven represent him? All his positive aspects have been spun out of the scene, which is nothing but a very prominent figure of a man who has the greatest effect on modern civilization. Yes, he drove Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was a racist, and yes he was particularly restless at the end of the war. All true. But again; Why were they available to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was that they were able to come to power at the moment of global weakness. This wickedness is so well recognized that still almost every German living (not referring to Austria and referring to other people) warns it of modern civilization, in fact Hitler was not as 'weird'. If it is like the makers, we have to believe - I am sure that the Germans were barricades. A man like one in this movie never got anywhere near the party's leader - not to mention Reichsangler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
