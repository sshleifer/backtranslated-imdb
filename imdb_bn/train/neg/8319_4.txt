Pretty unexpected If you have seen a movie in the last ten years and there are few interesting parts (where someone uses relevant sources in the decision-making) and there is a lot of secret, 'twists' all seem to be beautiful. 'These formulas were shown before explaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> acting is good enough. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole 'still awake' premises are canceled by inorganic projection stuff (not fun). <br /> <br /> Surgery is primarily intense, slightly uncomfortable, but then completely disabled. <br /> <br /> Not awesome, but not memorable. To date Terrence Howard's least interesting role, as far as I've seen <br /> <br /> Boring, overall.
