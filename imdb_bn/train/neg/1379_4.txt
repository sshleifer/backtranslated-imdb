Monica Mitchell Showbie has some hilarious humorous and some premeditated violence. I do not say bloody; But there is humiliation and injury. Max Mateo (John Casini) is a character actor, who has a playful adaptation on the screen, but there are a great track record for choosing the parts that follow. It seems to be an instant trivial reason for a producer's nephew or to prevent him from giving him the role he has. Well, the best thing is to get rid of the competition ... Max is obsessed with this kind of thinking. Fruitful career is just a swing, push and shot away. Other cast members: Ryan Reversa, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beales, Frank Casini and Erie Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's business to show ... or what?
