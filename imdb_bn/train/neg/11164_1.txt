<br /> <br /> This picture was trying to copy the comedy 'Cutting Edge', but the direction and script was gentle, ill and sensitive in the tradition of the worst movie. The acting / role of Jack Black was self-motivated and self-related ... and other characters were equally disrespectful and selfish. The soundtrack was tedious. We (WERE) are fans of Black but none of us have had more than mandatory titter approval for the duration. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The script before signing up for this drivel?
