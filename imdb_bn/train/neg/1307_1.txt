It was really a very bad movie. I'm a good fan of Italian Horror, Argentina, Mario Bava, Phukchi and Hammer, sometimes our best friend Lamberto came out with a good one. I found the first two 'demons' movies to be very entertaining - they were very bad, they were very good, but that's really bad that it's really bad. This is very annoying, the story never goes anywhere, and I hate the characters - the wife who hates husband and the pain of the baby crying *** The wife made me crazy, the story given in Ogre was not quite close, perhaps the best film is the best actor. I turned off about three quarters because I was very annoyed! Do not disturb.
