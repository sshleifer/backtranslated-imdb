I kept this movie on my style for a while in Milk Creek, and one night I decided to see it; Although not much hope. As I roll around the beginning credit, I am surprised this film is made under the company Filmirage. This kind of amazing stinkers in the world of Filmya brought "Troll 2", "At The Engineer", and "Quest for the Magnificent Sword", so I was forced to see. <br /> <br /> As the movie started it was even though it was unreasonable, could be quite decent. Gore scene has been enhanced and more frequently if they expand. But after a while in the film, it began to pull in speed and I myself thought that "anyone who dies sooner or better", or "someone is good mutate". At the beginning of this drag, when I used to think about these things, although some have been killed or changed, it is mentioned that gore and influence were not very good. What was worse was the transformation of the scene was confusing; Example: Dr. Hussmann will be in the zoo, then perhaps he'll get a flash to kill someone, finally he wakes up in the cold sweat on the bed - asked the audience "Did he dream that he was the zoo?". Like motion of the movie, the infection of this scene has become worse. <br /> <br /> I want to say that, Dr. Hussein's character was very good, but at the end of the film, once saw how the doctor has transformed, hopefully you will laugh - actually, the only reason to watch this movie at least once; This film is unknowingly like a long wind like a lip. <br /> <br /> The um's clothing, which becomes DoorHouseman, can also be found in Joe Di Amato's "Search for the Mighty", which was created in the same year. You will love Filmirage movie, they're always using the same thing again!
