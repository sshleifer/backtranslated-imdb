The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a jump "la plane"! (Actually, two years ago - is going good.) When vegetables, or fruit attacks in this case, what will happen. <br /> <br /> Through all types of magic (star speed, tomato on skateboards on papier-mash skins, reverse filming, on-screen tomato observation, people throwing basketball-shaped tomato on-screen actors), tomatoes actually hit their green leaves Do it. <br /> <br /> Then, I do not want to save a day from a government side on Mason Dixon (Miller) and Gupt's group. Of course, a disastrous reporter (Taylor) who pops in the worst times, dances and Gyen army soldiers, Japanese scientists dragged closer to the dawd-voice, some people parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, San Diego chicken raises it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, you could probably better yourself after seeing this. Somewhat neutral in the dialogue ("pass the ketchup" - there is nothing to say in front of the tomato). And as far as "love for young" goes away ... Well, I can not blame Tomato for suppressing it. <br /> <br /> is it good? Well, I like the theme song and the credit at the beginning, and there was a scene with four people on the phone which was perfectly well executed. ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. A "killer" is not a comedy, but it tries. <br /> <br /> On the Rock, peace.
