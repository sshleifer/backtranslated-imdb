Good night, Mr. Tom started in an unlikely fine village in the south of England where the sun seems to always be bright. We hear many announcements of a radio announcement of World War II before we get much idea of ​​this period. Soon, a train to run out of steam cloud brings refugees to London and when the shy little William is reluctant, we are billeted with the older Tom (who knows you have a gold heart), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And it's a load of an intricate cliptop. Actually it's just an old strange friend friend. No new story is written? <br /> <br /> I think there can be no other time in the village and there is nothing more in London, blurred around the strange old ambulance. And there is no indication of the bleat blight like the citizens of London that fortunately the air-raid files were filmed. Even the local school teacher's husband was declared absent, but later he was brought back to life. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Good night, Mr. Tom' is clear and clear, and John Tha's pronunciation depicting Roni Barker's photo <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> One minority <br /> <br />
