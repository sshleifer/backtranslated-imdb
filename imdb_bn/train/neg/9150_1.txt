I actually made the big mistake of watching this whole movie a few nights ago. God I'm still trying to recover This movie does not deserve even 1.4 average. 0 ratings rating for IMDb is definitely needed for movies that are really like this. A 1.4 too high. <br /> <br /> <br /> I've heard how bad this movie was, but I do not really think that a movie can really be bad, especially in this day and age. I think all the Chess goddess horror movies were in the 1950s and 1960s. My god was wrong i was Believe me, this movie is really bad. It is terrible to be overcome; It is out of pain; It's beyond any kind of words that I can think of. Butfieldfield looks like the year's best photo than this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (as far as I was the worst movie I ever saw) looks like it deserves some Oscars in comparison to this kind of effort. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that these filmmakers thought it was a legitimate attempt to create a Hollywood movie. This is no movie being called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was looking at some high school theater classes to try to make a small film. Or better yet, I had to skit live ripoff live on some Saturday night in real things. I mean, it looks just like that. Acting is terrible; The whole movie is shown with a 20-year old VHS video camera. Special Effect ....... Well the good Lord had better special effects than this movie from back to the day. Get rid of humor and chessy outside the door where she gets the shot. I would like to say seriously, my role of acting class 4 years ago in college, we all could have made such a good film. And the worst part of the whole film is where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. O my God I am almost right up to I have a strong stomach, but wow was awesome. Some people will not be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this movie can not go anywhere. They talk about legal issues that we have never heard; Talking about Ben's song that we can not hear again; Arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is that he is running a porn store. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to do with this criticism, but so everyone knows, I am not homosexual. I support gay rights and believe that all of us should be treated equally. And I will support a gay man in my church, against the cruel priest of this church, just as all other words seem to be brief. (Where is F * (# * INS white?) Ahhah but I do not want to remind anyone that I hate this movie because it is about two gay boys because it does not have any connection with it: it will be <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I could read. It should be cautious for everyone: just look at this movie, if you just want to sit and the 21st century Do some trouble And you can laugh at the movie but you can laugh. If you look at this movie and actually expect a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you. <br /> <br /> A final thought: 7 movies at IMDB Below it? There are 7 movies here. Worse than that!
