I have always been passionate about the drama of the times, which is an art form which has been excelled in the BBC's past. "Byron" This presentation was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was awesome, acting uninspired, and all characters woefully insipid Byron apparently was "harmful, bad and dangerous", and set women's hearts all-in-one blurred. Do not produce this. Here he played a little kiss with women instead of Greek struggle for a burning hero and freedom. Say it went with a tall outsider. This picture was scattered throughout life. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for a half-and-a-half-hour life. Do not make a splutter, even a glimmer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Should be blurred on, and this dramatization of his life should be treated the same. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost her nous with this
