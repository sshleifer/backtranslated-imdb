Sith's revenge begins without a long long program which is not very exciting, impressive, then it becomes really annoying for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrific dialogue and the other bits of the previous series that frustrate. The only thing to improve the proceedings is slow - and I mean slow down - build-up, which we know, it will be the birth of a friend of the dude. And when it finally comes, it's fair. Not great Not even good But everything is fine. This movie is widely praised because it does not suck in the upper heaven like the previous sequences. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you would say, wow, those CGI are really impressive at the time of the environment. What is lightbreaker war? They all have a blurry mess. I think the dark side holds Lucas when he started this prikel and nobody noticed. It will earn a ton of money, but thanks to the end of God, this once worshiped franchise has been beaten quite a lot. I saw 12:01 shows, and then, I heard a group of very young kids, wow! But everyone aged over eight years thought the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of annoying. I thought Darth Bhadar would be better. So we all said so.
