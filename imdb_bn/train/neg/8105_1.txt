Hash, yes, but I want to see it, as I see. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the end of the 80's, and it's really the most horrific, annoying movie that I've ever compelled myself to see. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. Check settings are really stunning Political Backdrop is provocative, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (such as _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), it can be even interesting with the story of politics. <br /> <br /> Obviously, oily and delightful to love. But this film managed to plodding and slow even "erotic" scenes. I'm for romance, but this movie was so annoying, I hope the Russians will shoot all of them and end my grief. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that if I read the book, the story will be a bit more knowledgeable. However, life is too short to spend too much time on this.
