A installment of this infamous Guinea Pig series. A young Japanese TV show, inspired by the assassination of a young schoolgirl by the show, was canceled after admitting that a psychopath admitted. This series is consistently like all the other series in the series, without a story, practically. A group of boys has been caught in a young girl. They stopped him and at the time of his death, he came forward. They beat him, poured hot oil on him, using the player on him and finally, "loving" closeup, pushing a needle through his eyes. This is the simplest of all guinea pig films and the first one. It was probably the film, more than any other, which rumored to be the destruction of the Guinea pigs. They must have inspired Nicholas Cage's film "8mm". This movie has got quite popular in horror circles. They have more polished, but evenly graphic movie "nude blood" has progressed. They will probably fill the remaining filling of the remaining Mando films, which have become slightly clearer and reality turned into TV. Not recommended, but perhaps those who will see them wonder, and wonder why I know I did it.
