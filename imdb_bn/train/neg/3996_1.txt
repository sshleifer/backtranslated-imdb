I do not see what everyone likes about this movie. The set-up was very long and playful and after completion of it, the main character, like the first character, was flat and vague. The film finally got Cusack in the hotel room called, I was surprised, well, what is going to happen here in the next hour or so to work for me. Answer: Too much, just John Cusack has long, drawn-out, psychological breakdown. <br /> <br /> If possible, there is a depth of Cusack character. . Maybe his scary was more thoroughly recycling his daily life out. . . Perhaps the film developed half-baked themes of good damage and trust, or did not use it in the first place. . . Perhaps if the image prefers to be psychological horror or excitement, and completely embraces one of these styles. . . I do not know. I know that I saw this movie seeing two other dangerous buffers and none of us like it. <br /> <br /> It's a bore, along with the frustrating episode of the hotel borders, as well as dangerous crazy ladies with hammers, and so stupid-it-funny crypt protector in the air pipe, three minutes of five minutes, which is not a screen time. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to have stolen the idea from shining and used to use them very less powerful effects here. Stephen King now has to steal the idea from himself?
