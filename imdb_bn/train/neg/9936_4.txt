I picked up this for 50 Cent at Pisa Market, was quite excited. <br /> <br /> I got impressive for it for about 15 minutes, then just repetitive and dull. <br /> <br /> It's clear showing Mick and Gang are their main, I did not have so much on the dubbing dialog, so I could say what to say and play. <br /> <br /> skits written politically and incredibly naive and easy, sort of ill-used Monty Python Acid. I spent more time than England in the late 1960s than dropping, then how is it actually happening in stupid skating? <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that changes frequently and which are very easy to make early. Innocent Good music, but it is now executed by this DVD.
