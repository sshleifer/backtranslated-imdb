This movie has been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to Russia to rent (2007) and accidentally got it. I thought it was a joke before the real movie. This was terrible I was waiting for it to get scary and it does not. This movie was not real information about the real Russian killer. Filmmakers are annoyed with some research on the killings even ... They just chose the name ... so they decided to write a script about something true in his name. I'm getting bored, I did not understand that this movie was not too soon. I try to like something from every movie, I do not hate movies ... sometimes ... without it. If you could give it no stars, I definitely have it. 10 out of 1
