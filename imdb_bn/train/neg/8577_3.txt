I knew my summary was about to get you. How is this movie like a pet rock and disco? Well, if you were not in the 1970's and 80's, you probably would not understand why someone would love the new coke or own a pet dog (and at least, at least in pet rock, I still can not fully understand it). They were just a few of the things that expressed feelings at this time but really bothered the young generation. Kay Kayyer and his band could be called the same. At that time (most of the 1940s), they were very popular and the studio in this film starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter LÃ¶hr. Even so, if you did not live at that time (it was good before my time), you wonder why such a "entertainment" is preferred. Finally, Kaiser and his band companion is incredibly irrational and their humor is very broad (i.e., illogical and greasy). Actually, I could not protest against Antrix, and I was not too grateful that there was too much musical numbers in this film. Due to these reasons, a seat seat was cast for great supporters Cast and fans of these actors would probably be frustrated. <br /> <br /> In this picture, Kaiser and the band are coming to a palace where a young girl and her pains live aunt. Once there, the bridges are washed off and weird start up. Finally, it ends with some efforts of Sally's life and a sensor (type). It is all played for the sunny - and it really does not have a horror movie despite casting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the best entertainment. As Logosi and Karloff Fan, I'm sure that Keizer and his duplicate headlines have received treachery.
