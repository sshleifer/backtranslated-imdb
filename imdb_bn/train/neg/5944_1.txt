Not just my style, this straight-to-DVD street fight is a result of only one friend when we had a few beers. I am a relatively open psychologist and Emanon Walker's most fan, so I was ready to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fighter for unfounded reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah <br /> <br /> What a tiring picture I understand that such films do not depend on the plot, but do they have to be stupid in a stupid, predictable and utter stupid story? It can not be important, but it disturbs me by the lane gum. A plot is better than any plot and pure work than a clichche-ridden flebag mongrel. Compact with a completely neutral and unusual senseless drill, it is a thin-skinned Turkish counterpart with a synthetic equivalent of a silver heart. I should probably mention at this point, of course, the film's drawing points: the war. Even in itself, war is rather poor. The bones are firmly established in the fifty-fifty people to find the fighters of the road (a big or two filmmakers make a laughable attempt to correct this inconsistency); The warriors who do not think they attack one after another are stupid. Even this repetitive and stupid, broken arms and facing kicked with an endless laziness we get to see time and time again. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And even especially well.
