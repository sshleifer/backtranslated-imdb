A very tough attempt at a young spine tube. At least the music was good at the spinal tap. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most tragic events of Hollywood Nepotism at worst. A bunch of Hollywood actors, bad musicians and producers create some "poopie" shows so that their kids can be spotlights. Please!!! Potty comics were even worse. I really hate this thing in these incredible talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) when their boots blur to be successful and this shit comes along. <br /> <br /> Help all !!!! Why was not Jim Simmons ??? The American's taste in entertainment is going down in the toilet.
