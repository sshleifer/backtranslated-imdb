20 or 30 minutes gone when you ever sat while watching a movie and suddenly you realized that you actually watched the movie before? That happened to me with "The Young Graduates" The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, it is very deceitful. I swore that there were two women in Dhaka and not even in movies. <br /> <br /> However, I have been born for a lovely point or gratitude of this movie for a decade ... It is simply dumb-free junk. I'm leaning intensely towards the next but I guess some of this movie has improved a connection. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot A land Let's see ... there's a plot around here. No, I can not find it. It is quite a few of the high school senior who are acting in Dope and making drugs and talking a language about a decade ago. One of the female students has a crusher on her teacher. The teacher's terrible wife (whom he actually mentions as an ice) is therefore acceptable for the girl's progress. <br /> <br /> There are many near-driving and remarkable dialogues and lots of dancing dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was transfixed by dance high school kids. Dancers became dancing and laughing with the amazing intensity. It is nice to see that at least one species found interesting things in this chaos. 1/10
