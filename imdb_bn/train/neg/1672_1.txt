This is the only movie I have ever seen that inspired me to write criticism on an internet site, and a significant statement that likes the "Attack of Monolith Monsters" This movie is perfect for those who want a silly movie. It is sexual and violence, for example, irrespective of I believe this movie is safe for all ages. This movie does not want to be humble, challenged or incited for any person. Adults can easily sleep in front of the TV when they see this movie. But do not be surprised if you turn off the kids' TV and start a board game, then you will wake up. As an adult who enjoys for entertainment, those who reflect the real life from the world and / or all the adult things that stimulate imagination, which brings everything from the movie into real, drama, comedy and action. Offer.
