The only thing that prevented me from seeing this movie was that it was not just an actor and a fakak show that is usually seen on TV shows. Fans of the TV show will not like the movie, but the only reason is not. This movie has as much entertainment value as the main bread canal. This leads to the shallow depth of making bad movies and even worse. I will not waste your time while describing this film in more detail; Not saying that I have expressed regret over the poor cameras who suffered the first time seeing this c ** pt.
