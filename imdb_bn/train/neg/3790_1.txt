I do not really post comments, but make sure to warn people from this movie. It is an incomplete student film with no redeeming properties. At the technological level, it is completely amateur-scenic steady editable edits, wildly closing etc. Plot is fully clipped, the structure is ridiculous and the acting is shameful. I do not want to be too strict: I made films of students, and they were all horrible, but these ruthless fans of the world should see that there is no reason outside the world. <BR> <br /> Safe sense - Cast like - Positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
