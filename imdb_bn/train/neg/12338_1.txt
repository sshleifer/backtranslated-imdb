When I watched this movie mainly at the theater at the age of 10. Even at that age the 'joke' was objectionable to my teenage intellectuals. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I see Ed Begolly Junior Or Jeff Goldblum I will start feeling cringe and very uncomfortable even a little sad. Until today, remembering the existence of this movie, I was uncertain why I felt this way. Apparently I've blocked my memory of this movie but my negative feelings towards the criminals still remain. Apparently I have forgotten that I have seen this movie but unconsciously have mourned the pieces of my soul that have been stolen, or eaten by the creator of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I'm brave to try to see it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process I might be able to face the fear of childhood so that I will really keep it behind me. Some feedback therapy and / or hypnosis can not be a bad idea.
