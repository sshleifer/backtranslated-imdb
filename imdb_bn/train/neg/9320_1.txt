If this image is a comedy then I could give it 10. Oh, where do I start? Keep this in the same way - I've seen many horror films, but it looks like a troll 2 that Frankin's savings are private ryan. A group of pornographic filmmakers decided to create a horror film, changed their minds into middle production and decided to make a comedy, then the scary went back, and then decided that they should be stuck in porn (it's softcore). Everything is terribly terrible about this movie: Musical score (someone shot on the man found on the keyboard), scripts, instruction, painting, acting. Simply have no words describing this. Oh wait, yeah: Holy $ *%!
