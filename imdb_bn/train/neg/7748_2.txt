This movie was quite bad. Sci-Fi is usually my favorite channel so I see all the original movies that play it. I do not really know if this movie can not be called the original. A zoo / a theme park on a remote island is quite familiar. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But instead there are subthath tigers. <br /> <br /> This movie starts looking for some wealth with some of the children of some of the storatological colleges on an island. One of them ended up to die a rather terrific death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. Looked like a lot of blood ketchup. There is also a scientist at the beginning who wants to bind his teeth as much as possible to enjoy the person. Three of them have already escaped and tourists are nearing food, or the tigers were invited to the island to see their first hand. Again, words like Jurassic Park Perhaps the coolest thing was the 1,000-plus Saber's tooth, which stood on its front legs, and killed the mad scientist with a tooth statue, as the way they are frustrated and the boys go through the neck. <br /> <br /> Acting is very impressive, terrible effect. The CGI Tiger could pass for the soil model, even some words were closed. For example, when college students are trying to flee, he uses the ax to break the door, goes to the door of the ax and you hear the word after about 2 seconds. This movie was quite bad. Sugar death was quite funny though.
