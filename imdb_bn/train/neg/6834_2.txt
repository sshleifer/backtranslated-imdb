G, no movie head! ... I said, I wanted to be an expert in bad movies for decades, so I decided to start such a thing. It was a pretty adequate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces, but I could not see anything of this pastel-colored mess. I have not seen many bad films before, but I got this feeling that seems to be "so bad that's good", maybe it's funny funny! First of all, there are errors. Plot errors, physical defects, and psychological defects are also there. Especially later on Van Damme's ass cheeks are as insane as blue spandex. Very strict line exists very much and I will not even start to talk about some of the pleasurable action steps. Without a special case, there is absolutely no bad performance from everyone involved in the film's hot world. Jaffrey Lewis looks completely kind as Frank, which is a totally stupid character. And, to tell the truth, I'm really surprised to see that Van Dam has done a good job by which the couple is playing. He was successful in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles of my firm belief. But the movie was mostly very bad and sadly it was produced by a major motion picture studio ... which is now bankrupt
