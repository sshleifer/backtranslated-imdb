I want to say that there is no mistake with low budget movies, so this is not my problem. My problem seems to me as if I were watching movies of my neighbor's neighboring house. Everything in the IMO looks like a person wrote a quick story, got a camera, and started shooting. I understand how difficult it will be to implement, but when I pay for renting a movie, I think I see some kind of professionally produced movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was a great actor, and this movie was fine. There were no other people in it. I understand how it should be fun, and it is cheap to use as a cast for friends and relatives, but it is not too strong to act. It seems like a shot, he tried to give many scenes a more attractive look, but when writing, plot and acting began, that type of style is not necessary and it is a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also at a technical level, it was digitally handmade in all places. In the first scene of these fine cars, when they scanned their slow speed, they were just a little behind. The problem is not on my viewing devices (Bennak P-8700 84 "Diagnal") but for the production of somewhere. I have never seen such artifacts before in a professionally produced film. Then the word was there. They do not make a voice-over, that can not be fit until it is like a movie track. It's a camera built-in microphone.
