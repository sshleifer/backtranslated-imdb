Film-school intellectuals can stir up everything they want about the important (imaginative) meaning of this film, but it only: intellectual conflict. This image is creatively bankrupt, and some mistakes are endless self-motivated wanking as it substances. Yes <br /> <br /> Clearly, Goddard Stones was not a fan. Very bad, because this can be great. He is born of this timeless song, and instead he likes to keep the music covered with true intelligence mag or some people falling from the cone. <br /> <br /> Then librarians of 60 have spray-painting sounds impossible to see like human cars. And then there is a seemingly neutral "interview" where the actress was instructed to answer yes or no not only for all deep and intellectual questions. Some dude in a purple suit is read more punk than a book, which, oh, goes for only about 20 minutes. And some of the black panthers or a junkyard. <br /> <br /> It seems almost playful? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, instead of the English man, watching the cover of Nudi Magazine, this movie is truly a winner! <br /> <br /> More accurately ... Maybe the gordaid just hit.
