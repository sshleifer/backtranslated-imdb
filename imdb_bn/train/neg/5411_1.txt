I think that movie is a big fan. I'm still thinking about this long and hard, seven minutes after fully roaming the credit. I really disrespect my neurons, trying to understand the relevance of the nude girl's plot for her sticky oily body, portrayed in the cheap video and made extra durable. This occurs three times and I'm sure it will be explained at the end. I believe in film makers that this cruel attempt to nurture the audience will be fair. It was not. <br /> <br /> I got the most gambling in this movie. Set in the middle of the 1970s, the concept of one of the cross and sponge-painted Living rooms corruption. The light is unimaginable (if your set is going to get worse, at least hide the plasterboard in the dark and create some ambiance). Around the abducted, the girl has stood as a special hair, but none of them possesses personality. Alliance plans are simply stupid for world domination - all of them have a birth control pill and their problems are resolved. Most of the films are running under the poor. Yes, it's really that exciting. The "ray gun" special effect ... to say weird (at least one weapon that is used to kill a 15-second infected explosion and even the man comes back more?). The script is like a bad episode of the TA team, and women's hairstyles have come in the same age, so they look like homicide attackers like a school teacher instead of a team in advance. We finally see how the aliens look, they are in suspended animation and do not even get out of their boxes. Solutions of the story - There are only a few words of traitor Alien, which invades the Navy invader and has turned his head away without second thought - a writer's sign that was not more complicated than the cartoon on Saturday morning (I think a plot, action, or characterization Including) in his own life <br /> <br /> But seriously, what is with the naked dog ?! Was it really that they could set up a DVD cover to increase sales?
