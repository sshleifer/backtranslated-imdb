If you waste a lot of time ... it's okay. It moves at a good speed, but to stop this film, it needs to be slightly more with a bit more background. <br /> <br /> Playing OK. Mariana Clenvo works best as a seater and is most credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The end is like ignorance. This is like most movie genres ... interesting parts ... but overall it makes you wonder why you spent time.
