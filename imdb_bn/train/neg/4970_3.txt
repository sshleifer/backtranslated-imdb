Best wishes, I read this evening in the film when I was writing papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one respects such a respect. The Icelandic "baulfuf and granelle" I'm the least objectionable, and I've paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Saiffi version has got its place with Christoph Lambert. Ek <br /> <br /> I did not like it? CGI for one Wonderfully bad. More importantly not to mention the story of credibility, stilted performance. I've used both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Regardless, Peter
