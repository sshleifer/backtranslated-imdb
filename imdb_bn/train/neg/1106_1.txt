Do not waste your time on this draw. As illustrated, there are no redeeming values ​​for the characters and observers watching them obscure. The "Gothic" was at least entertainment, this shit. If you like to see the insulting and humiliated poets disinterested in watching each other's deviations, but it can fix your groove. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete shake and why it is worth spending more than five minutes with others, really ridicule. Marie Shelley seems to be the only character with no spine, but even she comes without tears beyond completely irrationality. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I look forward to another movie based on the same subject, but do not take the title. I had this, but such a fate was expected. Not recommended.
