This image is self-motivated trash. If you just want to listen to spoken vocabulary or enjoy a pleasant soundtrack, check out this movie. Look for any other reasons and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but not - it's just boring. Character careers are poor and poorly played. The story is also ruthless and horrific in the film. I was expecting an impressive family film but this was no application for my fourteen year old girl. It is rarely that I can not see a movie in its conclusion, but it makes us both better. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is set to the present time, it has an earlier look and feel. The European film made during the cold war. Not enough to free it through fantastic Scottish scenery and cinematography. A real shame because it is an embarrassment to Scotland as a movie.
