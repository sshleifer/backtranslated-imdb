I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to see it like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her first films. <br /> <br /> This film is for the loss of a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who has gone from NYC to LA. After coming to a person fallen in love with her, it is clear that she has a mischievous Twin = Doppelanger, who frustrates her. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite poor and shy. Both dialogue and acting are not really worth watching. For fans of dress Barrymore it's just a little something.
