This is not a good film. Acting is remarkable and incredible. The film is not going to be a terrible method or it seems to go down the camp and kitch route. I have never seen the first film, but it can not stand with its capabilities, many are not aware of the importance of a disgruntled plot twist and the ever-lead female vampire. Attempts are not worth the effort
