How nice. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood of a bad b-horror movie and I found this jewel. I looked at the cover and I think it looked just like the movie for my mood. I brought it home and made it. <br /> <br /> This movie was B-Hora's movie which I remember. It was a lot worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I found, I do not know that such a bad man exists in people. This movie seemed like 5 years old and it was managed and it was great for her and it was great for her. <br /> <br /> I am an aspiring director and this film has made me so mad that someone is actually giving money to this person directly in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll tell you the same thing that I'll be ready for someone's suicide. "Do not do it, it does not work!" I really have nothing better to say about this movie. Do not do it!
