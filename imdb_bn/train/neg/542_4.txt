At first there is a Gujarati theater in Bollywood. Both have their strength and fan following. While producing Bollywood, director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarat Theater. Firstly, he made Aakhen (adapted from a Gujarati game) - which had a unique plot, but was not considered as a Hindi film. Now he is adapted to play another Gujarati and it is known as a wakt - a nation against time. In short, the emotions are alien. The development of the plot is not for Hindi cinema. For example, playing the role of father and son is the best in the Gujarati theater - it does not bring in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track left well at the Gujarat level. All Performance Average - There is nothing but almost screaming - Who is fantastic without shading shadows.
