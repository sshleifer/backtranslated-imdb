If you want to see a disabled gay sex worker, but repeatedly tries to work hard for the Mexican gangsters, then it's a movie for you. If not, then select another DVD from the 20c bin that this movie is the only place. The acting was so intense that I had to force myself to see me till the end. The cover looks so cool, but it's just another cheap, B-grade gangster film 2G and a key, along with bloody streetz and hazard. Do not buy or rent this movie unless you plan on getting stones and plots, performing and acting is not really important to you. This is really the worst film in the history of humanity !!!
