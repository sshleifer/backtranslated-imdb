Yes, I was lucky to see the long-running real production of Michael Bennett's hit musical instrument. It's a wonderful experience and when I hit the theater in 1985, I paid for watching the movie. It's awful. Almost everything fails. First off, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) was a sorry choice - almost as bad when John Houston was mixed with ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut the song and casting !!! They were horror - theater of drama, this dancer - the hungry, talented actors want an opportunity to show what they can do and when they get the opportunity - you can not close their eyes. But this act only gets by dance, sings a "nice" work but none of them is a sparkle spark. Actually, add custom to IMDB - none of them are really going to do a lot. (Okay, okay, Janet Jones got married to Greggie-Shesh). So this movie trainware does not hold the passion, frustration, emotional emotion of the stage for one second. A total strike out! (Even though they try to deceive the music - the great music sometimes increases and reminds people how good the score is).
