It was ridiculous that this movie was so bad. Although I could not resist watching it though. The plot is quality, acting is quite horrible (good actor supporting actor as a nutritional neighbor and lawyer friend). If you have time to waste and you see the conclusion of a dramatic plot, it is interesting. <br /> <br /> The title was simply interesting because playing "Cathy" did not make me decide whether his corpse would affect the flat whether it was a bad surgical result or just bad acting (I decided it was both). The script page to comment on this, which was quite awful. Pat comment, stupid decision, and stupid stupidity in each of the characters in the film. Maybe this was what was so riveting; I do not know. I just saw it could be bad to see it. (Actually the dialogue does not qualify as a "clich√©" - but it is almost completely inactive.) <br /> <br /> All, very bad, cheaply made movies. Set, shown in the same scenery (a house, a building), along with an artist or actual tie-in; More like props that have been omitted randomly in the action of a bad game. A chasing scene or an old school can be shot by a chase in a chase: bad shots, cheap props, short actions .... and I still wanted to see the end. Go figure
