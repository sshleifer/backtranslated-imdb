I've never seen the worst movie ever seen. I never wanted to delete the Last Action Hero, but it is easy. This movie is about 3 unique boys who meet on weekends to discuss weekly on their weekends. A fourth man - is married and - who was used as a part of the group and discusses what he and his wife did. Nothing works in this movie. Humor is not funny but they are repeated throughout the film. The big capsule ridiculous at the end of the movie. To avoid all costs.
