I saw this movie at Sundance in 2006 and I was amazed at how bad it was, although I was excited to see it based on the details of the catalog. It is being speculated that the students of two high school making a documentary in high school schools have a "musical", poor performance, poor instruction, complete lack of written letters, and total shoots everywhere. I love good movies about high school, and it's not one of them. The letters are one-dimensional and self-consciously "cool" although they are supposed to be excluded. You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making bad films deliberately to show their friends, however, it went to the sandens. Mystifying
