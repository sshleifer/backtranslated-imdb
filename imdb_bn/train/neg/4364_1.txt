I do not understand why this piece has been broken into pieces. The whole thing was the only saving grace of her sexy uniform Ariauna's body. Her humor is also appreciated. He has a specific plus but it will take a magician to rescue this garbage. However he will be positively recognized for his sperm effort and true professionalism. Can not say the same for her accompanying star Lilith with her whining voice that grates over her nervous system. Gave his impression that his attendance on the stimulating appearance and impression was only needed. Everyone except Arinana's performance said, this is really the stem.
