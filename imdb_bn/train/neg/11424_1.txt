I noticed "angry" was on the other night on the wire and I started to see it because I could not think of anything specific about it, except for remembering that it was a horror movie, when I saw it back in '85. The film is awful even after the twentieth century. In addition to the synthesizers, in the 1980s, pop music was the biggest abuse of Saxophone, as is clear in the title song. When I hear that song again, I want to wake up a screwdriver in my ear, so that they are mourned. And this musical attack played the character of Rob Greed played Saxon, and there was a scene where he played in the Walking Park and was like Charlie Parker, only his sharp tone and playing a monkey playing Kazu. All the characters were extremely strangers, although I must say they did a great job to throw off the unexpected actors to portray them. Actually I thought Murray Wienhingham was unemployed and I first felt sorry for his character because he used to have fun underwear, but then at the end of the film he decided to have sexual relations with Rob Loey's character, perhaps in most cases such things are cast on a sexual ailment. .
