The Christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film, but I was really disappointed. When they were finished, the VHS and DVD copies of the film were sold, which made me think that the producers were really proud of this project. As a screen actor I felt myself mostly in the phone in performance, although the Beau Bridge as Nick was in a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, then this film would not be better resigned to me otherwise. It was an embarrassing one. I was a fan from Walton's day, but I was relieved to see any work next to him, so this proposal was poor. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, the instruction was postponed, mechanical, and thoroughly amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope that it will not be considered negative reviews about my eligibility as critical reviews and critics. I made the movie because it was a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the film. But I will challenge anyone to watch this movie and I do not want to get back their money, even though it was on TV.
