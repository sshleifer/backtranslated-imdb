This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's worse than Dongguan and Dragon and Kevin Costa, a movie star.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > They did not look even though they were trying to work. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he can not simply transfer his talent to this film, which may laugh at two presses in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you're not seeing it, the film still avoids like plugs. Do some constructive and more interesting things to see the weather channel or dry paint on the brick wall. <br /> <br /> I can give it 2/10 for Chris's efforts <br /> <br /> <br />
