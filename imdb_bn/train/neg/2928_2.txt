I really wanted to see this movie, and wait a few months to get it through Blockbuster's total access account. When it shows up in our mailbox, I just put it in the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, which made me crazy. I want to give a movie, even if I want to get out of the theater / press 'stop'. I saw it all the way, but did not get anything from it but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good, but that was it. Nothing is explained; When we realized that Matthew was disappointed and got some land in the psychological region, we never saw his 'fall' insight. Although we understand that he and Cedric have broken, again we do not see it happening or why it happened. In an interview with Matthew's doctor, Cedric revealed that he once betrayed him, but it was not a big deal. I expected to see this in flashback, but nothing - nothing. We also got the indication that there was one to bring Matt to Cedric Hospital - but once again, we can not see it. <br /> <br /> I know that some movies are 'based on this', but this movie has really stopped me. When Pierre shows the former club of Cedric and gets into trouble, we can not finally hide or hide him, and it took me a while to play Peir's ex-ex-ex-character. His personality in the club and when Matt considers him completely different. I might say it wrong, it was confusing. <br /> <br /> The film hopes to know everything about you and to move it with its digital, out-space and confusing speed. I can live with movies like 'Pie', 'Citizen Cain' and other movies with Flashback / Flash-Forward left and right, but CE does not keep an eye on this style. At the end of Citizen's end, you know what you know and discover the answer to the main mystery. CE just hangs you away. Winds of wind in its context, 'We are not going to tell you a reprehensible thing, present it for yourself' presentations. It's like reading a book with chapters and pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I loved the characters, but the whole story was very frustrating.
