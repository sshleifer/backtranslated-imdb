This show did not do this for me, though I am a fan of this genre. The main reason I was disappointed was that there was not a single scene which was not influenced by the main character. It made a two-dimensional and I gave up the program before it was over. <br /> <br /> I'm hoping to get out of my criticism because I'm not a movie critic, but IMDB's guidelines say that you must keep the commentary line 10. The main character reminds me of Hudson Huq in every case and I hope the author of this program can use more diversity to connect with the audience. I do not doubt any cast and crew's talent, after seeing things like "cable only", I came to expect the great things of the hip-hop drama.
