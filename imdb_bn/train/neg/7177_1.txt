Since I like the original "caligula", even with all its flaws, I was unreal in this remake of this remake. <br /> <br /> If you talk about Jovvich, that lazy America will say, "Mim kualiyulaulah ..." I feel sick. This set is not seen in roman ... it looks like some rich actors behind the house behind the house of Hollywood, and you see Roman costumes like cheap cheap whips to buy in sub-city clothing stores. <br /> <br /> That "charming" Adriana Asti is completely afraid of her mind like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman, so it seems like she does not know a movie trailer. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> part of her usual dumpy crack-whore looks like herself against the mumbling about the moon or anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> Helen Mirren ... she was the original, and returned to her "keligula" ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!! !! " I especially love "love" (and I hate, by love) anew line, "Caligola ... J00 or Mackie i * some intolerable .... * Which sounds like jsnalo *" It's four of kaligula The very arrogant rule of the year was bigger than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have ever seen that it is the worst, most exploitative, autocratic, arrogant piece labeled as "art" labeled. Gore Bidlal hated the original kiln, even if he could not pay it for the amount of money, but how much was not paid for it (unless it is a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer.
