Many people seem to have liked this picture, so I think it's a bad idea that it's a bad review. But sitting in 96 minutes, I think I have to do this. Where is the plot in this picture? I had to miss it, I was waiting for the story to reveal and nothing happened. Surely the end was "somewhat frustrating" but they did not make it. I forgot who half the time, so they did not really develop the characters. It was so much that it was believable most of the time, but I was able to see it most of the time. So ... without giving anything away, I must say that if you do not like actors in the film then there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could have been wrong, but I did not understand why so little or too much of the film. I can not make any decision, so I call myself a judge. <br /> <br /> Plot 0/10 Characters 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Above: 3/10 I really feel like very high, I'm staying with my vote-up at the top.
