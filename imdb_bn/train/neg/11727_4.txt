I will not call it a terrible thing, but the film does not burn everything and it is involved in developing a somewhat incredible fundamental plot. It starts well, but once the main hit is completed, it enters a long maiden around a young girl, which is not compulsory, and some action scenes that weird unrealistic theater For example, the airport has protracted shootouts where the light is all stroboscopic No explanation for that. How reliable is the flashing and confusing flash of an airport storage area, and enough to give snippets its incredible exemptions? This is just a few steps view that has barely garnered set-ups, which fails to draw only one of the suspended beliefs. In addition to <br /> <br />, the entire court appears to be part of the United States CIA, shoot the place, but remove it by calling "national security" to Bright. This gimmick relies on a stereotype to be very far away from the reality. <br /> <br /> there are many good action movies there. Well formulated, well executed. It is entertaining at one time but does not have enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes annoying - something that can not happen in a good action movie.
