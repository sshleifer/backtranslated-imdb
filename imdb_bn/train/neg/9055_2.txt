I've listed this movie as Billy Bob Thornton and his expertise diversity, and I'm surprised that I did not hear about it. <br /> <br /> I've traveled normally both times. It was filmed in 2000 and it hit the theaters 2-1 / 2 years later. (The first time the production was not good with the production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayz can not work for sour apple, but Thornton has enough power to make up for the difference between them. And Charles Theron has seen anyone who would be happy to see it, even if she drew her painted paint. <br /> <br /> To be curious, I checked the product information on this site. It made $ 600 per screen in its first weekend, and more than just $ 400 after its month's theater ran in late 2002. Overall, there were a total of 261 kg, which I could cover in cast and crew hotels and for a week. Location <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is very nice, and the rest of the rest of the rest is usually used as a fun local. <br /> <br /> <br /> A lot of SNL bits all pins together, are not quite absolutely great, and the overall presentation is even worse. However, the cost of this product was enough - even if they were less feeble than usual - so one thing that made it a little tolerant, was the quality of the filming and the delivery of Bob (though his usual work Comparison with here is a little bit of lyric. <br /> <br /> Think of three superbly, fully different characters he portrays "sling blade," "bandits" and "bad Santa," and you know Below that he worked this below WA felt values, the audience had a chance to confirm this long ago. For him one star, even here, and one reason was better than production, generally, "Lifetime" Flick.
