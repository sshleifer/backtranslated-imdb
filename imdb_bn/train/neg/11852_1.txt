This movie was thought to portray a 'bedir man' bachelor, who was once ready and willing to live permanently for all. However, I could not postpone his mission, because I did not take care of his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women have seen. He was absolutely a class, or a charisma. She should have at least one way about herself, which makes women weaken by knee rather than her saxphon game, but there is no gain. Just because he is a singer is not sexy to him. Not to mention, he fell in love with the married woman who was about to focus five minutes, he was absolutely humiliating and ridiculous. Have these people ever been shy? She tidied up, and saying saying she's been more attractive as a character, but saying, her character was bland and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character was unnecessary British. He can easily become a laugh like a straightforward conversation with a regular commentary voice, which sometimes speaks poor British as it goes out of the movie. <br /> <br /> I took care that two letters were fish and frogs. Now there were two chemistry! Academy nomination for both ?? STAT! Plot holes, lack of character development, awesome acting, unnecessary plays, clutch moments ... a mess of a movie.
