This movie was pretty weird. There was some fun part. In my memory, Binte goes to the right-hand side of the movie where I think, "Hmm ... that was some interesting part of the movie, but overall, quite a ridiculous plot (or lack)." <br /> <br /> I think in my mind that Ben is trying hard to be a funny guy. And I could not understand how much he had been multi-millionaire, and still such stupid. However, I like Ben Affleck. He makes some shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I love Jersey Girl, I do not think Jigli was all his fault, I love him as a whole. I think it's a great kid like what you are feeling sorry for, he does not seem right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As they could not use. They deserve well. Overall, this movie is not alone, it is not a Christmas story, it is not one of Christmas holidays or other classic. Forget forever.
