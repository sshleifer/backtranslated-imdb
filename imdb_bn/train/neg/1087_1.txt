This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Movies do not live up to expectations while featuring good actors. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music that most of the movies upload: Familiar - good actor, loud and dramatic music compensates for a bad and confusing story. It does not change the truth, it is very annoying movie to see. Achieved 1 score yourself.
