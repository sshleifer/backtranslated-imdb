I rent this movie to DVD I knew that the promise I made in front of this case will not be alive, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunna Hansen) was in it, I had to hire it. It starts off pretty well, beginning to snuff the film that is being promoted on cable. However, nothing of his main character has nothing to be sorry for him, and the end of the movie really lets you hang him off. There are many unanswered questions. At the end was a great scene that made me wonder, but overall it was a very sub-movie, but I think it was worth the $ 3.99 rental price.
