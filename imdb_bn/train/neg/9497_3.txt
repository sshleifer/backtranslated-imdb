You have a strong stomach. Holding was actually 55 years of age in filming but was close to 70 and he was only 8 years old. At one point Holden said, "I'm your age." Okay, try Triple Dada! They did not work for the shooting that "the old enough to be your dad" theme. Approved senior citizens sometimes air with legal teens. They have more power, but that does not mean I want to see it. It's a matter of judgment but not the cook track. I like it where my food is. Lenz is having fun and 70 cars, clothes, furniture etc. came to the cables at night and he wants to see something lying on the bed. It was great to see Lenz's blonde friend, who pushed his guitar, got more scenes. Delightful spicy ... who was this chick? I'm going to try and find out.
