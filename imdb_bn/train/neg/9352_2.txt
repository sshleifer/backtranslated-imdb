You can often tell a movie that it should not be like the heavy use of a narrator. This feature features this device across the film. Richard Jawsson is completely content to write directly and even some of the funds in this film are associated with his achievements by reading his own semi-autobiographical quote, which matches some beautiful editions, which is a relentless sad story, which he misunderstood for the Genuine Art House. Kevin McKid puts a good performance. Everyone else is okay. <br /> <br /> The budget constraints mean that all the scenes are shot in the daylight but most are meant only at night, even though you know the serious alcohols but they work mainly on the day, so add it <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of this picture is that the waitress, who fails to fail in a wonderful 20-year-old age, in his presence - the more extreme version of the MacKid's problem Akapara more than 18 to 30 without changing it. Good luck
