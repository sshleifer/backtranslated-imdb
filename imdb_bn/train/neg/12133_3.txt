Yusuf's right <br /> <br /> A gang of cranes. Perfect plan It all goes wrong. They are in trouble. The police are outside. They're in the corner. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is a workshop, "Indie" trying to get the film and theater combination. <br /> <br /> It's such a thing that the actor loves - it's like a workshop or game, because it focuses on most actors ... anger, tense, fear, conversations, plans, plans - actors It makes Ham for many free range offers. <br /> <br /> A joke, a leader, a multiplication, a brother, comes with a bigger health scheme. .. and a monkey wrench is cast into work. To keep things top, there is a small "fender-bender" and a crooked burst of windshield bum. <br /> <br /> The police are in their tail and they fall into a bar called poetically (and basically) "The latest prospects of Dino." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to keep an eye on the performance of the actors and the dialog. He pans on smoking a bright emotional-red cigarette advertisement and smothers to Bogoter. And he keeps the screen off of all violence, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intense and horrible violent scenes, the film was given some edge. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie is that it moves very slowly and misguides almost every land. Matt Dillon ("Doctor of Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems to be very young and very idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sanjee thought and thought deeply timeless tag - These guys and Joe Muntago are as a traditional routine, since all the states are crazy-mad crazy police lieutenant, but they are really here to do something No <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An actor who credits his role as brainless harmful. He just wanted to spread the blood. <br /> <br /> The miscreants are in an acute situation where they either go to jail or they try to think some way. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no ability to create spaces in the spaces and to carry it. The character is mostly silent, trying to think about the plan ... and they are calm and very clear. There is also a scene where the miscreants are playing pool with full swim of armed police, ready for strike. At one point, one of the crooks brought out the police again and again. Oh brother Oh bothered. <br /> <br /> These police can blow them up or lock them. Hold up crooks up a little, should not be a little uncomfortable? Meanwhile, all real actions are happening inside. <br /> <br /> Someone whipping out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly conflict screen and a further casualties that happened ... well, Kinda is sad. But <br /> <br /> Fai Duneway could have spent more time with a dialect instructor to improve his New Orleans pronunciation. Skit Ullrich is fine in a small part. <br /> <br /> Reaching for a complete bad time match pack is a beautiful look of a policeman. And so a scene where nobody goes right through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialagues are probably trying to go through the David Mommy method and it is unreasonable, but not realistic or insightful. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> . " Speczi shows that he is not a terrible director, but there is a lack of feeling of "transforming the movie" and it seems he is acting actor. <br /> <br /> This actor can work with all the talented and element, but they all find out the place. As I said before, the movie is really suffering miscasting. <br /> <br /> I did not say that the wrong actor was cast. I think they are just found to cast right, but keep them in all the wrong roles. I think switching to some roles has helped greatly. <br /> <br /> Gerry Cristiano played by Joe Montagna, leader of this pack, Gary Sanzi instructed Lieutenant angry out of his Bullenhorn and inside of his soldiers, his "bloodthirsty goon" part and keeping the Fischter as the Mesh Dillion sacrificial lamb. That has been a big improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors direct it, it works. They can even win the Oscar for it But many times, when the actors are direct, they just have a tendency to focus on performance. Just shoot the performer acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but for them it requires a good showcase. An excuse for this. <br /> <br /> Similar realities are similar in real life, just like in upcoming real stories, so it is only natural that they can go from point A to point in point of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some great entries in this genre. 'Spacy himself appeared in a similar movie about the hostage situation: "The Negosierator." <br /> <br /> This must not be a classical classic, let's keep AFI's 100 people alone. Yet it has some nice moments and personal touch, but ultimately, it will immediately forget and play the best of the movie on regular TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Attempts Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> Yusuf's right
