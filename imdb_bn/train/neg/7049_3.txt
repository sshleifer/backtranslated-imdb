A movie about surfers without one wave of one of the worst things than the surfer without any wave. This movie is a big disappointment for those who love surfing, because of the number of struggles to reach surfing footage in three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is a part of the life of surrenders who are not waiting for the perfect wave, but for any wave. J. C. (San Parvay) is an old adult super-surfer who is flirting with his girlfriend Cloey (Catherine Zeta Jones). As she finds great pleasure with the woman she loves, just as three old surfing friends return to her and sister Yard is pleased to hit the beach in search of giant waves. The problem is that there is no wave until the end of the film, so most stories are removed from the horrific succession of isolated beaches. <br /> <br /> Most played medium. There is a few funny moments at Shan Paratwe, but in most cases he played Dundu. Ivan McGregor was just as honest as dealing with wild people, by the most striking and impressive character of the group. Perhaps the most fun performance was turned into Terry by Peter Gone, who turned his tropical body into perseverance. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as sexy as usual, but her character did not have enough acting to show her many acting abilities. There is not much to comment here. I rated it a 3/10 This is a real beach bummer.
