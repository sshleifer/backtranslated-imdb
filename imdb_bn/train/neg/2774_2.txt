It's just a bad movie. With quite a good budget what seems to be it was likely to be much better. It was almost there. The heroine is nicely like Salma Haik, almost like the hero, Jackie Chan's fight, war, and comedy tiger, almost two ... almost music, songs, Kanan ... etc. But in the end it is neutral and it is difficult to find something interesting. Maybe except for John Rice-Davis, like the heroes of the heroes sinking before the dual or flying tiger ... I'm really ashamed of the poor old man. She quite well after quite good actors and deserved much better. So you-- so if you still have a chance just see something else.
