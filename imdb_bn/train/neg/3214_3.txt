After all, I want to tell you that I am in comics, anime, animation and so on. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I have to be objective. To start the story - it's okay. As far as I know them, follow the comic book story lines. But the animation ... Well, this is not terrible, but it is cheap and medium. It would be better if it does not try to imitate the animation style and try to stick to the original comic book style drawings. If we do not see rare harmful effects like fire and light color, you can say that this movie has been done 10 years ago and even more. Since 1985, the real vampire shows something like Hunter D. For example, keep an eye on Heavy Metal Fact 2000 - 4 years ago they created a movie that looks great in a hell! In addition to this, voice talent is not something extraordinary, music is nothing special. So all of it - it lacks the atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There is plenty of blood and violence, but it does not affect me at all. It can be frustrating for a person who has seen more mature oriented animations and has seen animated blood for the first time (anyone around?), But I do not think it's the viewer for this movie. So they could add it to a nudity and spice. The kids were very tasty around Lucifer, and hell, our Lady is dead! There are a few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's song I think it would be better than a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. Above all, the film is not bad, but if you want to do something good then the original heavy metal, Heavy Metal Fact 2000, Ralph Bakhshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodshed
