Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or is it only anger that only those angry? When I'm going through the channel and came to the show, I'm out of half the unconscious curiosity. I do not understand Pat Robertson all together If I do not know what his audience is like him or if he is a good man and thinks he speaks well he listens to him. Pat Robertson is a little resultant. She is an old man who thinks in an old way. The fear of destruction was not once again affected (thanks to God). Now if someone can answer my questions, then I will push the power bit for eternity.
