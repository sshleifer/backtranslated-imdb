'A Smile Leak Uras' is a kind of comedy that actually does not give any sense. My story was not complicated, but the whole plot was made based on one thing: children's anxiety and expensive failed attempts at the couple. Those who worked hard should forget the option of acceptance, which is not kind to the film. <br /> <br /> Lorraine Holly has played Jennifer Robertson, which is a complete contradiction of the proposed liberation movement for women. , Exhibition in any sense of independence. She is a tragedy of a dreamlike housewife, she has nothing on her mind but the kids have nothing. Like 50 romance comedies, her submissive husband Greg Kinnear does not likewise show any personality, freedom and interest from us. They are two annoying and often annoying characters and they should be created for at least one comedy that should present themselves with many accidents, which should be raised from what can be done to get pregnant from a couple. Except, they do not do anything outside of a reproductive clinic and make full profits to do their own confidentiality (which can be done without the number of Vitro Fertilization). The plot rarely allows for an accident, because the couple does nothing to create any malicious situations. They just go to this clinic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The couple planned to have a child together after examining the essential ethical elements of the story, to test the fidelity of the couple. Jennifer works in a new age store, played by her friend (played by Joan Cusack), and they are developing business in aphrodiacs. Christopher McDonald's impressive buyers and Jennifer, a promising valued negotiator for her and her friend's product. The concert offers many offers to keep you interested (although Joan Cusack is quite funny in the restless scene.) <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinnear) is an architect who gets the opportunity to earn some extra money by taking Seattle's bills, where his boss Fierce seductress (also another hopeless, helpless female character) is a danny who is conveniently stony (as she is as stupid) once the things are rocky Yapara with him and his wife are trying to influence (for reasons I do not want to give away). Jill Hennessy's role is good, but his character is very predictable and very useful for Danny as a necessary element to create contradictions. It's stupid and again, very funny. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is completely annoying, and absolutely funny (save storage view and flight flight). The plot is truly attention-grabbing that provides nothing. Even if the story was trying to hold about two people, the authors found a lot of cheerful anger to develop from him. Second, the main characters are completely annoying. They were completely silly in the humorous 1950's comedy, including a happy wife and unexpected husband. So, even without the turmoil in the plot, the characters do not give themselves fun, alone make fun. <br /> <br /> Joan Kusac will head towards the leadership and someone else has to take part in the show. Cusak was even a violent story unreasonable (she sometimes has her co-acting role here). This is definitely one of the passes.
