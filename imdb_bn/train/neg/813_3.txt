The biggest thing that drives me out is that they say that Zeus took DUTCH commands. But he is talking in Germany. 2 languishes are completely different, like her "well she takes the French command" and started to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi does not give a detective in the sense of a comedy actor's little more. The role just does not fit him, even if it can be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many stereotypes / predictive stuff. Generally comment or return. <br /> <br /> If you do not see them, it may be a great movie to watch on TV sometimes. But I will not recommend it to rent it.
