This film is unfit for the title of the Woman. It's really bad that it actually damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They even did not spell Damien Thorn's NAME properly !!!! And the most important element of women films is not violent. Drag it and burn it to the shelf.
