I went to school with Jeremy Earl, the way I heard about this movie, I do not know what it was in the theater. I do not recall the name. I saw it, it's like one after school special one. Acting is ok, not good. Plots were of weak type and the line was quite corny. So I can only comment on this movie "Eh" I borrowed the film from Jeremy, if I were in a movie rental place, then I would go to the past and after watching this I would not recommend anyone past the middle school age I noticed that many times people who are portrayed in urban children, are far overused or old. Many times I think that their characters make incredible.
