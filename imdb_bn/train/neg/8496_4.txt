Have you ever seen a movie made of long shot wide? Any? Even not me. Well, I finally saw one in the Spring Spring of my house, and I must admit, now I know why people do not do it. The technique ensures "arty," guaranteed, but it is definitely not ripe for public consumption. This method is only faulty because the audience does not have any emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps it may be the full purpose of the director. I do not know, I can not read hearts, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to take the verdict. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is the ridiculous American anti-feelings. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we were not always the angels, but I would have been surprised how I would take the version of this man. According to this blind fool, Americans were not the main reason for the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost destroyed the country in a single way. However, Mr. Director. And I think if you still make this movie in communist Korea, then we did not interfere, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This was almost the same to make the Nazis "good boys" when the "bad boys" were made friendly by the friendly forces. This film is so historically naive and so really wrong that it's almost embarrassing to watch. For a person who came from the very existence of America's intervention, he is definitely closed as high and mighty and judicial.
