The script is nice Although the casting is absolutely ineligible. No style Clothing does not see anything like high hybrid society. Comparison of Gwyther Paltrow with Kate Beckinsel, I can only say that Mrs. Binsell M. British speaks better in English than Paltrow, although Mrs. Paltrow's performance is very similar to Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is definitely the best of all versions. Nightly, he is romantic and television version. Nightly like all is not sharp and unpleasant. P. come. Elton-Mrs can not see all of the audience. It was a development of Smith's progressive version, so he could not understand what Ama was trying to create an Elton-Smith match (as well as portrait).
