It was a crappy movie, with a complete fairly unidentified and many loose finishes counting. I just saw this movie because my favorite actor Ron Livingston has created a camio in it and I have continued to watch it because, as a girl, I love any movie that involves male nudity for change. Later, I imagined how funny the story could be, and every time it was ... more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wend). He thinks getting more work from Duke, Sun contractor Roy Matthews (Daniel Beldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy) agreed to meet. The verdict is being investigated by City Hall Accountant (Ron Livingston in a Camio, I've been in love from "Office Space" to "Sex and Cities"). The verdict finally slashed the $ 13k accountant for the frustration, and ended up receiving shawl work. Shan accepts information file against Rai with her, whose wife (Curie Wuhar) herself attracts, hits, and leaves open. Shan quickly learned that he is being used, Ray is not intended to pay him, and Shan uses the file as leverage to get his money. <br /> <br /> At this moment, it is a descent flickr ... usually watching the value. But as soon as the verdict, Duke and their crew abducted them to submit information about the file, it only got Dumbar and Dumber (and still Dumbar ...), finally it seemed like the writer of Charlie Higgs, writing for 10 days Hang out from Hangover and realize how to wrap a series of vague messages created before a specific time frame. He needs to think seriously about it. Without just revealing the film, let's say that after the kidnapping you see any single scene, you are "swallowing what ** **!" , Which has been bored by running nonsense because Shawn followed a rough graphic and gross way. Towards release In the end, there are many loose ends left in the movie, that you also regret seeing that you saw it. <br /> <br /> This is a film that should be seen only after the cable hits, and you should have enough beer and friends to cheat the film for the full value of the film. It is supposed to be a psychological thriller, and McKenna is a competent actor, but you have "cheers" to "soft" and a Belvedown brother is doing dirty work and it's hard to give yourself a movie that makes the movie shameless. No enemy sense Men will love violence, blood and strong scenes, and absolutely unnecessary sexual scenes and fools shots. Girls will enjoy the unpredictable crotch shots in mainstream movies when it is often a girl who snatches the film. Personally, I hate that his only actor (Ron Livingstone) is the first one-third of the valuable movie to watch more than that.
