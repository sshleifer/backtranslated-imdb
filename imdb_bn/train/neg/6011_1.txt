I did not expect much from this picture, but oh brother, what stinker <br /> <br /> I have found this room in Walmart a huge $ 5 DVD genre (otherwise)? This disc was as cheap, I stopped ripped off. The special effects were a high school for them, the fierce work by the wobbly teaped and sketch of the camera work and the acting 'Christian School' was a perfect example. After a return to smoke, the company can imagine the long and tiring 'prayer meetings' of the company - those who conducted this thing must have been seriously critical of the biblical feeling to the inactive production company. Think of their pain as their $ 942.86 investment has increased in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - perhaps Jaean filmmakers should try to see better films and copy some that make them so good. Believing stories and characters, less missile arm-birds and fanatism, oh, and a story which appeals to every one - is not the only true believer. That is, stop the sermon, save it for the church. For example, take Oman or Prediction Series. Compelling stories with fascinating story lines, great cinematography and acute music. No strange hand-waving. There are no promotions <br /> <br /> <br /> If this picture is sunny then it would be great.
