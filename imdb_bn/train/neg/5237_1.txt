One of the worst films out of Britain in the 80's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, cheerful, filthy and unreal, this The film creates a depth, because it is tragic to be funny, provocative, intellectual, and disruptive. Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is that it is fully customized by George Kastigan, Michelle Homes and Sivan Finner's tough customization, such a Lam Script. It is astonishing that this was the only thing that made this late Andrea Dunbar's screen. Full and nasty garbage on each level.
