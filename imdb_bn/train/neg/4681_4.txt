We laugh at our heads. This script is so incredible that you jump from CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was the captain of the sea for 30 years. He could not believe his eyes when he saw the film. During his experience as an officer, he once asked for an order on the ship, the captain drink 3 bottles of whiskey on his desk / day and (sorry) s **. Of course it was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, a kitchen fire, a fire is no ship, a nuclear or no important thing. At that time, just give Hollywood drops to a drill. When a Captain is arrested, he is arrested, take away all his keys and keep the guns where they are safe. It is stored in a well-protected room in minutes. The funny thing is, my dad had a dog dog too, but we can see how Hackman lets him into the control room. This is never done, never. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington credit these three stars for the film, all the calf ** **. <br/> <br /> <br />> When we know that 23 people were still alive in quarks, this image gets an extra level. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller of a submarine rental: The boat boats. <br /> <br />
