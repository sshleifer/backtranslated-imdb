In addition to accepting some excellent cinematography, I can not say something positive about this film. The only real problem is to live with the childhood of their childhood or leave them and take their lives, dramatic contradictions. Lots of "mentally strong" scenes do not go with this plot and due to bad performance, they also fail to create adaptive environments. The director only managed Anthony's hesitation and finally came up with a simple solution. Character does not appear to be a development, although it is difficult to talk about a character ... probably without Sony. In addition to this, the actors do not play a lot more and if they do something, they stop as self-amateur. I was surprised how else the movie was destroyed: simple scripts, all the possibilities of plotting or throwing bad acting, any appeal can be disturbed.
