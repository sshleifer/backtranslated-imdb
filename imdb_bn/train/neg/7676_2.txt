I was amazed by the darkness alone. It was very bad, I could not believe what I was seeing. There are no letters, some cyclones roam around and are dying around. The amount of character development gives each character a name and profession, and this is about it. There was no real plot, and no letters seem to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes were started on their own, which did not come from anywhere on a sharp techno track. When I was watching this movie, I asked, "Where is it? What's going on?" Acting High School was of dramatic quality, with strong wooden delivery, although the actors were reading from cou cords without understanding their lines. The line rendering has been further clarified by their hard-to-skew sound design. The ADR sounded like to be recorded in an open room. Actors are constantly taking care of striking their mark, looking around robotics in their movement. So, this uninterrupted automatons are flicklessly without the convenience of the scene of the scene, through a series of integral and confusing scenarios. They were here, now they are there. This is happening, now that's happening. Random scene with little rhythm or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Of course, nine rupees are definitely sure.
