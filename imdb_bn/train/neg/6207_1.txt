This movie is a mental rape on viewers as I say. The film has probably created a stir among Kenyan critics, but the final scene for me was a kind-hearted attempt for a newbie director to just renew myself. Very few voices in discussions about violence, drug abuse, or teenage crime (or any other issue related to any other issue) <br /> <br /> The main character is transformative, but the sad boy is virtually helpless to the naughty rapist, but the rape scene is a helpless version of rape scenes from "watch work orange", being helpless and I want to comment on his aesthetic value. Deny There are some things that an artist should not do to achieve and achieve its goals. At least my opinion. <br /> <br /> Wrap it up: Suddenly cruel, rebellious and not your time. Instead see "A clock orange" or "Le pianiste".
