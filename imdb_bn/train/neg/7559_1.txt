This has got to be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It's slow, annoying, amateur - even in reading your own background is not consistent. The actor does not work. I can not blame them - they have received a scrap of their pain so much that they can do whatever they can to do pain behind their eyes that there is nothing to do with the evil acts of Samersil. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that is not a genuine ring - an honest line and one is not a moment to move. Nicholas's cage has grabbed the character so badly that nobody feels sorry for him through all his sorrows. I have no doubt that I see a painful person there but Nicholas Cage was fully aware of the worst movie of his entire career.
