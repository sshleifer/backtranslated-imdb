We were surprised by the Lethal Weapon 4 to see this movie, hoping to see some of Jat Lee's glimpses. Unfortunately, many stunts of his war were so obviously fake that it even took that pleasure. Flying kicks can be even more impressive if you do not see the stars that fly through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Very cartoon and very frustrating.
