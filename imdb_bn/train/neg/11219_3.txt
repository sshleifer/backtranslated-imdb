This was a movie about unfaithfulness and revenge. A twin with a "twin" connection feels something wrong to her sister. This picture is an established plot forever. A plot that has been done many times. The acting was lousy for the most part. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. The pair that Laura and Ashley live with a rogue dad. Baba seems to enjoy Ashley, so Laura gets blame for everything. Women have been promised that they will never be separated, but when they grow up, their life goes from different directions. Ashley Dinner is getting a job where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course no good can come this. Barry Tintitas was a poor excuse for its way of tracking. I waited to make this film better and there was some solution, but it never happened.
