I like this movie, I'll admit it. This is the best video I've seen (directly?). Well ... just right now, I and my friend were submissive to rent this movie. What we wanted to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When the red neck blurred against the tree by the saskatcheck, we literally saw that part three to four times, it was amazing (strange, of course). And why? Why the main character will have to roll so much? Like honesty, we know that you are in danger, so much rolling that it will not help so much. But in reality, if you have this movie, then the local video store is RENT IT. It's worth the money and it's not even bad, it's not bad, but incredibly bad. Overall, if you rent this movie, it will be a wonderful surprise for you to shop.
