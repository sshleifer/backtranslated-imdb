I'm not really going to comment, but then I think I had to say something. I have seen this movie two days ago and although I think it is not a complete time (although it can be a budget for producers), it is clear that there is a serious problem. It got really good cinematography and (little but) beautiful music. A lot has been said about Anna Christina Olivier, but let's be honest, on what? He is not actually acting that he is acting in acting acting actress and under the overwhelming. His performance got better because no one was in another picture in the ode: crazy? Sad Childish? An impostor? Nobody knows, Fellow. So he is here according to the rules dicta sorta <br /> <br /> I had a good example of the problem that most of this picture suffered from Portuguese film: Soundtrack There is no permanent dubbing number and this results in a normal mass of blue color. In other countries people can think that Portugal is the hottest place in places. Although I'm glad, the dialog was some WB but it did not necessarily resolve syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I would say When the first scene talked about the first character, I thought it was a strange film that was dubbed. And to say that this film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> There are scripts in it. It tries to be classical from the first scene to the first. The things that were a terrible fear of postponement and that show The author was definitely trying to get everything and he but ... it shows !! All conversations are very outgoing and there is no single talk that sounds like a movie from a movie. It's all small and raw unexpected. <br /> <br /> This is not a mess, but I must press. I just like the good part so clear that I like to focus on the worst ones. <br /> <br /> Directions come little in the weak playplay. All shots are classical and non-innovative, but they are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think is the problem, which can make people laugh instead of accepting this story and taking it seriously through the film is that person who is DIES who is an actor definitely not a drama drama. Actually, this is an important role and I can not see why non-actor cast for such parts. This guy is not a good man to look at the actor. Which means that the whole movie falls down the hill, since we do not believe for one second that this fantastic lady is covered with her, even though she has gone, and her painful boyfriend survives, it actually has a bad time on damages, when all we It's unpleasant to see this character. very bad. The beautiful greedy lovers of the world are even full of beautiful people. The adult boys who are full of good actors in the world and able to cause obsessions on the people after they have gone. The world is not only with great movies and also those great movies. C'est la vie!
