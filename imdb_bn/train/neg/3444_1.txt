This is by the worst movies I've ever seen. From the plot, though the shot, "special effects", acting, and I mentioned the plot? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was trying to do; One of these movies is supposed to be that you can not really tell what's going on till the end. You sit in a messaged, you do not know who died and who died and who died, and why and when you feel that you got the timeline, you have found that you are wrong and the movie is over - for the next 5 minutes, Leave! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A double for author, director, producer, screenplay author, castor, producer designer, art director, costume designer and characters Some scenes ... It is basically a female movie and when it comes from Olga Livens "Levens Productions" you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> It may come as a shocker but "this time" is in Olga Has done big time, from the scene Rsya jumping from dream to reality ... but wait! After all this was a dream ... or was ??? The image was faded and I realized that there was no such incident, the girl was alone in the ship ... there was no ship ... there was no waiting! There are ships, and boys! They are alive! Thank God! No, they call him to join the crew ... but then the ship disappears so that they die all the time ??? Or maybe they never survived, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
