OK, the movie festival crowd probably liked it. But your average, pop star is a movie girl who has spent ten or fifteen rupees to watch the movie at this moment, perhaps she was surprised why she liked it. If it is "Copolla" stamped then it is automatically great thing, right? Wrong! This is a clear fool of filmmaking pretension. But it's awesome "in." I think when filmmakers are more concerned about their own entertainment instead of public. It's as attractive as a cinematic query and has a shiny or two of it. But after running it on film and TV, it became dust in movie cans and tape boxes. Very rarely or an epic!
