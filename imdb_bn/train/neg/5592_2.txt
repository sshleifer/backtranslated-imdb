This film is difficult to describe and wants to try it very hard so that it will not be canceled very soon because you think it can be a suitable film for the 12 year old girl ... <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful concept Modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. Some of his visionary shots and his single mother and his classmate have some nice sketches of the little boy's relationship ... you can say that this is a beautiful start, but then it is a greedy, very greedy, imagining trying to be a science, a drama , A thriller, a possible romantic love story, fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. As a result the audience left rather insufficient feeling. For example, when the girl (who played Rysa Goto), kissed instead of being romantic in the scene, (Uchi Koohara) started kissing, it later tried to be scary to make us smile ... it is a cheap strategy, because it has all the expectations and emotions Destroys what it is trying to create for half the part of the film. <br /> <br /> I did not read the original story (it is well-known) comic-book artist Osamu Tejuka is famous for his interesting and complex stories) I wonder if all the problems arise in the real story or do it adapt? Even to use the "accentuation logic" of Japanese Japanese comic books, it is also unreasonable for it. For example, after watching the live interview of Uchi Koharara, the TV star immediately went to the hospital to run the character of Risa Gota in front of live TV cameras (when it seems to be long live-off), the television? <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that are copied directly from other pictures (very self motivated!) and they all seem unexpectedly annoying. The famous "lion face shaking my hands" from "Roman Holiday" <br /> <br /> The film tries to do everything but nothing ends ... it fails to be a fairy tale and it was a joke enough to joke No ... and there are some strange scenes that seem like an unknown "ghost" movie. Still, one has to give credit to it that it has influenced some Japanese teenage feelings. <br /> <br /> I think that there may be a few films which came with an alert label saying "this movie is less than 18 years old. May be suitable for the old man ", it was definitely the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
