I had a lot of hope for this movie, because I enjoyed the book. However, I do not think if I could not read this book, then I could understand the basics of the movie. This film is an excellent effort to show the people's frustration, which is trying to break the bond of strengthening the government's rule, but the book shows the picture of sadness more thoroughly. Corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious life, although the general people struggle to achieve unemployment requirements to survive. Perhaps most people feel that their leaders and rulers feel that they are actually oppressed or oppressed. Orwell's Dostopia seems like it may exist in many places of our modern world. Even after a few years of reading the book, Big Brother, Thought Police, and NewsPic often hear references to media and casual conversations. Using this term probably means that many people came from the word. I strongly recommend you read the book.
