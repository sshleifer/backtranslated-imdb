I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was the rebuilding of Hi Sierra with Bagart, two, the Bagart portion was played by Jack Palenas, who can play dramatic roles with some brutality like Big Ashes. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The same plot is going on like the Hague Sier; Just here, do not care about the actor, the manager lost his thinking, and who knows what the manufacturer was thinking. Looking at Shell Winters and Shelley Winners, Jack Palenance is getting annoyed with what he is doing in this film. I do not even want to compare her with similar role Ida Lupino. And of course, they will use dog stories again! They surely can come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color shot Hi Sierra where it looks nice to look at the same location, but it certainly does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> If you see Hi Sierra, it is a waste. Before Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. For me, I'd rather die once more ...
