I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci; Many of his Giallo and splatter flicks are all in my favorites, but for TV movie this does not come very highly par par and I expect from the great Italian director. This movie is not funny, like some gulola of Phulchi, or poor like most of its religious culture; In this way, it has left the lack of both major cases, and finally ensure that the film is not very good. The film works from a plot that has been used much earlier, but it is still an idea that always has the opportunity to raise an interesting story because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This image focuses on Zurigo Menarde; A man who is not well-liked and then died after a blood stomach stomach, he does not have very sad people. This means that his soul is stuck somewhere in life and in the afterlife, so he decides to try under his death and this effort is his only companion his daughter. <br /> <br /> Watching this picture, I proudly said that the film is "HP Love Style", and this is the most popular effort to sell any movie. The great horror writer in this story has little memory, and this tagline can be the result of the similarity of the title of Stuart Gordon / Lovekumer film 'Of Beyond' - which is very good. The film is profitable from a distinct Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci positively looks appropriate for roasting each scene - and so the theme becomes increasingly annoying. This plot plays really annoying ways, and most scenes are just trying to find the ghosts 'desperately', or the girl suspects her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and it is not surprising that it is all right. There is a bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; But we do not know this love and we all love it. Overall, this movie is not a very good representation of the mediums and flowers of the film. If you are not a Fulci completist, do not bother with it.
