Hard times believe that director Barbet Shroder once did royalty and fun maitrease (1976), and now only think of "the number of Hollywood thrillers". <br /> <br /> It reduces the content of John Grimes with a TV movie plot. Bullock Cass Meider, a scandalous and independent criminal investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his saved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they have an uncomfortable twin. Not good, when two helpless college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild goose chase - planted a very clever and confusing forensic proof in the scene of a crime. Fair enough, but Bullock and Chaplin failed to create any surprises, we must also bear several uninterrupted ultraviolet-melodramatic flashbacks by describing an important event in Kasa's history. Then there is a cliff-side log cabin shot where there is no doubt about the end of it. Oops ... the atmosphere. See what episode of the CSI instead. <br /> <br /> It's a dot and a lot more exciting.
