I originally picked up this film because I saw a great remix of Kitayya Takshi Jyotichi and I was in the mood of another updated Samurai story starring Tandanub. These two movies are different in the world. Jaitii adds humor and depth to his characters and abolishes the traditional Samurai movie review. Gozo goes from the other side of the other end. First of all, I hate movies that can tell viewers of other characters that during the film, instead of developing the character, how the main character is. . Almost every character of Benkei's presence says, "You can not determine whether you are a monk or a soldier, but this internal turmoil is expressed in the character itself, instead of the development of character, we get lethal, boring, glorious fighting scenes. He found that he was bored and he did not know what he was doing there. I know that he usually sees the remote and cool, and it is part of appealing appeals, but this film does not serve him. <br /> <br /> Many camera movements are annoying, a scene that goes forever where the camera wanders around the main characters. Unless my wife and I feel flipped, the last is ridiculous and rather the anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that with today's budget In Japan, the film is not really good, the colors, scenery and costume were great, but the rest of the time just a loooong waste. I would rather see one of these legendary poetic versions.
