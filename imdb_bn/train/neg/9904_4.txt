Film 'Gong Ho!': In 1943, during World War II, the story of Carlin's Mackin Island riders was created to increase the morale of American people. This is a great way to showcase the part of the promotion of movies. This photo is only worth collecting and no artistic. Propaganda is meaningless in filming and judging the actors in a movie. How Pragagda works in the movie, or if you want Robert Mitchell to have a big issue, you see this movie as a small role in the film. If you want to watch a movie for World War II, they are better and purposeful. I rated it 4/10.
