Canadian fiction is a fiction film about a group of scientists trying to find and find a Bigfoot (it is "responsible for the document" based on a story though it is listed based on a story). (The device they want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Many of his scientific mangoes have assembled in Jambo, which is actually a group of a group of people flowing in the desert. There are some attempts to create excitement and fear, but to be perfectly honest, the wilds are not able to find some great shots. This is a perfect definition of a exploitation film, it gives you many promises, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it provides very little. Recommended for insomniacs only
