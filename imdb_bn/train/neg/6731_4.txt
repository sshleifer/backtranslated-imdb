Contrary to other critics, I think it is good writing, especially because it is more imagined, because more imagination will be needed; And played well, because there was no character to share the focus of these dozen-minute-plus, well-done monologues. But I am not just modest in such sacred, holy memories. Everyone has a story to say and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are even more intense than others. For example, this is not just ten, very unreasonable stories and problems, for example a person's life (or part of it) for example the sheets. Then again, I think, TV reality show is bad. So, if it's your bag, you might like this. This is such a stuff that will make 'good' for phone and / or internet conversations; But without the usual oral activities. And, even though every speaker lady, I'm leaving gender from this.
