When I saw this movie, almost 1979, it became the first movie that I was going through a lot of times. There is nothing worse than comedy that can be fun, and it misses every time (though I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the film). There was nothing original about any skits. I enjoy the warm humor where appropriate, these skits were inappropriate vulgar. Even more annoying was that the film was released as "Robin Williams's first film", which capitalized on the newly discovered fame of the "Mork and Mindy" television series. Yet his role was so small that you can not see him on the screen.
