The script for "Scary Movie 2" was not ready to go. This is a problem with the film, which is clearly clear, the actor and the audience alike. Director Kinna Ivory Wains, and many funny actors; And so the movie is not completely ridiculous. Their credits, the film has quite funny moments. But completely, "Scary Movie 2" is not as close to the original as cute and fun as well. <br /> <br /> One minute movie of the first "Scary Movie" was a smile. This made Slashner the smallest film in the film as a comedic gold. It is non-original as it is a very handicap to humor in "Scary Movie 2". They even miss the obvious chance for the parody. The former star of the movie "Beverly Hills 90210", and it was a show that was begging for being a fan! In the final analysis, "Awesome Movie 2" was like a fine bottle of liquor which was soon opened. Script ages need more time. 5 out of 2 stars.
