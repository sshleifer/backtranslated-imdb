To get a better idea of ​​how things are going in the background in a big Opera product, we got the DVD from the library. I said, I was very disappointed. There was so much potential in the subject. The Wagnaryan production set must be necessary and impressive and the story behind their creation and use can be a wonderful educational experience. Instead, we get a neat out of people's clips that move around visible big items, which helps in a commentary with failures to hold my attention. I mostly heard listening to music background clips from opera. I was impressed with the intense extraordinary effort of this type of production effort - which is fairly good and the next time I am in the opera. I'm sure if I remember this video, I will remember - but it seems to be a little bit of deception due to lack of detailed commentary and explanation.
