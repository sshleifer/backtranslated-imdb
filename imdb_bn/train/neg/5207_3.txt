Anime comedy-drama, convicted of an unhappy, seemingly fierce enemy, who lost the purple housewife, who gradually made friends with Hit-Man friend, who hired to kill her husband. Chase Palmantry, as a talk fare gun, adapted the curtains from his own game, swift set-ups, and backwards and next conversation that quickly tuned eyes and ears. An air of frustration over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky could never get out of his gaping spaces (he was shameless). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as producer), there is no element of "faithful" story, story and character, which rarely comes to life. * **** to 1/2
