This is by the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this picture !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> "B" is a big fan of horror movies. You can imagine .... I have been exposed to the worst of some of the motion of the film industry. <br /> <br /> I was lured by the title of this movie. I mean ... the true fan of horror will not be confused by the headline titled "Vampire vs. Lomas"? "Unwanted" pictures dancing to my head "unexpected" in combat with each other. I think of myself ... "I found this" !!!! <br /> <br /> It's okay to say ... "I did not see it if I did not see" <br /> <br /> The film's title is too confusing to say the least. There was no vampire to fight zombies. Actually, no plot !!!! If you ask me to tell everything for this movie, I really do not have any idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There were no stories !!!! <br /> <br /> This image does not understand at all. <br /> <br /> After the end of this danger, I feel sorry for the poor souls who have invested them money in this project surely they have no business knowledge !!!
