I really wanted to really love Julian Bo. I think Slater is included as an actor, and this supporter is very good player here than giving this supporter the chance to show in this film. I found it available based on a short story which I did not read. So, I did not know what I saw because of the film's flaws, or it was imposed on the story / screenwriter. The courtyard is wonderful, and I like voices, the opening of the confession is the opening of the first hartal. But then ...? There is nothing! Some of the local local characters ask Julian Pointbank to explain her motives for suicide. Someone can argue that he is not answering, because it is not their business. But Julian, who only lost his motives in public under Token Pressure. The Julian character does not seem to offer anything in addition to the original information of Jallian's life, a tape-recorded journal character for God, even after Julian's director / writer. He said he was a bookkeeper. He said that because of his father's job, his family had almost moved around when he was a child. So what? There are several interactions with locals designed to illuminate the purpose of Julian. But none of them goes anywhere, because Julian these DOPs feel that they were alien to another planet, as he was the only extreme (and only) honest among them It can act as a metaphor, if Julian Po has some defined characteristics or something close to the given knowledge. He is the closest to reveal something about himself, where he deliberately humiliates Mechanic's stupid, religious wife. And what this scene reveals is nothing that Julian sympathizes with. I only see the Julian character - as selfish, tiny and perfectly restrained. Arrange this half-baked, protected film to match the director's attitude. And poor Michael Parks, who was an actor who promised so much, did not give anything to work here.
