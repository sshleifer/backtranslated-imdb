This film, originally released in Christmas in 1940, has long forgotten it. A very poor copy resurfaced and now has been created in a CD, for sale. Do not buy it! The film is inevitable terrible. Welding is poor, scripts screwed, and guidance awesome. <br /> <br /> Photo Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie was deliberately lost.
