I went into this movie with high hopes. Generally, I'm not very interested in my movies and animated films are * always fun to watch, or so I thought. I will list the good parts of this movie: - Animal effect. All the animals did good work, their movements were realistic, and they fit well in other imagery. To be honest, the effects of animals are that I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. Now, the bad things: - Acting. Good Lord, I saw bad acting, but this movie takes cakes. The characters are single * even credible * off of one. It sent a welding call like the director and picked it out to try out the worst. I did not want to ride very well, because I did not want to hurt anyone else in the theater, but the acting was really bad. - Storyline: The whole story is full of plot holes from the beginning to the end. You can choose at least 5 plot holes from any 30 minute film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with cheese. This is probably the most clutched, not worried and one of the most stupid stories I've ever put on the screen, since I was unaware of watching parasite in the Saifai channel sitting on one night. - Dialogue: This is a world where everyone is most challenged and the most cluttered thing they can possibly do. At least 30 low-budget animals in this world seem to be before each movie before the movie. It's cheese and clich√© world. Special effects The effect of the animals was awesome awesome, unfortunately failing of special effects. Yes, they are better than those shown in other movies, but it's a lot in the presentation. And there are no presentations in this movie. It can be honest like the power effects used in the Power Rangers TV show. Sum up: Dragon War is your time not worth your money. The idea is good, but it is trapped in the movie's poor directions, acting, dialogue and glasses. Til wait for the next big giant movie to come. Dragon War is absolutely horrible because it will be better than that.
