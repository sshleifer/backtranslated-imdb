What did they think of "ears"? The most annoying one, all the time. Every detail of this picture, no foul is shown. If I had put him in boots, I would have once again cried out. The point of view of this movie is to show how bad the budget was, but it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credit should have been running. But no, we had to see countless unexpected scenes over over. The whole thing was filled with irrational and disrespectful characters. They were desperate for Rosetta. And I think I went to "Tumblebles", to see this annoying film. It was like to see the growth of the grass, only that is more exciting.
