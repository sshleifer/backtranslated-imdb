The unknown Jack (Matthew Lloyd) came to the studio in the collective collector of Max (Vincent D'Onphriio) and told his brother Jerry (Valeria Galino) his ambitious partner and the specialist Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, influences Jack and keeps him in the chair. When Max comes, Jack offers a 100,000 US dollar US to protect him in a discussion of "Spanish judges" elders with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid identity, Peace (Mark Buane Jr.), who brings his believing girlfriend out of dying to write a backup of a private group. However, Jack gets the collector twice and then he plans Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish Judge" is a movie that is a great conclusion with a reasonable script that breaks a good cast. Valeria Golino is beautiful but with good actors Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save stupid stories. In addition, the scenes are supposed to be funny, do not work unfortunately, and in fact they are not stupid and funny. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudor pore Dinahiro" ("All for money")
