There are three movies about this animation style that I totally remember from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicon," "Flight of Dragon" and "The Hobbit." I own both copies of "Dragon" and "The Hobbit" (both nice) and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" for more than a decade. To date and now I had no desire. The most hate of me was the script. It was incredibly sticky and often insane. Things will happen for some reason and other things happen without explanation. We are not just talking about small things here; We're talking about plot points! The story itself is not good at starting, but it can be a good creator of the script. Not even close The music above that was horrific! I know that music will rarely call classic pieces in such movies, but the music of this film wants me to become unconscious with the bowling ball. It was a movie that I was going to show to my kids for a while, but it was cut off. I do not think that I can sit through that festive festival again. Undoubtedly, it is undoubtedly put on.
