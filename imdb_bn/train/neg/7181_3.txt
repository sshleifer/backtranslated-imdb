Do not make mistakes now, I enjoy the Christmas movie. I love it a wonderful life and I really enjoy a Christmas carol version with George C. Scott and Elster Sim But this special movie is awful. I think the life song of Christmas is particularly painful in the current psyche of Christmas. Albert Finnie Annie sings fairly well. I do not know what's wrong with her in this film, but it looks like someone is trying to sing through dead girl. The only thing to save this movie for us was to close the sound alongside the Sound Park Christmas CD as well as observe the number of dances.
