Okay, it's very rare that I got some complaints for free. So I think this movie has crossed that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood cemetery for free and went away very very frustrated. Instead of being the heir of the film, an audience member's question about "audience" opinion about Native American references is basically everything that has failed in this movie. <br /> <br /> American American References --- Native American references have really come out of place and arose. It is clear that these directors and writers tried to deal with any area that had never played before. They should stick to the old expression of "Write something you know". If they are actually aware of this, then this film is certainly not shown or the beauty of this unique culture has not been given fair justice. <br /> <br /> - Clich√©s and Noj --- I agreed to see this movie as an Indie. So I held it to high expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. I was raving on how it's going to be a hit before it even came out of the widespread release. Unexpectedly, I could not say the same thing about "expiry date". "Sunshine" took us to the point of view, but filmmakers were so clever in their view that the result would lead us to avoid being trapped in "cliche" from a different direction. On the other hand, there was no way to trap this film because it already started. Syco mother's antics, Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I did not agree to say it, but this year I saw that both the best and best films were in the Indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the filmmaker for making such a good change from his family members in the graveyard.
