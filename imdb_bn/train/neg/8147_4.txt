This movie was a misleading piece of garbage. You did not know what's going on. Characters were badly written and, in most cases, they were completely disrespectful except Gass (fully played by George Eids). I hate this movie but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula Curse) it will win an Academy Award. It is very sad to see a talented actor like George Eds in such disrespectful and strong movies. Lifetime You have a whole new low sunken. No one will make sure that the director of this movie does not work again. It was much fun than terrible because it was supposed to be a scary film. For shame, for shame.
