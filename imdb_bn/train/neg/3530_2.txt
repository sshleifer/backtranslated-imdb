When Richie burst into the first movie scene, his films were congratulated as funny, malicious, well guided and original. If someone can compare the hype generated by his first two attempts and in his last two ways almost universally hatred, he should consider - What did Richie find? Is he really that talented? Does he really have any real real ideas? Or is he just a scary and arrogant director who really wants to be Finker, Tarantino and Lyon, has become a huge and unorganized hip? After seeing revolver one might be forgiven for thinking that all is wrong? Has humorous feeling happened? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas? When the revolution tries to be tricky, philosophical and short, it tries to be an intelligent psychologist, it tries to be a complex and complex thriller. Richie makes a serious effort to meet these many objectives and to invest large parts of a script in existing music and numerous plot twists. However, by the end all of them work to make a serious controversial, unselected and ultimately incomparable film-making movie to the viewers. His anarchism is so sinister and intelligent that although Riri tried to give his spin at least, he should be punished for trying to pass it as his own job. So what the audience gets to the end is a terrible screenplay that is associated with many persuasive almonds and clammy settings. <br /> <br /> Revolver is finally an unreasonable and lovely movie that stole amazing themes like Fight Club, Yusle Soupaks and Palp. Fiction It is high target, but inevitably empty lots of shots. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be tall, it's really a poor film that masquerading as a Wannabe masterpiece from a Wannabe auteur. However, it falls flat on its harmful face and fails at everything it wants to achieve and achieve.
