There is nothing to be excited about "Dan in real life". First off, the whole setup is incredibly conrived. Do you really believe that during the so-called first meeting conversation at the restaurant, Mary did not say to Dan where she was leaving? And during the conversation, Dan had all the things, why would he be so attracted to him? In this regard, I never realized why Marie was so attracted to the movie. He is very brutal and he is really a really good guy (for example he lied in the bookstore Marie, laughs about his past girlfriend, and tries to envy Mary by 'blind date'). Bowling Allie has more skill such as ridiculous scenes where the whole family is caught by Dan and Marie. Yes that really can happen. In real life Dan gradually, sad and manipulative. Even dog flicks like Jane Austen Book Club also get a higher score than this expected "tirejoker".
