I've read all the rave reviews here and those who like this picture are impressed with the imagination. I could not say that it found a lot to suggest. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not too over-heavy-elephant but it is beyond measure. The film looks fair enough, but something can happen to its work and nothing else can be done: an impressive plot (not a real problem for me), not the development of many characters, but nothing in the theme. It just slogs along. Simone's "Heaven's Gate" has a few bad moments and it's a movie that I want to see again soon. For a brighter review of the West, HBO's "DeadWide" is much more than "McCabe".
