I read behind the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Wonderful! It will be great!" I was so wrong. All of the stories were screwed. Actually I still do not get it. It seems to me that all the characters have drinks, smoke (opiates?) And sex. Those who do not have good movie qualities, but please! Where was the story? I finished the movie myself, and yes, it got to the end, but the film was almost over. If you really like to rent it. Just do not believe in the box behind.
