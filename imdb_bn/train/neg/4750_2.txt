I want to give it a 2/10 <br /> <br /> I was really frustrated, really. <br /> <br /> The story was developed poorly, for example, the event was very short and brief, so the moral did not come out clearly. I thought the Brenda song did well, but Shin Quamada seems to have a hard time playing his role. I see Western shows show, but there are some parts, where Chinese elements were also needed! For example, villain. His physical appearance is similar to a robot, something outside Chinese culture. The final and worst errors were wrong, and distortion of mourning shows. <br /> <br /> Others might say that this is a 'kid show' and so does not require such height. However, there are other Disney shows like Mau Lane, which are very good about the story's development and presentation. <br /> <br /> I conclude that Disney films should be well researched and well-designed. A good show is not enough just to depend on a series of martial arts moves.
