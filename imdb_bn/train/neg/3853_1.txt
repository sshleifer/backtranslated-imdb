I think Jason Lee has a huge potential, but it was a big star which was an attempt to break as a star. The plot is horror, comedy horror. I'm doubly laughing, I think for relief because, because of recoil, they were roughly paranoid jokes. I was scared for the future of the flaque, and I had to console myself that the film was faulty, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Styles and Selma Blair are hot, but I still recommend to look at this picture to illustrate the image instead. Save your time. 1 star
