This film is another fine example of Jerry Brackhammer, since 1997, a year before the release of its best version and does not seem to come through a quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as expected. Trying for a joke, every effort in a sensitive moment, and a sincere effort of a love story, I was thinking of what I thought. Save yourself a favor and this one is your money.
