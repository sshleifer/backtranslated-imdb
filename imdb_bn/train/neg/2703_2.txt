Small spinners! <br /> <br /> I've just been sitting late watching this picture, mainly because I enjoyed the idea of ​​Singley's previous work "Boys N Hood". However, I have to say that this is a big disappointment because of which I hate hateful, clinched, so-called "message" movies. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> But the worst of it is to strengthen all the screw-up stereotypes that you can think of. In the second half of the film it has become a cartoon, in its characteristic form, you have been able to lose some discipline of your sympathy for any one dimensional player. <br /> <br /> Once a valid point is not created, the underlying cause of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance As a result, it only sensitized the results of this problem. Its message is contradictory, causing confusion and general lack of plot integrity. For the conclusion of the film, I guess it's predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and desperate. All I have to say is to repeat what is said for a movie called "High Learning". <br /> <br /> If you want a genuine comment on these themes, then fail to fully describe this movie, then rent "American History X" ... unless you only see it for Tire Bank, a life rental Take it.
