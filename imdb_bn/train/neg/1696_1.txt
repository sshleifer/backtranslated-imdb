I hate to throw such a line, but in this case, I think: The worst movie I've seen in a theatrical release of the American remix of the Groodies in the past 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I got out of my system, please explain to me why <br /> <br /> "When a strong enmity dies, curse produces. The death will be consolidated by the wrath of those who encounter it." GRUDGE In the context of this and I would accept it impressive. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not accept it anymore. Those who face "curse" are actually consumed by his wrath and that you get. You want more Well very bad. Some critics and fans think that Grudy's sole purpose is to frighten you. The problem is when there is no plot to speak, vague images and words can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu dragged George Sluzer back and rebuilt his original film, boldly attempting to build the atmosphere for the first time? By repeating the same view over over over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This same scene is released 5 times in the first hour, before the audience's plot is indicated. The first time was actually a bit weird. Each subsequent use became ridiculous as the film continues. Until the end of the film, my friend and I laughed laughing that this scene would end with "a loud scream and black cut". We were never wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no fishing story in this movie, instead it appears in a series of spectacular vintets. When done correctly I have no problem with non-linear stories. The film will release a rhythm or reason for the period from time to time. I did not see such a movie since the opening of the theater version of the movie Highlander 2. The story of this story makes fun of something which might be a movie. If you already know that Scratch is afraid of two letters for death, how is it frustrating when it is found in the body of the body? And when we try to investigate an intelligence invisible disappearance, why should we take care when we already know what happened? <br /> <br /> Clearly, the American version of Rai's second granlit, $ 15 million in its first weekend, there is nothing concocted as a genuine movie impersonation of Graduate. GRUDGE's most awesome thing is that it made $ 40 million on its first weekend, and some people consider it to be "the greatest movie of all time". I'm surprised, what will happen to those who are hungry to look at the graduates?
