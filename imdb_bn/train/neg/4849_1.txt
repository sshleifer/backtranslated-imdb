I just heard this rental today ... good reviews long ago. How nice!! This movie is a mound steaming Poo !! Anyone knows the director's address so I can get my five dollars back ???? Finally someone threw "Stop-Hosne" from the number one spot in 'The worst Iraq War movie ever'. To be fair, I think there is no good Iraq war movie anyway, but this was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not fall into any technical error, there are hundreds of other GWOT vetters that make them all detailed. If the director is annoyed with the lowest possible E-Nothing for technical accuracy and even advice, then the movie can be a bit realistic. I think the writer should "credit" the waste of this film. He obviously snatched this plot from some brilliant imagination with the hindrance of the reality of this movie. But no one wondered what was the point of this movie? Was there a message? Really say ... .wtf ???? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see all the positive reviews. This film is difficult to look like a vat due to all shiny flaws, but no one can ignore it, but the conspiracy decreases, the characters are shallow (to say the least) and the actress is poor. It's ironical, I think this film seems to be related to the explosive ordinance, because I saw this year's biggest bomb.
