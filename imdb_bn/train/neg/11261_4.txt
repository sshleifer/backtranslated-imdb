To get started, you need to point out that you have been completely lost for more than half the time. Yes, some things may happen, but you do not know why or what to do. When you finally illustrate things, you can only understand that it is nothing but a thick soda opera, mature prostitution, dead mother, dealing with an illegitimate son ... characters are rather poor and the actors (especially young people) do not help it much make'em credible look Only Meris Paedes is standing, but she is an extraordinary actress, but the movie does not matter if there is no mobile phone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
