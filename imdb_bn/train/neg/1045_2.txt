Victor Vargas raises the most horrific failure: being realistic Unfortunately, there is no reality in this film. Characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br />? Bad directions Peter Sollet uses all the wrong tools of his operation. It seems like Mr. Sollet does not focus anywhere that it will give a real feel to his picture. Wrong! It just gives it a badly created feeling. Likewise, the camera does not give a documentary style to your movie by shaking, it only gives head to the head and separates it from the screen instead of increasing it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are so painful nets on the screen, such as Mr. Sollet writes with the only goal of trying to see "hip" to his doubtful friends and his "film" filmmaker "Eddie". <br /> <br /> Overall, the only permanent impression this film leaves you is a bad director Mr. Sollet. Next time, how about writing some writing and classes?
