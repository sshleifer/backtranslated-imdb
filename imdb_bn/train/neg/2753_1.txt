First off I would like to point out that Sam Niel will not be seen anywhere in this film. What is a movie without Sam Niel Anyone see the incident Horizon. There is a possible movie about D-Wars, a dragon that controls the camouflage with rocket launchers, but the term is quiet but not sad. No, no sam nail, no good movie. I recommend taking 5 dollars or so it can rent D-Wars and add five and buy Sam's movie - apparently I need to send ten lines so that I recommend a list of movies with Sam + br / > <br /> -Jurassic Park - See the Hunt-horizon for the cold-red October - not the Jurassic Park <br /> <br /> Overall D-Wars Law
