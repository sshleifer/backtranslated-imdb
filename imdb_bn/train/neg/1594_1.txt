How nice. I watched this movie bothered to pants off. Dot, dotless and unmoving <br /> <br /> apparently, Ash and Co. With the help of "the spirit of the forest" ('Princess Manoque' many ??) can travel through time, where they meet a baby named Sam and start "plot". <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huq (Sam) became better with nature, became hippies and tried to free Selbi from some strange predators. I do not even know what went on. It all went into a blu. There were very few of Ash's friends, and all war scenes were annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Too;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash learned that his new friend was actually his grandfather's grandfather. And I think that's it. Is not it very annoying? If you love your children, you will not publish it. (1 in 1.)
