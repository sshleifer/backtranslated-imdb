I just gave 3 stars for beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest were ... well quite annoying. We have outlined our plot for about 50 minutes ... during the World War, the initial part is going on, oh, about 10 minutes? Then there was real action! This is something that: "Let's go to the Sunder Sanctets at Savannah and gaspost!". And perhaps giving a message, such as "Do not kill elephants!". Very Environmental I could not expect this out of the "new" Steven Segal movie, more than that ... the main actress thinks about artificial sun-tan, hair color and much more foundation! And I did not see a scene where his hair became bad, or he was sweating, or his clothes dusty. She did not look like a 19th century woman! And at the bar, where they find out our hero, commenting on the Syyez Commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and in the following years it became famous. Livingstone and other explorers moved to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So, until 1896 to 1900, the action was performed. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes an excellent impression .. as short - hard outside, but soft inside and cuddly. I do not have to cuddle with a nut, but you get points. She has really managed to look at the puppy look that has beaten her face on various occasions. Movie stank The path is very long and growing boring. Do not look at it! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
