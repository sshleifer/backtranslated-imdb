Deed Hossens is a stupid comedy about a bunch of conspiring wives to interrupt each other's husband. This is not a comedy that I can mention, but it never fails its feasibility. Imagine, think of how good the Farrelli brothers had for us to handle Ben Stiler in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh cartridge is based on Jerry Spring? The only strange reason is to catch Dr. Elson's view of the phrase "keep an eye on each other and talk"
