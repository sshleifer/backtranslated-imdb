The reminder of William Lustig's "Maniacs" has proved to be perfect that without the spectacular effect of Tom Sawini and the strong determination of Spinalel, "Manik" would never have been such a goddamn hit. "Vigilant" is poorly operated, a simple-minded script that makes everything for you and predicts in every celebration and performance among all the actors. This picture judged me in the sense of "deja bhu", many times before the "dead wish" was seen! (* 1/2)
