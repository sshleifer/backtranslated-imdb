<br /> <br /> I read the book "List to Die" and I wanted to see what the movie followed the book so I saw it. For the most part it did. There were some minor differences (for example, the last violent scene), but in most cases, the movie was more true in real movies. It may be a mistake - the film has been completely shot - especially the pollen and the belo - I was not impressed with the book. Or take me back that. I started very impressive, gradually became more confusing and at the end completely left unhappy and felt almost gypped. No difference with the movie. Here's why <br /> <br /> there is no "salary" in the book or movie. Very rarely I read someone who has made this thriller, has created such a separation with its final decision and I hope the movie will change a bit. <br /> <br /> Full- (He did it, did not do it, nor did they both) - Not attractive, not interesting and more confusing, annoying and depressed after some other. Add to that Lindsay dies at the end of his life (after his illness his grave will tremble and he will cry in his grave) .. And then where he is thinking of suicide, cut it .... Then suddenly he is fighting for the war with real villains His life which was cleared after being arrested .. But he was met that he and his wife were together ... hello !!! This whole thing has now become a "general hospital" rather than a good old fashion thriller. Seeing the book, I cheated and stopped the film and I was watching the movie (I certainly paid attention that the TV movie was very good) hoped that it would not follow the book. /> <br /> I still think the movie is not worthy of watching and for some reason your face does not leave the taste as bad as the book (or maybe it would be exactly what I knew) but unfortunately this story is not well done.
