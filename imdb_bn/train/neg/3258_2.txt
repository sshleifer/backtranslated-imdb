Dock protection: Bronze people (1 to 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Fearful, horror film ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robson ... is a very heroic '30 His five assistant adventure heroes, all the experts in some fields, who allowed them to resist evil. This was a fantastic hockey series ... but I was very happy to read as a teenager. I knew they had made a movie version of Roni (Tarzan) in the '70s ... but I did not get the chance to see it. I never played in the theater where I lived and never seen on TV. I finally understand why I saw this picture. The plot and characters are not treated seriously ... it's all tongue-in-cheeks and campsie ... like the old Batman TV series ... without the convenience of just being fun ... or any visible wit. Corny dialogue, special effects of sugar, stupid stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Indeed, I find it kind of interesting in its badness ... could they possibly think? Arnold Schwarzenegger was willing to play in the modern day reconstruction ... but I do not imagine that it might be better.
