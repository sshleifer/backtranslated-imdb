I noticed how all other reviews of this movie refer to "healthy" and "recreational". These people are frequently needed to get out. I do not know why they are snatching these bogus, sculptures and pieces into pieces. Pat's sister has no acting talent, and her obscurity has only been exceeded by her co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (yet another reason to cancel the abusive practice of applying models who are unarmed to the unexpected government public. Unfortunately, this practice continues unfortunately). A good supporter Cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Evertti Hartin, among others) works hard to understand something, but does not come in any way. I noticed that two directors shared the credit, even though I would not use the word "credit" (though not "director"). For "good health," these movies forced them to sit without having to torture your loved ones. Find one of those films, and skip this one.
