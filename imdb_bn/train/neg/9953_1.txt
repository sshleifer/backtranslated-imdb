I would really like to see a better movie soon because it seems to each other or it is something that I despise. But my history speaks, I will not lie. Bobby Dirfild and everything about it sucks the green banana peel. I never thought that I could see a movie like this picture. Al Pacino is not acting in this film: He is making a pledge. There are many scenes of his character, the driver of the race, just looking at the camera. He's totally awful. Marthe Keller just as bad. These two are supposed to be a love affair, and there is simply no chemistry there. Sydney Palak is the director of this picture? There's no trace of talent behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man cheered for the ample shut of eyes? I believe it very little. Save yourself an awesome movie experience. Run, do not walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
