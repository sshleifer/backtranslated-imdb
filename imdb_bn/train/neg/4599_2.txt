The proverb "Do not judge a book by its cover", was created as a warning to fail in their patronage. <br /> <br /> I saw the artwork, "The King of the Ents" I immediately thought of losing! Speaking of sky, proudly speaking about a dark perspective on the cover and behind, prosperity promises the story of killings, betrayal, and revenge. Instead, I was less attractive than the surface I found below, which you can find below your average rock. <br /> <br /> "The King of the Ents" Chris L. McKenna made San Crowley as a name for himself in this world, and even the means of killing. None other than San Crowley is concerned about you, sometimes I have not felt any sympathy for this character. Actually, he was impossible, but Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) became as much a disrespectful performance, as well as making the worst of all time with comedic conversations. As a sad widow of Qari Uhara, who is undoubtedly unconditional (homeless), and unknowingly, and George Wendt as a duke, which is primarily from cheers to soft soft but mayan! Now there are some interesting "confusing" sections of this film (source of cover images), but this movie will never be confused in that world. It likes to bomb you with unsupported characters after unsupported characters, bad conversations, and unforeseen events. Alas, alas!
