The only scene that makes me smile where it is with Cristofar (Crazy movie director) The rest of the movie was simply boring.in. In the first hour or so nothing happens. Which is supposed to be funny and is not a win-win Jones Douglas is really overwhelming. Julia Roberts is the first ugly duck (yes right!) In the next room of the girl (where I saw it before?) That works for a routine person. For small I really did not care what would happen to the original characters. If the building collapses in a cusack act suicide, then the film can be further intercepted.
