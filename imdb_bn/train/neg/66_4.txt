I think I was attracted to this film because of the story and the main actor, so I gave it a chance from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo soldiers). Originally founded by Nad Kelly (Heath Ledger) police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he was forced to go to form a gang and went against them to clear the names of himself and his family. Actually I can tell about the story, because I'm not paying full attention to being honest. Orlando Bloom like Joseph Bayern, Naomi Watts like Joey Cooke, Lawrence Kinnigan as Dan Kelly, Philip Bernantini as Steve Hart, Aaron Sherith as Zone Edgarton, Kierzy Parmore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kenny Condon Kate Kelly, Emily Browning Grace Kelly Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott Ledger has created a pretty good performance, which is worth it, and it's a fascinating moment for the movie, especially with a gun battle at the end, but I can not say that I enjoyed it because I did not see it. OK!
