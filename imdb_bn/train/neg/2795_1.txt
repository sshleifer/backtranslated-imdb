Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun on her face, leak behind her head over the boyfriend Neil (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was a "demons and death" rock band's lead singer who could not reduce the sad feelings of his negligence towards his boyfriend (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve other than setting up bullets through your head). However, he has kept his friend with the spirit of Dori (Jill Small), who wants to replace him with the voice so that the group can end the album by stopping Cassidy's premature death. However, the cassidy made an agreement with the dark and must collect the soul. He played this atrocity basically towards the blue, but all the band members or anyone who died in the studio studied died when they believe that they are rather distasught. Cassidy back for payback. <br /> <br /> Lousy micro budget looks awful flick, a cheap cast should work in the other line, and the cheap murder scenes which boards are not effective one bit.
