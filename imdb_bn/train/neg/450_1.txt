It is painful to watch this show ... <br /> <br /> It is clear what creators should change with this show, never changing "jobs", boyfriend and cast. It seems that they wanted to throw Amanda bins a bit ... but there was no idea, and this painful program came up with it. They threw him around a hundred and thirty in the form of a teenager and in most adult situations he kept them in unsuccessful attempts at the comedy again and again. Soon, they understand that he needs a "cycle" and at the end of 20 years people have to try to pass like a thirteen year old. <br /> <br /> How this event survived 4 seasons outside of me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show, and it was put off in the ABC family lineup this afternoon.
