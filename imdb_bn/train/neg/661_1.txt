OK. So I got back. Before starting my review, tell me one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I was negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually came to like this movie. I do not <br /> <br /> It is not true that this horror fantasy is like this. And it's not just that they make every little thing shake (walking with a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It was not just scary. One thing I was surprised: I wanted to have more blood than blood .. which is not saying much <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The house. He comes .. go upstairs. The camera pans on his father's body dead Ghoul She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finding his brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could he say he had no blood?) The killer comes, Donna hides in bed, mother dies. He runs outside screaming for help. The killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut the Therapy Session It confused a lot of people - everyone was asking whether his family was actually killed or imagined - and he mentions how the nightmares are coming back. Filler ensues the dialogue. <br /> <br /> very fast behind Some scenes of salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already (for some reason, he fled 3 days ago, but the police / family could not be known earlier). <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not going to do what I'm going to film, because I do not want to hide it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan has already made a post about it. But in matters of death: they were not that exciting. Theater laughs aloud (an experience that I've never been in a scary movie before, even when not in the stranger's call) most of them time Especially one: The bus boy guy that I saw gave the most ridiculous 'horrible' face. The only death associated with any blood was Lisa, and it was very few. His throat is cut, blood (if you can even call it - it was virtually black) Splatters on the screen. The only blood clair was when we saw her body. Clearly, Fenton had decided to kill him several times after he was executed. Um, all right? The film is one of the most clich√©d I've ever seen. Let's see here .. Compulsive shut-off-screen-boom! View Check out. Twice, actually (you can say they are struggling). Mandatory Back-up-In-Killer Check out. There is a back-up-in-lamp view, but you watched it. Oh, you say you want a bird flying away-away? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to involve one of those here). And, of course, our security-on-out-out-but-still-shattered scenes. May I leave now? I can. <br /> <br /> Anyone saying that the characters are not saying, are you kidding? "Oh, even though the huge alarm is running, literally lets say the building is good and my 3 friends are missing, I'm going upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only favorite character - Lisa - made one of the film's most stupid steps. "Oh, I understand that the psychologist is here! I have to leave my strong lover to run my warning! Oh, shoot, the lift will gradually go on slowly! Construction site!" At the end of the film, they all deserve to die Donna's boyfriend (I can not even remember his name - was it bad?) No one felt any remorse for that, and at that time, the audience was completely emanating from this horrible, cleated film. <br /> <br> There were some positive- acting was honest in most cases, and it was very good. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I want to give it 1/5, and that's being generous. Just for the laugh (and I believe, there were a few of the viewers), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the response was bad. very bad. After the film was over, the people drank aloud with a loud shout. Hope for the bad legs for this one.
