First: I bought the video store. Second: I saw it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of the anticomes were lame. And last, but not least: this is not just a bad movie, it's a complete lie. <br /> <br /> I am a huge Adam Sandler fan despite this frustrating and forgotten movie. I thought it was great because it was his first movie. Even if you are a huge fan of Adam Sandler, do not be bothered to see this movie. Instead, just hold the video, make a yacht board and drop it overboard.
