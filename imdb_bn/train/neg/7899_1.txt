I think all the indoor jokes have created a classical classic on stage. I thought I was terrible, although the story of ridiculous stories and characters has been given, it might be a very good (and funny) movie. Probably what they needed was the real budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many visitors had already indicated, some of the parrody of the Girillins. Therefore, all references to movies. The movie starts somewhere in Peru during an archaeological excavation. An annoying Dufus named Paul, who is up to the aspiring comedian stand, is holed up with his parents in the cave, offering no sarcasm or malicious joke during the movie despite his career plans. His parents are unknowingly archaeological, artificial or mummy or nothing, but UFO proof caves are searching for them. And that's where the Munchies come in the picture. A ugly little mutant hidden in a rock's crevice that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice. They call him Arnold, hold him in a bag and bring him home so that his father can finally show evidence of additional land life. <br /> <br /> Paul, the fool, broke his promise to his father. See Arnold (he lost his father, who lost, he closed a community college to get a 'real' career). Bad rage, beside neighboring neighboring Sicily (television veteran Harvey Curriman), surprised his neighbors. So, he and his lazy son, some AirHope to type hippies (who seems to want to make their character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go and rob Arnold. Why? Get a definitely rich quick project. And of course, Sicil's son is too stupid for Arnold. And after some insects and prawns in Anaerald, he grows in more mucus. <br /> <br /> This was not a film that was very bad. It was just awful in the sea. I was optimistic that the monchas will always change the killings behind them and kill them, even Paul and his girlfriend. At least it is one way to get rid of all the bad acting of the movie which really upgrades the movie. The hand is not referred to the poor special effects that look like dolls. And around really bad writing - it was not even funny - not even a young man who could really give you a horse dog in your eye. I said, muck, if they were given their actual budget and good actor, they would have been able to stop a good parody. Pass.
