This beautifully illustrated and written episode was released for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950's speech, but for years, a person will not react to this kind of violent negativity with the gift of a female Android left alone in asteroids. 2) It was not an Android, but a woman, a beautiful Gene Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades can get its source back from this source. It's done properly. Actually, the modernization of sex-boats is just as I talk about. <br /> <br /> Robot was not new to the movie or television when creating this episode, so at least it could work like that. . Then its fleshiness will add a weird element. Instead, it becomes a wonderful little love story about two people in the remote star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this episode looked at Hamstrong by a Calvinist morality, how much of it was with the machine's masturbation, or neutral illiteracy.
