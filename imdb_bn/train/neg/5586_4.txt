Man-To-Man tries hard for a good movie: It has its heart in the right place, it can be epic and there is a message of doubt that everyone will be grateful. But there are some problems with this photo. It's good to work and work so hard on its message that sometimes the audience will feel uncomfortable. So the images used in this image just do not think it is right-man to man viewer, but hack his message on his head. This example of his role in Joseph Fiennes: he looks anxious, indeed his example of all the other emotions that can express you with one facial facial expression and suggest your reporter. The movie will be more broad and its speed towards the end will ease you to conclude that Man-To-Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to protect it: it's recreational, some ridiculous scenes and shows-stealing Christian Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it with humanity like Hilfant Man (David Lynch) but you will be pleased with the theater. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is very clear) and most of the time is successful.
