Overall a very frustrating picture. Build up to the very basic, basic storyline. The role of Maria Schrader is to search for the hidden past of her family. (Every time it seems to end forever?) There is actually no rhyme in the film. *** *** Speaker ** was rescued from her mother Ruth Nazis, by the German woman Catez Reiman. Ruth's whole character is so dimensional, so stereotyptic. *** SPOILERS LAST *** CAMPAIGN READY IN THE NEW YORK AND BERLIN AND BERLIN 40S IN THE NOW DAY. Please give an indication of the time when the audience must do exactly when you do this. Do not have a clear indication of time ?? Very boring. The worst part is the end. *** Spokilar *** The complete show of the Jews and the cheating of such a great fatality, only a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. Thus the Jews came out of Rosensstra√üe? Never answered the question of liberating the Jews. Gibilas freed them? What to do with Lean Fischer Goebels? Who is in Venice? Ryan won the award for acting? ?? I have no idea. Would be the Jewish theme ??
