... For the worst Swedish films of all time ... Forgive me to silence. <br /> <br /> I did not see the first (the first one that I was bored because of the first one), I hope the better of the first, it was filled with strange cut scenes and very strange plot changes Watched and felt 4/10 high for them (trust me), but it forced me to laugh a few times, because it was so weird and I'm still laughing at this idea I wonder, the next is "Dit Sajnde Pest II". Unlike the novels or books, the celues often do not turn out to be great, and this is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be honest with you: I smiled a bit, it got a few decent joke and slapstick ridiculous among it. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let some fools do this or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably frustrated ...
