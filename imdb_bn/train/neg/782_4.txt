Outside that George Lopez is a scary brawler, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez has ever been fun. I've seen his study-up and have never said a similar smile to laugh. <br /> <br /> His staff comes just like a protestor and his animosity towards the white man comes out of his every single hole in his body. <Br / <br /> <br /> I became laughable with the comedians' white people's joke and loved many of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shows Plot Always Cookie Cutter with Hispanic Pronunciation <br /> <br /> Sunny smiles on drowning comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Why is this show always in competition at 2am?
