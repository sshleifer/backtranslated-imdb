This is a weak series: it is almost the intense interest of "Man Cooled Horses" in almost every aspect and lack of light touch and when they compare each other, they rarely look the same. <br /> <br /> The first one tries to propose a parody and several Indian shows, but the first one tries to try the magic bottle. In this picture the tribe has been lost and abandoned, lost their homeland, modern life has stagnated in heaven and they are living in hardships and poverty. Probably this is this: The first film took us to a place where we would like to have an easy time. It takes us to the broken Indians in a sad world and White Man is the hero and the savior who denies the full idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The white beauty of the first beauty has been learned and it has been discovered that the real civilization is in place of Western materialism. It is lacking in the second movie and so we end up with a weak film. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment.
