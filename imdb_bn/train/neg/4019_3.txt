Dakota (1988) starring another iron diamond Phillips. This film is similar to the next releases of the movie Harley. There are some differences but they are both the same. I do not know which one is the first. I guess it would remain one of the mysteries of life. But both of them are in "children" who are trying to live around. Instead of bikes involved in this one horse. They're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. If you have a serious L.D.P. The fan then I recommend that you both of them. You get some extreme mugging and posturing from L.D.P. If you are in the game go for it. <br /> <br /> is not recommended, without LDP. FRIENDS !!!
