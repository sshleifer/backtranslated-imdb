Hamming confused with Bombay-Jumbo, which is so difficult to find in Evil Dead that it mentions Bruce Campbell many times. The problem is, it's not just that great movie as in the same league. This movie is nowhere near as original. This plot was used earlier, by Kevin Tenny on Demons of Night, and it was much more fun. These torments spend too much time with complex expositions, before taking children to the wonderful palace and introducing giant events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The screen keeps another top-on-top performance that he will be jealous of Crawford's Waver. As kids played, it is passable but no money is good. Sticky camera work is more annoying than tricky or atmospheric. When the first person roams around some deadly fishing while sending his victims and is scary for a few seconds, then there are some good moments. Gore level is less than medium-length, but the director tries to make the actors appear to obscure them several times. All is okay, okay if you have 87 minutes to waste.
