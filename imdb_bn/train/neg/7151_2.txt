I am proud to have seen three quick and furious films. Sure, the plots are stupid, and they can be a little cheesy, but I like driving them, and all the beautiful cars, and the secret midnight race. And I'm glad to see the fourth one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a clear guide. Three have been made by the most qualified directors, all of them have taken movies in different ways, equally exciting. The Redline looks like the producer is sleeping with a dozen women casting cloth and extending them, then lifting his lead from Hollywood's unemployment line. And scripts. Favorite. Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. This 70 TV movie has been made for bad. Yes, there were some cool cars in the film, but you really do not see much work, and the action is so weak that you can not get excited by chases, if one does not excite the cars, why do not you To go to the movie? <br /> <br /> I see a group of viewers, and I can not stop joking at all. I got dirty look, but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
