This movie is sunny, not well. Fights are done very badly, sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones and even it will only happen two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie. Gunfight means that a hero can shoot 10 people to open fire on a field, shoot a gun, start shooting again, and get hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the man is awake, his memory is lost, he started fighting with love. Five years later, the memory came back, took revenge to Bubbalala. <br /> <br /> <br /> Your mom is not valuable, your time is not really valuable unless you are drunk and disturbed.
