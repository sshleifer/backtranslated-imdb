How nice. Recently I recently felt the need to comment on the movies, but it is especially begging for a bitdown. Let's start at the beginning. Firstly, author-director Susan Montfford told Kim Basinger in the role of a tired old victim, the necessary humiliating husband and the existence of a neutral colony. It should now be said that almost all the content of this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The busiest shopping night of the year. She decided to do something about it, so she left a nasty note of the windshield of cars. The next fifteen minutes of the movie, Dela, roamlessly in the shopping mall. When he finally arrives in his car, the lips face his note, a policeman is killed, and he goes away, and he reaches to him, and he goes away, and they make him do something else, and many others take it. Everything is completely expected and uninvolving. The lips are not scary and are not very annoying, and they all pick one after the other in normal way. <br /> <br /> It is a movie in which all action depends on the character, as you can imagine stupid. Why do not the bad people kill him instead of waiting to hit him with tire iron? And once, just once, in such a film, the leader of the pack eventually dies? What is the matter that they all are sorted out when they are all equally inactive? In most of the films, only Lucas has a smile, "Della !!!" Run around a shanked wood. And the inclusion of the Joy section on the soundtrack of this confusing movie is insulting. <br /> <br /> The part that I was running for my computer keypad was when the lace was tired and shouted in the sky, "Where are you, God?" When was the film really created when it was created? I only give it 2 for the sake of the choreography and illumination, and it is not as bad as 'BTK killer', the final marker to judge any terrible movie. Cheers!
