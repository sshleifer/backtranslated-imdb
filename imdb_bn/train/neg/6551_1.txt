Bad is a study. Bad acting, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Scoiller pieces do not come in any cheesier or weird funnier than these things. At the end of "cinema", you wonder why they were annoyed at first place. The poor Malcolm McDowell, was he cash or something short? Still worry to see this? * Spirit Ahio *: If you did not die due to laughter in the first thirty minutes, then you will see a cyborg-populated city called "Sathoin", you will go. Avoid these, my movie-loving friends. To avoid.
