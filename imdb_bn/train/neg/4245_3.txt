Was this movie based on the real truth? I do not really hope! <br /> <br /> We have seen how many armed police empty out guns for 2 people for visible surgery. This is a good idea; The aim for armor! ... Forgive me, but for the big fat how irritable head or their feet cry loudly. Or did they save their invisible tanks? They came from Crypt? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie became fair enough, but after 20 minute shoot-out, it turned out to be really boring. <br /> <br /> that the documentary style does not work for me, but that just does not find a suitable one. <br /> <br /> Extremely incredible thing that eventually 'makes it hard to finish. <br /> <3/10 for fine editing
