Of course, this is not actually a blockbuster, it does not even look at that position. "Ditar" is the name of a popular German musician, who hated for acting or love for his child, and what exactly is this film. It was written a few years ago based on autobiography "Deuter Bohelen" but it is not correct. The film is subject to some sexually abusive material (at least for American standards) which is scary (of course not necessarily another "actor" or fool) - it depends on your individual kind of humor or you're "bohale" -fan or not Technically speaking there is not much criticism. I can see this movie as an Ok-Movie for telling me.
