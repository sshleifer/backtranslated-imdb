What a muddled mess. I have seen this with a friend a few moments ago and we both seem to be very surprised by the movie, but this assurance is not one of them. While there may be something very good idea / idea and of course some good performance (under circumstances), it is all burnt under random unconsciousness. As far as Sir Anthony is concerned about performing natural birth killers, U Turn and similar films, much of the way from the gene pool, or perhaps he saw himself as Nixon's inspiration. Tell us what you like about David Lynch, but at least he is often more than a madman's approach. <br /> <br /> quoting his statement that he made this movie a joke. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
