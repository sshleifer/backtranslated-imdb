This will be the worst movie I've ever tried to see. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to be interested in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and there was plenty of time just for fun for the movie. The container we were in was in the stock - they must have found it from the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, it's not like any movie. It started with a bad compartment and then became worse. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies, of which I do not care about anything. But if you decide to waste your time in this movie, do not say that I've warned you.
