This Tarzan epic is saying a very good one. The only reason for this movie was that. John Derek wanted to show his wife beautiful wife! '10' was a humorous film at Bo Derek and was the reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If you're that good, then go ahead fast and left the rest! This movie (like Bellerora) was once again a vehicle of Bo Derek to show its brutal performance. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; This is one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time in this movie ... instead of buying books.
