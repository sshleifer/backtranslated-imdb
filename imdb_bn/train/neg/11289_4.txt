Elizabeth Ward Graysen, who may be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "Bimbo blasts" (perhaps the goal for her now!) Is probably the weakest element in the show. It has really kept the tired formula of the series in the series - Hero Amar encounters another immortal with flashbacks for the last time, but there are some conflicts, and ultimately a sword war where you have a cheap special effect sequence. <br /> <br /> Then you have Nick Wolf's character. Generally, the hero of your usually unheard 90, usually the story of "sexual tension". (Seriously, why you think Hollywood's tendencies are more attractive than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the characters in Virtual Utah imitated New York and half in Paris ... like the Highlander.
