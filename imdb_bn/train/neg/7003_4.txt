(Lawyer: Trinity is still my name) It looks like this that they call me trinity to capitalize on the outstanding European box-office success, at the moment Joseph E. The pictures of Levine and Avro-Embassy America want to capitalize it, and America is also good. Hill / Spencer photos were not too bad since only limited success in the US, and this mostly boring, drone-out movie does not help it. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear their death (Harry Carey Jr) father that they will successfully ban the law and take care of each other. Later they are involved in arms smugglers who loot guns from a monastery and those who think they are a pair of federal agents. Despite some fun scenes, it is becoming flat, especially in a trinity where Bamboo is in a French French restaurant and they do not know how they can carry. And the card shark scenes were very mildly sunny. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Pretty good If I want to buy its CD soundtracks, then there can be something else. <br /> <br /> The film could have closed for almost half an hour and it did not drag for such a long time. . Looks like most of the scenes are being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in about 2/3 percent of the way. The DVD is also terrible, it's the constant sound of the soundtrack, and it's a poor print that looks like it should be sent to the great scrap heap in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step from the previous movie <br /> <br /> <br />
