Madhur has given Chandni Bar a powerful movie in our past. His next film was one of the worst films of all time. This is apparently the story of some high class people in India. After watching a scene where a man forced another person to star in the movie for sexual reasons. I felt like breaking the theme and DVD. Eventually I did. Why this movie was a child pornography and a sex scene scene. I was shocked to see a movie showing literally opposite and naked children. Very annoying material, there was no need to show the children completely naked. One of the rich people likes to kidnap poor children and sell British men to foreign people in this movie. I am surprised to find this movie a hit in the Indian part, otherwise the super flop in the United Kingdom, USA and Australia. I am from the UK, and such things make me sick, should not be released in the UK.
