I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor so he's interested in seeing how he / she is as a writer / director. I could not be more frustrated by this step. The film was so confused and the cinematography ended so much that I wanted to pull the plug from the wall. The actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut off from a writer or director and clearly Mr Hopkins falls into this category. The films I saw in my 50 years are sometimes the worst movie ever. Please grace us all. Keep Hopkins and acting, which you are awesome, and go out of writing and those who instruct the talents in the region. If I could give less than one ratings for this movie, I would certainly want to.
