Just because it's an event really happened does not mean it would be a good screenplay / movie. Peter Bogdanovich's claims were based on actual events that took place on a crucietic run by William Randolph Heart, The Ketes Moy. The authors pay more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than to take when creating a story to live in strange characters. The original moments of the story seem impossible; For example, when the heart accidentally beat the producer, believe him to be Chaplin. Anyone wearing false hat is trite and conrived crushing an original element of the story. The story is an attempt to become a dark comedy, but The Ketes Meyer misses an important part of this equation, comedy. There is a lack of sympathy for any characters. Can be killed, who dies, who is guilty and who is innocent? There is no strong character to be happy. As a result, difficulties are difficult to take care of and the end result is related to the accessory.
