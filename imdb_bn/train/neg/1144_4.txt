The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. First off it is very dark, it is probably difficult to understand the position and the impact of the bad influences, that is, some scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what's happening. Despite the Nij√±a-cinema, the second is its lack of martial arts. Of course, some of the lower quality, but most of the disadvantage is that automatic firearms or explosion sets are set on fire. Push a problem with automatic guns that seem to have an endless supply of ammunition Sonawat guards die like flies, and Ninja bullets seem to be almost defense of bullets. <br /> <br /> What can be said about it? The pioneer of ideas and ambitions. Some actors, and especially for a Swedish film, have good action scenes despite martial arts. Some nice slow-motion scenes and most of the blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapon technology that makes the heart or brain explode in the victim. Most of the parts you watch in B-movie <br /> <br /> This is definitely a B-movie, because there can not be any mistake. But if you expect it and it looks like a B-movie, it's entertaining. But do not forget, this is not just a B-movie but it is set in eighty. For example, in addition to wearing some girls ... "Attractive" cloth lets say, there are lethal dose of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> See for all, religion status and ambition. Enjoy it, and then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
