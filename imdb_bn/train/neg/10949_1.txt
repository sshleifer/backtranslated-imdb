I go to the entertainment movie. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film. From the beginning to the beginning, there is no vacancy from this woman's gray, gradual reality. It's a one-read, with no change in the mood. I stayed in the end because I was sure things would be better. They do not, and I do not think that I was the only one, traveling around the movie, moving around and moving around so many pictures. Describing social obstacles in real terms is not a crime, but disturbed by the annoyance of your audience, there is no way to gain public sympathy. A horror film.
