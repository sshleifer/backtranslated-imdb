I'm a fan of nightmares but this one is awesome. Death is so prevalent. The whole Nintendo view you were seeing after this 20 years is old. I like flashbacks. I think there should be a prequel about when they were still alive. That has been more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. Depending on how much extra time you have.
