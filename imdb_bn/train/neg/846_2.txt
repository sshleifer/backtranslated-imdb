To this end, in the last 20 years, I saw the worst movie. When I saw that Michael Madison was in it, I thought it could not be a bad movie because he was in some pretty films, and he was a nice actor. Wrong! Someone should waste their time in this film. I hastened for 80 percent faster and I do not think I missed a thing.
