There are some scenes in "The Cats Myo" which boasts intelligent dialogue and some of the cool performances surprised me. Thanks to the Chaplin (partly for the excellent hairstyle and some talented designers' makeup jobs), Eddie Ezard is more effective. Joanna Lumley is compulsory as the novelist Elinor Glyn; And Kirsten won the title of Donest Marion Davis (although it is difficult to explain why the movie does not use Stuart in its real life). But this element does not add a complete complete. The screenplay seems to have worked very hard in some scenes - meetings between Davis and Chaplin are specially made - but not so difficult in the big picture. Some minor characters do not have to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is miraculous (eg, why does Thomas Innes think that something that should not be heard in heart?), And party scenes are repetitive and tedious. I think a trip to Harst Yout was more fun than a movie. Davis has been identified as a standard Bubble Flapper type, which is not true right and author's ideas about Chaplin and Love are impossible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovic was so similar to the thirty in "Paper Moon", but it was not similar to the 30s. He told the nice apparel designer to use only black and cream, which gives the party a very artificial appearance of the guest and only stereotypical tracks run for the time (eg, "Yes, we have no art"). When the heart says to everyone, "Charleston, Charleston!" Just before shooting the scene, actors feel like a ten-minute dance recital. <br /> <br /> Silent film stars can create interesting movies of life, I'm sure, but not this time.
