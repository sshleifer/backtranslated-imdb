This movie is horrible when you pay attention to it. This is a perfect movie, if you only see dance scenes across the screen - there is no apparent connection later on. I hired this movie because I'm David Bowie's fan, and I really appreciate the musical. Ultimately, Boey was in film for a total of ten minutes, and singing and dance sequences were sparrows and there was something else to be desired. The morality of the story was really disrespectful. I could not tell about the racial problems in London in the 1950s or not being sold. I wanted to eat cheesy for the first half of the movie but I taught the message "sold out". When I started killing the blacks, I thought my tape got worse. Maybe I hired two different movies halfway? No, a "Keep Britain Britain" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but WWII is not something that you can write a musical instrument. At least one musical that can be reasonably described as a "campi", as I did several times in this review. Overall, I want to say that if this film is made by his mind and throwing a good actor, it can do better. (And David Bowie keep it for goddammit than me!) My grade: C-
