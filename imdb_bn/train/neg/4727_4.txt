This picture is really a curate egg, some parts are good. Unlike other critics, I have found that its main fault is the inability to attract the characters' interest in the character and plot. I sat by it because I'm interested in Rock'Orl and the band's dynamism, but if I want to analyze it on the basis of its talent as a movie, then I have to stop it. Some Cavits: Jason Behar is a good and strong believer in Rock Leopard; The description of his childhood panic is unclear, although Leviyan's good-acting relationship has been directed to his parents but the behavior of the viewers (which should not be the case) is finally bizarre. Yet the concept of using stage personalities to solve internal conflicts is interesting, though not a novel and was not fully searched as a theme for this movie. John Lennon's answer was boring, but I acknowledge that I'm not a Beatles fan. At any rate, Livienne and his band reminded me more of osis than beetle, in the sense that something was revealed about them. Another frustrating thing about the movie was that it was open with some interesting - though the middle-class and high school level - philosophical songs of the main character, but left the threads of his thoughts there, only briefly when the film was taken to lift them in the middle, when Levien said, "In front of God, There was music "(never in the 1990s that Tia Maria's advertisement It can be seen, "before, there was a tie in there"? It seems to be a stupid conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he reached, but he deserves it. Fortunately, his bassist and friend Dominique played by Monghan, he feels confused about the reaction when he "did not know". <br /> <br /> All aspects of limited power and plots can go both ways in future projects, deviation or an interesting and more mature perspective.
