I'm not a big fan of Slicker Flickr, but with low-budget exploitation criteria, it's really lingle. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly annoying (both have some, but it's all kind ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it was not even released on the theater (although it might; * After all, * Out of space, planned at 9 * theater). There is a good (and efficiently distributed) line right in the whole movie; I guess it's stolen from somewhere. <br /> <br /> Acting is the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood was one of the few capable actors, and the rest of them were humorously humpy, which might be fun to watch. However, most of her actors can pass as mostly educated. Here, those who can not read their lines like cigar-store Indians, they have learned the word. And there is a difference in the film: it can be badly run for most movies, then there is a lot of transition for the end to the hilarious end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Good for meditation, but with this one, even a moral turmoil does not seem to work there. <br /> <br /> And you know the fun stuff? They are clear  াবে একটি সিক্যুয়াল তৈরি করার প্রত্যাশিত! <br /> <br /> এটি খুবই খারাপ এবং বিরক্তিকর যে এটি আসলেই অদ্ভুত ভাবে আকর্ষণীয় হয়ে উঠেছে। আমি বেশিরভাগ ভিডিওর মাধ্যমে বিস্মিত হয়ে বসে আছি কেন কেউ এটি তৈরির বিরক্তি নিয়ে যাবে।
