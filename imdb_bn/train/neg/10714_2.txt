For two funny comedians, the movie was terrible. Fast forward it and do no good! Waste time and waste money! Tina Fai is such a great writer, I could be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only show the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought for a chick flick, sucked it. What's up with that is Very slow reply to the movie was annoying. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I want this money back! Bro from us here in Arizona. Thanks but not thanks. These stupid elements are the people you think are pregnant. I thought it was going to be very fun, I had my own children and I helped others with kids. It can be more along the lines of reality.
