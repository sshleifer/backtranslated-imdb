This is my first movie review of IMDB. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not be unmarked by this movie in good conscience. People should be warned! <br /> <br /> My first rating is: 0 (as "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Wais, and Christopher Walken And yet, I hate this movie. There is a plot, but there are no scripts when there is care. The conversation is unreasonable and straightforward, annoying, situations, stream of events slowly and slightly deliberately, letters are disrespectful and selfish, and the story is based on a good premise, stupid. This movie is a piece of puree. <br /> <br /> Do not be sad to waste money in this movie, your time is not worth watching. Please do not see it ... I request you!
