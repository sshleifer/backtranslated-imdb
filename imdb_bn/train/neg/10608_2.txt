I do not think the Universal soldier bit of Van Dame any movie ever but you did not know. This movie was good but was not as good as 1st. VD will provide a luc and fight again. He tried the B 2B fun here but it is likely to be a sunny price in a shiny. VD has a child from Aleppo this time, well it showed a picture of him 2. Goldberg was calm, he forgot his famous steps-that his reasons I do not see wrestling-sucks Videi and Goldberg had some good fights. It ended up like the 1st but just that was not good. VD takes the best steps in his career, such as helicopter kick. However, the final finishing should be more long. However, it is valuable to look but it will never be above the original.
