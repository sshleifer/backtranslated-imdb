And the lowest rating goes to the Oscars for classic horror actors - Dwight Frye. Sincerely his name should be described with the same wonders as Karloff, Luogsi and Price, and this film proves that. His character, Harman, is the reason I can give two reasons to watch this movie. Diet has given slightly more than a bit annoying miffy, it's a loving but surprising dissonance that gives you a big role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason is M. Ibern's humor. In the medical profession itself, the self-rogue-prone Hypondodriac expert will be able to provide performance. Although "medical mistakes" give other types of chocolate, especially when a good doctor takes a sample of his colleagues' medicines ... "Be good to give it to him" Unfortunately, these two extraordinary performances could not help me awake through three attempts. Slow movie The plot is predictable with just a few short twists. While closing a valid wonderful atmosphere, the picture was more rewarding for me to live in Zawani - yes you can use a lot more shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - to see fries and eyelen once to see - but only when it is wide awake and lots of caffeine.
