This Kiyoshi Kurosawa Scratch movie is quite wild, and it was at least a jump fear that caught me off guard. But finally, the film is incredibly stupid, a detective tries to stop a suspected serial killer, only to know that he can take part in the crime. Then she finds herself pierced by a superb Asian lady ghost, and why no idea why (and not visitors). As the other murderers commit, the killers are easily found, yet he becomes more confused and this ghost still disappoints him for some reason. The plot is not totally stupid, the lady is more fun than the ghost, especially when she suddenly flies across the city, such as Wonder Woman. And the end makes a little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes a bit sensual and I can not recommend it at all. If it does not make itself serious, I think it was supposed to be a black comedy. "Outside the Brighter Future" This is the worst movie directed by Kyyashi Kuorawa.
