I went to see this in my wife and 3 year old son. She loved it much more than my wife and I did. Written by Pixar / Disney is surprisingly poor for traveling. In fact, I had a very difficult time paying too much attention. The movie seems amazing, but the story is so weird and long that I hope my son will fall asleep so I could take him away. <br /> <br /> A fun idea, it's just been so weird, (bad screenplay?) especially when we first meet "family" I know that we think that the family is frustrating but the good Lord, they can reduce the order in 15 minutes (probably, I'm not actually the time). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.
