The Phantom of the Mall is a film that best fits in the "Easy forgotten" section. This is a beautiful lounge form of the famous story of the opera of Fantatum Gaston Lerox. There is no bad idea for yourself, but the plot and production of this film is a way to weaken to pay attention to that story. On the bright side, Gaston Lerux will not have to roam in his grave yet. It can be very bad. <br /> <br /> Mal's Phantom has many unreal flashbacks and makes it so memorable that it is memorable. Also, the authors wanted to give a lot of stories than necessary. And even though there are many mysteries about Eric's character ... the basic plot is general and the day-to-day *** Spokillers *** This is about a young couple who is uninterrupted because the boy dies in the fire. That fire was set in his home because he and his parents refused to sell their homes for the construction of a large mall. The boy survived the fire and hid himself in the mall to take revenge on himself. Meanwhile, he worked with his daughter and now tried to forget her loss **** The last speaker *** *** This is pretty simple - but effective - Plots get plummeted by many vain elements and annoying conspiracy theories. It should be just an entertaining horror film, it's wildly trying to be an intelligent thriller ... and it's not what the fans are looking for. There are some innovative killings, but they are not quite satisfied with the people who want to see a shocking horror film. And besides, the fan's fanatam could use the least humor !! This whole product - Includes welding - takes very seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with a few positives ... for example, it makes Kain four bigger !! The die-hard horror fan must recognize him as the father of the dead! That horror milestone has yet to find an equal. Although his role in this movie was limited and even completely unnecessary ... but it was better to see him again. TV-movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as Mayor, he is a good actress and an elegant lady. Paoli Shoreo is in it but I can not bear it ... so my opinion about him can be a bit biased. And finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress known as Curry Whitman. She is a very beautiful girl and she has a bit of talent ... very bad she is not made on top of it. Actually, this film has said enough about his biggest achievement and his career ...
