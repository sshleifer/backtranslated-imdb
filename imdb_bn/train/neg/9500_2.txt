This movie is really bad. In addition to Michael Iranside, the act is terrible horror. I do not have the story After the fight between two Mac gangs, the only survivor Richard Greco He came to a city and suddenly he was preferred to fight against bad people who wants Indian land. He said on the cover that he was an Indian who returned to his home, he could not hear it in the film, if that was not clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A bad actor. Strong and ugly He said his line is very good. And we will not talk about San Young, he was not my favorite actor, but in this film he played an Indian woman who is in love with Bolt (Greek). She is terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose it with amanda page and in the safarfews. I was throwing Michael Ironside because this one choosed. Maybe I want to take a subterfuge <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I have it at home. I wrote it after watching the movie.
