Usually they are not very good, but I like the movies of lesbians. I favor, I guess! <br /> <br /> But it's just poking. Yes, the scenery and the building are beautiful, and have a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is a complete waste time. Alumari Sulinge's middle and high / stone-made / easy to operate a drug or poultry is changed, and Ela fully captures this disgraceful behavior throughout the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know!) Relationships between two, there may be some satisfaction. But at one point Amnari asked Ela, "Why do you love me?" Ella even does not acknowledge this. It is never clear that it is nothing more than a bona fide road trip (shameful) Lejian with a simple woman. <br /> <br /> They even contact with two women and local people. Journey, which can be animated and informative, instead of flat, tiresome and mostly unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was strangers. Women traveled two seats Ford Coup with a bed-sized trunk. Yet when they set up camps, they have a big tent, cottage, sleeping gear and even a table, chair and typewriter! On top of it, when they ride in a boat, we see luggage, perhaps they also carry a little Ford's trunk! <br /> <br /> And through the whole film, we never see a gas station, or anywhere we see, there is no place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through the seamless mile of deserted desert. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Leave this one in the rack.
