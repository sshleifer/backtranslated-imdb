After listening to hearing about how bad it was, I saw myself and wanted to see myself. Seriously, even if you read all negative comments here, you will not be too close to understanding how bad this movie is, even though it has to be one of the most fun things I have ever seen! Do not bother posting a comment here before, but this piece of this brand really warrants. <br /> <br /> Firstly the whole plot is ridiculous and unconscious. The main character's brother (Ben or Arthur, forgetting what I forgot and forgetting truth is not very clear) wants to kill everyone from the point of view of gay philosophy - because homosexuality is hateful to Christians, but apparently genocide. Then there is some other shit trying to pressure the gay couple's former wife to shoot him in gun battle. It does not increase anything, but giving one of the funniest lines of our entire movie conversation - "I do not understand ... you do not understand! <br /> <br /> <br /> Then played, which is just turmoil It must be believed to be seen. My personal favorite is apparently a stoneless civil rights lawyer, who is definitely reading something close to her line, yet still her mess management. Enough said. Gay couples can not be less believers. Wonderful, attractive and perfectly pregnant, and her boyfriend who looks like Busto's advert, like the little cartoon duck guy. Only hole. And less talented. <br /> <br /> "Film" is portrayed by a person who is unable to stay still even remotely, and the number of mistakes is amazing. The whole thing kicks off with fat guy in the bed with a pair on the boot. Yes <br /> <br /> However, we all know how terrible this stuff is, so I want to highlight some priceless comedy moments that give "film". <br /> <br /> - Like a six-year-old girl in the car park, Preeti, like a fat person burns a church fire and runs away to escape her Ridiculous <br /> <br /> - Mildred! Any idea how he relates to the main characters - sometimes they know him, sometimes they are not, but they pop up in some scenes. Ridiculous <br /> <br /> - The stone has thrown stones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am sure you do not eat time while you watch !!!! Lord Main character / director / producer Tub gets naked. It's a lie <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are uncertainly bad, but oddly the most strange thing you'll see for a long time. In the literal sense, nothing is good about this excuse for a movie, by the director's director even 15 times by writing his own name, the credits are initially managed to create an interest.
