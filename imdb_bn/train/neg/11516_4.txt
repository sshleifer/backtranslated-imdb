For years, Madonna has not only tried to prove herself, but with the eyes of the public, she can work. Unfortunately, it is not good to try hard to tear off his own personality. <br /> <br /> She seems to be renting if she is not a star of a movie: If you see her performances in a display of sexual disciplines Susan (1985) or her own (1 99 2) a tail, she looks really good. . As this story revolves around other actors, so the weight of hope is taken by default on her shoulder. <br /> <br /> The problem starts whenever he is asked to be the star of the movie, irrespective of style, regardless of style. The idea of ​​a plot that should be visualized, must be encouraging, like the actual movie performance, against the effectiveness of the video, whether it is good, medium or simple horror. This is a significant difference between Madonna and, say, Bate Davis, or Merrill Strip. The next two, however, failed the film (because the visual story was inadequate with some of our functionality, or the lack of script decreased, or because the actress was not at the moment), there is an extra in their performance, which will take the film out of the whole bombs. Both Davis and Strip have shared them: Bates, doing more than Strip, Renting like Boonini Wahare (1971) and Wicked stemmothor (1989); Steipei-SH-Deville (1989). But at least that nature has both attacked their roles that have forgotten the benefit of our film and have seen the performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He really expressed another personality, Shadow and Fog (1992) have the ability to reveal a personality like Woody Allen, an inferior classic during the time of his pan screen. And a little stiff, even nervous, as he was aware of the camera and crew and could not just go. <br /> <br /> He tried again to prove that what he could do is basically a two-letter movie. Giaca Richie, known for the power of men's action action films, seems like a story close to a story like Michael Angelo Antonio or Engmer Bergman, who can tell the story of two people with incredible comfort. And in the 89 minutes, events occur in an incredible way that when the last half an hour comes and the story takes a dramatic turn, it does not seem sincere. Fai Duneau's Laura Suddenly, the love could suddenly be 180 degree turn from a worthless dining without any valuable value, suddenly discovering his passion for Tommy Lee Jones in Yawes of Laura Mars (1978). Adriano Jianni is frequently odd in the middle of the movie - there is no humor in it and it really looks psychopathic - and when it looks at Madonna's love, it will be very quick to believe. Gradually, this music is not about any growth or involvement on the "transformation" of filming and romantic and beautiful scenery, which tells the story of the story of surviving characters, unlike in a love story that discovers each other. <BR> <br /> Trying to do the last thing unheard of against the movie - it will only drag it, it will close it, and when Madonna is portrayed hoping to be devastating in a cruel bond, it is trying very hard. Many actresses have done good work conveying so little. Harris is a performance that is suitable for acting styles at the beginning of the 30th century, where compensation is done as part or emotion. <br /> <br /> Has the movie been good? Of course. There are innumerable ways to portray visitors in such a way that the viewer realizes that these people may at least hope to see each other again - for example, it has been done before the overboard (1987). It can be an existential practice, in which two very different people need to rely on each other but do not necessarily change (to ensure moral sound). Many conversations and unnecessary lover scenes can be preserved for a more "silent" film - such as PERSONA (1966). It may even be something of a thriller, it provides that the average line of the character of Zayninani was in Billy Jane's Dead Cam (1989). It was done for sexual intercourse but it did well for Madonna, as he got his feelings upside down, Uber-control fiasco. But with its humorous narrative, at least without a soft aspect hiding behind a mask of softness without a glimpse of its character, and without defining its own character, it becomes another scary look like sex war.
