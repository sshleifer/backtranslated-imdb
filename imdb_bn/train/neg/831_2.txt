Live! Yes, but not kicked. <br /> <br /> True story: A few days ago, a Dutch TV station announced that they were going to a new reality show. Rather a contest. The main participant of this event will be a woman who is going to die of something terrible and she will donate her kidneys to the lucky one with progressive kidney failure. For the reality <br /> <br /> <br /> The country and the international media were like a torch-like torch on this story, saying that it is scary, immoral, the world is coming, and so on. At one time, I agreed. <br /> <br /> After the end of the month, the event was developed up to a degree that the government occupied most of the programs in order to proceed or not, instead of running the country <br /> <br /> <br /> The show continued towards the wind and on the right till the last moment. And till the last moment the country was in arms, Prime Minister's speech, writing about it every newspaper, everybody in the country kept their breath. And push the network. Television is on a new border. And they are definitely successful to fix that. <br /> <br /> This event has been broadcast, and we all saw a great sick woman who would choose the right candidate for her kidney, she will survive, when she will die soon. <br /> <br /> And then, at the last moment of the event it was revealed that it was a partial fraud. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The entire program, the promotion and commercial and all the discussions, was created for excellent measurements for several months, there was a promotion stunt to pay attention to the main shortcomings of organ donors. The person who established this particular network died due to kidney disease itself. <br /> <br /> Now it's television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> * Spellar * I'm going to believe it will get it through FCC. If I'm going to believe it will get it through the US Supreme Court on the basis of the free expression. Just as I would believe this ridiculous end where this woman dragged it and there was a problem of conscience because some people shot themselves in the air. <br /> <br /> This is already done. Instead see Man Running with Arnold. At least it was a half better end. <br /> <br /> * Speller * This is an unexpected bad piece of film together with a ridiculous end. So he shoots at last, after we leave the theater, does it seem to make the movie better for the public? Do not accept my word for it, but I would say it: leave it alone and instead of checking the test pattern, you will get more quality.
