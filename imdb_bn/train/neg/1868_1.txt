This picture is terrible. Each line was stolen from 8MM (at least the Italian Dual Blade Edition). If you like trash ... try the original trash, try it; But be careful: it's not "Flickr kind", "very bad it's good". In her pocket, it can really look like a porn, but believe me, if you are looking for "Snack", S & M, Hardcore, Softcore ... or even a common lover thriller, find something else in the store! I'm telling you, 'Absolutely unpredictable and unclear shooting, acting, plot, conversations (the only good line I have said before, as I said earlier, was stolen from 8mm of Joawel Schumacher!) Will throw it in the tears. A few minutes and "happy ending" are completely rebelling! I'll give it a star: Half of the sequel to the back of the scene, "hunting eyes" after stubbornness (stolen from 8mm) and half for mother and girl's sexy bodies (which did not handle this while watching the Turkish observer keep me awake, however! )
