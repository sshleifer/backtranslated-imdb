I should love this movie. Acting is very good and Barbara Stanvec is great but the movie always seems very annoying to me. The film considers the working class to be less and cheaper. The girl is ashamed of her mother and the girl is not climbing up, she gave me a lot of discomfort. Barbara worshiped mother as Stanwick but she loves mothers to find happiness for her father's family. I wonder how many people have seen this movie in this way. Acting was very good and valuable. I really do not like story lines. Just a personal choice. Thank you
