Philip Who Dicken movie And that's a decent for that matter. Pooch (Woo) and the hate that is known as minority report (Spielberg). But it was a little more for me to face, twisting and cheesing. Half the way through the movie I've already started to panic about this end, and I'm sorry. But this does not mean that the movie is not worth its time. Not in any way. The first half (as already made a lot of comments here) is horrible. There are some parts where you start to suspect that we start to doubt whether the director wants to express how important the future looks are (we can do whatever we can). But there are paranoia and "joint out" feeling. Good one
