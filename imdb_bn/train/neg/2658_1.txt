Looking at CBS's "sirendor, Dorothy", I was wondering why Diane Keaton wants to stay in it (this is not a television movie - it's not the lack of seductive roles for older actors, it's not surprising that the Academy Award winner? Acting TV as Keaton launched - But because it offers no chance for Keaton to shine). The single mother apologizes to the sudden death of her prominent daughter, imposes upon him - and gradually becomes a friend - the youth-youth group was nearing the time of her daughter's accident. From the novel, this telepelle gives a group of our self-absorbed characters that will avoid the road to avoid. Painful and gradually, these fools are incredibly incredible, like the handsome scenes and the children in the bungalow near the children's home, where the children live (a young man who wears a muscle shirt, he tells Diane Keaton, "Sirndor, Dorothy" and actually asks , "It's from the Wizard of Oz", right? "... No, talent, it's" Citizen Bought "!). On face-to-face content Keaton wanted to do this material, and he tried to convert this obviously unlucky woman into the shadow of his own personality (the kaki stuff), but the audience did not sit well with him, because Ketan has always been warmly flexible and flexible. A crazy Harry, who does not learn much about his journey of self-discovery (Cinematography It quickly forgets about a dead woman and becomes a mother of nervous relics, who seems to be a very Hippie, who has not lost any of her). Such film actors talk about this cavity in talk shows, "It's a lot of sad Help mothers " I can not imagine that it is helping someone because it is inherently a low, muddy and annoying. It is deranged.
