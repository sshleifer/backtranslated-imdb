They ruined this story! Finally all the heroes of the nail and the team took out to save all their asses from the Hill House and save a bunch of nonsense! They cut heads, add wired wire to man's head, and turning the roof into a giant hand! What that hell ??? I love the original movie owner and, I read books and I love it! The real movie and book is so big because it scares you so much without showing it. There is no excuse. There is no roof in hand. It is only a ghost who knows how ghost can actually kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not walk around our house or blow a knife in our head. No They could only drive us crazy Security took away all our senses. The nail was a selfish woman. He only wanted good things for himself. Yes, he cared little for others, but not too much. David Cell and John de Bont took a shit on this great story! I hate this rape hate!
