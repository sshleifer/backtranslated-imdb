This story is about romantic triangle in an nth. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stefani) and a Russian waiter who does not speak any French and never shaves <br /> <br /> As a movie it shoots on neutral, indifferent and depressed, fog, winter days or badly decorated interior, where everyone is wasted in the strange blue luminance. And yes, I know, because it was out of white balance. Everyone looks pale and inferior and haggard, shabby and dirty. Organizations shot sisters and this kind of close-up that they look pretty ugly and obsolete. Moles, smooth hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people are often naked or sexually explicit. <br /> <br /> More stories? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. Three characters return to the village of Stephanie's house, where we see Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre, through a bunch of flashbacks to the rural and eastern dingy internal evictions. Mother died. Well ... and that's really, about it. The story has been named as the lowest, as is the denial of the story. <br /> <br /> I think the storyline is not linear (it will explain a growing number of numbers) but in reality, after paying my seven euros, I do not think myself like filming: it takes money for the director. Joining the storytelling process and getting my hands dirty, hopefully many more ways are seeking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ie Stritace Shock). I can see how it is a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it was found anywhere.
