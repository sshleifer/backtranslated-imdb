Put aside the Dr. House that I missed, and a disgusting housewife (new) to see it. I do not know exactly what this movie has done to the disaster. I never thought I would say it, but I want my 15-minute fame. <br /> <br /> Scripts, instructions, I can not say. I recognized the actor (normal suspect) stable, but thought that Herbert Marshall was sitting down for a class addition and a good Chess Flick. Boy, I was wrong. Dulceville <br /> <br /> My favorite part: Where "Officer Girl" creates a 029 keypunch and puts the card on 087 sorter. LOL @ "computer" I want someone to detect the next device - a 477? Even before the dinosaur time <br /> <br /> And we do not have much time to destroy the dinosaurs.
