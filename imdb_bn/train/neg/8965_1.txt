It is mostly made for low budget, TV, the movie's original purpose is to stop the capital of success. I am a fan of B-movies, and it was probably good that they did not associate the name "cube", because the director and plot were really good and the film was destroyed by me. Taste for the whole series. Characters are annoying and clich√©d, there are problems with continuity, and different manufacturers screw up production. The story gets an opportunity to develop due to exaggerated dialogue and is suffering from it. They used the same horrific disguise over the whole movie, and at least the first one was so good, it just became frustrating. <br /> <br /> If this is an exclusive B-movie, I probably want to give about four. This is a statement about the "1" rating that I gave to the effectiveness of the first and how to get it completely.
