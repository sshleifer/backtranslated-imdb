If you are a person who can come out of a very bad movie, I highly recommend it. If not, stay away. This is a surprisingly cheap-looking movie and sometimes you can think of yourself if you do not have a joke that you are hurting yourself. I can make the most positive comments about it that the responsible people realized that it is very low budget, so at least there is a sense of fun here. <br /> <br /> As an amateur gets it. Their ideas of giant killer mushrooms are covered with tangled color sheets, which can see the trash on their heads. It is certainly not meant to be seriously (at least say), but with that demand even you can push your head to amazing fascination. Or I laugh loudly aloud
