I am working in the hotel industry and have recently come to our cinema library to enjoy this movie free of charge. Nothing against low budget movie, but this movie has awesome acting and direction. This can be a never made of how a movie. The director should be listed black, and all the poor actors, it is not a jumping board sure in a career. Please make sure that you do not see this movie, long acting, camera and terrible directions. There are only a few films called "Low 10". Another example would be "Ductula 3000". It should be donated by people who make money through this movie, so at least it works for a good reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case I will look at 10 (or at least once more).
