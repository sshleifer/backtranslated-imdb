How the audience reacted to this new "adaptation" of Charlie Jackson's book, based on the original 1963 film (true truth) not being rebuilt, I would suspect the following: The big fan book or the original movie is like this. Many people are not going to think ... and those who have never been exposed and who are present in Hollywood for "special effects" Rabanatara big fans, they are the first and last word "good" picture, it's going to love. <br /> <br /> I do not like about this adaption: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not the true adaption of the book. From the articles I read, the film was meant to cover other aspects of the book, which the first one almost never got. And, that seems logical, a film can not cover a word for words until it's length length! (And even though not yet), however, there was something in the film which was never mentioned or even indicated in the film. In Shining's original movie version, they reminded me of the decision to kill black people. I do not like that, The film's press release will say ... "We got fundamental, fundamental, idea from the book of Charlie Jackson, we agreed to write our own stories of the same name and leading character names (though not all) of the house, and what the hack, We saw the first change and horn and ghost, and decided to throw some of them in. <br /> 2. They are completely called "bad birth" It seems that in order to investigate in a house, they completely lose a paraphrasexist theme by inviting them to take care of the guests who have removed the brush with their abnormality. No, instead, this "doctor" brought them to the house under false accusation to study "insomnia" (He actually invited them to fear in their deaths And then how did they react to their fears ... such as lab mice, they said that they never said they were part of a test ... excellent people.) This doctor, whose name was not the same name, Dedicated professionals were different. <br /> <br /> 3 Contrary to the statement used to promote both films, "some houses have just borne bad", this house became worse due to bad rather than bad ... and, this time around, the mystery (change shadow) Go). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was so uncertain that I was certain that it was a mystery to most visitors ... However, in the first place (not in the book) there was no mystery because the house was bad with BEGIN. This is not the first "victim" to have eyes before. <br /> <br /> 4. Luke's character was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a Debanena player who was one day inheriting the house (and it was a real suspect in "history") ... and this is the only one who was drunk-drunk, submerged silent who could not sleep (remember insomnia) and a compulsory liar Was there. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also disturbed by the way I thought to go into the main scenes of the film (the word with the family of Nell's sister and Mrs. Doodle's small opening statement ...) to the often visible gates. These other movies are more harmful than the other. It wanted to do it that it does not want her mind. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed the story of Nell through the whole movie. The original was like the Gothic novel that the story was told by the eyes of the first person, and we were always secret for her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They tried to make Nel more heroes. The original nail was not a bad person, but he was a bitter person (a selfish elderly woman and an intelligent sister after dedicating her 11 years of her life, what else could she be?) And she liked to moan, and she lost her mood . .. this one was almost too good to be true. It was no longer clear compared to the last episode of the movie, where the author has probably seen Gahst many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house and it is too much occupier. There was AbbyLa rain (Huiyu's daughter whose story was large in the original version), there was no "companion" and there was no nursery there. There, "Grace" (wife of the real doctor) and Hugh Karen's wife also died in various ways. This change, the story too changes WAY. I do not know whether the producers of this movie should be happy whether Shirley Jackson does not bend the world or if she should ... ... be sorry (if I get my drift !!! !!! !!! !!!) <br / Finally, I will leave you with some words from the original Luke (the appropriate word for the word "movie"!): "Burn this movie" to the ground Should be, and the hole with soil salt! "My favorite movie is always there. No contest from this one.
