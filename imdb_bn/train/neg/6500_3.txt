Look, if half the world commits it to me, I'm sorry, but life is quite confusing. I do not see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time I even saw the fracture, and I knew that Quinton would have a steamy wave. But these things are not good shots, and it is not brave - even if it is artsy. The well-produced films have reasons to cut and quick edits, not this "Oh, but it's a realistic explanation" excuse. These things will hit your head. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you somewhere. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if it does not have time to look at the bad ideas of the screen, leave it.
