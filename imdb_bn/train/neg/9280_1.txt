Honestly, I do not know what fun, this awesome remake, or comment on this board. Masterpiece review sheds me tears, it's great fun. However, this movie is the worst movie ever, and certainly at the bottom of barrels for sequels. The name "Oman" has stopped me from this title, and this morning it is seen in HBO, but it is the other three, especially the face of the face. There are many classic bad moments, but my favorite guy is burning fire from the emotional girl !! Good time! This film is in the whole genre of "The Awesome Movie" with the Omen series. Avoid until you are looking for a good smile.
