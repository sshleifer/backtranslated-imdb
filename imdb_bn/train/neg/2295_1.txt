Varnished annoying film with the charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. On Thursday, one minute was released in a local movie and except for the whole population of Sydney, a producer, apart from me and four other, was produced to show a fee by a producer. Local actors like John Pollson and Terry Serieo (well, Polson Swimfan and Hayd and Sikk have been the director of hair thrillers) and Terry Serieo think there would be no teacher other than Thug's role. But Paul Marcureau should have been Australia's greatest exporter on screen. This is a big rage in the role of this and the movie like this is only a waste of talent and time.
