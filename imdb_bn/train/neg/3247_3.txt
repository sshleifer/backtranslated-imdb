I was looking forward to seeing this picture because it was truly committed to the upcoming attractions: Jim Keri was a concept with the power of God that worked for me in most cases. As a huge fan, I was sure that he would be the greatest with such a committed evidence in his material and what could be wrong? Yesterday, my bubble was big, boys and girls burst, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it is established that he hates his life, is a disgruntled employee and a largely unhappy camper with a room to swallow against God), the second task (where he called by Is the power and power of God through the telephone) Great - Carry gets fun with her new 'toy' and it's a fun to see, really fun But the third thing suffers beyond belief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot device; Even his NAME repeats even the unexpectedness) - He thinks he will pop the 'question' but instead, he will tell him (finally knees) that he has finally received his anchor news, and is not that so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. See, he wants to marry her, so she leaves her, see, though she still loves him a lot, see, and the rest of the film is deadly on our heart, after the transfer of spiritual-voiced cliche, finally I was very praying. . Be it over I did not think of the lack of lack of work in the first two works (for example - in the 2nd law, after getting his power, Bruce was singing the song in love "What if God is one, our slogan like one of us" , Allah, Allah), and I was also willing to ignore the wonderful wondrous things that exploded on us (for the open, Morgan Freeman - a / k / God - He can tell Bruce that he does not violate the free will, but he does it, many). Those choices were forgiving - it's a Jim Carrey Comedy, it's directed by Tom Shadyak - The Remains of the Day. <br /> <br /> Or was it able to become a comedy? When the script writer tries to lose his track (terrible law 3) and try to make the proceedings a gag message, then we get hell in place instead. Bruce could understand the mistake of his selfish way, he realized that Grace would save - it would be - grace, and priorities of life were seriously misconceived. Although all this, although much less heavy handover has been made, though. The film does not have to go to the dump to make this point. Unfortunately, the author and the Shadik did not have any idea to solve the story on a shiny, light handover, so we hope we do not expect that they have become frustrated. They even take some amazing weird endings, further hoping that it will reduce bad taste. It does not work for me.
