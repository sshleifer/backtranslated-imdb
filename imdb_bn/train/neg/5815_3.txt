I was really looking forward to the movie based on the preview and pressed it, but after watching it I was very disappointed. Slam is a completely strange film that mixes the annoying family reality of Todd Solland with the humorous brand of San Todd. The story drags along and is worse than the end of each scene. Maybe I missed the point, but if this picture is an example of the growing experience of every girl, I am glad to be a man.
