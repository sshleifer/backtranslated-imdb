I think these terrible productions and movies are managed. Bensio del Toro can not work on the production of the film, his acting should be pronounced and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed the full idea about the concept of revolution, his ideology, and Che Guevara's most important about life and other issues. The camera is terrible, shooting with someone with 2-day work experience, music is ... I do not know ... there are some music in the movie ???? I would recommend this piece to this piece .. no one. It's about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever ... I do not understand how I can rate this movie more than 3 stars. Disaster .... disaster .... disaster .... please do not see the disaster. Protect yourself from this sorrow of "movies"
