All right, I must say before the 'demon' release. He was a boring screech that's just a weird thing, saying he really did not belong in that category! And personally I think a granny might be far from that thing, but anyway. I'm actually going to this movie, though the main character is drunk and a heroine addict has not come as an appeal. But when he escapes from the train, such scenes are seen, and you can see that the picture of the door was frustrating, where the guards died and kept his hands on the 'demon' screen. <br /> <br /> But then when the demon appears when the demon appears, then it becomes your average horror with limited thrills or fear. Gradually I became more bored, and wanted to close things off. I say to most people that the person, especially the man who made it for homeless people, gave me some cheaper laughs here. I think this movie may be something really special, instead it's what other Horns are today! Not just boring and worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a timeless Gore Festival (which is limited, at least none) to provide it in all ways, but for everyone you look serious somewhere other than watching, there are many Good films
