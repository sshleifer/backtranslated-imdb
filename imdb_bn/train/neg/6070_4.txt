Tony Scott manages a thriller sports flick, which can attract even non-sports fans. And some say the baseball is a dead game ... boring ... very slowly. Well superb! Outwardly, he is a helpless salesman (Robert De Niro) who thinks he is inside San Francisco Giant's fan. As well as a new slugger from doldrums (Wesley snipes) and nominated savior comes. Our salesman maintains a fierce emotion when all the hard hit strokes fall in the worst of his career and Giants is afraid to be growing with him. De Niro terrorists personality Snipes are very popular as a ball player. One of the most notable things in Caste is: Alen Barkin, John LeGuZamo, Bensio del Toro and Patty d'Arbunville still interesting. You're a free agent ... so enjoy it. Violence and very strong language will be expected and you get the value of your moneys.
