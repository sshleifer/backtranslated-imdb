Mel Brooks's suspicious comedy vein, "Absolutely Moses!" Moses tried to take the Bible story and makes it fun, which sometimes portrays the unexpected Bible's wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot here, it's an excuse to find great comedy talent in underrated roles. Doodle Moore and Larryne Newman are touring a holy cave bus, when they stumble across an ancient cave in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Gerrelard, who also starred Moore and Newman. Herschel's life parallel to Moses. He was sent to the river found by Pharaoh's family at the same time as Moses was. Hershe's father, late James Koko was a slave to Herschel, Harseel was rescued by the makers and worked as a sculptor. Finally Herschel comes to work for Faroure as an astronomer, deportation, and ending up keeping Moses's pastor of the sheep. Herschel and Moses's married brothers, marry a sister, and Herschel thinks that God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course, Moses got the Divine Word, but Herschelle was mistaken. I'll break here for frustration here ... break ... However, a series of poorly-written scenes that the rest of the film Murray and actors create "special appearances" These scenes do not take the plot forward, they bring a little story to a frustrated friend. <br /> <br /> Jack Gilford played a door. Dom Delois may have three lines while meeting with Harasel in the desert. John Hussmann is a major peninsula, he reads the same line in "The Paper Chase". David L. Lander Horsel's "fake" is a fake blind person. Andrey Martin is one of Geraldard's sisters. I was not sure what Madeleine said to Kahn, she traveled to Herchelle and got about one and a half screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pierre has a scene like Farhou, but apparently Murray was shot at different times than the scene because the two screens did not come together! In the end, Geralda looked at the destruction of New Sodom and turned into a pillar of salt, haha. Harlem wrote ten commandments and gives them Moses, who is basking in all the greatness. In the final scene, the screenwriter decided to try and rescue this shallow movie by scandalizing HerShel in a debate over God. God came as an all-powerful bandit who often led Herschelle for his own mind, telling him to give ten orders. We also have Zerdla Quip "God works in a mysterious way," thus forgiving the Christian behavior of everyone during the movie. <br /> <br /> This picture is not funny. Nary has a smile to be found somewhere. At the same time Monty Python had made fun of the religious mainstream founded in "Brian Life" as well as taking their suspicions about Jesus' life, but here in hilarious puuki juke and letters jumped over their heads. This makes the look like Brooks Merchant / Ivory in Melbourne. Churchgoers will be shocked by the movie's attitude towards religion, but the film will be displayed by the film's fascination, which is influenced by their own frustration (I do not know, not a word) about a subject, they certainly do not know anything about it. "Whole Moses!" Completely bad, and all involved are an embarrassing. I recommend you instead read the book. <br /> <br /> This is some physical violence, prejudice, sexual references, and rates for adult situations (PGI).
