If you read the review of CFI's "DinoSearch", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget scalp which can provide this television movie. They stupid ... they are stupid ... but they're still quite fun in the kind of "very bad, it's good". So, because I'm still found guilty of absenteeism (and recommended) absence to be chosen (and recommended) absence, I'm sitting on the "Hammerhead: Shark Frangiei", watching a cinematic film, half-man, half-hammerhead monsters are terrorists on an island. How can it be mistaken for a surefire-fire recipe of the CFI channel and a cast with William ForSmith and Hunter Tilo to create the properties of B-movie animals? Well, for my surprise, it does not really miss the mark ... not much, but it is not enough to recommend it to me. Why? Well, first of all, its title giant, horrible hammer-human hybrid, is in the back of a cluster of vague-military goggles, which actually became the primary villain of the movie. Although Hammerhead racks up the body count, he (or this or what you say) comes directly before reaching someone and goes straight ahead. The rest of the film is pushing our hero against the soldiers mentioned. That is, to me, just walking on a walk is not forced to feed the man! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
