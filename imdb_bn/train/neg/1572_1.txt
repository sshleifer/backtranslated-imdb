One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Horrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (it is clear that cars are slowly running), harmful scripts, sudden disagreements and helplessness guidelines create a movie hash. We know Judge Reinhold is a great actor, but he should be ashamed of this rebellion. There is no big excitement in the car and, when the letters are postponed at expectancy, they laugh like irregular sanctions for some reason, even after reducing the bridge, even after seeing the 'Five Five Elements'! <br /> <br /> Also, know the incidents that these people will share the credibility of the same car strains. Although apparently based on facts? If that's the case, the truth is obviously unfamiliar with imagination! Then unfortunately, it was portrayed in an irrational way.
