You have seen a movie by Brian Avant-Bradley and compared it to the feedback you received from IMDB, you know that most comments and votes have been faked. TRUST ME: You will bored! People of production groups write their own responses (sometimes they even accept it). But this is not enough: they constantly click on "no" when negative comments are made in the film. Because of this, negative critics always kept behind the spread. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad light, bad script, bad end Trust me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avente-Bradley could be a good businessman. Otherwise it can not be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (All right, they are cheap, but still.) But as a creative person, he is a complete failure.
