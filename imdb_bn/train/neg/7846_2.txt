You know, I want to see "The eyes of the mountain are 2" want to like it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remix was fairly entertaining. Apparently they had more meaning throwing around than Wes Craven had had special effects almost the second time. Although I still like the original movie, the remake was done very well and it was guilty of me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any awesome fan. <br /> <br /> which brings us "the eyes of the hills". Man, where do I start? Plot, or lack of one, paper thin. We do not break the new ground here. The military decided to monitor the area, and these people are absent. So what do we do now? Send National Guard to investigate. In real Hollywood fashion we have to show them the least, and the worst soldiers. Gee, I have not seen that premises before. To make a long story short, you have to kill one murder of Moron soldiers at a time in the mutant graphic fashion. Nicotir√≠'s special effects are great, but how graphic is becoming annoying and predictable. It really takes me to realize that this glow is just a quick piece of possession. It was bloody, and graphic, but I found it hypothetical, annoying, and all scary. If it had a basic idea for me, it would have been good. Waven Crayven and his son shared the responsibility of writing, and he was involved in my favorite horror films, but sadly it was not one of them.
