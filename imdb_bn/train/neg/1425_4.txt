I'm not sure that H. Who What other critics of the film are watching, but entering the eagles is not near the top of the hip's hierarchy of action. Michael "Fitz" Wang will be happy that he can get acting in HK, because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is an extraordinary fighter (better than the leg wager than his father), but his acting skills are also sub-par. Actually, all English conversations (90% of the film - more than Zen-Cop) - is so bad that I've just switched to Mandarin audio, just delivering poor conversations and English shortcomings Subs. Of course, there are some decent gunfights (but we have not already seen before that) and have good cinematography, but Chess visual effects really ruin the work. <br /> <br /> This entry is worth the price Shannon and Beni "Jet" Urquidez go see it. <br /> <br /> Finally, you can see some scenes that you think are "known", especially a shootout (think matrix) and fight diving in the outdoor market. Outside a helicopter wearing black fattyuegues (think MI: 2). Someone thought it was worth ripping at least a few things to think about.
