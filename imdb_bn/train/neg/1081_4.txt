This entire movie does not have single sympathetic character. Do you think we will take the advice that Kenneth Brangha congratulated? Well, let's see - we learn that he is a sleazebag defense attorney who gets off on criminals on technical. He deals with his colleagues like cow, is involved in their own personal crisis (in this process, killing one of them), risking his children's safety, threatening his ex-wife's new boyfriend, strengthens the police and the school administrator - And what's all this for? Because he was thinking with his little head! I really put the father and his gang to jump from the lawyer and drowned him in the swimming ... it made for a more satisfying outcome.
