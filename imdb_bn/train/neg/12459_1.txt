Considering how much money has been budgeted for this movie, you fully expect more from the story. This could probably be the most worthless movie I've ever seen. There was no real progress. Character development, short. Plot progress, maybe Enjoy, no one I'm sure it was even trying to make what points. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are good friends, the American CIA bombardes everything that does not agree with our opinion, all the capitalists are corrupt, and you're going to see something like storyboard progression with death. Those of us who understand that it does not kill a good person to make a point, we'll be in other movies. In short, it was a secret in the '11th ocean' genre-that-plot-person-thinking-film, because you do not know what's going on, there is no one who creates the film. Home Alone 3 was a good movie piece.
