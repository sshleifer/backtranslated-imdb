Haha people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really bad. On the contrary, think of "really love." Nothing just fits, nothing is coherent, and of course nothing makes you smile. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> it's total flop. However, as indicated, there are three release points about this melt feasibility of a movie. <br /> <br /> With Jennifer Love Hewitt's star billing, there are many people who will respond very well to see that Petite Hewitt is just a touch of form fitting clothes. To say to you now .... There are some promising scenes ... but it's really a poor eye candy. Here "possibilities" are watered down. Anyway, I saw the whole thing tempted by your next scene ..... what is the tilting! <br /> <br /> B) Last romantic and positive. It is reversed and relevant to "top" ... still there was still a positive point for me. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly friendly guy ......... Refresh! Thanks! <br/> <br /> 2/5, you are not eligible for $ 10 or more dollars. By <br /> 2/3, I was sure Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next software legend. Although I'll go back for it ... It's fierce in his next film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister are stupid in the street. Her husband is astray ... and what the hack, she is stupid <br /> <br /> next time. Indeed with JLH can not wait for the next love!
