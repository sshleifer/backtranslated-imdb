I once saw this movie, and I thought it was right. Then my friends said, "See it again, it's good". so I. And my surprise, it was the second time WORSE! There's a word limit, so I'm going to get the ball rolling here. <br /> <br /> - The bomb explosion scene was all stupid. Why would anyone want to trigger the explosion on earth ??? Here one of the characters is loved even remotely. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> - Oh, and last time I checked, a car did not explode from a gun shot, and no fire could burn in the fire. Tiny fire extinguisher ... above 3/10 visitors actually see the movie ??? - The camera is so embarrassing, I can just say what I'm going to say. The open scene with the robot was close to my stomach, the rest of the movie was no better. <br /> <br /> - Sniper view. The MacManus Brothers (from "The Bundak Santas") will turn their eyes, so stupid. First off, why was the man making guns in which a man shot? Yet, why would he spend so much time in giving bullets, reloading, goals and shots, when there was so much chaos around him? Rather than SAS Raining and returning to war? Hah ????? The soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean homophobic word, but to be honest, the scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Good for yourself, but it is too small for a lot of reduced product. Bigelow thinks that the more action, the better. Looks like he's wrong - there is plenty of action scenes filled up to mislead the film from the lack of central plot. I know that Watchmen was more than 163 minutes, but at least not able to pull that movie. On the other hand, this movie, and for this, feels more time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfied. But do yourself a favor, just skip this, and do not give up in the mockery.
