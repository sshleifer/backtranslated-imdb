Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically what has happened in the show! Well if that idea does not plot you, do not do it, stay away from the ringmaster. I was unhappy with this at the theater and was actually able to sit in a movie world. I think Jerry Sparker does not show his show because it shows from the cheap promos for his show (yes it looks cheaper than the real Jerry Sparta show) and he is only known as Jerry in the film. Plot (if you can call it) will be with a girl and her mother will decide to sleep with the boyfriend's mom. So the mother's brilliant idea is to show Jerry Sparta and to do it with her daughter's boyfriend. (This is no incident of the resident of a tragedy park). Somewhere somewhere in America, a woman finds her Cheatin 'man with her friend in bed together. So course America's therapist calls for spring! I talk about the rest of the picture, but my head hurts even thinking about the film. Jamie Pretty acting in the movie looks completely overwhelming at the movies. And does Michael Dudicoff remember the ass asserate master from the American Nina series? Well now see him once as a white trash drunk. The fact is that he is very awesome and shaped that it "communicates with his church". But the funny idea is that if Jerry Springer chooses to sing a country by hooking up with his own show or transvestite ... well ... just watch the show! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay in this flick.
