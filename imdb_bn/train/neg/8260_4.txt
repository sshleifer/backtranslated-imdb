First of all, I want to indicate that when I'm not an expert, the way to manage the trial will insult your intelligence. Firstly, the prosecution never proved that 'learning benefits' actually work. Both prosecution (because they could get an appeal) and responsible for the defense not to play on it. Another commentator said, educated education was proved untrue. Second, they used to use Terry as a translator, who has a personal interest and even testifies that it is simply stupid in trial. If the court permits him to give a witness like this, they could not bring a neutral person, otherwise they would only ask for an appeal. Thirdly, this child was not asked specific questions about the prosecution (birthdays, event details, etc), and even when the defensive specific questions started, he could not answer even though asked. If this is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know how a suitable lawyer could achieve an isolation. <br /> <br /> The following line starts well with the pressure of being the child's child. Autism, but the trial makes this movie completely incredible.
