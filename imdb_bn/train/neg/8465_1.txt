I can not believe how terrible this movie is. I feel liberal to mention it as even "movie". The acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot was missing many major questions. A small group of aliens in the United States is living and gradually trying to get down on humanity, if its foundation was right. But it can be quickly cast from it. How can they accept foreigners as a "man" as his wife, so that they can create their foreign-human hybrids? They display a Larval alien but do not show it. They may produce the perfect looking skin on an industrial scale which includes a plastic surgeon. They throw in the mandatory huge alien monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to see. I think that I am disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner will do something with this. He can say a huge alien monster with teeth, "A B * tch son with a straight face to get away from you?" It's a long fall from his 5 days in Babylon. Avoid this at all costs.
