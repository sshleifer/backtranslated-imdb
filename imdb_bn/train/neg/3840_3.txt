I heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and he recently got the DVD. We both heard that it was a horror film, really scary and there were so many tensions and excitement. How disappointed I was? Too !!!! Apart from a scene (which we all know) nothing happened !!! I wanted to see the black girl a few times and she had to show a few blurry scenes, such as appearing in a window or walking or walking around something. <br /> <br /> All the reviews here say what's a scary, gripping, atmospheric movie. I just did not see it. I'm scared. Is there any difference between the fearful people in the United States of Britain here? <br /> <br /> After all the hipod reviews have grown too much :(
