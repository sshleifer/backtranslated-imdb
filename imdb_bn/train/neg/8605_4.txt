It's a gently entertaining 80's Gore Fest featuring some nasty slugs with a tiny fascinating interesting human blood taste. If you can find the laugh of the whole thing, you can actually get a little more enjoyment in it. Actor is terrible and the plot is meant to hold the film together only poor slug invasions, but the film is not a complete waste of time. Special effects are actually quite good, and Gore is doing well. It reminds me of Blob's remix, probably due to its softness. After all, you could have made one and a half hours of your time bad, but if you have not got a strong stomach and are in this type of thing then I do not suggest watching this movie.
