This picture is sticky, inconvenient and surprising. It was a very medium cheerful illustration of women. I was hired as it was listed as a comedy (that is a stretch), and Covering because Andy McDowell had a storm work on it. He was not. I'm a girl, I saw this movie with these two people, and I insisted on how bad we were after an hour. <br /> <br /> Alert: Plot underneath the bottom! Rampant Speakers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They want him to marry an annoying man of his age who loves him. But he's so happy with his oversexed puppy that you're rooting out rooting it for them, and sure, he decided to marry the guy. But his laughing girlfriend, who was driven by will, established a plot to cheat our heroine, who was cheating him. It works. He has a fight with him, he goes out of the house and crashed through a truck (remembering the title of the movie?) So now he is dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And even though our heroine is a school headmaster, who spends her time on girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and pregnant. <br /> <br /> She stopped her relationship with her friends, because they were so helpless. Alone and kind, he decided to marry a boring guy. Do I love a boring man that loves him as a minister? He told her to marry him to the young girl (beautiful, huh?), But now she has told him that she will marry him, and apparently there is no objection to being disturbed in such a situation. But his girlfriend took him to the altar and took him to his house, where he did not recognize that he was mostly responsible for the love of his life. Has her baby In the final scene, they went into a room inside the house while smoking and dirt while going out on the water. I do not kid you, it's bad. I dropped out of cancer red herring and Harry's ridiculous lesbian moment.
