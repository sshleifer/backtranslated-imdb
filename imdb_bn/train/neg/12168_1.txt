This movie was bad since the beginning. The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get high body count. Acting was terrible. The killings are played very badly. When Eli stuffed the toilet, I guess it was in the abandoned cabin. But when the movie ends and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, then you see Ally so Angela can get her. The black girl and Angela came in the cabin and the Angela guitar shined her with the string, she actually got me. One terrible acting and two why do not you just walk and throw anxiety?!?!? Then when Molly is behind Angela, if you have a neighbor, why not just turn around ... Very stupid This movie sucked ...
