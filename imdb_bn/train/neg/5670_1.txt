The only reason is "The Norris Tapees" is a star that has the presence of Angel Dickinson in his room. There is nothing other than seeing Angie Baby to see the former "Police Women" performance here. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is tapped to write a book of the occult. One day he disappeared mysteriously by phone his publisher and said that he has been involved in something that has put him in grave danger. This serious pilot was written, the whole series wanted to be a series of flashbacks through "Norris Tapes" - a set of recorded audio tapes during the investigation of miracles. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a rich sculptor died - but before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local orthodoxy, he assured him that after death he would be given immortality. We soon discovered the ring does not give immortality. Instead, it only rebuilds the corpse of the sculpture so that she can escape from her hypocrisy so that she throws out all the beautiful girls of her blood. <br /> <br /> You have not heard of blue face, yellow eyes and aggressive lake "Skoo Doo" cartoons, sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) on a dark night. She escaped and, through mutual contact, Narolis helped solve the mystery of the mystery of the unreliable restoration of her dead husband on her property. <br /> <br /> Is this guy a vampire? No There is no vampire in this story despite what you've read or heard. The sculpture does not drink the blood of its victims - they collect. How? I do not know that we only attack him and do not collect. Why? The second part of his bid for immortality is full. It will be rebuilt sculpture only to survive forever if he will build a monumental statue called the Sargoth of the soil and human blood mixture. Once finished, Saratha plans to live in the statue, using it as the gateway of our world. <br /> <br /> The last analysis: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a series of a very good reason ... it was garbage. You can see from my synopsis, the story is a runaway, corrupt mess. No good offer for acting and dialogue. This is a "so bad it's good" is not a competitor for the award. Sometimes bad is bad. <br /> <br /> "Norliss Tapes" great talent to an underground rumalinyera few years later, I was very excited 10/15/03 bringing in the Fox Movie Channel. I hope not prepare myself for fall. <br /> <br /> দুই দিন আগে প্রথমবারের মত এই গ্লেনারটি দেখিয়ে আমি অন্য IMDB সমালোচকদের কাছ থেকে শুনেছ এমন যেকোন উপায়েই কেবল অনুমান করতে পারি যারা স্মৃতি স্মৃতি এবং যুবকের নস্টালজিয়ার উপর ভিত্তি করে শো পর্যালোচনা করছে তাদের কাছ থেকে আসছে। Or perhaps they are fans of Dan Curtis. No way, they give you "The naralisa tepasa" proposed reviews of the error. <br /> <br /> Paoli Orchid - October 17, 2003
