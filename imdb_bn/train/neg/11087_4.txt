Guy-Madison, the second-leading American star, played a role, whose reputation was earlier in Spaghetti Western ?? Which very modest certificates are essentially appearing as routines (although with a nice enough score). The plot gives some light interest: the title, incidentally, a machegrower refers to a wounded man involved in a deadly attack? Their family property, the cavity agent Madison. Modern siblings are determined that the injured party now performs the responsibility of gang-bosses in their charge. Finally, what is the identity of the mysteries of the mysteries? And both, maliciously, become involved in one of Madison's sisters (another raid is raped during). The Euro-style starlet Rosalba Neri is unknowingly seen as a salon hostess and former flame of Madison.
