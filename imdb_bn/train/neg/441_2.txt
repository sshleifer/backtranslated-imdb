We did not have it on television in England but I went to the internet on YouTube. It's stupid, stupid and annoying! It comes from the "EarthWorld Jim" Douglas Tennapel's creator, I've ever entered that cartoon but I have to admit it better. Cartoonist has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a return travesty and all the time! The story is about three cats who have a home heir and a lot of money off their dead old lady master. They are rational and disagree with what they want to spend their money. "Annoying"! Animation Awesome The main character is meant to be a cat, right? But they do not look like cats! Only strange creatures with big faces, sharp teeth and bully eyes are demon-looking animals! People and other animal characters are also drawn to ugly real! The theme song is terrible and annoying! The story is also lame and is probably copied from old shows. It was a surprise to see this event getting 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDB viewers. Television is not really used! But now most of them are fools, cheaply made and annoying. Some of your website may not agree with me. I'm sorry but the complete waste of money and the complete and complete wastage of your time and Brazil is not that much to tolerate this frog (Oh yes, if you have a digital) I'm not, so my problem Is not! Unhappy! 2/10 (And it's so lucky because I've done the worst of other shows!).
