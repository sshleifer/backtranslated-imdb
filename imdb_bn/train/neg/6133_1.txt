Like the Jonathan Cabot, Kurt Thomas's star is a bit gymnast, who trains a special game, which is involved in hunting by a group of Nijonas, but those who do not get the chance, especially Cabot as a gymnast! Take Helveta as a full-length taker to adapt bad movies, violent performances, God-awful scripts and genuine disabled instructions to human standards, although this movie is so horrific that it really makes fun. I like the dialog "I know I'll sleep them!" Or "yes, through you!" Just add the sum that the player will get more. In addition to this (intelligent) only hero hero is a gymnast who finds things to swing at the moment.
