Yes, scream, scream, scream, debate, celebrate, boxing, high fiving and fighting. Why you have a general idea, but 100% can not be specific. A navy ship will be an advantage for fine points, but then you will probably find many errors. A terrible movie and Hackman and Washington are not their usual bright, but the plot was that you can start very soon. I'm still looking forward to seeing the submarine film where people take each other away and do not dispute, but then you probably will not get a movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
