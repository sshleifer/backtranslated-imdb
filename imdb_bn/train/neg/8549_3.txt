Well, what kind of trash is I now seeing? At the same time, it is curiously mandatory, "The Withs Mountain" has sometimes been one of the most consistent and insanely Spanish absorption flicks. There is nothing here that makes sense here and I even suspect there was a script to work there, but the way I could not stop it. Starting directly with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat, scratching your head with confusion. So you think this image is rolling over the children possessed by the evil forces? Hack, because after this role, the girl and her wickedness are simply not mentioned anymore. Then cut a man, which you will see with the most impressive pruning mosaic, who rather breaks his girlfriend rather uncertainly. When he asks her to spend her vacation, she asks her employer for any appointment! Great move The film is finally started, as she travels to an isolated mountain area for some peak photo. Although she did not raise a new girl (Patty Shepard) and took her helpless photo! Will all the strange happenings occur throughout their journey ?? Do you realize it Is not explained. The girl woke up in the middle of the jungle, loudly loudly loudly loudly stole! Really, jack jacking witches? Apparently silent magicians own a quantum mountain and they practice voodoo on criminals. As far as I am close to describing the plot, but there is a good opportunity that I am going to stop? Here is the more important atmosphere! "The Witch's Mountain" is sometimes very awesome, its amazing music and interesting cinematography. Helpful characters play all the weird looks and scary Patty Shepherd plays a good heroine. It's like a European horror film, which can be a story, if someone just stops writing a structured screenplay.
