I bought a bluetooth on eBay a few days ago. I viewed the part and reviewed it again to be very fooled at it. In the beginning, excessive amount of water 'blood' is simply obsolete - do not mention air mass "around the whip". My friends and I have made a very low budget movie, and the effects are still beyond this shit festival. <br /> <br /> There are many ways to calculate this movie as the amount of errors. I knew one of the actors - I do not believe, he was my theater teacher. Haha <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not get bored with this "horror" flickr. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of possible 73)
