I am surprised about "real" about how many comments this show is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because Veronica is at the top of it in a great way. <br /> <br /> The scenery is chewed with enthusiasm and plots have holes that you can drive through a truck. That's not really what I say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a snooze-festive And found the best of the worst than a less annoying. Christian Bale thinks he might be a good actress, but it's hard to talk to the top styles of the whole show.
