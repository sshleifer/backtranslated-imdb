Flashbaby is said to be the last few weeks of a dead unconscious woman's life. Like weird, the film wanders nonsensically and rather stupid. The character of Mona, Lazy, Sullen and Drug-addictive are not liked and Bona√±ar does little to do something interesting for her. Although Mona has some incentive dialogue trying to explain why this sad lifestyle has been chosen, her motivation is never clear. The episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, tends to be tired after a while, it feels much more than its running time. It is hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman will not get more attention from men.
