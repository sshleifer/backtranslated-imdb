The "secretary" is a sugar-coated, clipped, "thriller" one, which arrived after being watched on Sunday afternoon, where there is no other. Although the plot (jealous for a demand woman who succeeds in her office and can be done to stop them) may be of one type, I recognize countless plot twists, probably taken from other TV movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mel Harris is one of the actresses who has created a " Mother "or" hunting "of criminal sports or abuse, have come into the picture of someone who lives in the way of his life. This one, he is delighted to play a mother and is a victim of the emotional secretary Sheila Kelly, who is not very well liked as the villain. Although Sheila Kelly has created some good carrier patches (single, breaking in, and I guess, laws and commands), she is also wandering through a string of tough TV movie roles and it only adds it. For others, I do not have any clear memories, so I have to say something. <br /> <br /> This lifetime game will play on the network (I think where I saw it), but Dawn is not bothered to see it until you get annoyed to see it. It does not have to make you even more exciting ...
