Very disappointment has ended in a season ... <br /> <br /> Journey Part 2 and other notable episodes were in the best scenes on a series TV, where it was bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that it was an episode of frustration, but with the late Chess guitar, the music was ridiculous and there was more to the original series house. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate execs did not want to basically end the note and it wanted jazz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
