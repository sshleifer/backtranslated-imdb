There is a lot with Helen and there is no good of it. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds played in Leopold and Loeweb, a couple of mothers who played from the Midwest to Hollywood and fled from their past as murderers. Reynolds, a star performer opens a dance studio for children, and winners of his piano player. Soon the winters (Helen) started cracking up. It's going very slow and although there are real tragedy moments (Nasty phone calls, a visit by Win Timothy Kerry), the film is a real threat. Yet, it is still appropriate entertainment. Acting Divas fined and production quality is terrific. David Raskin's musical score, Lucien Ballard and Oscar nominated clothing artists contributed intensely. With this, Sun and Lolita have a place in their credits, someone works as crazy and winter? Directed by Curtis Harrington, this type of master is not the exploitation of most movies. Alongside Kerry, Dennis Weaver, Agnes Murhede (Yemen Sample McPherson as an evangelist), Yevette Vikers and Michael Allen Walesi (Irish Ocean Wells) have included the nickname as Hamilton Star in the weird supporting cast.
