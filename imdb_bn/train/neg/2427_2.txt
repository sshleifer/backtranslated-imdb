Do not make me wrong, I like the action and revenge flickr, I've seen many people from the last "mechanic" of Dolph Lundgren, which was quite good. And Tony Scott must know how to use the camera and even a talented shooting and film editing. <br /> <br /> Instead of using "man on fire" (even more "domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his "talented" skills to produce film, he does not offer his material and compensates for the loss of substance Use it indiscriminately for giving. "Man of Fire" was about 2 hours and almost half of it should have been at least one hour less. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It wants to stop it after 5 minutes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Put a bomb and beat a man with a shotgun, all this is a small girl to take revenge for the death! Then why would the studio pass a good script because of the image or the violence ... take it ...
