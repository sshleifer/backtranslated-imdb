"Living Dead of Night" can be found in this short fool Elite Millennium Edition DVD. As a good thing I did not even go to a tad from my way to visit it. Replacing zombies with bread sound just like silly harmless fun on paper. To execute execution, it is a different matter. This short is not even a sneak from me. I never thought that I would say it, but "the day of the invitation of the son of revenge for revenge vengeance night, rebellious, curse, alien, meat eat, hell, living dead zombie 2: Shocking 2-D" was a very good parody and almost as hair Or annoying. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
