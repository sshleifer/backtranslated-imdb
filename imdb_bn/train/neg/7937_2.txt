After 30 seconds, you already know that there is no actual budget for this cheap knockout. The story is taken from great movies like "Texas Chess Genocide" and "Eyes Are The Hills". I like the type of movie, even if they are duplicate (wrong whirls, timber fruits, turns) and duplicate. <br /> <br /> "Side Shows" are difficult to see: Actors are really bad, Conversation Chess and Music are fools and totally wrong. You do not care what all the characters do happen. The so-called bad guys are all rather interesting and interesting. So how about blood and cow? Well there are some, though it is rather cheaper and the action is executed very badly. 2 points, only for the beef and blood, but realize that it is rarely a look, even for the hole.
