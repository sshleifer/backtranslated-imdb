Since the cinema-loving universe is George A. When introduced to people known as Romero, the word "zombie" automatically gets associated with blood-terrible horror images and non-stop acting sequences. It's safe to know that his "Living Dead of Night" has created a zombie movie that we now know. Nevertheless, in the early years of the films, the foundation of rebuilt corpses is gradually used, almost the work-less psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneur's "Idea Wide and Jabboo" is a perfect example and so is the "White Zombie", played by Lloyd Luis. This may be another example of "rebellion of zombies" but unfortunately it's a failure on the whole line and one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! This image lasted only 65 minutes and yet the first half-hour of the stupid love-story plot and illogical psychological issues are completely destroyed. The legendary Cambodian Anchor can be a more engaging story in the city, but what we see is the interior shots. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, curly hair and textbook blonde with ugly nose) made me very excited and I was hopeful that she would not be able to sink somewhere to get upset. Again lucky ?? If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 unique minutes, then you will be rewarded with a perfectly finals. However, this movie is rarely only a suggestion for giving a positive rating. Avoid! If you already see everything else you will only see this movie.
