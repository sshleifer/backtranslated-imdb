Basically it's an overlong, unfunny, action / comedy. First of all I want to say that I enjoyed the movie of the Waiwan Brother (1) and the moment of Sigelal. Unfortunately the white girl does not even give half of the laughs. <br /> <br /> Humor is absolutely weird. If you want burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. It is stupid when it is not crude. The first 10 minutes of the movie went to me, completely unreasonable, easily stupid. <br /> <br /> Even though I was a friend, I saw the whole thing (otherwise I would not be bothered). The story was definitely thin, it was also in scary movies, but at least the smiles were fast and constant. I think this is probably one of the major problems with the film, smile does not come fast enough. Some jokees are more hateful than the fun at first place when they drag too long. If you like your comedy with some brain cells then avoid it. If you want a stupid comedy with more smiles, see scary movies, airplanes, hotships, 1 + 2 <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely unclear, slim story, an idea that seems based on an idea (that is, if we are dressed as a white girl for any film?) but not just enough material.
