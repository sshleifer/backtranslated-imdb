All you have to do is note the emerging movie authors: Study this film. If your conversation is reading dialogue in this movie, please cut your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I did not have high expectations, but the Christmas mystery was enamored by the description. Factory. The mystery is resolved very quickly and the film becomes a straight romance. I saw it in about 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and the first break. My spouse, Hallmark and Lifetime Fan, give up the first break. <br /> <br /> The Forest River is a company city - the main business Aikens ornament, which creates all kinds of holiday decorations. The company's parents have recently died, so companies may have questions in the future. We'll meet with Nell soon, who will meet Wall Street and mysterious Justin more than Main Street, who received a date with the newborn after the big snowfall in the Halloween car. Once we meet with Alison Iyenson, we have proper persistence for the board, our story is setup. <br /> <br /> If you can not dance to all the stories through the first commercial break, you have not seen enough such a holiday movie. Maybe that's a good thing.
