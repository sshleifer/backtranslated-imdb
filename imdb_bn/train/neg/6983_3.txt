Revolution is a terrible movie, but if you do not care for a history teacher, news writer, Al Pacino fan, this movie probably will not be able to earn a valid '10'. <br /> <br /> Notice what the plot is trying to collect money from a note that Tom Dobb (al) got down on his boat. Everything that is rolling around the notes. Tom's son joined the army for notes, Tom joined the army, he went on a boldness to leave the army, after a few years the war ended and they could eventually turn the note for their boat. The end <br /> <br /> had some battle scenes, and they were pretty good. Transitions and magical characters in the scenes used "after five months" contain letters in some of the famous historical battles. The story of love is a joke, and it is very hard to follow the film completely. So save your "note" and instead of patriot clock.
