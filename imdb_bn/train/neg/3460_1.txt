Oh man, this movie never bites! You never feel threatened by Slashar's genre rehearsed, as cheap as possible and at the same time carefully (PC-friendly, meaning no nudity, classic element of slash films) is cut. Each cliche is retread without self-awareness and an indication of acting. Oh, the acting word defines horror. I should be well-acquainted as the title directly to the title will translate me to Dutch.
