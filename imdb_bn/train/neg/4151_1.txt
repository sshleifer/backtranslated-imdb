Perhaps after the death of Ed Wood, it is probably the worst horror movie. <br /> <br /> I can not waste the end, because I have no idea what happened. I'll try my best though. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping organizations, so a character may be a character that you think might be or it could be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> The confusing word? You might think it is not confusing, because no letter starts to make any startup. There is no plot, no character development, and random people show, some lines speak, and then disappear, and never heard from. There are also jambi, who are probably an enemy of animal enemies, but there is a dream-dream dream sequence in a psychiatric hospital, so it probably did not happen and it's all the main character confusion. <br /> <br /> The lead girls both take short their shirts. Special effects are simply mind-boggling (I especially like the incredibly slow, weird fight sequence). Everyone is really a stupendous Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of Hillary. <br /> <br /> Price of the rental price. If we could not cry, we laugh.
