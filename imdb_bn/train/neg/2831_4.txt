I've recently seen my wife and discovered that it is better than Keane's faith, even though it is not too much police. The greatest screen actor in Britain is not very interested in this role, which can be raised with more determination as to his sadness. Rex Harrison feels even less annoying, perhaps vaguely, his character is written very badly. William Holden is good, but his screen is fastest and again, his character is not good script. <br /> <br />, the film has gained a big deal by focusing more on its stories. Ustinov stole the show, but basically playing with a critical tone of the film, by playing a comic character. The song is poor and Omar Sharif makes many of his uninterrupted kaymoos (his career has been made based on this for decades). <br /> <br /> <br /> is an incredibly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weak movies.
