The championship game was just a few days away, but New Orleans should not be like them. With the issue of marital problems, the risk of a drug from the risk of drugs from players, life should be a memorable, surprising time. Can things be returned in sequence and a killer can be closed before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> This is not a football movie, despite what you might think of when you first read about Superdom. Actually football is nothing more than a plot device and thinking. Instead, 70 people made for population films with SuperDom Hollywood are one of the operators of the Opera and those who will never be. The cast is sleeping on its way through the item and nobody really looks good. The best (or worst) example is seeing Van Johnson a very small role, which is why he usually lost it there. The plot is dust, weird, and incredible. Donna Mills as Hit "Man"? Yes right It's as trustworthy as its affair with David Jansen soaked alcohol. No lack of motion in the movie. Whatever the suproodome is trying to get all the four or five story lines around the flow film around the film. With no drama or mystery in philosophy, SuperDome ended 70's TV movie. The only highlight for me was the voice-work from late Charlie Jones - I'm missing an athlete. The intelligent pronouncement of intelligent practices and extremism in the atmosphere of New Orleans is pure cheese among its superiority. <br /> <br /> Like most of those who saw the super-com, I also worked on the mystery Science Theater 3000. This can be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it is one of the best early startup examples. Although I only gave a rating of 2/10 to the superdome, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
