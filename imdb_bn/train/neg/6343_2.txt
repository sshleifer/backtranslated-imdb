Maybe I'm not a sophisticated. This and the closest I've seen recently are two of the more supposedly cerebral films, and both suffer from annoying amounts of the same problem. Dialogue is a false lie Remembers believable to anyone comes out of the mouth's face. Perhaps this film can be felt as it is set up, but it was unwanted. And annoying. I went out after 20 minutes of tadium. <br /> <br /> I'll be making slippers and bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I ever come across these teevee, I'll try and try to find an episode instead of Quincy.
