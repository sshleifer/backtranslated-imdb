If you like "Pump Fiction" and you like the camera by hand, you will love this movie. I liked quirky stories (although I think that "Pope Fiction" was "the highest rating movie from the English patient") and the characters were found to be unreasonable but interesting. This is understood as "waterfront" or "citizen purchase" and is considered by European instincts. But the worst part is the hand-held camera. I feel very scary and annoying to finish the film. I do not know why new directors think this filming method is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, hands-held cameras will vomit you in about 10 minutes.
