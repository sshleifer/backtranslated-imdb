Now, I hired this movie because Brad Dariff was in it. He is an extraordinary actor, creator in everything ... without this film. And I think that only because of this, he realized how stupid the film was and was not disturbed by good performances. This is a weird comedy movie. Some of the lines just crack me. And they have some lines that do not give any idea, and it seems that Tabu Hooper just throws the line without worrying about the plot. Oh! BTW Plot Bid! But this is a movie that Tath BAD is actually visible to see. I only recommend this for fans of Big Bourd Dourif, or other actors, because the plot is suppressed.
