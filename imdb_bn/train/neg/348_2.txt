This movie is a crappy and forgotten Shawn Connery vehicle. Performance is typically crappy by Capo, Fishburne, and Typically Hard Ed Harris. Connery thinks miscast as a Harvard academic. The movie gets absolutely bad as it goes along with it. This is a third-rate mystery which is very evident when it is revealed. The movie squanders throwing a wonderful supporter. George Plimpton also played a minor role in adding some of the key to the debate over the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere is the third degree mystery / thriller of pepper which is the manipulation of the highest degree. The scripting and direction is extremely poor. Kanani's charisma and screen presence are the only attributes of the movie. Manipulute, violent, and discreet. 2/10 Avoid it
