When I saw it at the age of 6 or 7, I really despised this movie because I was a great fan of Robin Williams and he could not do anything bad. Till this This complete trash destroyed Robin for me for a long time. I recently retrieved Father's Day with his funny but serious part but then he went to make another mistake, Bicentine Man I think it was called, but the point is. Robin is still getting a lot of jobs and now he has come to perform the order that is derived from this 'classic'.
