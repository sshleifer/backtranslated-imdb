Vincent Minili movie is usually worth your time; Meet me on St. Louis, The Bed and the Softy. I have watched this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment <br /> <br /> Visible scene after a short while roaming scene. Sinatra is a tragedy, to come back from the war, to find frustrating family relations, the gloom of despair, the gloom of despair, a girl persuade her to end her hopeless writing project. The film has a major dramatic finish which leads to frustrating villains Sinatra and McClane and some frustrating reasons. Order tension is filled but Menele is not a hit; She is so confused by the beautiful colors, she noticed that the scene does not clich√© a horse and the characters are so thin painted and badly developed we do not particularly care they get the shot. (Especially in McClane), but it is the only real painting of the project. Alternatively we look at wrist-like characters standing around bars and cells, getting nervous for each other for two hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this picture. After WW2, the two soldiers who came back after the transition and indecision were more shiny in 'The Best Years of the Lives'. And among the two engine products, 'Splendor in the Horse' and 'Picnic' with many deaths, across the frustration of being stuck in a dead-end city.
