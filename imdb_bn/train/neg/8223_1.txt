Of course, the worst movie I ever saw, no questions asked! Opponents of this opinion may argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, because it is an independent, low budget movie, but already? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please agree with everything that has been said about this image, for example, if it is bad, you go to another in the shooting scene, this is), I The most annoying thing was that there was a total lack of general knowledge in scripts, a thing that existed at the time of production. There was a clear absence of a dialogue with respect to the audience, the girls changed personality several times and they could not sing any rationality or even a brain-brain - five relatively less competent women against a little psychopath ?? Gang up on her, why do not you? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered a bit victory for this title, the camera does not leave the van at any time, so that the viewer sees everything from everything - which is like the rest of the film, a good idea is rapidly executing horrific execution. Effective. <br /> <br />? Oh and anyway, this movie is not Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other way. The title is pictured with a hand held camera ?? This is an effect and not a feature! Cleverly used it can be exciting, but in this case it is an excuse for insufficient cinematography.
