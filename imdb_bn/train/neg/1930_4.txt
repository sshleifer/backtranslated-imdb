Many have praised Alantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think - at least for adults to think about <br /> <br /> <br /> This script refers to a beginning like a live-action film, which strikes someone, which you can no longer sell to adults. Many old adventure films have worked well before the "crack stuff" (think, _DartyDozen_) but _Atlantis_ represents one of the worst movies of that motif. Characters weak Even every member trots out that seems like background stock and painful. An MD / Medicine Man, a tent mechanic whose father always wanted boys, if we have not seen at least these before, we have seen mix-and-match quicks before. The story about how a companion played by Dan Newello (Father Guido Saradukee) tells about how the story goes from flower shops to arbitrary debris. <br /> <br /> The only original character is Milo Thatch, voice by a young Atlantis-uneducated academy Michael J. Fox, which has no depth. Millo's search for Atlantis is being run by his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a lot of chills, such as his grandfather put a pith helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And when the characters were the thinnest, the best part of the ultrantis was the voice genius. Perhaps Milo's depth is no darker than Fox's charm. James Garner's voice did not lose the Commonwealth Rur! Although Rourke is a fantastic military type of stock, Garner simply shows his ability to breathe life into characters by his delivery. Garner's high vocabulary performance. I am sorry to say that the king of Leonard Nimay's death is not obligatory. In addition, the debris expert Don Nobel, Winny Santorini, was one or two good works, also interesting for funny lines - but I always liked Father Guido Saraduki. <br /> <br /> There was a good computer animation. Background animation, that The animation of the character from the little character that Don Bluth was able to get out of the door was not bad for Disney. Character Animation Nothing does not already appear even in chocolate even in flat characters already. As well as landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is nothing to print. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Say something hackneyd or trite. I am not so sure about that. Any new service can be made with the right treatment. Shakespeare was often famous for introducing a familiar story and plot and just putting a new coat of paint. So the treatment thing. And _alantis_ obviously lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can not start all the logical trap without any rebel division. The plot was bad. Plot bridges are handsome and do not snap to the end. To add that, the script and animation are peppered with boring sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that the punistic or Celtic signs have been transliterated incorrectly and "Ireland's coast" is to be read "on the coast of Iceland", then we may have trouble. Script writers must accept the British as "Erland" of Erre or Irian, and ignore the old, Latin word Hibberia. But more than that, they need to know the Viking conspiracy that is called the deer Island Iceland and Isika Island Greenland. <br /> <br /> It creates a mistranscribed "letter" issue, the authors themselves have destroyed themselves for a silver version of English and the Roman script for the script. This long after Atlantis was supposed to shrink into its undersea cave. Without Milos and without visible sources and fewer texts, the inscription made much less credible. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard's journal could not be written before Atlantis sank, or it did not know anything about "the king's eyes" or the crystal. It was written after the drowning, but in addition to the Millionaire campaign technology, how anyone hacked Leviathan. Then what can you learn more about something? And why would it be written in Atlantian? <br /> <br /> Autoconfiction and clarity can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel Shepherd Atlantian is not required to write. So it should be some sort of automatic text. Since the rest of Atlantis can not read, it may be the spirits of the crystal booming messages on the surface. This will create more knowledge. But the film can also be interpreted: Millo could discover that this power tells him his whole life - appear in dreams, etc. Need to search this photo. <br /> <br /> 3 Atlantians will not be able to easily understand modern languages Nobody expects the original Indo-Europeans to speak in Europe, and the Romans will realize that "C" or their day has become French, "f", (like words, not low!) <br /> <br /> 4. The present Atlantians were alive before the disaster - apparently they could read *, but now they are unable to read what they use, or manage similar equipment. <br /> <br /> 5. Public illiteracy refers to an important error in the film. Nothing seems to have happened in this culture. Millo seems to be suspended in the air until it can recover it. Although it seems that life is not a continuous struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or write a novel, and perhaps it is at the end of the combination of Atlantian school systems and lack of good fiction that illiterates in Atlantis. <br /> <br /> 5. Setting up of styadity costalism allows the kid to be forgiven if he can not read or manage the device at such a young age - but ** ** strictly qualifies for his father's eligibility !! Kashim's foolishness almost wipes his people from being alone. A bunch of blasts killed, suspended progression (many do not die here, but a large scale slide can be seen in culture and progress) until someone can kill the crystal unless they are looted in the lava, then the first monster robot did not have to protect them. <br /> <br /> A blue lightning bolt cut off the image of Kashikim, when Kinda tried to join the circle of the great kingdom of Atlantis in his father's picture! <br /> <br /> 6. Milo could read only Atlantian, Roura and others knew enough to see a book of screaming and find a page of crystals - which he knew to be a crystal and some stylized astrology or "alternately" sun "images. <br /> <br /> Explaining how Milo's grandfather told Rour to tell him about how to read Rolo as Milo, as part of the book. It does not - that leaves the page - which was looking at the dog in the hands of Roura, though Milo did not find any sign of a slate in the book - there was only "there was nothing wrong" to the audience's tips. "Crystal" If someone does not try to steal it, Milo will not be suspected, it is just a thick-headed precursor. <br /> <br /> 8. The crew's "double cross" a character change We learned that Vinnie, Sweets, Audrey, and Cookie were taking Roor from the beginning, however, "the change of heart" fell flat. This was a change, and it needs to be well transmitted. It is difficult to deal with those characters that are not allowed to start with . <br /> <br /> 9 The litter flows slightly over the dome, instead of filling the rest, we see the order. It is fluid; It will not flow on the protective dome until it is filled in all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. Last stints! - and do not give any other ideas except to fade away political purity. With the restoration of its power source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, coding is needed. The giant robot guardians and sky chakras offer blue-fighting shooting that is less afraid of them than them. Technology is superior to us, and certainly in the early 20th century. Ultimately, the Atlantians will have to read Milo, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little calm, disciplined culture alone, not sent to the hyperdev. <br /> <br /> ** Last Spirir ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the setting of the Lost World Plots and the centuries of evolution will give me an indication that it is a tribute pulps. Failures with the film agree with this idea. But I am in a loss, why should I see thin letters and tear off the droplets because there were also many dime novels alongside them. And the decoration story "part of the shit they can no longer sell adulthood", however. We are a little more sophisticated and our decorations will grow as well. The LostAir's expatriates do not feel any feeling and can not avoid such a lot. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - The movie is enjoyable but I think about the plot, it's always less.
