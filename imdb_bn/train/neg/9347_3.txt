This image is longer than the autonomous moment from the spontaneous moment, for which promise to develop into hanging pricing But it's not. It's flat, self-conscious, unfamiliar and tiring. <br /> <br /> A set of set pictures and backdrops does not make a movie, they create a calendar. Such a cruel socialist pseudo-dramatic documentary ("It really happened") simply fails to entertain, it becomes convincing, so it does not even work as a social history. Clich√©s co-mingled with bad acting This is very hard to finish a film, the pleasure factor is pretty fast wearing off. Character is one dimensional, developing the amount that never feels for them. Director's ego is the biggest character in this photo.
