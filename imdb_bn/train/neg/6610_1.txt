This movie should not be seen as it is meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Varma first wanted to make a rebuild of this classic Bollywood film "Sholay", but after having problems with the original makers, decided to go ahead with the project ... and I think all the good parts of the film (acting, script, music, music) , Comedy, action, etc.) and shoot out the movie because she will already hire the crew. Waste money, time wastage. After making movies like Rangeela, the truth, and company, he pulled Coppola (Godfather) over us; Are you thinking of RGB? However, the story is difficult to follow though, almost like the old silk. Ajay is playing Devgan Hero (Biru, Sholai) and Ajay, playing the new baby Ajay (Joy, Shola) on the blog. Both "bad yet funny" friends helped a police capture a bad guy first. Later, retired police in film protected them from Bubban as a personal security and wanted a much wanted Amitabh Bachchan. If you do not watch a Bollywood movie, then the good people finally win. There are only 3 valuable hours of your life!
