I hired this movie yesterday and little loura ingalls may express my frustration to be involved in something very rarely produced. I'm not sure whether there was terrible writing or bad instruction, or both, but it was a disappointment to a viewer by wasting time to watch this show. It consists of a weak homemade story line, very poor line, and is absolutely dependent on beautiful scenery, and beautiful people sell it. Unfortunately this was not enough. You will be good to rent a tape full of static than waste your time on this shit. Lindsay Wagner has done a wonderful job as a farm owner who does not work very hard, whoever went to a farm, knows that it was probably written by a young man in Los Angeles and there was no one with much knowledge of the world. .
