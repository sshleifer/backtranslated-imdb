I'm not sure what Diane Silver is thinking about creating this movie, but it does not have any relation with Richard Wright's novel. Based on this film, this film is produced. <br /> <br /> We read this past novel in the summer of AP English 12, and only saw the movie. While checking the timing notes and checking the clock, I think the possibility of being hit by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5th paragraph over it. <br /> <br /> Wright discusses the very real theme of the novel, a murderer's mind and behind it psychology. Silver's film transforms a murderer, which Wright did not want (see: "How big was born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make this small and sweet: If you want to leave your consciousness in Rafael Lambert's words, ignore, skip the movie and read the book. The adaptation of 1986 is not a thought-provoking element. <br /> <br /> :: sigh :: Now I have to write.
