Evil is dead? Unfortunately M & M (thankfully for us) followed it and did not develop a religion and resulted in a trilogy. This film attempted to address most of the problems of the main character Robi (directed by Hong Kong), which was confronted by the film. It has become a horrific video that has been created by stereootype which has helped D & D strengthen the Diabolical movement in the 80's. <br /> <br /> Please clean this junk if you do not want to waste your time and money. PS - Although the cover looks very interesting, I think my brother bought it, it does not have any fantasy area, unless you think it's a place like New England or New York City.
