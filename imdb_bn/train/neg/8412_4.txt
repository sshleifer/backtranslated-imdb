I just saw yesterday's DreamGirls, and I was really underimpressed. Despite all the Oscars buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this film is not bothered to see any real movie musical classic. Apart from the excellent musical and dramatic performances of Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirl's only a glorious TV movie with a style or flyer. <br /> <br /> Now the first half hour was good, but I was annoyed with how Eddie Morphy's terrible rackup performance was scattered and Montage was disturbed. Those who easily had the best songs and the best performance of the film. And the "top of the film" section was the only part of the film that had a consistent perspective or motion. The remaining hours and 45 minutes was a neutral, rainbow mess that was not realistic, interesting enough to be interesting. It was apparently neutral and included too many sound-oriented tunes. <br /> <br /> The condom did not try to slice the pieces into pieces, as I expected. Each number of the other half was just a closeup after "singing" to each other. And Hudson's big "love me" number was criminal! His stopping shot just around the stage of the canon - no drama at all! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'll Teffell You Some Efff-ieeee!" The shit editor was supposed to be left on the floor of the room. Those "songs." <br /> <br /> <br /> Again, without the exception of the film - Eddie Murphy's extraordinary performance - there was nothing but a glorious TV movie. PR has got megabucks behind the job for this photo! I am surprised that how much money was paid for the "Awesome Buzz" Oscar for the Liberation War? This image was completely, without Eddie, Nowhere around an Oscar Caliber movie! (Without Eddie) I rank it right there with Greece 2. Big disappointment, especially all hype (I've expen $ too much)!
