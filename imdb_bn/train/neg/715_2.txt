It sounded like a really interesting movie from Blogger. Nazi, secret, government plot I hope the Davenci code or the Nazi version of a low budget of boys in Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something more than anything else, more emotional, David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is called, it is just awful. <br /> <br /> Part of the trouble is the casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts somewhat horrific and scared moving closer. She did not even at that age, though she tried it. Actor acted as actor, this scene is a comedy. Most other actors also believed that it was a camping film, or at least played it like at least, rather than being a joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> It starts off very slowly. So slowly you may be tempted to stop it. But when you get the girl's suicide and subsequently drink it, it is a bit compulsive. But soon after, it all became a jumbled mess. Some of these objectives were, but most of it was confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is not just a pleasant movie to watch. It is slow, dust, no likable in the characters. Imagery and set overuse In some movies you get to torture characters. This is it, that is the audience. It's a few amazing moments, especially murky images and credits, but the rest of the film is mostly just tedious.
