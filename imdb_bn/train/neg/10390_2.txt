I just hired this movie and saw what it's all about. So here's what my response is. It is easily seen that it is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main plot of this film is about a woman taking revenge on her rapists. The idea that this properly done can really be a provocative movie. However, the film does not disappoint me or disturb me. It just bothered me. This movie can be easily minimized under 45 minutes. All of the scenes are mainly filled with time, such as visible scenery and some of the scenes below. ******************************************************************************************************************* Actually, I do not know if I saw the cut or uncut version. I already found many plot holes in the very badly written plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This would probably be more frustrating and annoying. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapist left him in the jungle and returned to his house. These rapists could at least know that if you want to do any dirty work properly, they should not send any cowards to get them to work. /> <br /> Why did Jennifer call the police when the rapist finally left? Which is the first thing that should pop up in the mind of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> While these fishermen were alive, the rapists did not scare away miles away? <br /> <br /> I think it's really amazing that a simple lady like Kemil can drag a man. Trees and leaked him. ************************************************************************************** This film is not without its capabilities, Camille Katon is fantastic and when I was returning home to Monty and killed Jennifer, I heard that one can hear the funny line, why? Why me, I even ^ m !!!
