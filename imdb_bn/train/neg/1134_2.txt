Like Dan, I'm proud of the good Danish movies made in recent years. This is a terrible shame, however, this increase in quality has led to the loss of the majority of critics of the Danish film critics. Actually, it has become so bad that I do not believe in any reviews of the Danish film, and as a result, I stopped watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know that this is a movie of this unfortunate development, so press me that "Villa Paranoia" will be a terrible film in any situation. It was hip by the critics that in fact the confusion with the Danish film added fuel to my bonfire. In addition, there was little help waiting for the DVD to come out of time and there was little help against the impossible feeling of money being wasted. <br /> <br /> Eric Clausen is a successful director with a design for social reality in Copenhagen's settings. I particularly enjoyed "de Fraggeste" (1993). He is usually funny as an actor, although he usually plays the same role in all of his films, namely, his fate-class slab which descends from his fate, partly because he is a slogan but mostly due to society, and who himself rebuilds his community For something good. <br /> <br /> This problem is the number of "Villa Parnoyia"; Clozen himself carries a chicken peasant, which is a break from the ideals that he did not succeed to be credible. <br /> <br /> It is worse, but to understand how the film is going, the rules for the audience can be broken by breaking and breaking the rules. For example, the film is opened with a low budget effect and bad camera work, with a very tricky attempt to visualize close-death experience of the protagonist. After that, the character told his best friend that he suddenly felt the desire to throw the bridge. This whole movie is notable; There is little or no motivation for character action and the closest resorts to any interaction with any motivation: instead of displaying it is not saying. So, at one point, you have a character that he is talking to a forced catalytic person about the way he feels, because the script does not allow him to effect his feelings; And later, the voice-over is presented suddenly, mostly like the next post, which can express feelings which are unknown to the audience due to the incompatibility of the audience. Thankfully, at this moment, give an hour-long so-called so-called story about nearly one hour of character care. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I'm a 2-out -10 rating.
