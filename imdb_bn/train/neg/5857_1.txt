WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> It was among the worst events of 2001. Probably the biggest mistake was that it was not followed in most of the previous Survivor series. There was only one surviving series match. And that Survivor Series match went for 45 minutes. What's more, anyone with a brain knows that it will be introduced to The Rock vs. Austin and The Rock for his team. And do not start to preview me before the event. It was clear that no matter how many people have won it. There was no need for all that stupid hype. Whatever the story, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> and for the rest of the matches: The first match was to defend its European title against Christian Al Snow. It's a good fast pace match and it was good to see an ankle wins a match. William Rigal v. Taji was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times earlier. Edge vs. Test was good but nothing was great. The title tag of the satellite cage tag tag was the best match in the evening. The war went on for 10 minutes by the Royal and nobody really care who can win in the first place. The women's title match was not great. No, not least. The main event is the most hypocritical match in history. The Alliance is lost, but guess what, after 5 months every single alliance returned the superstar. The match itself was poor. The Rock dropped three of them and Jericho eliminated 2 people. Rock was caught up with his performance when the attack started. Jericho endangered the whole match. If I want to exit before the first one, it will be. Everyone knew that Cain, B Big Show and Undertaker just fell. 7 matches are not enough for the Survivor Series. If I ever do this again as bad as a survival series this I'll do
