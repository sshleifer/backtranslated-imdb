This movie is just awesome. It's annoying, it's low quality, the actors I've ever seen the worst actor and the scene is so bad that it's sunny. <br /> <br /> "The main" actor seems to be a hot guy, but all the girls, but he looks ugly, overweight and from the beginning of the 90's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Married couples have not seen even "major" people for 5 years and they were not really friends. The main person's "date" only knows him from work and at a bar he likes a girl. Now tell me that spending the weekend in your cabin is at risk of losing your job with a person who is not your real friend. Because he did that at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have made a home movie scarier than this! <br /> <br />
