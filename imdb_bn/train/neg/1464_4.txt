I hoped to find out something that I did not know about the most infamous people in modern history and could not help thinking about history recasting Hitler's history: Evil Source Hitler insulted his nephew so much that he threatened to shoot one of his fans. Hannel took a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Roham. Forgive me for asking but the authors confuse Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana from Scofes? That is bad enough but really offended me that this mini series has the entire part in the historical context. Germany lost the first world war and the German people gave so much value to co-operation. It is this economic environment that took the German people to someone to take back their pride and therefore they became Nazi. Hitler has no choice: the power of the deposed power seems completely absent due to Germany's insult of 1920; Hiller's verdict can be taken seriously as a historical document and I have not yet mentioned that in the absence of Himalayas and Goaring dangerous, <br /> <br /> Robert Carlele has a positive side and title role in the mini series. Well, some of his methods are wrong and his voice is very loud (archive recording shows that Hitler had a soft enticing voice), but Karlie, a craftsman, and he handles Hitler's own charisma on the screen. Commenting on the British press, Carlleed Adolf is more obscure than Sparks than a Hitler, and he gave Hitler a better explanation. <br /> <br /> I like the performance of Robert Carlyle but I hated all others. About this short series and why was it surprised at first place on earth. There is nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
