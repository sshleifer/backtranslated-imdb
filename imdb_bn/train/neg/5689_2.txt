In the past year, Uwe Bowe showed little progress as a film maker, "King of the Year" ("Ring of Link" clone) and proudly lazy, 9/11 ironic post "." But then "Seed" came, and it was reset to counter zero He had kept his bid for legitimacy and was more respected beyond reach. And I'm a fan of that guy? His films showcase a unique screwball aspect, and are never dust. <br /> <br /> From his frustration in the barbaric notices found in his first film, "Seed" is a very confusing effort by social commentators and a more serious scandal to create an iconic slash myth. (The ball often seems to be taking the page from Rob Jobs's successful reboot of "Halloween"). Opposition Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a silent, violent brute who killed 666 people and is sitting on death row, is waiting for the death penalty; After the failure of the beast, he has been raised from the grave who has kept him there for revenge ... and therefore starts a string of completely ineffective Mayhem. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a new millennium slash, Michael Meyers or Jason Vauresh's vein, Max Beed is very disrespectful and annoying with an impression, finally a wash-up pro, doing "The Toolbox Murders" as the heir to equally annoying victims. The wrestler is similar. In addition, the "character" of the seeds and bowls of "balls" is run against each other: the death penalty is wrong, but we really hope to be sympathetic to a suspected killer who has left hundreds of dead bodies in his wake? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Perre works as a lazy, long lost brother in James Riemer's character of "Dexter": A policeman who sits on his desk, wanders through newspaper clippings, and engages in seedlings and seed plants trapped The trapped people are seeing unpleasant stop-motion scenes. As long as he sows and sows a seed of a cardboard, the order is very tight, it becomes sick (illumination is almost non-existent), and strangers (despite the healthy dose of the cow) it almost kept me sleeping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The creation of shocking movies is not limited to that sequence: "Seed" seems to have been shot by a drunken filmmaker, camera boasts and finally weaves, a technique that is more The stomach itself is bent over the cow; Very short this takes lasting attention only the attention of the scary, almost invisible details. In 90 minutes, the film is busy enough to consider the form of tyranny, which was probably the purpose of Bowl. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I think this trick is mine.
