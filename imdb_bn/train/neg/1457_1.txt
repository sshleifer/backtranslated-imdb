I have seen this picture several times and I can say that it is a low budget junk and it does not have anything to do with the facts of a real history. Performance of the actor is very poor but it results in limited acting possibilities. Anyone who has seen this movie is now probably considered Hitler to be crazy skinny crazy who is running a gun like some Chicago Gangster. I can only say that there are many good films about Hitler and Germany in those years and the rise of the temple is relatively low. I can recommend the German film Doughfell, which you can see in the role of the superhero actor of the Swiss actor Bruno Gangs Adolf Hitler.
