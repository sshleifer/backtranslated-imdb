If you like the common themes of euphoric suspensions and Fightclubs, then remove all their style and class and combine it with lots of tempted new waves "I'm so intellectual, my film should be difficult to understand" film maker junk, in a few extra styles for good measurement The torch, the end of the end, there's your revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I did a little bit of thinking and sense sense, even though it does not stop being rubbish. <br /> <br /> money wasted Time wasted <br /> <br /> As the worst movie I've ever seen, even a bad movie novelty is worth it a little released.
