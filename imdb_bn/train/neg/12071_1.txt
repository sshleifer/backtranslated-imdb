Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw some beautiful pictures throughout the year. The term sucks the quality of the pictures, direction, acting, etc. Only good shoot (ie funny, because they are very bad) special effects. Overall, about 5 minutes sunny. The rest of the Flick gives you brain damage.
