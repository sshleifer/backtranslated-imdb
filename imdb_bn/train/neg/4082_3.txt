This movie was only painful to watch ... not in a dramatic way that made horror with emotion for good versions of dramatic situations (yes, I went mostly with the last sentence in most cases), but the absolute dull way for only two hours. Now, all of you might think that I am just an anonymous critic who is not respectful for Shakespeare or "making artistic films" ... well, you both will be wrong. I love Shakespeare's work, especially Romio and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet's tragedies, and I've seen a lot of "earthwash" films such as the ultrasonic and disciplined arrayagehead and Fellini 8 1/2. .. But this is just two hours lost translation like Shakespeare, much more nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not every shot of a movie !!! !!! Pintas and Saved were nothing for the story! !!), and basically just made too much film. My high expectation for this movie was that it was considered "very artistic" and was an adaptation to Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but it was just an extreme lockdown. Due to the presence of Sir John Gilgood's acting (which has no name in this film) and the combination of cinematography / set design, I made this movie three because it looks like a motion picture .... An illustration has been as good as ever. The real disappointment ... maybe if Jeffrey was given a chair, then it got better. But this is an audience member's opinion, others can enjoy far more than I do. It's been said, if you do not find it in any of its nearby video stores (this is not the current DVD), try not to go far away from your way to find it ... it's not really valuable.
