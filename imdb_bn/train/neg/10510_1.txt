Oh, where God starts ... Bad acting .... The characters you do not care about ... are they American or British ... They think that they are in America, because the big jungle in the Middle East somewhere ... < br> <br /> One big fault ... they are driving through this jungle all night ... until they roam around Scotland in Scotland. .. When one of the whiny knocks on the poor terrible woman .... <br /> <br /> and they do not work on mobile .. so what they do ... must be divided, it can be easily sorted. So three homes can be anywhere in the middle and two of the sellers can be behind 'care' for women ... So what do they do instead of comforting them? Put his hand on his head, cover him or even move him away on the road, when they fall into the hard road, they burn 100 yards away ... and they always have their camper van <br/> <br / > <br /> The horny angels, which were so much convincing to the people of their choice that they were brought out of heaven to live among us ... then what do they do? To build a sexual relationship with a man? Do they bite a large amount of them and tear their heads ... I think they have missed this point ... <br /> <br> These are not extraordinary sexually deprived past angels, they are canvalerealistic vampires ... and Tom Savini is saying how breathless she is ... ... she has good body but there is nothing special to open her face. The main role was far more beautiful than the so-called unsafe cyrences ... <br /> <br /> waste of Â£ 2.30 waste from my local library ...
