I can only believe that Gerson Canine certainly has two people. Who wrote the bright "A Double Life" and the funny "Bourne Kelly" and wrote with Roth Gordon, "Adams Rib" and "Pat and Mike" with extraordinary screenplaces, and then who wrote and / or "Bachelor's Mother", "A Noodle Off-the-knot ", and indicates such a tiring, tragic drill. Cast tried, but the script is so tired and clinched that it is always surprising to defeat Brenda Vaccaro's efforts. The script shrinks to its nadir in a truly objectionable continuity, in which Jansen's character examines the character of Digras to ensure that Given is not there. An ugly sequence, but sadly one which can play a film easily today. "Ethnic" trick is now fully vocabulary, but "fag" joke is still "good, clean, family fun".
