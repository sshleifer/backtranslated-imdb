Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandalfini, Christina Applegate, Kathryn and Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Messi, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kiar, D. Mike Mitchell. She decided to return home to her childhood so she did not want to be alone alone, a hotshot Yuppie Christmas dped by her girlfriend, imposing on the working family that she now lives and imposing on their unemployed family committed as their family. An abusive and one-dimensional performance by Apfelak, who mainly works with a laughing smile, stops her character as mentally unsafe crop, but Gandalffini and O Hara breathe some life in this world. Even for the distance, its fascination is long, is not visible from the scene of the scene and its sensitive messages are duplicate like the white of Auffleck. 91 minutes, rate PG-13 * Â½
