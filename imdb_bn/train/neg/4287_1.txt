I gave the timepiece the perfect 10, I gave it 1 <br /> <br /> This story is very annoying, and it does not have much to do with the original timepiece. A lot of things have been dropped from the timeps, and they keep new stupid things instead. This story is being held in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but due to some reason, timetraying is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> and action scenes are nothing to be happy about, most of them not ... just the first Great ... and these are not scenes of a step, and they are all beautiful. <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main character travels five times in a few minutes ... no wait Or not, they <br /> <br /> In short, two times ...: Do not waste time watching the film, it is not worth it
