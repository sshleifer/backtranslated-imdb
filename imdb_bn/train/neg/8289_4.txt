I'm sorry, but such a bad movie is ridiculous in it. Football Hooligans Debate in a Travel Lodge? Suits Shadow ?! Alan clearly did not understand what he was saying when he created it, as far as possible from the truth. <br /> <br /> Casting was violent ... Gary Oldman football ammunition? He does not look terrible, does not do terrible things or does not want anyone who wants football. And so for you? What a bad situation Suits, taunting with shades and taunting the kids sitting in a tragedy each other "It's almost got your nappy". <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet thirty ICC Underwear umbrella? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this photo seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. This probably is probably the most misquoted script in the crisis of eighty thousand gangsters.
