This picture reminds me of how college students used to protest Vietnam's war. For example, some children were working without cowboy cheese in cow dung colette, the President was immediately going to change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, based on the concept of a policy, the USSR and the US war, it could be the last word in the world, working. Wars outside the United States and the United States could never fight. <br /> <br /> We were the only conventional weapons, the idea of ​​another war, a "war", war in Europe and Asia was impossible. <br /> <br /> I do not think they will be released from this movie. The film should be viewed as a wonderful example of how to "not make a movie" by students. <br /> <br /> It should be 0 big or black holes ...
