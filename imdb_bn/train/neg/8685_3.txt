Frankly, I had little hope for Little Bush. I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but Rehash and Overdone) Bush Jokes. Obviously I wanted to reduce my expectations further. <br /> <br /> Writing was absolutely unfortunate. In addition to the Cheyenne-Chicken-Ating Mix, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really annoying and unclear. <br /> <br /> Animation was sophisticated as the thirteen year old flash project. It is disrespectful that they used Macromedia's products for this reason, because it is even more capable. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush too much, and I enjoy Bush-joke as the next man, but it was just a half-hour swipe with some of the President's tragic non-funny moments. Tray pieker and Matt Stone did much more with that Bush. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Thank you
