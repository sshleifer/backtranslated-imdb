I only give these three because it has filled my friends and I hope it will: Entertainment. <br /> <br /> I was not fooled enough to break this thought, it would be a zombie movie with Romero or Phulasi, but the rent I hired was a smile. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for entertainment, or a movie you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. This junior - "mystery science theater" is perfect for fans, but the only negative aspect is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
