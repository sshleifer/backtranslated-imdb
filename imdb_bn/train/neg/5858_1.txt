Fans were allocated because the "Winner Accepts All" matches have occurred between two separate "agencies" (World Wrestling Federation and "Alliance": Coordination of Former WCW and ECW Superstars). There was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were limited to trapping the opponent from every side of the ring; Each competitor came to the conclusion that there was an inter-prime requirement to surrender their opponents and make the match even more intense. Each competitor only defeats the rival. Punches, a special step, and a partner performs tags. The story was tarnished by Vince's subterfuge before that a member of Allan must be terrible and join the WWF. It was clear, with that statement, the WWF would be fairly: very innovative stories but poor execution, which is not the weaknesses of the wrestlers, because the match format tags-team. The rest of the matches are just rebellious: <br /> <br /> Edge vs. Taste: Strong "big boots" by the test, but it does not show the true genius of both stars. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was a great fun match, but because the two major companies were involved in the main event, it is only a wrestler who is characterized by "heat" which is characterized by a "heat" and possibly a WCW light-heavyweight rejection. The hurricane, which is only employed as an entertainer) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz Versus Doodleby: The best match at night: Jeff Hardy from a cage summit and "Swanton bombs" and Matt cage wiped through the wooden table, It seemed painful. <br /> <br /> Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam Hardcamp champion, and Cart "a joke" in the Angle Alliance, in addition to all the basic star booker of the main event of the "Alliance" group, after the match result granted the job , Who recently attacked a wrestler in "Roy" and must work inevitably. Shane McMahon will return to television anyway, and everyone wanted to test Stone's cold work to test the fall and death of "Alliance" from outside. The WWF did a lot better. A match that brought all the buildings to one group would have been better, and what would happen to the Casket and Iron Man matches?
