Just the bottom part is false? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other viewers commented properly, storm scenes are simply ridiculous. Already in the rain fall in the rain harvest? Now that's smart. Menace? Forecast? Sexual tension? <br /> <br /> I would like to thank God for Mia Sarah's fountain scene but in the past, I think the producer of the film, seen complete. The mess was understandable that it should do something for half the earnings. So it just became another revival. Make yourself a favor and give it a miss.
