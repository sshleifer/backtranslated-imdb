Dusty west from the director Richard Brooks, all the usual clich√©s keep intact, while the idea seems thoroughly engrossed in style. In the early 1900s, the horse's competition attracted a low-key cowboy (Gene Hackman), Jubala (James Coburn), Kaki Bachcha (John Michael Vincent) and even a girl (an amazing game Candice Bergen) in a sue. Once the premiere goes out (with the expected argument about whether a woman should take part), it has become a fairly serious entry, even though it does not break a new ground (instead of something similar to the era of Gary Cooper). There are handsome, fragmented pieces and a fine cast, but the plot's process gets rather tiring. ** **** to
