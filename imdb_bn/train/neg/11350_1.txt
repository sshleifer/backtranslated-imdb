As long as there are 3D technology, (in the 1950s I think) the animation was created for it. I especially remember Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale. At this moment I do not remember this name, but the plot was working in Donald Circus, eating elephants' peanuts and stealing chips and dell peanuts. It was probably made in 3D in the 3D watch in the 1960s. To show Robinson on the theater in the theater, you have shown this cartoon before the movie and explained its source details. Perhaps around 100 cartoons have been made, which is especially visible through 3D glasses. This claim is a bad step because it is not difficult to prove it wrong. Above that, it looks like a bad movie.
