This TV stallwart makes a sad outlook, while running on the clock in their carrier, a small harm of the ship could be more appropriate by stumbling over. The whole production feels cheap and barbarous, and it does not help by a "big name" star, which is capable of spitting several lines of trustworthy fashion. <br /> <br /> Increase the support of the welding above the material; They're clearly watching the clock here. Close the view, get paid check, go home, and try to forget all about it. <br /> <br /> This is not particularly badly scripted or illustrated; There are no real clangers, it's just fully anodne, and the set is a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast. Panning is a little malicious; A shameful romantic sub-plot begins only after the start of the main program, which it considers to be irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Scores several points for skill to score with Maiden's voice and "QB bit partner spot"; Most of Caste is in Shortland Street or JSA Graduates: Warrior Princes. The worst thing about this product is that these images probably constitute their big breaks.
