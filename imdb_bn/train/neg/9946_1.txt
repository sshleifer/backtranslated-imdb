Speakers are here <br /> <br /> <br /> They can try and inspire us for testing. But he was the guest speaker in the most memorable way to take us into the right mind, who was none other than Australian kickboxing's favorite son Stan "The Man" Longindis. The first mistake they gave this person a microphone, because he was crying halfway through us despite sitting 3 or 4 feet away from us. Now, his statement was normal, "If you fail to prepare, fail to do stuff", but there have been many incidents in which I have really worked. The man stood in front of us and told that during his lifetime, he did everything for himself and there was no one else. He was given many deals in the past to leave kick-boxing, but he never looked at him for being Australia's greatest kicks-boxer. He said that he was not out of sale, he was happy and retired, was he sometimes involved in any other work than Qibox? Then he plugged his film. Yes, you've heard right, he plugs his new film. As she talked about it, a woman got a poster and could capture the ad, and then she showed this little 4-minute clip of this annoying film "Trojan Warrior". (These are all before being defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career) (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stan Isaac, a kick-boxing performer plays a former Special Forces agent, which is suddenly deprived Is. Melbourne Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) has recently sold (well, at least Stan does not turn away from everything) to the fads, and as a result, all of the organized crime is managed from the ends. Ajax and Theo come up with all the ridiculous situations, pledging to play a bond party as a playboy in a kebab store. It's all ridiculous, but if Silverstein really wants to build a credible film here, then this person should not be handed over to the camera again. <br /> <br /> I will admit, I actually pumped to see it. I love acting movies, even if they are a bit, and especially if it is set on my backyard. But the act that was played with me was a movie about the annoying acting from the word "acting", and "please stop it for God's love!" After the words continued to do, mistresses were opened and even when it was not touched again, the letters were not cast for absolutely no reason, and the most characteristic battle scenes that did not reflect the real genius of Stan on the remote kicksboxing. Cast was included in vain camio appearances by anyone just famous (read Demot Breton, Mark "Chopper" and Greg Matthews). The whole time you are sitting there and playing a game of guesses standing in the background. Very bad movie is divided by ex-celebrities- It is widely believed in second appearances. Do you remember the plot-hole I told you? Once upon a time, Ozs is currently lock-up, wrongly accused of killing his wife. Now, we have heard that Ajax was in special forces through solo sentences in hello movies and then left it for baggage. Next, another sentence is followed, which helps Ajax to incorrectly lock the same person. Then, finish it, it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is not dead, but she has been sold for prostitution. Did we see him? No Ajax as soon as he listens to find him? No, now a wedding! <br /> <br /> Among all these annoying Pirail Cats, some websites described this picture as a cross between "Jackie Chan and Gai Ricci". Is this guy ever seen the film of Jackie Chan? Chan is taking more decimation than Stan ??, well, some! And Guy Ritchie's Crime Photo Messiah, and you're comparing him to Salic Silverstein! This image is like a mix of "Pizza" and "The Enough the Endor". <br /> <br /> Now, where do you come from the whole "Trojan Warrior" title? Today's fighting skills like many Greek fighters? No The unification of the gangsters is like finding Theo, like the Trojan empire? No, because it ?? Wait for it ?? Theo carries a condom with him. Yes, all right, because Theo Trojan brand rubber is always ready in his pocket, he is a Trojan Warrior! <br /> <br /> I was unhappy with seeing "Trojan Warrior" in DVD as well as its "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip of "Chop Chop", read a rap song from Mark "Chopper": Chopper did this for the sole purpose that anyone could rap. The funny thing was that Rapper for only 30 seconds of the chopper, and then used to throw these two Donaldastar's albums into "D" and "Dop" etc. in their Australian accents. Face the people, build rap in the state, stay there! The clip kept Exstation like the Channel 31 cameraman. <br /> <br /> Bloopers: There was no real difference between this and the actual film. <br /> <br /> Stan "The Man" Longindies Kickboxing Featuretite: It was not very bad, because it was 6 or 7 different militants from different corners. (I think Dennis Alexey also read about 15 times in that 3 minute montage). <Br> <br /> I do not want to tell this film because the country is going to hell when it's going to wolf, but ... Oh wait, I did it right. My suggestion for reading this is that you go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", tap them together and use it for paperwork, because this movie is very bad.
