Last season I was happy to announce 'My Desh Vu, My Desh V'. Scrab, I thought, clip-shows are some clever and unique about the idea. Instead of replaying the footage, they are repeating the jokes in a conscious way and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I'm really unfortunate that I was wrong. After one season, they almost all sitcoms that seem to be clamped by the child in the clip shows ... and inevitably, the work experience. Dr. The head of Cox's head shows how lazy the editors were sitting together, because it does not appear again after some 4 episodes until 'My Long Adby'. I can not imagine that once a well-built sitcom was able to maintain its consistency, a wig is very much a try. Who knows why it slipped, it just seemed lazy and from the place, reminding me of the episode (mainly) in the last year. <br /> <br /> Three-second clip jammed together with background music. DVD is an extra (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television.
