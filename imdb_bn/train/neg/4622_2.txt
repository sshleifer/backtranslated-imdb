This photo has never seen the light of the day. The release time was awful. At the time of the film's arrival, the Gong Show already "sharks jumped", so who will pay for watching some sensor clips from the show's original run? And the show clips were a tiny bit of this impressive, how tough it was to chalk Barry's 90-minute whip, host of his life program. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his immoral millionaire's life? Does he really think that we want to know about his life? (Clearly, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Does he think that the audition for him will be new for all 90 minutes? Or the network executive hates her? It worked as a 30-minute sitikam episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was again nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Jane and unknown comic (though, to make the film "spicy", only their most lazy routines were included). And as someone else mentioned, Phil Hartman's first major movie part (although it lasted just a minute). Note that his name was made on Hartman's credits, the name he was born. Although you can not miss his voice and facial expressions, he is much slim and smaller than SNL's day. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; After soap to leave the world her first one.
