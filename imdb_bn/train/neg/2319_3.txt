Foolish plot hole in the film. First of all we see his master practice Kung-Fu, and he died in the middle of his practice. It's okay with me. And then at the end of the film, we used Kung-Fu to learn that he had just learned to see his master when he was still small. Is it possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> This program is entirely for Joe's eyes, and lacks depth of film in the development of character, cinematography style and intriguing design. <br /> <br /> Anyone noticed that the captain of the basket (forgot his name) and the statue player Li Xiao think each other alike, the amount you think they are the same person and the same person? Long hair, Sunshine-boy looks, tall and strong. Both of them saw that they came out of a mass manufacturing factory that was designed to slow down the products, making teenage girls angry. These two actors have no value in contributing to the movie industry for the movie industry. <br /> <br /> Jokes were hair and not funny. <br /> <br /> Joy Chuey's returning to meet with the four Masters is helping him in the basketball court, when he is in constant conflict with his opponent Ala Royal Rumble Style. All bad, when the 4th Master won the fight, the crowd started cheering, and the match continued. Was it really a WTF? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they won the match, thanks to everyone, the excellent Kung Fu expert on Joe Chou. It was a mystery to learn how he had acquired Kung Fu skills, because this program helped him to master his master. <br /> <br /> And his long lost father came out of the woods to accept Jake. Like his long lost son, Chu began looking at the director quickly for the film's mobile phone. <br /> <br /> Short, it is JJ Chau-flick (instead of "chick flick" instead of normal) See only if Jay Chou is your fan. With the list of top 250 films in IMDB, if you are among the ones who have a taste of movies, this movie is not for you.
