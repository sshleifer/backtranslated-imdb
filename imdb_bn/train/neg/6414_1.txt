This is by the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It's just made in the sense. It was not terrible (unless you shouted out loud?) Sarah-Michelle Geller has to shut down these sh1tty horror movies. I think when everyone else in the movie agrees with me, when I "shout" when the credits are uploaded. <br /> <br /> How it will run on the list of my worst movies: <br /> <br /> 1. Returns 2. Cabin Fove 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> Because I made Silent Hill 3rd because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest were completely cr4p. The same with cabin fever, made no knowledge, but topped that list back. It's worse than Silent Hill and cabin fever
