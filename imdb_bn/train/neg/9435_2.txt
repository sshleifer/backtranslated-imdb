I never heard of the owner of my local DVD rental outlet before mentioning it; Due to the notorious difference of being banned in the United States due to the severe storm of the 1980's, I decided to test it. The film turned turned into a dull, amateur and ugly looking ride; Sound recording is so poor that the dialogue is an unknown half of the time, and the new meaning of the acting word! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soon, girls have to look for help and never hear from them. Can not go; Another, still in bed, is quickly disposed (after forgetting for most of the period). The heroine is for the maximum contact with three women of the woman: a birly-touching mother (the super-over-cocking of the coup), a harridan of her repressed (and long-tolerant) daughter, and later the strange brother who is sometimes seen as a dive scene on sleeping guests. <br /> <br /> Participated in dinner-table flirtation by the often hated mother (such as the absurd, backstory does not mean anything), and which always develops in maternal springs competitions, this film has a sharp edge to its slip - it's impressive As the end is unexpected, it does not have anything to remove the bad taste in the face of the film. It's always been intimate with its flexibility) or an inappropriate feeling to lose 80 minutes of my time ...
