There have been many so many movies based on the same theme. A beautiful wife needs a handsome boy to impress the former, then what does he have to give (guess what?) He is in love with her, before the end of happiness, everyone follows a row before moving away ... many times have been done. <br /> <br /> I knew it before I started the clock. But, despite this, I was still waiting for it. With the right hand, a good cast and a brilliant script can still be a great way to spend a few hours. <br /> <br /> This is no <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was dead <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Just remove that smug look. I had no idea that a male whore was living a life, all the wise to see the wise philosophy. <br /> <br /> A complete unreal movie filled with unrealistic characters. None of them did the job, they had more money than most of them, a wife who went with her marriage even after falling asleep with her best friend .... plus "If we were with you you never met" !!!! ! I used to go but I realized that I was wasting too much time in this draw ... I could get annoyed with introducing a character for a very cheap laugh called "Kadakinya" but it really happened in the film that only remote ridiculous things happened.
