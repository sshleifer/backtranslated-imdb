I thought I was going to watch a scary movie. And finally, the movie was sunny. The scene where people transformed into a VERBOLL I thought they were kidding. Today the computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget, an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) for a good movie with Jack Nicholson. It has good special effects (they should transform the people of Verjual). If you do not want to laugh well I will not recommend you to watch this movie. This is a joke in the movie.
