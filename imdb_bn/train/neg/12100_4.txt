Now do not get me wrong. If your insights and essence about everything that is wrong with the history of human civilization, and the need for a brilliant way of bright future for mankind, better than a comrade and pop culture practitioner? If you need a healthy dose of all the energy, then why does the religion exceed its effect, then go back to Sagan or Dawkins, for God of Bihar? That's a good point and itself. Maha simply ignores our religious past as a neurological disorder, and its entire society, industry and science adopts its fundamental basis. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he is pointing at the time when he is trying to appear extremely intelligent and exploited fools and wisers. Unfortunately, his intelligence is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Mahar laughs us but clearly does not have bright bulbs in the box. For example, he has responded to an interview (and I am clearly using this word as "Ambulance"), claiming that Jesus' existence is a historical event, "no, it is not", in which it is a boastful insult (a device used annoyingly in this film) . The problem is that the person was right and Maha wrongly claimed that he only mentions the historically-suspected Gospels. I have never read the history of Mr. Maha's contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the public will swell in this pseudo-documentary because they will do fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they are loud and guffy (they must have displayed me) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's doubly saying that the most powerful and most dated braking of the sound is about 70% of the time the film has dedicated to it. Opponent Christians were diabolical when the audience during the Token was completely muted 10% of the devoted to criticizing self-respected religions. Hmm The criticism of Islam is not limited to the hip and generous targets, or they are just scared to laugh. Saying very much, whatever ..
