This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what kind of a director his heart is about to create a big disaster. The songs have been added in any situation, the story has been expanded to meet the empty space for 3 hours, and action stunts performed by the most hateful actors seem to think that the bullets that they can run among the bullets are all fire, and nothing happens to them and one person is 100 Are fighting with Only Best Performance was Anil Kapoor. He is acting villain in the role of the best actor Hinglish's comedy ... Akki has done a good job ... but the movie just forgets.
