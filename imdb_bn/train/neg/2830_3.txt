Ashanti was making serious efforts in a movie about the organization of slavery, but the film that got started in the Third World War may have got better. Instead, it became a star-studded disaster where they came, told their lines, and lifted their pills without much convincing faith. <br /> <br /> Michael Kain and his wife Beverly Johnson worked for the United Nations. World Health Organization and East Africa are busy doing their humanitarian work. Along with this, Peter Ustinov arrives who can bring enough ham to participate as a partner of Moslem Slaves. As Johnson Black, he arrested many children as well as some adults as well as him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cain does not accept this abduction, and the rest of the film is spent. Rescue effort William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film stars Kebri Bedi are in this part of the cast and they look so incredibly indifferent with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Like some of the above mentioned genius people will just overtly indulge in food and overact on the festival. But Ashanti is not even going for it. <br /> <br /> What time of incredible waste Enter the tax aroma is permeating the air.
