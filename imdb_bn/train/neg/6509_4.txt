Great as Shan Bean, photography, location and costume. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the conclusion is flat. The plot has changed from Cornell's novel to the bottom, and not good. Unfortunately, this adventure has seen a lot better read. Sharp was very brave here, contrary to the arrogance of change in his literature, who feels more intelligent and firm in spite of his fears about his new role as a promoted an officer. I really enjoyed the short scene in which Sharp was tropped by the "real" officer and after a quick break and tearing of the hole, he was surprised by the surprise of the caller. It sets the tone for its next trial as a commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "10" of "4"
