Because some people, like me, want to know everything about the movie, but eventually they want to see it. However, here it seems to be ending, because when I saw the first and only time of the TV, I could not have been more than 8 years old. But I would say, I'm sure that little baby was scared, and I thought for it after a while, and it still stands in my mind till this day, although some details are a bit unclear. Ebay Vigoda was in this movie? I do not think I do not even remember that Ol Barnabas was in this movie and I like Dark Shadow. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Was loved by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, although it seems that he is not an old family doctor or a judge instead of a judge; see how the memory fades?) Remember it is a kind of a cave? Maybe I got that wrong; And Shelley Winters is sunny there, and the judge has a caps, and the camera looks at her in the corner, and she touches the cloak back, and has her goats legs, and she declares she is actually her father, the devil, and she hands directly to them (the devil's community) Actor, because he is in love with "mortal" people (I think Robert Foxworth) wants to marry him Satan wants to marry him too. Yellow eyes, and yes, sure, they look Robert Foxworth, and his eyes are yellow yellow. There are many close-ups in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone is smiling and enjoying, except Belinda Montgomery, which is very unhappy, and crying or screaming or something, and that's the end. Bad guys win.
