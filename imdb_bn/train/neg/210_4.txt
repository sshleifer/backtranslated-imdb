Perhaps you should not compare, but the battle of wild style and style is the original hip hop. There are many of the original hip hop artists on the Bit Street, but they obviously made it clear that it could be a big break, of course it was something and it's nice and it's nice. But if you see it as the real hip hop culture then you are wrong. It is produced too much and has a Hollywood dressing. Rather search for the first two films I mentioned. They expressed the intensity of life in the gate. Yes, this movie is low rating, but reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because stories, acting, dialogues and aspects are horrible, but music and dances are about people love it. I love the dance, but it seemed like I was very happy with the death of Electro Hip Hop (when I was a new generation of '86's now a classic hip hop artist, such as Cars One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Max, Junk Brothers, Bizmarchy number few ), And I still do not like most bits in this movie and so it does not work for me. I mean, a story of wild style is not a lot but the music is great and authentic. Of course the taste is different and that's OK. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie breaks dance and music is trash except for some and so I can not rate more than ten to four.
