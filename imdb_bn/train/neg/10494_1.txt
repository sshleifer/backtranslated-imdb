Steve Irwin's show, he is mountainous. He did not try to be funny and he was but I do not call a movie - I mean that when his car is trying to kill him, he is just saying, 'Oh, this is a nasty person! 'And looking into the camera directly. He put his face in the camera! And when the man falls in the car, will not you expect him dead? And the worst performance of the star I saw! Like a crocodile about to eat Steve when he's just called 'Steve'. He did not fear or do anything, it was not just 'Steve'. I mean I hate the sound word but that was not that valuable. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was very stupid.
