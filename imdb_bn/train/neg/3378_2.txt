During the release of this film, I saw Storious Lines 4 times, and hoped for a long annoying production of a film in the story. Within a few minutes of the box office opened on the release of the film, my wife and I were there. It was not just frustration, it was a stick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "moved out", with no scenes left in the theater. Those confined stories are a big part of the meaning and impact. <br /> <br /> second and third together (allocate your own order): One of the original songs with very dynamic dance numbers has been removed; A song that was not produced at the stage was added. What is the ball I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1, my respect for the talent and hard work of the actors. I have now seen the chorus line on stage six times, and do not feel like seeing it six times before I die. It is written beautifully, with excellent music and hearty stories. If you want to see a great "cattle call" audition included in a musical instrument, I recommend all that jazz. If you want to see the story of a chorus line then see it on the stage.
