All right - helicopter shot is fantastic, and the director has made some good use of Barcelona's top sights. Otherwise ... in the first few minutes the production price rose and the rest of the image was felt like a movie of the week. Allen Pompeo was interesting and fun to see, Abel Focus was the deepest and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He trained his martial arts in good use and be an ongoing-jumping-hearted action figure. The rest of the cast was wood, but most of the paper was there. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - this is an image of an action twist postcard and El Graco's healthy dose. If not, skip it.
