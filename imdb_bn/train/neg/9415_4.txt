Very re-editing and often misleading, when the main screen version of Man on Fire was created, at least ten years ago and the elapsed years did not make it better. This is a movie that draws attention to producers with very little money and very little experience and others can only pay to their outstanding advisor or their sales dealer, Scott Glenn's bodyguard escapes from an organism to protect his organs. Year-old charge, kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pacey, Brooke Adams, Danny Iillo, Jonathan Price - all done well, the action is lazy and vague and only a remarkable fine score of John Scott (which has become part of Die Hard's last screen) positive impressions. In one case where there is an improvement by the remix (Tony Scott, the main choice of this version's main choice).
