Robin Williams and Tony Colett could not get this rating bad ratings or bad reviews for two reasons. The film is likely to be a thriller and there are some annoying elements which leaned towards the psychologist, which could focus a bit. Robin Williams plays Gabriele Noon, during a story night, going through personal issues with the diesel: her lover goes away and Gabrielle seems to be an incident in the story block. One day he accepted and read a story written by a 14-year-old boy named PT Boland (Rory Kullkin). Pete speaks of the story of her life and abused abuses at her parents. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Dona Bolland (Tony Colette). Gabriel starts fascinating and friendship with the stomach, but when Gabriel tries to meet him, something looks weird and Pitt Boland even explains the possibility that he can not even find existence. I will not go in detail because I do not want to spoil this movie, but I will tell you this: it is quite predictable. Beautiful atmosphere for the story of Robin Williams and Tony Colette and to talk about good performance, which I think was the main character of the film. Colelet is one of the most talented and loveliest actresses without question. She hopes to see her winning an Oscar winning character and mental personality is very dishonest and I hope to see her win an Oscar (Hell, I think she could get a helpful supporting actress if she had a little bit of a script.) The film begins as a psychological thriller, but it's a prospect. If you are curious to know about the end of the movie and twists, then watch the movie otherwise I will hire another expected thriller called "Hide and Seek".
