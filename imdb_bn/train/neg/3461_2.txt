Slasher films are often seen as derivative, repetitive, and spontaneous, unreasonable. I have to be a horror movie fan, but this picture was so poor, the words failed me. The script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is surprisingly bad. Just a round stinker, that I wasted time in my life. Its first place was a entertainment of all the entertainment value of a 15th series of horror movies. <br /> <br /> Who has cut this mess? <br /> <br /> I like two things in this movie. The first killer's mask was - which was beautiful. The second was Austrian's confidence with despair. <br /> <br /> Save yourself, and avoid this terrible mess.
