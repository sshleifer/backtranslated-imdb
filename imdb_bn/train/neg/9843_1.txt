This is the only Robert De Niro movie that I really hate. It's stupid film with terrible acting (not of course not Niro). For me, Brian de Palma will always have to do with Mafia films such as Scarfus (1983) or The Autbebble (1987). I like the De Polama Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro has worked with Palma two different times, greetings and wedding party. Although I was very right at that wedding party (I do not see Greetings). <br /> <br /> The screenplay is really bad and weird. There is no scene where I can smile even for a while. The film has lost the chance of being even a fun style in a "funny child" scene, and I do not like the scene where a person's sexual orgies appeared. So, it's one of the worst movies I've seen! Just bad. I hate it
