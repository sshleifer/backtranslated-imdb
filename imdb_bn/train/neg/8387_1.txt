This theater was the worst movie I ever seen. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People are not funny on the head. People are not funny getting kick. For the third time a man kicked him in the kick, even the youngest audience of the audience could not laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He actually drew the king of the hill aloud He made fun, but this cinematic masterpiece bothered him. I'm not surprised. The story is quite hair. A Midgag thief steals a big diamond that was the hottest hijst in Hollywood's history. Then she hides with a family posed to be a baby. I know it's exciting words but that's the whole story. Tell the two lines over over 1.5 hours and you will find the pictures were predoreable trick galore. I really felt ripped off after watching this. I did not expect much and I was still disappointed. I would like to queue some junk writers and / or write their next script. If it is possible then it is worse than white chickens. I have seen plays in high school which are good, and cheap. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like submerging under my entertainment.
