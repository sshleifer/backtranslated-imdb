Oh man, it's amazing how anyone can be a science to demand global warming, I think this Eliteist nonsense is now replacing Eugenics Science! Al Gore tries to make this problem complex, even though it requires only general knowledge to look at the whole thing, making money with its own earnings, a man hacking big! <br /> <br /> How did scientists guess the historical temperature? This planet? The sun speculates the activity of the sun. Is this method correct if anyone has ever questioned? No, not even groan! So, how does the hack be accurate to predict the future temperature with sunspot activity if it is correct in the past? According to the sun-spot activity, the temperature today is what it should look like to fully line it with. How is the temperature of the entire universe increased (relatively) equal to Earth? Does our SUV increase Wednesday's temperature? <br /> <br /> Use some common sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to determine that it may be anything more than a HOAX. Do it yourself. Profit from this like Al Gore and his elitist friend Rothschild (banking family who sorted the Live Earth event)? Well, the new World Bank will be established in carbon credits, which taxes tax on everything that makes CO2 invalid and it is easy to reduce these taxes, if people think that it only means more money, central control and more power of elitist bankers to save the world. Al Gore is even a company that has sold carbon credits! Is it not eligible for voluntary carbon credits for global preservation, especially if it goes to its own organization? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe in me blindly, please do your own research and use your own knowledge and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion!
