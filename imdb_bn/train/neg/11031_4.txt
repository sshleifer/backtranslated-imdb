Interesting to see what the director tried to do with this picture. But the problem is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film and when the plot was well presented, all of the original characters were shallow and you were not bothered for any of them. <br /> <br /> The blue (and sometimes low) bad photo may be a bit preferred, but I guess you can not expect much from people who are doing less budget films for their hacks. It is unfair to compare the film and compare it with other high-budget movies. But lazy, that's what one should do. On yourself, it's not very good. And compared to the others, it's still not very good. But it is not without good points! I like the plot. It was rather nicely built and tied well together at the end. Sometimes in really dark scenes, it managed to build a wonderful feeling as well. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film failed to impress. Characters are quite non-existent and we do not care for any of them. Someone may die of them, but it is possible to quickly identify the final "survival" from the earliest.
