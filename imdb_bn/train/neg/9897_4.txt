I found this a good movie for you to pass your time, but by no chance of any historical value. Cleopatra script reminds me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She gave birth to feeding her children !!? Please, please ... a pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this one) that will not bother to go from one room to another! They tried to show him a saint for God! And they tried to prove their right to kill their own sister ... except for the narration. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of his time. His decision was something other than his feelings and morality. He did everything for just two reasons: energy and self-preservation! He was born into a family where he had to live, he did a very good job. Anyone standing in his way was killed (his brother and sister) or revolted (Sissar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was very powerful to kill and too ... to persuade homosexuals. So, she was her last ...
