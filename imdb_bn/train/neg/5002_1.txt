How did this awesome script manage to attract this slope? Strange, anticipated and completely incredible, it is well-played and handled gently, but the element is so bad that in years I have seen it as the greatest thriller of all times, Wonderfully bad, and not a fun way. Even if you have a fan in someone cast, avoid all costs.
