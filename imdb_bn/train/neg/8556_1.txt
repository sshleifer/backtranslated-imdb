OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the age of population, and I marked with some of the stories. Even sometimes strong and meaningless conversations seem semi-realistic, and could be forgiving in a different movie. <br /> <br /> I try to do as much as possible without trashing this movie as much as possible, but it was not so easy when filmmakers tried it all. <br /> <br /> Edit this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst edit I ever saw in a movie! There are some things you do not have to go to film school to learn, it is not one of the better edits, but identify bad. <br /> <br /> Also, the shot ... Oh my God shot, just awful! I can not find the details, but sometimes we only pop up random things, and with the performance of which will give you the most painting experience of watching movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is made up of 4 cast and crew with no less than an excuse or budget. I saw a small film on YouTube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greyta, I do not know what you're thinking, but this film is not just masturbation for both of you. You should be ashamed! In conclusion, this movie is a lazy amateur pornography that is divided into 3 or 4 shy sex scenes, full of annoying conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If it's not your kind of thing, avoid at all costs!
