This is a very strange film ... I was not really sure that there were some N london lollaeps found such an intelligent child that they all believed that they had some kind of miracle and in some way made them their own. Make changes in their lives that usually end in disaster. About 90 minutes later, the film ended up feeling uneasy, almost all bored with silence. I was not worried about any characters - none of them got the chance to bear with the audience. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am i disappointed It was just very weird. What will runner? Why does Emilio shoot the child? ... that made absolutely no senses, stupid. Can anyone help me understand the mess of this movie?
