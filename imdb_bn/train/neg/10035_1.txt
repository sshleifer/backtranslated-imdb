Absolutely terrible movie Waste the time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so loud that you can not understand the lecture. Well if you really listen intently, what they can talk about is really unknown. <br /> <br /> The camera work is bad, the editing is not present, the background score gets a headache, the action is disturbed, the dialogues are unconscious, the acting disrespect, and Kareena looks like a wrestler, now she looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can slim down but you can not get favor. <br /> <br /> I like to like it after spending three hours watching a movie, but this movie did not let me give that joy too. <br /> <br /> Continue if you want to torture yourself.
