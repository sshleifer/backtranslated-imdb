My first comment should agree with: The film is very difficult, very difficult. Despite having a big B-list cast, this film cover (probably this movie may sometimes be found for those who do not see it at the comedy center on weekends) simply tries to blame Denverfield, but in reality, everyone has a check mark for the Comedian from the '80s. . Randy Quaid? Check out. Ed Begley, junior? Check out. Lisa Simpson's voice? He can now say that the maximum overdraw was not his only terrible flick: double check. And many, many others. <br /> <br /> <br /> The most tragic thing about this flashing thing is that it was written so lazy with the already called jokes. Nothing interesting about this movie beyond its existence. You're good off paint dry watching. This is clearly the straight-to-video-scraping-the-behind-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adze: Throw an old-time star on the cover and you'll get some money back. The days of video rental are changing, consider that one of the last examples of garbage collection is <br /> <br /> The only use of this movie is if you are having trouble sleeping. It will get you there.
