If you have not seen Zumbi Bloodbath, then you do not have it. A contest like 'Create your own horror movie' in one day can not possibly bring an entry without the fear of an obsessionist's intellectualization. Mr. Sheet has forgotten to leave a story, a plot, the right dialog, that people need some basic acting talent and the credit designer has forgotten to publish. It seems that the handicakes have been recorded on the crumst and copied to the more bad tools. The effects of make-up are made of black skin and the jumbo and yogurt being imitated on the human head to mimic their skin. It's nothing more than a home-movie and it's also bad. Just befriending friends, friends and neighbors to watch for fun. For my life, I do not understand why any of the products listed in this interesting movie magazine or website are interesting - my wedding parties have home-movies, which are way better and more interesting. Total waste of time, money and energy. Growing Zoomy Bloodbath II is the same garbage.
