I saw 'Descent' at the Stockholm Film Festival last night and it was a huge disappointment. The reason for the depression was potentially strong, there was an exciting excitement to see Rosario Dawson in a little close movie and the 'rape / retaliation' Falix fan of the 70's (sounds, I'm not!), I was poorly told to check out this movie very funny My conclusion: Let's get a classic stick! Yes, the story has potential but dialogues are flat, the actors are incredible. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that this college is the world's best screenplay in the United States, which serves only one purpose and all jazz, but it only makes the whole film unstable. Dawson is like the scene of the rape: it is seriously lacking in intimacy! I was not expecting some 'irreversible' style but still, do we feel the compassion for him? I do not Not for a minute, that was so lam ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, this is really good but nothing is breaking down on the ground. I must admit that screening was not so good at the festival, so maybe I missed something here but at the end of the movie, I could not think, 'I like to see Argentina' Info 'again. Hah hah More importantly, the first scene of the club has been shot nicely and all the bitter sensation of seeing a more and more annoying version of the scene in the dirty bar near the American-Canadian border at Lincoln's Twin Picas-Fire Walk. My ... ... crude red and blue light, heavy diamond music, general sex / falling atmosphere ... no, I could not enter this movie. very bad.
