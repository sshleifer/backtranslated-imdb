This movie ??? What are the Indians trying to show? I think it is more effort from Pakistani soldiers and in fact the ill-managerial director of the country .... But we know Pakistanis that we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... armed counter only <br /> <br /> It's OK ... In the early part of 1997, this image was bad ... and the director and writer tried to eliminate the shame of Kargil's defeat by the Pakistani armed forces <br/> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > So Mr Datta is trying to create some good films instead of such a Nonsense movie
