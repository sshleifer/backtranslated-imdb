<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some impossibility, it was really a great ghost / giant flick. So, I will give some good points at first: - The dragon was quite strong, especially when he found the luncheon for the tunnel (hint: he liked the man). - The action was not fairly closed, and, after a weak initial, I got quite absorbed in the story. Sorry, I was transformed into a dragon - he was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the film. <br /> <br /> ** Maybe some inconsistencies for inconsistent things **: - If you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100, would you charge her cave with a barrel of her arm? Duh - All American names of an American character, blonde hair and clear slavic accent, are trying to assert its Spanish? is not it? - A lead scientist whose slave's act can be cut with a knife, and he is supposedly born in Chicago, educated in the United States? - A military helicopter pilot who works on his own repairs, a huge transport copper with another crew flies and an expert Marx and war soldier for the boot? OK. Ohhhh I will not mention 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while contacting his base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than the Japanese giant Flickr, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Warrior 2, although naturally the left side can eventually be opened. Or, perhaps, they will hire a real manager next time. <br /> <br /> Despite all the things, I gave 4 out of 10 of this Flickr. If they rewrite the plot, add 2 more, and eat it in the first ten minutes of getting the dein kine. <Silently>
