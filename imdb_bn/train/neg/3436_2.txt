A girl is looking at her through a serial rapist skylight that is falling unconscious. Martin Mener's and Orville Stone of the Intelligence Department are hot on their feet, but after getting her breast breast, raping her, and taking the baby's breast, he gets as soon as it gets hot. He died. Hope this picture will end. Because it is not very awesome because the level of acting is sudden horror. Sadly, this is not the end, and a few months later, the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a contract of devils. So wherever he has left, with detective detectives in this case, this time the flying children remain after him (do not ask). Very low budget movie (Street Trash and Philly McNistry Spring Mind), but it is scraped under a barrel. Dangerous acting, special effects on crappy dime shops, lame attempts on comedy and oh yes, and the end also sucks. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Theres Bestul completely gets naked; Anne R. gets helpless
