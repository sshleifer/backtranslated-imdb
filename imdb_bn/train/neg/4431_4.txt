After the release of this annoying comedy-drama in 1979, Wonderfully received the views of Sterling. I think that remembering the opening of the movie section of LA Times, and looking at the 2-page ad for "Chapter Two", for example: "Goodbye Girl" better than! "And" Neil Simon does it again! "What did Neil Simon do? He took an autobiographical situation (a very early resurrection after the death of a beloved boyfriend) and it's deadly, unpleasant and - worst - illogical. James Kane played blue-er, George - A writer who can not return to life after losing his wife; encouraged Marsh Mason (true life, Mrs. Simon ... soon will be soon Mrs. Simon) who tried to love George despite her mood and general abnormality. Mason is very upset here, and it may not have been for Cane's indifference (it is not painful to mention a sub-plot related to the thin, blonde valerie hyper, which suddenly stops the proceeding) I finally like the Mason blast ("I'm surprised! I'm new to me!"), But I have not seen any happy ending for these two people ... and the time has proved me right. ** ****
