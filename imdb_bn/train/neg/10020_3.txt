Vijay Krishna Acharya 'tashan' is an excessively hyped, stylized, product. Certainly this is one of the most stylish movies, but when it comes to content, even the public will refuse it. Why? Films script as a 2-year-old child as a amateur. Script King, in addition to a good script, is the greatest director ever can do nothing. The most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars are being displayed at Tashan. But if the script is bland then anything in the world can protect you. Frustration! <br /> <br /> Acting: Anil Kapoor, an experienced actor. But how could he fix a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor is not so hot! She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan did not get his award here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Fawah and Yashpal Sharma were lost. <br /> <br /> 'Tasan' is a boring movie. Film failure in the box office, you should keep away.
