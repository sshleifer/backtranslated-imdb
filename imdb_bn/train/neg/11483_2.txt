I was completely amped to see this film. I'm waiting one year for New Zealand to be clean here. I did not have so much disappointment because it was so frustrating and Clark's worst movie is no doubt that this film is so wrong with this film. First of all, acting is something great, especially Nick Stahl as 'The Bulli' and a curly brown hair girl (I can not remember her name), but most were touching and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now an expert in the film of Clark and he was so bright at 'Kids', but in 'Bulli' he investigated his scenes with such seriousness to make his scenes often turn into a parody. The first year the screenplay felt like the film was written by the students. Sorry, a high school student ... nobody has seen a movie before. And I could not fathom Clarke's intentions. Did he try to make the existence of these children meaningless? Like hell, it was certain that he got very good pork. I am not rude but I did not need to see the breast and buttocks of every 5 minutes. I still keep Clark's best film as 'Another Day of Paradise'. It's fantastic and I do not think he'll ever be at the top.
