I tried to finish this picture three times, but it is a terrible God Case on the point: Mother and daughter are in bed and morning walk, gas stop for mom, crazy gas station makes strangers crazy to seduce her husband, who is running her B.B.B. He ran away, turned his head on B & B and instead of calling Habibi ballistic and wants to call the police, the story continues with warm behavior on both of them. Wow <br /> <br /> The other tasks are logical shortage. The acting is also warm, and the next neighbor's warning is really delivered at a very bad, bad acting moment. <br /> <br /> Impressive intense anger / death moments are integral to the timing-filled interplay with striking scenes in characters. <<br /> <br /> At least focus, mood and stories will be given more attention.
