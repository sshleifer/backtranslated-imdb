When Kevin gets his dead uncle's boat as a gift, he invites his five friends to visit Catalina Island for the weekend. During the journey, they drink drunk, play sex and play, everyone says their greatest fear. After Kevin drowned in the open ocean, the engine stopped, and they were attacked and murdered by their greatest fearsome fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter, and three other friends, on the "cheated boat" DVD, with less than 30 minutes, the group saw these dirty and boring adulterous pieces, and we had another movie Afterwards, I decided to see how bad I could see the rest of this membrane and sleep in sleep. The confused story is a horror cinematography and camera There is work, perhaps an actor who can be an actor and actress, and ultimately the film seems to be a bad project in the movie school. The terrible and proactive playplay shows a ridiculous wrap at the end, actually a complete mess that did not understand everything about the story. The girl was crazy or full of fantasy friends If this is true, then what is his friend's last result of his crazy? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagam para non morte" ("Death to travel")
