In short, the film was a slightly weak act, and a slightly weak work with a little bit of isolated rhythm and pacing, some second-second laws governing some inconsistent passings and some poor performance and conspiracy, despite some inferior performance. Cast, and the third law ... there was virtually no third work! <br /> <br /> In the third game, the movie suddenly disappears. There is no resolution and no way from the measure of the second step, so there was no third thing to do. The bad guys die and that is; The last credit roll. There is nothing to show the hero and supporter characters and what happens so. Visitors will probably leave the theater after the movie, "What is this?" A real letdown. <br /> <br /> Music was composed by David Bell, which worked largely to serve the film most of the time, but of course it is not something extraordinary. It is just effective, but it is achieved simply by being generic and derivative. It is clear that the score is very date-wise with the use of synthetic texts for several syntheses. The impact that I had at least about the score was that, in a few moments, the exciting songs sounded as "48 HRS" songs from James Hornner. And "commando," especially brass. Finally, the film's basic story was good, but the death penalty was unthinkable with medium direction, weak acting and somewhat contradictory passings. <<br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This might be a screenplay or perhaps a production Because of the budget constraints, the film can be produced in the finished film or the third three editions (but why do I think there is no third thing? Whatever happens, the sudden end is really the overall movie pain. <br /> <br /> If you are curious This is good for a scene and you can easily copy the movie If you write screenplays and make movies, then you will not want to waste your time until you get the MST3K version At least something can laugh.
