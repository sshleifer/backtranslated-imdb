My wife and I do not see a movie every night in a film and most of the art films that need thinking. I have many patience, which is slow for movies. My wife has twice the time of attention that I have. All that is said - this film is just empty and BORING! It went somewhere. Never blossomed. It started fairly strong with a pledged plot ... then he baked cookies ... to Spain ... he sulks, he stares .... Credit roll. The savage, full of holes, lies start and dead ends. We just FF'd through various extended sequences staring off in space. The artificial depth was implied when he cried with mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It is a pretty shot pose to be deep or arty like chick-flick. You never know that Morgan would always know. Almost half of you do not care anymore anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines to develop. Do not waste your time on this. I'm so shocked at the score so high.
