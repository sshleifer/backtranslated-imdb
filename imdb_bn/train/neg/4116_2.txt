One of my line essences will explain it, but I have to go to it. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like an overdone soap opera, and I can comment on it. There were some interesting scenes in the middle of the movie "Big One", but wait, what's that? Earthquake * gasp *, wait a minute! That's a dent! Well, some parts of it were lost. I can not believe the belief that the film was bad, the other "visible" scenes from others, many good movies What a wonderful director thinks that the viewers are fools, believe that they are located in the top of the mountain Lakes in the suburbs, Ala Danta, on the big mountain-backed backdrops. <br /> <br /> My suggestion, this film should be Bond V anna, Destruction, and go for the real thing (Again, anyone from the peak of Dante's Crackle.) <br /> <br />
