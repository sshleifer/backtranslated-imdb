As said before, visual effects are stunning. They're breathtaking. I personally use bladder and graphics that are not at all easy. But that's all these movies. Not only is the confusing plot, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scenario, Prog and Emo are trying to flee away from what they know. The conflict seems to be here between humans and nature. Later, when they entered the straw straw house, Prog explains that "one step place and (you have died)". Here, there are more specific contradictions between innocent people and nature. The film is like progress, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man when Prog, Somewhere Out, Emo Murder. Proog is immediately being a "sick man" being a caring parent seen in a lost child. He betrays us Not only this sadness, but we do not know because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character does not develop. It is becoming stronger through somebody, through struggle. It is depressing and does not cause any reason because there is no great truth about the soul of man or the world is brought to light like a great drama. In my opinion, the film is strictly abolished in all respects. However, graphics are stunning, but a movie is far more than mere eye candy. No true, no struggle and a bad surprise came to an end. In conclusion, an untouched movie without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
