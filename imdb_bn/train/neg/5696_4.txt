It keeps an eye on me, however, without damaging this movie for anyone ........ When he corrects the fridge by getting a book from the library, you knew how the movie would end when he returned to the library? Against a book of self-defense and killer. For me, this movie has not been worth saying ... a killer is actually a remedy for mental illness or another symptom.
