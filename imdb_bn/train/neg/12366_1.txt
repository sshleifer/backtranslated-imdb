The worst thing about the classic characters created by "Lunatics Unleaded" Chuck Jones. "Lonnie Tune" has many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others were not too much. "Lunatics" it's the worst. The idea is stupid and innovative of the series as "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titten". . There was no match with the original characters and the stories were annoying and bad. New design is ugly and animated compassionate. This show just does not work. This terrible waste of animation is a complete failure and it can be nothing but a bad joke. Lame! Zero Stars
