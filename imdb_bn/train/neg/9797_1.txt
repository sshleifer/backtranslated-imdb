Nowadays it's a tendency to show all the show from the classics of the 90s (people became blind so easily by nostalgia these days) and when some shows were undoubtedly good, it was just pure shit. I have seen this event many days ago because it has received many reactions on TV and I do not even like it as a child. People over the age of 8 can see how much power rangers are working, and how much the special-FX has been delayed. While the show does not suffer 'painful' scenes of pain, viewers are infected with a group of thirteen people with this unnecessary soap opera and they have little social problems now and thereafter. I do not know about you, but I could not donate it to any other thing, and it was not really fulfilling, until they again have to fight 'a fight with some kids' fightworks' or some diverse alien-clothes with some toys. -robot You do not feel 'involved' with this event anymore and in fact, most actors do not really have any interest in acting, as well as they only increase the feeling of feeling. <br /> <br /> There is nothing really memorable about this show, and it's fantastic surprising that it has received many spin-offs (Beetleberg is a good example). It's all a quick way to make some money though. I asked a fan to challenge what exactly happened in episodes that looks so good because I did not find anything that is very objectionable to children. My guess is that most of the Power Rangers 'fans' will tell me that "I'm not right" whatever happens on that line. I do not really care though; This was then crap and it's still shit now.
