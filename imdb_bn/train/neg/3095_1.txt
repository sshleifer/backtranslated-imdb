Wow, after finally making several attempts, I ended up watching this horror film, only to learn that Rick Sloan and his production team have signed the video directly this year. <br /> <br /> All movies reviewed by MST3K - and they are, of course, a bad bad manoj, '' Weaverlief, '' incredibly weird '', and 'Laserblast', 'Jobs Nightmare' and 'Time Chasers' Sometimes the rubbish shown must be the largest size pile (it is suitable for blurring). Very simple, the film exploits people's desire for sexual violence, fame, fate, skill, and of course about a bunch of greedy people, which ends in human death. But it is a film where the acting is very ridiculous (as a test of machismo, for example, two people who fight in front of the garden equipment), the text is so compulsory (like a gramlin view hanging in hand with a girl unattended, if He turned his head to a quarter left ... and this is not the first movie in it), and the story is so much ... I have paid attention (So MST 3 Reef "where the future law will create movies by philmamelarsa), that's actually a good time for you to turn off the screen, all route for the dolls. ... the worst film ever.
