I saw this stupid waste on HBO's comedy channel, so I thought it was quite innocent and probably it was a comedy. But there is absolutely no fun here. After being beaten by 15th-century investigator tortures - a good cast is being lost in a script I have written with my left butt-cheek. The first half is particularly bad, because it has some neutral, uninterrupted dialogue which I have added in a while and talked about zero-empty empty plot. Starring like Ian McGregor and Jeta Jones, this little movie is in it and this site has less than 1000 votes on this site, only you have to tell everything. Some nice shots hurt on the cold British coast, but it's about him. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply makes it because it writes that good connections (family connections, especially) and / or almost a lot of cash is lying.
