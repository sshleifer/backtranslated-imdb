I should definitely be beaten behind by watching this movie because it was really painful. Is an incompetent painter becoming a fully capable hit man? The film was spread out of irrationality, which I mentioned to all of them, then I would leave the film. Soft Pietersen Ur George Weint certainly would like to agree to this movie. The acting was helpless and the story was even worse. As an intelligent and reasonable person, I did not understand where the author came from and where he was going with this movie. There was a point in every part of the main character, there was a string of helpless and ridiculous events, then the film ended. One does not make a movie of the illogical act after the conversation, it only makes a conversation train debris.
