Although it got some favorable news after playing at the Toronto Interl. Film Festival, there were many reasons to not expect too much from this. One - it's a very low-budget Canadian film. Two - it's written, directed and starred (usually a bad sign, until Woody Allen, George Clooney or two other respected filmmakers). But despite this being my obsession with the expectation of hope, it still faces great disappointment, I wanted to think as much as possible. <br /> <br /> A short - bad script, bad acting, terrible instruction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I only laugh twice. Plus, horror is blaring across music. Any attention to this is how I do not know how to get it.
