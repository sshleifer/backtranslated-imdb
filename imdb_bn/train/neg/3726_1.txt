I was forced to see the whole series of films in this short series and I was told that they were true! Talk about child abuse. I was less afraid than Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is trustworthy only for those ridiculous beliefs and those who want to abolish their children in the same faith are good. There are obvious problems associated with brainwashing and rebellion, as well as bad acting, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They are just terrible, terrible movies all around. Yes, a child credible (and scary), but I can not imagine buying a big up in this verse. However, I must say that today, one of them is interested in seeing as an adult. They may think of them in a certain midnight / civilized movie.
