The movie was doing a great job at first, the profiles of their characters were set up ... the plot seems to be going in the right direction ... However, as the film progressed, the director looked at the wrong kind of things. .. or edited from many movies. The character's identity has changed in the film for bad. Also, many seem to have meaningless meaning - in other words - they had something in the movie which is not suitable for the movie. And the title ... The movie does not fit the title in a movie ... I think the title works for the previews. The actor has done better with what he has done ... if he has a good director and a writer, maybe this is a good job Has done. But it's not. So now a new horror movie coming this Friday .... My opinion! Do not waste your time or money.
