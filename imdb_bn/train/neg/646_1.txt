I accidentally saw this movie and this movie was an accident ... well done. The blonde women were drowning, the villain disappeared from one place to another and then became unexpected and came into hiding. He's not even a superhero, so I do not know how he did it. Cat and it is not difficult to make it. <br /> <br /> The old "bathroom mirror" is no longer scary, it has actually stopped scary years ago. You had the police on the way to Villain, another Clich (Idris elba congratulated, he came from London), the director had no source, and he made a picture and created a "scary step". "Which was a comedy look scary. Pathetic!
