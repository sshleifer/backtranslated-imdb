The plot seems certainly interesting enough. How can the brutal killing of a real life be turned into a really annoying movie? Well, you can see and find "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> I heard the murder of Wonderland before the release of this film and it seems to be a real true story of the real wicked people. Unfortunately, zero character development has evolved, so we do not understand why any such work has been done or good sense of interconnection between characters. Speed ​​speeds were very tiring. All of this leads to an unusually annoying film. <br /> <br /> Central character Don Rocker as Holler's girlfriend - a co-producer and Hollus's wife was a consultant in this film, our chance was to gain some real insight into the characters.
