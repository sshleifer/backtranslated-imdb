I have seen this movie for the first time and probably I have never heard of its bad message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the director itself is quite good, the actor played well and CGI (I'm CGI fan) is fantastic. But that's not a movie alone. There are no stories, there are no messages behind the beautifully exploited opponents. <br /> <br /> People should remember, the art of a director is not just your point of view but the story. And missing this whole 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> For a simple 4 rating.
