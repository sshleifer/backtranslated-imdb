Diana Muldaur appeared for the second time in the Star Trek, but this time as a different character. Someone noticed on the board - perhaps it was hair. Yet, at this time, he is not worshiping any god (see the previous episode), but with magical powers it is a very famous lady who is able to communicate with him and is able to see a medusa without being crazy (human rights response). Unfortunately, the person who loves most with him is a small card of the whole deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small piece - it is a strange way of travel). And, unfortunately, the fundamentalists themselves do not get hurt. What happened next is silent, and for the first time I saw it, I was quite hard working. Gaffanga was quite stupid on Mudadaur looking at all the people in the board and when he went crazy for a short while acting, there were quite a few camps. Do yourself good - if you do not see the show before, then choose a different category.
