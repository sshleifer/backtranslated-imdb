I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie is going to be bad. After watching it for more than a year, I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not see this bad movie, but seeing the whole film would be wrong for me to write a review. <br /> <br /> When I say "this movie gets diminished", I believe that some bad filmmaker Winnie Bees has been financed to produce this bad film, but it costs more than $ 20,000 to create this film. Could not do All you need is a cheap camcoder or a cell phone camera. 15 people without any acting skills, a script written by some drunk people. <br /> <br /> The main part of this very harmful step is <br /> <br /> <br /> A reporter (they are Woodley) speculates on being a drunken person on the victim's report. She is completely unharmed. They are supposed to leave home, but thankfully it will be almost fully equipped and there will be a bottle of wine in the door step. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The history of the link will be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Her Story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Dropper allowed his soldier to die due to complete fatigue (I think it happened) After personalizing poor soldier, personal Wilson sat down to help him dig a grave and make the soldier fall, Ben Dropper. A shallow grave buries him <br /> <br /> but Sgt. Ben Dropper N is for big surprises. He knew his wife and daughter and she and her boyfriend killed the sea. Ben Dumpers To Retaliate Private Private Wilson. (He was killed by the soldier's grave) The soldier woke up from his grave as a zombie and killed him for retaliation. <br /> <br /> there was so much hair in the end of the crown. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B Horror, do not see this movie
