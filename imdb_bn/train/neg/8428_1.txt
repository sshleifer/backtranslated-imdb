Despite mysteriously positive reviews and high ratings, it's a terrible movie. Awesome enough, I feel the obligation to warn you bad. <br /> <br /> During the Indian War of Liberation, this film was set in the final phase of the state. What followed the ridiculous plot just met me with incredulity. The characters do not seem to exist in that era only, how they behave and how they behave. For example, the young married Hindu housewife in the local village should have a relationship with her leprechaun Englishman Master, knowing that the meaning of the discovery is probably shameful if the discovery of a social existence and a shameful punishment. ? Impossible, but still can be. However, will that young Hindu housewife continue to be half naked in Britain's conservative society, like Britney Spear, participate in hot outdoor sex during an open scene where they can be discovered at any moment? It's not just bloody unlikely, it's a crushing plot line. <br /> <br /> Such stupid movies matched poor performance, let me leave the film for one hour in the movie, so I did not see the second half of the movie. The only hope is that last intelligence is more than what I saw from the end.
