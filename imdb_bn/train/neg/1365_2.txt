The legal gray area concept of love crimes contributes about 10% of the movie appeal; Another 90% can be blamed for its flagrant bad ness. It is said that Shan Young's performance as a so-called district attorney is a fairly understatement of wood. With his blood suit and lazy hair gel, Young makes a decent job at convincing his cruel hate audiences for men. Why would he ask his only friend to dress as prostitution so that he could arrest the police who tried to arrest them? The only reason behind this hatred is that he follows a relentlessly deformed photographer who gives a combined romantic and driving force behind this hypnotic movie. Young people from full-time nudity tend to be interested in showing interest, but with gentle nudity, they stand by the fire. Shipping her gems and making her rave about self-frustration and sexual despair is worth the love of the fare of love, but it's downhill to and from there all. Despite the desire to judge Patrick Bergin's character, his police skills escaped completely with his tired wishes and emotional lips. Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a thin sociopath; If it works to sleep with the enemies, it can definitely work in hell. But I can not imagine if there is a lack of energy, if the young man brings conflict with his picture. I'm guessing it and the result is a "thriller" which is quite bad and yet ludicrous thriller.
