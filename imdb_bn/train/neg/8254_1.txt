I saw good production quality on YouTube! I apologize to the actors, because writing was terrible and the direction was frustrating, not sure how they could find the line - I really doubt that the actor was able to recover the film or not how good he was. Characters did not always develop and the plot did not have any practical additions that could go a long way. It's really embarrassing, because the film's consistency was good and it could be a suitable movie with good production values, directions and scripts. It was definitely not a comedy, until you panicked and screamed loudly - which was amateur, even the English actors thought it strange.
