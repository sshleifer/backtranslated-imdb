How Hollywood (and still can do it) is a wonderful example that can take a great piece of literary fantasy and make fools. <br /> <br /> In the case of "Big Sky", the author Dudley Nicholls and the company proudly said that they could improve on a classic pioneering novel by Pulitzer Prize Winner, author Guthrie In this way they have given the spirit of the story and any side and influence as a movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> The story of the epic nature of the gothic book and the evolution of its original character, Buen Cadil, a naive, from a Kentucky boy, is a hard and capable living / mountainous man, a low river boat has been replaced by a boat, which convey a slightly similarity to the author's intent. Do it. In the film version, the presence of a sister is nothing but despair. <br /> <br /> Incentive and even shiny plot elements for Guthi's novel effects and tensions were not moved for any reason. The worst thing is to insist on the character of Live Calo, which was a formal, minor character in the book, grabbing only a few pages. On the other hand, a very important and impressive character, Dick Summers, veteran pioneer, completely absent !!! This hacker's director Hooks decided the role of Jebe in this movie, starring actor Hannik Utte, he was not quite busy. Therefore, a significant time was given for the short cut of Hollywood for writing, editing, and direction of extraordinary screen descriptions of Geb / Hananik utt, in an unreasonable, voice-overwearing description. <br /> <br /> Some movies have really improved the books that they were based on (a wonderful example of William Wiley's "Ben-Hur"). But it is not terrible and depressing as an adaptation to a novel but as a movie to yourself. <br /> <br /> The story is brutal and cleansed, and characters - at least those that were not edited - only shallow and boring shadows of Gothry's literary philosophy And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's star appeal, which could help to lift the film, was shouted by the past role of milk given to him. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, then Gothry's Pulitzer Prize winner's version of the movie is Sequel, "The Way West", also starred in Karke, more bad. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" makes Hawk's place as a more restricted, cruel director.
