Who has researched for this photo? Although it was set up in Baghdad in 2004, all soldiers wear ACU and all have Universal Camoflaz pattern gear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie did not make any sense, letters came and went without explanation, and people doing such ridiculous things that will never happen in real life. I understand that this is a movie, but it's probably trying to illustrate some realistic imagery. It's sadly failing, but trying it. Looks like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them and then swallowed them, then flipped a film. I will not recommend anyone on this photo. I'm not sure why I still sit through the whole thing. JI Joe One is really that you feel compared to this. stay away!
