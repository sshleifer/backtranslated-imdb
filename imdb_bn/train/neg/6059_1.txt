I would say as a fan of Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - perhaps one of the best films I made. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I do not reasonably think that he made a similar effort like Cigarette Barnes. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You will see it from this perspective that it does not feel like a movie. It looked as if someone else guided it for a thing. <br/> <br /> I just heard his old school H2 / H3 / Fog soundtrack and it was especially nice for the time being. <Br /> <br /> She is using a style that was no one and it did a great job for her movies.
