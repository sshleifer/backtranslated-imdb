Three writers made a brave attempt to adjust the novel by Jane Stanton Hitchcock for the tube, but this television film has finally been injected through a lot of melody and it is not known only when to leave. Artist Meg Tilly was suddenly appointed by the wealthy, mysterious Ellen Bartin, who wanted a sculpture painted on his unused ballroom wall. After learning about the last assembly held there - the upcoming party of Allen's daughter - Tilly decided on her artistic theme, even before the function even started, the girl did not mysteriously die and did not dream that both she and the dead had a similarity with each other. ! Two superb actresses lend their services to their incredible yarn, which does not closely scratch, which does not meet lady's intensity. Holding the role of Bartin in the camp, Tilly was trapped in a dreamy-eye-wife routine. Only a series of late films (in the morning after the end of the sculpture) are accused of allegations of honesty, anger and betrayal. The rest is in PEOPLE.
