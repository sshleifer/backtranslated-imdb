Here are some previous comments that give a lot of speculation about this flick - and I totally agree with both letters and dialogues. <br /> <br /> I want to read about the horrors of Elizabeth Berkly, equally terrible "shows," which I have never seen - much like acting - and its performance is not terrible here, even if it is not too bad for the quality of living bad rent. His character was not an indication of depth, but then perhaps there should not have been there. If so, then it did not have any depth or character in any character, actor or painting - it was not a letter, actor or screenplay picture. After the Principal handling of the initial complaint of Lease, he kissed his joke and smiled. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were the same (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in her car, more realistic, intelligent work, and heck, she is mentally challenged). <br /> <br /> The ridiculous, unclear lawyer (overwhelming excuse), the father of the false student, probably performed something worthy of his performance: At the same time he was both ridiculous and completely annoying, there was no credit. His attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also the profession is not unknown. <br /> <br /> Finally (and really, I'd rather enjoy this part), the police had a collection of such extravagant oafs, depending on Barney Faff, without Andy, to administer all law enforcement and investigation of your community rather than you want. I know that most of the original police are slightly less than the level of sharpness, intelligence and sympathy displayed by most characters in the "Law and Order" series, but these levels seem to be in the way. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> I said, the original performance of this written performance in the story was even worse than its overall performance. This was something of a credit, such as "F" to "F-minus." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This whole crippling situation should be solved - in real life - about 15 minutes, following the realistic meeting, between the teachers involved in the school and the school authorities. But then this adapted play was followed and a one hour blank image was kept on the camera. <br /> <br /> But here the authors, proven with their last, can make them worse. When the situation is finally "resolved" and "correct", it is done in about 45 seconds, without any indication of any steps coming towards criminal and "real world" for his parents, whether they have been able to find some way towards the liberation war . <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; Second "*" because it contains some "attraction"
