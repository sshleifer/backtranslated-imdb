I respect the romance's extraordinary work which he feels like a great synthesis, and ordinary viewers are generally considered as artistic failures (such as Renoir or Chaplin's last film; yes, "politician countryman" has his dark side too) But with "Les Amor's de Estre a de Deldon", as Roma herself wanted, for her last film, the director of this great film, who made the last movie film, she sings with Uraf's "El" ", ridiculous aesthetic codes, Think of a parody of the last films of Roselini (which he created for Desserts or Marx's life). <br /> <br /> " In his version of Piersval, Rohr denied that in the middle of the classical presentation could be a re-transcription of the film so that the film was made in real landscapes, when the director was involved in the 16th century, the actor apparently changed his mind and the film's actors contemporary trees like peasants of 1600 They were dressed up like Antique Lesson around the landscape, but Lucini The story itself is not stupid, and the story itself is not stupid, but the way to mix naturopathy with Rohm's artistry is so childish and amateurism that it quickly becomes unreasonably funny (and I'm not even talking about the annoying pronunciation of the actors, annoying and I'm not even sadly humorous) Rodolf Payline, ridiculous soft-loving tone, poor musical Nurture Tactivates, or Strange Attractions for Transvestest!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Made for TV. At the beginning of the film, Rome teaches us that the original French version of the story is now isolated by modernity and that is why he had to manage the film "El Astri" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure this film will be more modern and attractive, if Rohrer also had the same story in the same narrative and painter's conclusions as well as in modern areas. This movie may interest some historians, but most of the cinephile may laugh at this last and tragic romance movie.
