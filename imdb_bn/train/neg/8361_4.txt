Home in Canc√∫n Mexico. Keeping this CD, he gave his brother James, in which three years of phone conversations between Regalczky and the President of the United States are involved in criminal agreements. This CD gave an edge to David on those international mobsters. <br /> <br /> James tried to reduce Rosenlosky to 22 million diamonds, became a little greedy, not only spent his life but also risked his loss to David. Raspenskski wants to talk to David for his CD by talking to her ex-wife, Lease, Rozelskski makes an agreement to pay her loan if she comes through. Later, David killed Rosenlissky's Mexican hit man Tony, with the help of a white white shark, who did not go for all these peaceful behavior in his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony brought the CD that had been kept for safe at Leicester in a local hotel and now wants to kill James, as he did David, and also kept the CD on top of Rosenlausky. <br /> <br /> Secretly concealed secret secret secret secret secret information kept secret secret from Dr. David.
