Can not save this terrible script in good performance, chick-flick larded with cliche per book. Both the main characters are deeply disrespectful, and where Laura Lynn's character reminds me of sexual relations in front of her teenage son in front of her teenage son - which I think is considered stupid - it's just awful.
