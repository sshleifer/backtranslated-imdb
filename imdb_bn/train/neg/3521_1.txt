I'm still shuddering thinking of watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw films played, I liked a couple of them, but this one went upstairs. It does not play the lead role of the greatest male actor ever (Sally Stallone), but the plot of the film is so stupid from the beginning (why the plane does not loot money while on the ground) To require a person with a person less IQ than on Saturday. <br /> <br /> Also, there is no real twist in this plot, a three year old child can guess later. It's a set of clich√©s (action-style) slie performs worse than its other movies (it was also better in Rambo III if you see the movie as a comedy instead of action movies). Now an actor who can not work) A) B surprised) C) Something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I still want to say that there are two reasons why this movie can make some people like it. Exploration is outstanding, but then ... you can look good on July 4th. LANDSCAPES are fantastic, but then ... There are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see more good sights instead of spoiling this flick. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching any other movie, there are even hundreds of thousands of good action movies.
