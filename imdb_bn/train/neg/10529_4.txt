First shown 12/6/2009 - 4 of 4 (D-Walter lang): From the point of view of the development of a character, the musical frustrates, in my opinion, from these halved Rogers and Hamartstein pieces. Sometimes there are some good songs and a decent comedic image, which is the King of Eulle Brenner of Crimson - but the film does not really do a good job to present the situation and settings. I can only blame some of the screenplay and maybe acting, why do not we fully understand the character and their situation. I know music and dance can be a little more than a musical instrument meant for enjoyment, but this part can not stand a lot for me. The basic story is an English woman who is fasting to teach children about European things. We later came to know that the king is actually the biggest student. Rita Moreno (as a Latino Arab - come !!) There is a side-ban romance between the king's bride's wife, and a former lover who creates some complexity, actually adds something. Deborah Care, the main female character Annie - is OK, but it's not too trustworthy. King learn some things due to his presence and then he fades away as the movie. It's really a tiny story with a song and dance but a viewer is really an experience that's great.
