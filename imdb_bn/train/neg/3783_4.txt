It was never experienced in the most timeless animation film, but it certainly can not be appreciated as well as tried. Combining the DreamWorks animation and computer graphics, it is named after a Mustang, after the soul (Matt Damon, providing first-person descriptions), and his journey across the Old West border. In fact, he was born free among all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he was abducted using races, he led to throw all those who tried to run him. But when he escaped from his cage with Little Creek (Daniel Stoody), he developed two of his friendships, oh, and maybe this is one thing for Little Crick's female horse. In the end, after some fleeing, after the colonel (James Cromwell) and his men backtracked and made a final big jump across a hole, let Little Creek spirits go and he also gave up his female horse and they found their countryside and fellow horse home Also played Chopper Burnett as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LÃ©beau Morfi / Railroad Foreman, John Ruben as the soldier, Richard McGonagall Bill and Joe as Matthew Levin I was hoping to talk about the horses in this movie, but it became like the Dumbo thing across the whole, and Brian Adams's songs are not the most compelling, but this is not a terrible movie. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Oscar, and Golden Globe was nominated for Best Song for Brian Adam's "Hei I Am". OK!
