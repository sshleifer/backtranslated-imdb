I enjoyed the first reviewer's comment, when I saw a lot more films than this, when I first saw it in the theater on the second floor of the '80s. After the painting of the painting, I was fascinated after taking care of the costume clad in a closely dressed room. But to me, the cast was originally scanned, their personality muffled by the mask, while I think of being incredibly stable, and crooked photography. At the time, the rating below was silent, which means "sit even once". <br /> <br /> However, I'll jump on a chance to see the second look.
