Despite many styles, flash and shiny, this French music failed to speak. The tunes are repetitive, anticipated, and tiring. The story is worthless as many characters. <br /> <br /> People refrain from singing and dancing without inspiration or reason. Most of the curiosities wear fake looks and hair dresses and sets off the studio suddenly. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the restored version of this video was discontinued before it ended, so its negative impact was on me. Of course a shame, a final attempt is so weak to cast a talented cast. <br /> <br /> goes to the show, I guess, where is the follow up (in this case, the great classic, "rel relas") often turn around. One can recover, only to recreate.
