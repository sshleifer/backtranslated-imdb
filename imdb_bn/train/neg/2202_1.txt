This movie reminds me that I had another accident that I had met with combs. There were far more holes than the platform, I think I sometimes see something more to say than "B" in a movie. The act was so ridiculous that the memories of combs past camps were not enough to save it even. Considering the script, I should assume that there is not enough money in the budget such as meaninglessness and fundamental concepts. I completely offset that I offered blockbuster prices for this trash. It was something that was made for television, which helped me avoid this torture and obviously something that these poor movies should be needed to alert you. No matter what avoid this movie.
