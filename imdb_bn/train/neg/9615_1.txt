It seems clear from this adaptation that he is not. He did not just leave the plot behind, he created himself! The things he left behind were unbelievably frustrating that I was happy to exclude some of the most important part of the novel. The plot was digested, incompatible and at least pronounced. I do not want to say anything about the actors, but they can not work! Dickens certainly, of course, but this is unfortunate! In the middle of the nineteenth century, there was nothing more than a cricketer, and at least said less than Trondh! If you want to see the real Copperfield then see the wonderful 1999 adaptation of BBC. As a playplay writer, I think he read the Cliffs note!
