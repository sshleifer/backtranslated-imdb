Eddie Murphy's "Enchanted" is completely and completely irrational, crude, cross and Lud. This absolutely the only way to stand up to stand up to describe this terrible, trashy piece. Eddie Murphy goes on for rather than trying to shake it on to try and smile to win. He sometimes drives to be funny, but most of the pornographic languages ​​and the strange musical roles have lost the plot. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Until you enjoy Eddie's dirty style. I do not think I'm annoyed with "Eddie Murphy." I like Eddie in the movie script range. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
