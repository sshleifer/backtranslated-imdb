**** WARNING: Be spoilers here **** Why do I waste watching my garbage like this in my fast year? This image is an impressive collection of clich√©s, poor writing, more bad directions, and yet we still can not act. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can predict the last story from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hero experts fight stupid, corrupt and helpless pregnancies. One off the avalanche, all the heroes who managed to survive living in spite of moving through all kinds of cliffhanger hazards in any way. The corrupt partner who brings the whole thing together with the money of his money. Second firearm heroically deflected by brave expert's brave test. At the end of the Evil henchmen there has been a heart as well. After saving him, the tragedened teenager fell on the head of his miserable head. Etc, etc, etc., and it goes. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are little reasons to warn for spoilers. I could give you basic elements if you could possibly do the whole plot. At least, I did not mark most of the time, guess what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we did not discuss the error. <br /> <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier commentator that although there is a bad movie even some release features. You will be given the pressure to find any one of these one. I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots, but that's it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br <br /> <br /> <br />
