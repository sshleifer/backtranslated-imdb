Seeing this stinker, Sandler constitutes cruel and illogical punishment. Really a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> Wall Wall bought $ 5.88 bint DVD. But thinking of echoing my head, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unsuccessful thing in this movie is that the boat just does not shrink! <br /> <Best / constructive suggestions: Mystery Comedy Theater. You show that some guy in the SciFi channel and his muppet-machine the most unwanted horror flicks (mystery science theater) spoof. Immediately, spin off a comedy program and features this flick. Without the good humor of this train's wreck, I am afraid that visitors can actually start with sandwiches and chains. <br /> <br />
