Perhaps Tobe Hooper is likely to have to offer horrible clones probably the largest fluke. Like any other awesome fan, I like Texas Chess, but it seems that to keep your name in front of a movie title, you have at least one hit movie. I can not remember any movie of Hyuper (do not count on yourself, the pollutarist) which really influenced the world of horror or film. And this movie, Night Terra, just back up my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him the terrible element to give him credit for at least a good job. He could do what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure drudge Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story written in us, and really awful scenes, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is removable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10 I'm sorry for Hooper, his career has really ended before it starts. I hope he will be able to pump at least one good flick, in the same way he can judge some of his rituals. <br /> <br />
