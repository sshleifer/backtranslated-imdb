This series is completely disrespectful, incoherent, and stupid and modern (ridiculous, in the 21st century style songs dominated by time and character) and "intelligent" (very disgusting: many ruthless, stupid jokes with animals) in the series "plot" (if there really is one). His film actor Kishore Kachchatra Secondary. Even Glenn Close (and it's usually good), swimming through this movie, Rudolf Dulle and Sunset Blvildard are driving themselves like this! This is a movie that is not good to watch. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless Siegel. Even the Basic Institute 2 was a plot, characterization and acceptable acting. Oh, No. It's bad.
