Citcom follows the life of some of the wicked people of "Legend of League of Legends", the legendary village "Raisen Vesi". Different scenes are combined with their general settings. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, the original plot is related to a new road that will be built by Raven Vesi. As a result, go to more foreign cities. But the "local" shop owners do not like foreigners like Edward and Tibbas, which are far from the city. Whenever a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are ruthless and not funny, for example, when the couple exploits two engineers who want to build new roads. Edward Drums, while nearly half of the victims of tubes are naked dance. <br /> <br /> As well, Polyvin Royston is on the move. He works at the local work center. Although Polyline hated humans, the woman does not want to leave her job. So when an unemployed person interviews as a fireman, he does not let him go because he is not ready for the job yet. <br /> <br /> Then Barbara Dickton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes wild, "details" about her sexual transformation. <br /> <br /> As well as vet, Mr. Chinuri, instead of healing them, they killed animals. In one case, he comes into a farm and is taken to the living room, where a dog puts in his basket. The farmer goes out. The dog is thought to be a sick animal, Mr. Chinanani is ethanizing him. After a second, the farmer opened the door and held a real "diseased" animal, a sheep in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some more resident husband and his wife who were killed by their nephew (his friends shop owners). The couple is very orderly. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color stands for one part of the body. Besides, they have thousands of keys, marked and precisely grouped with different colors. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actor plays very well. Playing women, the scene becomes ridiculous. Clothing is also suitable for actors. The tubes are wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show is a great deal of dark humor, usually British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The gram and gray of all the rooms are grayed out and corrosive. Often the fog is made in local stores which strengthens the threatening effect. Even the mark of the village is bad: "Welcome to Ravenstown, you will never leave." <br /> <br /> I think actors do great work but this series is not my taste.
