Basically, take the idea of ​​every Asian horror movie and destroy it and you get this movie. The story goes like this: A bunch of college kids give voice mail from their own phones, which predict their death. **************************************************************************************************** ************************************************************************************************************************************** It's the same bullcrap, different movies. <br /> <br /> Acting was pretty good. Unfortunately the actors are kept in a very ring-esquire situation, so in the past we have not seen anything. Although the two main tasks did a hard job. <br /> <br /> As far as Gore, there is nothing. We've got a cool order in which there is a hand-holding arm (I do not know how to explain it), but it has been cut so that you can see nothing without final results. You occasionally see some blood in which the decapitated weapon and a junky (which I can really add), but this film is not very bloody. <br /> <br /> This scare is less and scattered, and it really is not that scary. You will occasionally get some vague images, but it is not enough for my fear. It's no different from rings, ju-on, or dark water, and none of them feared me. This is really (and most Asian horror films) collapse that is not right if it does not provide fears. <br /> <br /> As far as guided, Takashi Mike has still done quite well. Compared to his earlier films, he expressed a slight downroar in the film, but he still portrays his many confusing styles which he has become famous. Many pictures were more than Mickey (with a scene with a bunch of dead scenes), and in the last 15-20 minutes, the rest of the film takes longer. Still, the film is flawed by its consensus. <br /> <br /> I would recommend only those people who are huge (even if you do not, I can recommend) in Asian movies or for big mix fans. Warning to those who want to go to Mikey, this is not his best. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it 4 because it's only medieval. Perhaps it was released 4 or 5 years ago, it could be a high rating price. <br /> <br /> Also, I ********************************************** ******************************************************* How does it assume to be good here (USA) if it's an Asian horror movie here? Most of these movies are similar to Japan, which are screws, urban legends and I know what you did last summer was here in the 90's. If you have seen that you have seen them all. And most of these movies are horrific and very dependent on imagery that if it does not provide horrible things that they do, then they are not only good and nothing will change it. More Asian Awesome Films will be auditioned and like a story of two sisters, if they do not fear or fear you two movies, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography and much more. . Two movies which are not just horror films, but in general movies. More Asian horror movies would be instead of cliche, "One Scratch just wanted to find out so that people killed people with their phone / video tape / house / electric equipment / water pipes / Google search engines / vibrators / groceries.
