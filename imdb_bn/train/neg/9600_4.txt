Very curious but never really elegant exploitation film with real story, but its stunningly extraordinary lead actress and benefited from some nice, awesome make-up effect. Daniela, a pretty prominent girl carrying her horror, was raped at the age of 13. 13. Nightmare and misunderstandings also believe that he is the reborn of a female ancestor, who was considered to be the Verruf. At night, he killed his father-in-law and submitted to the hospital. She escapes again, and the police devours more people irregularities while running for detectives, doctors and relatives. It is very nice to watch and very much to listen (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity became very quick. Fortunately enough, the leading lady Annik Borel rarely wear clothes and she fills the boring moment by a nude dance around a fire. The film is very long, very weird and very forgotten. The biggest surprise comes to an end, when suddenly outside of the blue, director Rino De Silvestro believes that his film is based on real events. Yes ok
