I saw the pilot and 3 lbs and house, m. D. Some of these have been noticed more than compatibility. The character of the piece is bright but socially lazy, similar to the Laurier character's house, but without the accessory intelligence that Laurie House brings. Meanwhile, the 'Straight guy' of the Tucker, fertile Doctor Segir, does not develop in more interesting characters, such as 'Siddhe Boys', Kudie and Wilson. The character of Indira Verma is similar to the relationship of Adrian Holland Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron. <br /> <br /> Some of the CBS targets the success of the House, MD, and prove that it will be successful in imitating their (similar) show. However, a show like the house demands a high level of copy and mystery, and the tuition and the company are not just challenging. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I canceled the show until the show was canceled. IMDb comments, but it does not come as a surprise to me.
