This movie is so bad, it's ridiculous. In fact, mystery science theater 3000, the television show which three characters watch and parody bad movie, mock use this very film. I suggest instead to watch this movie (probably above YouTube). <br /> <br /> Please do not see Hagglinens if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. Actually, this movie does not see time. Please Not least seriously. Her joke is not funny (to say the least), and you will have more fun poding or watching the movie after watching a parody of it. <br /> <br /> You can become ill after seeing yourself, so give up yourself. Read a book. To do laundry. Hobgoblins have some fun than watching.
