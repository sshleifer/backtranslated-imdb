::: Speaker Alert ::: <br /> <br /> Sawo, Arni is really a good man, but he has been sent to prison (or rather a few camps), in the fight against the helicopter and in the event of disobedience to some order. He fled, but after a while he was caught again. At this time a strange reality ended in the show, where he would run with a variety of themes from a bunch of tough boys for a while and eventually died. But we all recognize Arne, and we all know that he is more difficult than the hard people. <br /> <br /> I really like to love this movie, Arnie-fan and everyone. However, there are many errors in "Running Man" which really disturbs me from crap. For example, Arnie Wars reconstruction inside the helicopter, where the audience suddenly shows a brief overview of the event, 5-10 different cameras are done in the corner. This means Arnie Biman's military helicopter was drawing pictures of the driver, with about 10 cameras, one of which crew member Arnie Hall's eyes _inside_ <br /> <br /> <br /> There are other errors, and The theory, which seems to be very interesting and innovative in theory, works for a while, then it creates a pool of stupidity and miracles that drown. <br /> <br /> The acting is not really true, said to be something better than the lowest role, with Arnie's leading role, doing an average Arne performance. The rest of the cast can be found especially if not good or bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
