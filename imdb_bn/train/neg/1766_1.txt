Belvedu did not really bent to make such a movie. Script, music, everything in this movie is a waste of time <br /> <br /> Sound FX does not speak the real thing, they keep too many paths (technical gadgets), if they are trying to create a movie about something like this, at least try to achieve reality with it and extra sleep And reduce the beaps, because those gadgets do not really make loud sounds. Natural sounds like backgrounds and they are non-existent, which gives it an inauspicious atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The guideline seems to be right for a low budget movie (I'm sure it was a low budget production) though sometimes it seems quite amateur. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be empty and false, they just did not throw the film very well. I used to imagine that the Spanish actors wanted to speak in some Spanish than speaking in English, when we all knew that their language is a more vibrant and living language, so the actors can enjoy performance. Extensively if a strange language is used. I mean, no one can finally understand that how stupid it is for international actors to speak English with bad words? It should be done long ago buried in the production of cinema. Has the production team ever heard subtitles? This movie again depicts the European police as lazy and corrupt, the society as weak and helpless. I would like to say if the plot goes again, "Interpol can not jack, so let's call an American to bring this American syndicate down". <br /> <br /> Sony photos go the same way as Colombia. It's the only movie production for hell. I'd like to imagine some of them have some self esteem. Why Sony keeps out something good every year, because buyers are supposed to buy just all the dirty titles? They could use the same team like Die Cu C - I say. It is spoken in Spanish and Puja between Vegas and Santa Milan afloat profession to keep a good working movie. Looks and sounds a lot better! Come to Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
