Just saw this movie and of course I would say that after the initial effort to make a decent film that was shown at the beginning, it was absolutely terrible - but in the sense that I was not sure. <br /> <br /> It was like a child that gave this brilliance to the intellect that the spectators would be dead or very hard to entertain or both ... thanks for the quick progress! While making this film, the producer thought that I could not imagine the visual type. I mean, your performers are trying to be serious, though only, and a script that cries for total rewriting .... I can not say again. If Harlequin romances decide to make awesome movies, it will be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie to be entertaining, I strongly recommend that you look for some guidelines for the film. There are many good rentals there. Join a club, read reviews, but above all, avoid this like nasty.
