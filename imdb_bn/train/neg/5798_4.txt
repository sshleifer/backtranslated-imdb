This film is a relatively composite mix of crime with musical, romance, drama and film-silent shortcomings. It's basically a dirty hip of different styles, none of which really works like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is considered an actor as Mikey Rooney to be considered more serious. She is a former child-starter who is always happy and starring in musical productions at the beginning of her career. In this movie, he has chosen a different method (though musical aspects are still present in the movie). But its role is actually quite ridiculous in the movie. Do I think Mickey Rooney is a solid player? She is a very young boyish looking man. He was originally at the age of 30, but he was severely seen to be 16 years old. To pay tribute to the child, and to listen to difficult words to the gangsters who are nearly 3 times big, they just do not look and feel right. He simply does not believe in his role. <br /> <br /> This film mixes so many different styles, because the story looks really dirty. There is a crime plot somewhere in between and somewhere in between a romantic plot line and your dream is alive, but none of it is a messy approach and really does not work because of its operation. It's not just an interesting or compulsory movie to watch. Despite his career span from 1935 to 1957, Lasalso Cardos has made only 10 films in his directorial career. He was a struggling director, who was given a hard script to work in the industry and instead offered a small script to work with. His movies are all unknown and not very high quality. <br /> <br /> This is not a 50's movie but it also seems to be 'one of 40's or maybe like '30's. This film was mostly shot in black and white. Generally 50's black and white films often experience a cheaper appearance on it, and this film does not make any difference. <br /> <br /> It is rather strange scenes rather than watching it as Mikey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band acting like himself. One order together Although it was not Armstrong's only film, and often he would pop up in such films, often like himself. I think jazz lovers can still enjoy a bit because it is enjoying watching this movie due to this movie, because it is quite a lot in this movie. The movie actually received the Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
