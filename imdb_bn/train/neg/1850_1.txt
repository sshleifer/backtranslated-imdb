Director Ron Atkinson is utterly insane. This tiny budget movie is written by Harry Rousseau (John Jiancasrro, who co-wrote) in a few days' history of life, a non-job that gets Roberne doll from his bizarre girlfriend. He ordered a lot of drugs from the dolls, rape and murder. A ball-to-wall wall starts as the absorption film, well that looks like, but it gets very quick to repeat very fast. I'm certifiably leaning more towards the insane. Although it is difficult to forget once seen, it is difficult to forget If Tom Green never made a horror movie Kinda <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Laurie Farwell completely gets naked; Jasmine Putnam shows tits and shrubs <br /> <br /> Anti-Candy: Watching repeatedly nude
