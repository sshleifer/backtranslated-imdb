An old man, who is available to the plot, can live on a main road in Jamuna, one person killed by a forest and witnesses a witness. Follow the old people trying to digging for soft and following the belief that the police believe that he was not a figment of his imagination. However, every time the old man directs to the police where no dead body is found to be killed. Soft For Dijing has a short dialog that illustrates most of the film's scenes, an old man living in a house. During this movie I saw that I was afraid twice when the murdered child appeared before the unknown old man. I do not have to accept the rest of the picture; I found the film very slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, after watching this film the conclusion of the story and its decisions take too long. I think there is more to do with relationships, face-to-face, children and the elderly. At night alone, your own mind may become uncertain, there may be some bad situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
