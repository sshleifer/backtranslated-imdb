I was waiting for a while to see the Dreamgall ... it's going to give everything to reviews, nominations and media attention. And of course, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really illustrates back to the black music scene. However, the movie was going on, my whole family and my family had stayed away from us. The song began to sing, one after another. I seriously would like to say, just one more music number and it would also break with the RNT. <br /> <br /> I also rarely see any character development in a character; I just do not care what happened to them! Even when the character of Eddie Murphy died at a very high level of medicine, I knew that I should have been sad, but I could not feel any passion for that character only. Characters were given an intense background about their childhood and singing in the teenage, but there were not enough people to express themselves in drawing. Finally, the conflict was not enough for the care of the visitors, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminds me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rental (Ray and Chicago, in my opinion, wonderful movies). Overall, I think this film will suit someone who does not really care about the whole story, but will still enjoy two-hour entertaining and fun song performances.
