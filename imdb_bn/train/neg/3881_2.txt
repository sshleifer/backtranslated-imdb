A few days ago, I saw a documentary called the Best Fifty Movies of All Time, and here I heard the first great mailing man. Due to being the lover of Scolici films, I am making a point to find out some of the documentary films - not just the incredible Mailing Man. Actually, since the time the malling man first saw "bad movie" and I must say I am rather frustrated. Although it's a really bad movie, it's not enough to include it in this list. <br /> <br /> Before watching the documentary, I have enjoyed reading "Bad Movie" since the book "The Harry Medvedev's 50th Century Film". Despite the same title, the book was prolonged, documentary and documentary makers had never given credit to Medvedev with the idea before. From the book of Medvedev, I saw 35 films out of 50 but came for a collapse - the rest of the pictures are not available in VHS or DVD only. So, I thought I would try the film with the same name. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated with the extraordinary melting man because it contained some good elements of the film. First, the special effects of melting people were really cool and hateful. It is obvious that it is a professional (famous Rich Baker) who adds this look as realistic. However, I was more than the influence of some more cheesy and sugar - such as the floating plastic head and the way to the path of the monster on the way to the left of his left arm - you can see it "under the cover of his shades hidden"! For the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts shine inside the shirt's ring without shiny. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - as we see it closed. It's weird since Saturn is far away from it - it should not be seen in this way - it should be a big spine. However, the scene changes immediately and we are told that a surviving astronaut is in a hospital. What happened in the last scene and this one? Yes, it's somebody's guess. Well, soon, the survivor escapes and is involved in a killer rage as soon as his whole body melts. <br /> <br /> Now they think that like a molten poppy, you think you can find all the stops to find the government and stop it, right? Wrong A general is the only doctor involved to find him !! There is no army, no police - just a few doping doctors. Even after the body starts to stack up, doctors do not do any work to get any meaningful exploration or backup. <br /> <br /> Now, if the picture is stupid, you will not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cute old couple are driving late by night, they naturally stay in a garden to pick fruit and die. <br /> <br /> When a woman sees molten dirt, she closes the door to save herself. If you do not have the door behind the house, it will be smart! Instead of just running away from home, he is just waiting! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the man keeps his assistant and the yankees on top of him. Why? Give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated R flick. <br /> <br /> When the molten dad is at the end and there is a clear shot near the sheriff, the doctor can stop him - though now the monster killed about a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, you can see that the image is full of stupid plot elements. This is a very bad film. However, given the occasional special effects, I hope it was not a terrific film. Of course, it is good to laugh, but there is no place outside of bad place anywhere near Plan 9 and sometimes it should not include its worst movie list.
