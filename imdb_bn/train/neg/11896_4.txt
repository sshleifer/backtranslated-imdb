Before I started, I _love_ ed. Izzard I think one of the funny stand-up around today is. Perhaps this means I'm going with it very high expectations, but I did not find Eddie in this adney. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying hard to get AD. Everyone knows him as a completely irresistible comic, and we all love him for him. But in the circle, he seems more likely to be irrelevant than fun, and lost me in a complete place. He has covered most of the topics he has covered - even I think I recognized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you are buying a DVD, you will see a back view on Eddie's visits (interesting at places, but not very funny), and a French language version of its shows. Die-hards Eddie will enjoy watching in a different language, but the subtitle comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you've already got it or you're going to buy it whatever I like. If you are just passing through, kill glorious or buy dresses - you will not be disappointed. With the circle, you probably will.
