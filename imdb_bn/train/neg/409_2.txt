<br /> <br /> Finally Paul Wolheven killed the bomb. He himself became a joke. Again we have a movie that includes conversations of sexual intercourse between sex and violence, immorality, boring on women, and characters and wobble panes. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to it. Because they have no action in this film. It's all set pieces fudges. All actors give kind of forms of a Verhoeven film. Another word smacking on almost all level acting. The Starships fighter joined it because it was a world of mice that lived in characters. This scientist is acting the same way. Sorry Paul but soldier and scientist are not really made up of the same psychology. <br /> <br /> There was a big mistake in this plot that after one night ran away from evil deeds, Kevin Bacon came back to science again in the lab where we already had enough time to walk and talk about these animated manniquens (without Elizabeth Shue) Have spent enough. It's not how much the character can show in the external world. If they could be anywhere, then they could possibly find out how ??? Think of all the different things done with this concept in both story and character. So how to see this movie and how badly you did it and actually converted the entire project. <br /> <br /> Doco in more humiliating DVDs where everyone claims that VeroVane is some kind of Mad Genius. One of the two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> There is no note in this picture. The title is OK. <br /> <br /> Hole !!!
