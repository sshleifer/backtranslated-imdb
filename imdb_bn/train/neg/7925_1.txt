Want a great recipe for failure? Take a **** Y plot, add some weaker, completely unused characters, and known to be a horror movie than the most horrific special effects. Let stew for a week (time may cost the cost of making this trash). As a result, Corps Girders is a movie that is dangerous and very bad to take bad movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is fully exposed. My words could not express how painful it was. This is not one of the bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and have fun with. This is not 9 plans from outer space. It's a long, annoying, time-consuming waste. Corps Girders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. When I realize that people really spend time using this life, you can play it. But again, when you have poor points, poor story, everything in the poor, the last thing to criticize is to act. <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge, disgusting Turkish that you want to quickly come out of existence, afraid that a friend or loved one can see it alone. I could actually destroy every copy of this movie, so it would not pollute the mind of the aspiring filmmakers. Thanks, Ted V. Mikelas, for the sake of my new honor for any film. You've shown me really terrible, and why I just appreciate all the bad or annoying movies.
