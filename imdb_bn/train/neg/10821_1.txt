I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. This was the time when I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Jella Clark. It was a nice version and a lot like books. Years later, I was keeping eyes on this version and scared. William Heart is completely miscast as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt portrays him as the ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is the story about love and passion, but I can not see it in this version. No, return to the BBC version. An amazing time is guaranteed.
