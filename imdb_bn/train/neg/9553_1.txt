There is no vacancy in Australia directly from the DVD, there are no freedom fighters. Document hockey, acting, horror and the script was sucked !! Anyone who thinks it would be a good idea to make a picnic or follow John Bowdham's film, the War of the 80s, was something good because they had bad ideas !! Amanda Walsh looks good on cancer / love interest, on the other hand, Matt Latters was as good as any other major leader - about it. I will not recommend warmsmase: Check out the dead code, hacker or original wargames for anyone - both are better than this shit!
