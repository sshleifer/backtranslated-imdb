A killer, the rape of the cancer, was killed by an insane police on his latest murder scene. There was a religious gathering on the plan to revive the ants in the graveyard in the graveyard. Of course this works and he awakes off the guys off the penis and he returns to his old murder way with a new all zombie look. One of the two policemen who is going a little crazy about the city's dirt and has a drug problem, the case is back. Two members of the original religion also try to stop killing any other kind of dead body. They submitted the claim, but they were coming out of the grave a plastic baby doll that was used in the real resurrection. <br /> <br /> The actress is terrible and one of the police is also the same guy who encounters Voorant Van Gorek Gore series and he is just as boring as a boring police in this film. The other police struggled to find out its terrible lines only. Now I'm all for less budget movie but this picture is just terrible. I would fall asleep if not very easy on eye doctors and their nudity. Although some of Gore, it is nothing more than the animals kept in the stomach. On the other hand, the jambi makeup looks great and her legs have long penis which she repeatedly uses the funny kind of rape of her victim. A half-decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with a voice of chimpanzees is the most foolish thing I ever seen. It's just a plastic toy in the fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad. You expect the killer to fight a lot more than that. God knows how they have made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
