Freelancing, a truly capable director, like the Undertaker Alliance, the Undertaker alliance, who was ashamed, could not hold on to the first thought of this shame. He could help in attaining the real potential, especially with the attractive character driven by William Bishop. If the movie is standing, it is mostly of a zodiac (stressed by critics chips). The main problem is with direction, cheap budget, and poor script. The strength lies in a nice cast and an interesting general concept - the characters drawn in different aspects by the conflict. If there was a need that was sufficient enough to revise the script together with positive content, instead, instead of its broad, painful mess (try to determine the motivations and interpolation you can make). Also, a large budget can be combined with opposite positions and studio shots, and may also find locations in all very spontaneous LA extrajudicial areas. The real shame is that before the extraordinary death, Hayden, Taylor (before his tooth caps), Dahner, Reeves, James Millikan and William Bishop have an extraordinary cast of waste. Some films illustrate the importance of a more enlightened outlook than this neutral Western Western, which may be much more in the right hand.
