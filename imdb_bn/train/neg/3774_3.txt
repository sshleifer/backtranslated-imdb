This picture is old, and misses the mark. It's far away from the 82th Batman, trying to copy it. That female singer could not do what her name is, and we see why her film career died. Notice how the picture is shot at the box office, no one sees this movie on TV. My uncle and father were in the hopes of Batman, and the prints of the film were more like Cop Rock. Rent No 3/10
