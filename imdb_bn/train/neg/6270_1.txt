The way a woman working with a scientist puts the round metal ball in the face of a man, which, by way of course, changes his personality, but actually turns them mad, zombie-like killers. "Guinea pig" for the test is a desperate need for the weirdly tired, casual young women acting. This movie is awful, nasty, and surprisingly bad. There is no logic in this script. The following will really hurt you following what is happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen represents a huge scientific progress which does not show much more than the old eighty screen. And what's worse is that there is a doll with a faked haircut (like it is made by a lonely kids in the summer camp), like George's personal girlfriend / believer (the main "actress"). You will be under this doll's stupid, sophmoric utterings throughout the film. But wait ... you get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely naked scenes with girls with some times son. There has always been some kind of spiritual discovery in a boring soundtrack background. The actor is someone good. There are different levels of bad levels. Gore and "Horrible" aspects are particularly painstakingly illustrated. The film looks really like putting a teenager together. No restraint Henry Sala, named by the director but did not trade, created another film. I was almost bored in a coma watching this stupid, stupid, shit! And how the last bit? what happened? If you hide me secretly because I do not understand it for my life. I know I spent the time looking at this trunk which made a bore a nightmare at the beginning of my holiday!
