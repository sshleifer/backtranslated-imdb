True, this event is so popular that it just bugging the mind. This show is not funny, it's not tricky, it's not real, it's just a steamy pipe of steam bras. Let me start with letters. Characters are miraculously a one-dimensional melodrama with miracles, which are a fingerprint on a blackboard. Voice acting has been good. Then there are animations. My God, it hurts my eyes looking at me. Everything is very flat, very dots, very bright, and very candy coated. Then there is humor, or lack thereof. It's totally stupid! They only accept these B-grade jokes which are not even funny and then repeat their death. They drop me into some ridiculous humor that makes me sick. And finally, last and at least, music. It's just normal boring. It is composed on a baby computer and sounds like generated in any emotion. I wanted to score less than 1, what I really did This show needs to be seriously canceled. This is a show that I try to avoid like a plug. Whenever I heard the theme song I stopped the TV. You did not see this show then not See quality programming like Simpson or Phuturama.
