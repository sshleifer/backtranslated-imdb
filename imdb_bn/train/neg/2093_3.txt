If you like a sifai soap opera, this show is for you, I'm worried that it does not work for me and after seeing 3 episodes I can not see it again. It's annoying and slowly and 100,000 years ago for a timeline based show, if you build it based on the timeline of Blessore Galactic to reach the Earth, it's definitely the same thing that driving 100,000 year-old Shevy Vans driving the streets and people 100.000 years The old popular name brand LCD TV set. It is similar to those of the set as well as those of the show, it can not be ignored for many things today, I think they could work much better for these issues and think yes battlestar galactica was not something but similar but almost as bad. As the show left to rent it was not nearly as well as BSG and it is a poor pre-estimate ??
