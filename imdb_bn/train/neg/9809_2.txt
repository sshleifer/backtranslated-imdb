Some wonder why and Mrs. Murphy is not the next movie. Because this movie is completely destroyed. Disney did not have the right studio to run this picture. Mee Touchstone (Well, they own Disney, but it will be more mature). The film is very child-like, not a book series. All wrong for welding characters Characters do not even work in what way they book. And why did the money change? She is suddenly a daughter of the book! What was done to appeal to boys of these boys? Sheesh. Where was the peer, the gray cat? One of the most interesting characters in the book is absent from this smell. Rita Maine Brown was a good writer, but Disney was wrong to blow her work. Perhaps an animated feature film in Van Bluth's artwork van, suited for a better Mrs. Murphy film. Overall, I give it a 2, because at least Disney has made a film from a minimal book series. However, they were better they wanted. However, there are still my books for my entertainment.
