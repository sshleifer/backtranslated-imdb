I rented it in the 80's and honestly do not remember anything specific about the movie - this is the only movie that I saw the worst movie. This "it was not so bad, it was fun". It's not that it "was very important, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. It was not such a thing, "What was the hack?" Movie I can not remember the performance of the actors, but it was shot badly, the story was disconnected, and there was no specific style. When it was over, I was angry that I wasted time. <br /> <br /> I did not understand the reason for saying unfamiliar culture, style and / or story-story, but watching it was clear that those movies had some features. <br /> <br /> I did not really want to comment on this "piece" that anyone could see it from curiosity, but I was forced to warn someone who praised the movie to exclude this movie. .
