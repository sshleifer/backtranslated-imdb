I want to say this is a horror movie, only when you see this movie in the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I saw, I started to laugh, thinking myself, this man actually believes me that it is true? So I had to see it, and now it's watching a movie, but since now it's not a documentary, it's now a bad movie starring. So, both ways, it's quite bad. I do not actually end it. I was off it off. I am a NYC police officer, and feel that anyone trying to mislead me for thinking of this documentary for earning money from me and my colleagues for a terrible day. So, I took it a little private. Maybe I was blinded by that, and I think it personally is not as bad as it is. Everyone has their own views.
