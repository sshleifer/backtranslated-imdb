Every movie of the 30's is dated, but if you only see John Ford movies it would seem to be more than the date than the others. For example, the Grand Hotel is relatively modern melodrama With Ford, the ambition of somebody (Abbey, Jod) is always sold. Always emphasize on something bad. Always poorly made, weird and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a rather belberband device to provide the feeling. <br /> <br /> No Ford here does not thank me for Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the entire body described here lasts forever. Ford went to the beautiful movie. This is too bad but something to date is too much. It seems completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda is worn with a fake nose. And some from Illinois will not 'go' behind, or "Shonuff!"
