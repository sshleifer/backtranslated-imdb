I saw this movie only once, and that was enough for me. Although the film is very small, it seems nothing but a series of scenes and a series of spectacular violence. I wanted to see this movie because it played Joe Trilling of the second "James of the Demons"; And I wanted to see someone playing him normal. Unfortunately, the Toba Hooper script is rarely launched and Robert England influences the film and captures scenes and intrigues. Joe, I know where you are now; Hiding from this picture!
