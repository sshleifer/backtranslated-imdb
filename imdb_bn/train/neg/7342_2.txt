"The Man in the Attic" is a movie set in the 1910s. This is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, this is not a story that really needs to be told. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < They use words as "illegal emotion", "forbidden matter" and "unlimited joy". They also show a picture of Blue Patrick Harris (a little Dogi Hawser, MD) that holds the gun! <br /> <br /> This story was played by Crista, Anne Archer. He is unhappy with a gentleman who owns a business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward finish to fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" part of the movie's permission is that: The Christian husband learned about this matter and banned each other from seeing them again. So what they decide to do? Krista Edward end up staying in their attic How nice! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward gets very jealous. So on and so on <br /> <br /> "Man in the Attic" does not cover any new areas. This is a showtime original photo explaining why they are present in a few B-list actors and both are briefly in the buffer. <br /> <br />
