I always felt a good film should have a plot. This special movie was missing and I think it would be more effective with a plot. It started going forever that this incident was even worse; Finally I was worried about the end. However, I noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; It felt like four hours. There was not just a plot but the film also lacked a significant contradiction. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I say that it was "fast and furious" up until now. So, this review does not come from anyone who does not have to do anything without it. I actually hate most worker movies today; It's just that this film is all the way to the other side of the spectrum. Not really a lot in this movie. However, the scenery and costume were beautiful.
