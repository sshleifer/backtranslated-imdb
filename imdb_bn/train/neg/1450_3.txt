If anyone really wants to know Hitler, the WWI history will not read the WWII history. Find out what happened during the war, how do soldiers roam around the body? At the time of WWI, how many soldiers were insane from what they saw, at that time they called the name "ShellShock", after which it was known as tractatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of WWI, then you start to understand Hitler. You can understand how a person can become very sensitive to the death, because not only because of their evil but also the only way for them to deal with them is that they can deal apprehensively. <br /> <br /> This picture is unfortunately, so many others do not. Read some books on this topic and watch the movie "The Way of Glory", which is the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see a complete devaluation of movies, helplessness of the soldiers and human life, nothing more than bullet catcher. <br /> <br /> What does this movie miss, what does it really mean in Germany? A lost war, where millions of Germans lost their lives. Then after the war, a complete economic collapse came. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is unfortunately ignored. And there is another leak to just drop on the slope. Actually there is no real value, fiction is based on imaginary characters that can give you a better idea than Hitler. They just threw the name of Hitler, so it would sell more.
