My and my girlfriend watched the film as "Primitive Arpree", which was bought in East Tickets by a movie before it was opened in Denmark. We are sitting through the first hour or so and then we left! The point of the film was thought to represent only the era (and 54 clubs), but in the context of the character development it was such that no one was there and whose plot was a little bit. <br /> <br /> Seldom I was so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> While the music was good. So if you want to listen to some good music and want to fix the mood of the 70ies but I'm guessing it's OK. But trustworthy characters do not expect to get a plot. <br /> <br />
