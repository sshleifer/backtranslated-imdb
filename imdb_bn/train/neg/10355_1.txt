I have liked this book since my 5th grade teacher has been in our class many years ago. And I read it in my third and fifth grade classes in my last 18 years of education. A movie has been created perfectly, but I can not detect it. Well, my students and I were all very excited when we heard that Disney Madeleine L'Eagle's wonderful book came out on screen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie, I had the highest expectations. If the film is going on, I become more frustrated. They were botched it badly! I did not land so much with the favorite book-to-film adaption. I understand that movies can not be stern in a book, but do not have to change things for it! Most, if not all, the exit from the book was completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I had my opinion first and only my students talked about this movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost every single unit felt in the same way - Madeleine L'Agal was deluded by such a wonderful story that made it so efficiently! <br /> <br /> Why were they surprised, star mars saw the cribs from the movie? Why did Calvin's hair become red? Why was Mrs.'s proper name "Witch" outfit, which was so tricky game in her name? Basically, we all are surprised - why would it change almost every single detail? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed of how wonderful this book will be. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was a skeleton only during a wide sense of time. I'm going to write Peter Jackson and try to satisfy him to take the task!
