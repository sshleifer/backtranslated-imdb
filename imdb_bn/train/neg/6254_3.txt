A friend of mine was cast as a FEDS agent (I recall as part of a non-lecture). I brought it on DVD so I could see it. It was "attractive", but felt like a amateur film too. A well made amateur film, though. Written really annoying and weak It was probably fun and involved, but it was definitely not eligible for any kind of wide release. Maybe they will enjoy it in Omaha, but this California girl was annoyed and honest about getting involved with my friend. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker creates or makes a film, then he will really try to have a really interesting story line, and have good actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future, and hope they can improve their filmmaking.
