I saw this movie my rock climbing instructor, and we felt absolutely ridiculous than sorry. (For one, if Staln himself freely manages to fly, then there is no need to bear any gear, but I think those dangerous Caribbeans are "mountain mountains", so throw them into them). Those Lolotomized people who believe that Colorado sees something like Dolomite in Italy (where the film was portrayed), as well as the Hollywood Mughals are more ridiculous and you have molten smells.
