Flat, a thriller about a conniving woman who cheated all lovers supposed to promote her bank account. Nicole Kidman played fraudulent Tracy, Andy (Bill Pullman) is married. When an old school friend named Andy, known as Z. Hill (Alake Beldwin) resident becomes a surgeon, does not have much trouble for him. <br /> <br /> The script fails that it does not develop a committed commitment. Effective, tantalizing thriller, and character motivation, serious lack of background and development leaves to reach the whole show. A caster is not able to make Bill Polman's interest especially in their shallow letters, whose own unreasonable and unbelievable Andy is impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunate manager, Harold Baker, is trying to resurrect the impossible dead project, and it is unable to entertain from anyone. Unless the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you will not take care of it. <br /> <br /> At least in cinematography, Massachusetts looks good. Also star George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Joseph Somare <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - TV.
