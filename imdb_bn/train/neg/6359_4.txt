Woody Allen, when his best, has one of the sharpest pen around. She can make an intense observation and can wrap it around a punch line like someone else. However, when he can stench his movie ugly during his worst times. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have been open to stop this poking. Set up is one of his few more playful ideas. Four friends sit in a restaurant where life is a trick or drama. To settle this argument a person starts a story and debates the other two (a comic drama, another dramatic playwright) as the comedy or a tragedy. Then the two men continue the story and the movie that they knit out plays. Now, when I first heard about this picture, I had the burden that they would say the same story, the ritual (comedy or drama) looked at you and just changed. Now that's been interesting. However, the story is only a main element and few side components share. They are completely different stories with the difference of the main plot. The drama is so strictly inscribed and impressive that it can only serve as self-parody. If this is the point, it failed because the viewers of this content prevented from experiencing any emotional investment in any letter. Comedy is a story of such a success, but they are still small and fast. Will Forrele probably wanted to stand-in for Woody, but without the addition of Woody Stutter and hand-tie, he could play this character so credibly. Woody Woody is the best. If someone else tries, they are not playing a character, they are modeling a recognizable actor. Such things only attract visitors to the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films make me somewhat light on the theater, which I went in. I wish I could get my money back.
