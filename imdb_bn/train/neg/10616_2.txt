Terrible Just terrible The script is converched, the acting is painful, and the story drags along. It is without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and something else. It will not be so bad, but it's the film's director, writer and star, and so only self-glory. I did not care about myself developing romance between the main two letters and the end did not come a moment soon. It has two redeeming features. Firstly a lot of shots are really beautiful, especially in Paris, and rather rather good at black and white. Secondly, whether you are a fan of Tango, the music is too big, nice (where Sally starts singing). Check out this movie at your own risk, or if you need a weird smile. I'm sure it appeals to someone Statistically, it has.
