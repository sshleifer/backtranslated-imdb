I thought it was a New York-based movie wrong! It's a little British countryside settings. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: Wrong! This is a drama .... Well, until the last third, when the story becomes completely "abracadabrantesque", symbolic words for a French president's mandate. This means that even the motives of idiocy want to bring sincere feelings. <br /> <br /> What have I kept? Maybe, a good couple of actresses: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but redhead police women are somewhat invisible for me. The tall doctrine was surprised by his punch, and McDowell distributed fine acting as usual, all fine, soft and almost silent attitude. This gentleness puzzle me, because other fine artists or directors are repeating over the same pattern. In his case, whatever it is, whatever the movie, it is always the same character, its quality, the infinite variety of stories which are determined by his feelings. I still do not know how to set limits (or additions) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this movie is its touch of women and interesting different views. Women keep their own way of living, even if they are single. It teaches many tolerance and learning that how similar and unique reality can be felt in many ways as a human. Finally, the film is quite spectacular, but a final look at the great ultimate desire.
