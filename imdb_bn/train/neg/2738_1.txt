Trash / bad movies are not usually bad because I can enjoy them. It's so bad that I'm out of words to describe it - the "bad" at the bottom. There is an instruction at the beginning of the movie which tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, instructions and a dozen beer could not help me through the whole film. A tagliner compares this one to the KILLBILL which is certainly unknown and knowing us is an insult. Obviously that's right. There was a plan to lure you to buy this DVD of this tagline. <br /> <br /> If you're considering renting this rental, keep it down! If you're thinking of buying, do not worry! If you do not lucky this DVD, play it, throw in the early trash bin.
