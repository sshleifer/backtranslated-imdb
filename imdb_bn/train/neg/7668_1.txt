A moment to come forward, I knew we were for trouble! The premises are the best ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> You expect from more than the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. The line is delivered as a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reed but she was incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff try their return and pick up a lousy film in the stage. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the continuation of the whole movie was continuing. Animals were not bad, but they were not really good. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I want ninety minutes of my life. They can keep money, but give me time! What a waste
