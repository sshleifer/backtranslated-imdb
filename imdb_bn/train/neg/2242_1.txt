I grabbed this image at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I did not hear much about it; It was only a hard-faded thriller, shot at a very low budget digitally. I was hoping to catch the next Big Britain Flick. But I must say, I was very disappointed. Following is a "not a love song" followed by two criminals, who accidentally suffered a cat and mouse dead game after shooting and killing a young little girl, when the locals decided to take their decision and searched for them. <br /> <br /> The real problem is, this is another example of the style of substance in British film. Camera angles and edits are fully contained in the story's conclusions, such as the above performance and slower cool usage, which work just like expensive home video for overall content. The film is repeatedly tried to feel radioactive and radioactive, which is rather sunny and upwards (a kind, compulsory drug scene, and numerous, pointless camera zooms). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Efficient "release." But in the next film we actually care about the characters in this movie, I want to mark myself as a hunter and kill as soon as possible. Even if their opponents were awesome or fit, they did not get so bad, rather instead, only uninterrupted, collection of inward racist countries. Again, another offensive, overused cliche 'coming in advance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not a patch in the mountain budget, "dog soldiers" in the low budget last year. If the proper meaning goes wrong with the wrong people, then maybe the British movie may start again.
