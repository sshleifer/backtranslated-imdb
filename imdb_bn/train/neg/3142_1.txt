Once was a director named James. He came with our wonderful, exciting science-imagination such as terminator and aliens. These films were made of Stock Blockbuster and they looked a fantastic future in front of them, because the special effects produced by computers landed in the film industry. Terminator 2 showed that this new era has given us the glipps. <br /> <br /> ....... And then it happens ................ 1997 ...... .. countless awards .... ....... bad amount of money ............ lazy barrels of advertising ...... ...... Maximum profit margin ........ Titanic here Was there! <br /> <br /> I never had to jump over the bandwagon. In fact, I often took the opposite position from the majority to be justified. Titanic, however, I was just a single positive - the Kate Winslet was pretty fantastic! <br /> <br /> Fast - The conversation was something like Beverly Hills 90210, the more wood than the acting was my nephew tree house, the horror images were really funny (the man falls off the ship and hurts the propeller), historically false (even very There is more because I did not want to start), it was the terrible theme music (there was cheese with the bodyguard for it) and the uninterrupted love story is so tiring, Was wise and merciful that it humiliated the plight of all others involved (he was happy when he died and was frustrated). <br /> <br /> It was obviously clear from the word that this image is considered MTV observer, bubble chewing, chasing boy-by-car, teenage girls (Dikeprio considers something less heroic than a boy band's lively member) Designed to appeal to drag. A half-hour chick starved for boyfriends out for a three-year-old hope to be lucky! The worst part was that it was not stopped at that time. Hundreds of people were silent, the summer of the culture went to see the costly waste of celluloid because "it was expensive to make it" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they knew their movies." <br /> <br /> When the Titanic Academy entered the Awards board, the crown of glory came. The King James of Hollywood was a free moment for the deadly victims in the evening, on which three and a half hours were first. It looked at me as if he was praying for forgiveness for praying so that many people misrepresented the circumstances that could cause death. <br /> <br /> However, if people are too stupid and sensitive enough to buy such garbage, they are desirable. If they want to earn money, good luck in Hollywood, I would have done such a life, I would do it! <br /> <br /> Another silly, historically false / human interest such as "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
