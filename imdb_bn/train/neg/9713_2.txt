After almost a year running on Denmark television, I saw the syndicate case for the first time. When it comes to TV, it almost sinks about 4 or 5 other American offenses Broadcasted at roughly the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I died. There was a pain behind self-righteous face and low quality actor with moral. A group of investigators were given so much money to solve the murder for 10-20-30 years or even 60 years, that the whole meaning seems so unlikely. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> May It is coupled with "personal" problems and the connection between the searchers, which is time to fully take the show. <br /> <br /> I can give it a 2-star rating because of the lyrics which is really the only reason to see it ... which of course you will not do, because the reason for this crawl look crippled.
