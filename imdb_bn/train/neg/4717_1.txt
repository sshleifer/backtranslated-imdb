And how it grew into it astounded me. The main character is a humiliating show that is not least fun at all. I can not stand all the characters. She offers a dirty ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon in the last 10 years, no joke. The storyline line is both written and executed both bad. Jokes are as bad as Disney's Sweet Life of Jack and Codey. I could not dislike this show, it is terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. Headline, even worse. <br /> <br /> It's a 15-year-old show that is based on the character itself, and they think that they are hot stuff when they are really proud and lack creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go away and fast away!
