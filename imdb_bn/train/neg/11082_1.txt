I know it was a Power Rangers hostage and catered to the 7 year old but really why were they serious with this movie? If they are going to write a plot with the Crions, at least it has decided to fool it. It's like you're so kind. We have a special family that is full of clipped characters (father war criminal who lost his wife and called himself Loll), trying hard to fill the air-born children's stereotype but fail with terrible acting and ridiculously terrible side-effects no movie But to fill the camera space. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because I do not have a room in the budget for the Koreagraphists, so they come up with this American Gladiator type setting. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Ratings because they try to treat it seriously.
