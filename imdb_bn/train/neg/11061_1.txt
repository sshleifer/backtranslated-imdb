Curiosity led me to this "Masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most annoying thing about this movie is that it is not so annoying. Only due to their familiarity, this filmmaker Jeffrey Dahmer set out to look towards the human. Are you kidding me The person gave the new meaning "finger lilac"! And I had trouble following the story with all flashbacks and flash-forwarders. All Jeremy Rainer's performance was not very bad at all. You call him "SAAT" You can catch him, where he is an unhappy former police. However, I will rate this as 1/10. Because of the performance of Rainer, it got only 1. There are so many books and TV documentaries that do better to cover Dahamer's crimes. Avoid this one.
