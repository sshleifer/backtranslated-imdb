Susan Seddelman seems to have done a decent career with some of the top true credits under his belt. I am glad of this actor who seems to have bounced back from this film. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I saw good acting in high school dramas in Smithrans. The plot like this involves young Susan Barman, who is ambitious for the music world to make it and just want to do something to get there. He even rejected the heartfelt progress of a young artist who is living in Eastern Regions of East Bengal east of Brad Rijen. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn contributed to the worst performance of the film, in fact one of the worst performers I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I would say that Seldom's eyes for the camera are good for holding East Village locations where most of the film was shot. But his work with his live actor did not measure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can sit. I'll be in the Bing Crosby.
