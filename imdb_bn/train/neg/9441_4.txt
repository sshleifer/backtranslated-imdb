Was this movie banned in England? Why? Tom Savini, George Romero, Dario Agento, Lucio Phulasi and others have done a lot of bad things and have done so much ... <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the awesome elements of the Greatest of the 70's, or the worst of the 80's. . Movies. Good looking girls (who can not work to save their lives), a terrible thunderstorm with storm storms, Skyy, crazy brothers roaming around family property, and really good finishes in the end. . But banned? Seriously. When the English Parliament banned this movie, the Italians probably laughed their joint asses, which were really bits and chasing. <br /> <br /> There was a total of two minutes screen time for Violence and Gore. Which was widely underdone). Although nudity was there but there was no sexuality to talk to sex, perhaps. But there is nothing to be banned. <br /> <br /> If I want to see what the filmmakers can do if they do not have the right budget to work. It stands, the film is entertaining, but the lack of photo and the sound quality is far from the end. <br /> <br /> forbidden ... what fun ...
