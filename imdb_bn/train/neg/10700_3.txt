The film is about the relationship between Sir Christopher Strong (played by Member of Parliament - Colin Clive) and the character of Catherine Hepburn's actress Amelia Earhart. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband but when he met the strange but interesting Hepburn, he "could not help himself" and they fall in love. You can say, because they look far apart in space and how painful their inappropriate love is. To be honest, this is a horrible date and efficiently impossible movie. A part of the problem is that in pre-code days, adultery glamoring films were very common. Plus, even if you accept this morally suspect thing, the complete happiness of dialogue makes it sound like the 19th century romance novel ... and it's really bad. Sticky and difficult to choose characters (after all, Clive's wife was a beautiful lady and nobody did any harm) It's a great time to waste The only interesting aspect of this movie is wearing the clothes of the clothing clothing of Hoppern wearing the first! You will believe it will see it - and he seems to be one of Bugulos (a vague, but appropriate reference).
