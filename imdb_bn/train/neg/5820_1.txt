This picture is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. I was studying French at the college and thus realized all the conversations, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to surrender to a character described in the movie. Cast is just a professional actor and I'm not a professional director or author. <br /> <br /> Although I've rated 1 out of 10, it probably does not qualify for a poor rating. It is a vain attempt to reduce the present overall rating of 7.3 accurately. Perhaps 4.3 is a more accurate rating because the film is a real non-event 100 minutes or longer that you will never get back. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I am certain that some college students busting their browns making a film twice good and half length. But if you want to join the bandwagon that you think is moving around IMDB, you can also give 10 "lost in translation" as well.
