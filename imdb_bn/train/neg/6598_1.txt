This "film" is a deception. No, wait - a hatred. No, WAIT - without any doubt that the actor has ever acted and created favorite images established by other actors. Instead of Peter Sellers, "Inspector Clausau" with Alan Arkin (!) was ridiculous and sacrosanct, but brave to "remake" Stan Lorel and Oliver Hardy is even seated and in return for money. <br /> <br /> Lorel and Mr Hardee died from 1957 and 1965 respectively. Why would anyone even begin to imagine that the appropriate updates for London and PHP were outside of the personal perspective of Bronze Pinto and the Gilbert Sartain? I totally expected to be scared and embarrassed and I was certainly not disappointed. Everybody involved in this kind of humorous, disgraceful, disrespectful should have everything related to the creation of Hollywood and film and be black. Avoid all costs in this movie - you've been completely cautious.
