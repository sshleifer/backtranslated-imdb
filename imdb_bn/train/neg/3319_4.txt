I was surprised when I saw this picture. I heard it is the best example of the novel. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> This adaptation of any real Jane Austen fan is a mystery in my eyes. Scholars have decided to ride the comedic bits which are often embarrassing, but also destroy this feeling of time. For Cast: Gwynth Paltrow, rather than a gradually creating heroine (but might be a suspect in a 'hot' American star role), Tony Colette has made a mistake, and poor Ian McGregor seems ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really could not say anything good about this movie. I rarely think that it is not rated, but if you want my suggestion, instead of watching the production of the TV production Kate Buckinsle - believe me, it is much more preferred than the ocean trash.
