I was caught myself in this movie, at least at the beginning, and giving credit to any of these movies is Lacey Chabbert, he was nice !! But where it ends. I think it's great to find the killer, and when I'm able to bump a movie completely I like it, but I felt and lie, they all lead you in one direction and suddenly they Finally, decided to move from a completely different direction, they did not give any injuries to it, that is very bad writing and planner Not confused, do not worry, no one so much! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie that if they were trapped in your plot of leadership, they would have been better, they did not even answer, why Jane (Maria) had set fire to the professor's house. <br /> <br /> It's a big misery as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie.
