Tell the truth I'm stun a bit to see all these positive reviews by many people, that's the main reason why I decide to see this movie basically. And after seeing it, I was really frustrated, and comes from this man that loves this movie in love. <br /> <br /> I was totally surprised at this movie - it's nudity for a child like a movie, and it involves cursing and swearing of all the little boys. I am not religious at all, but it has gone too far in my account. Sinapassis: The story of two people has been sent to the big brother's program for their helpless behavior. There they meet a child with sexual tension and the other is a medieval horror. <br /> <br /> Only this name is not related to the story itself. They are not being a role model and do something else to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very expected (though expected) and humor is lame. And we have not seen the same characters (played by Mac Lovin) in many other movies (such as the Sasquatch gang?). I think I smile three times and almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the direction, what do you expect? This same guy who brought us a Hot Heart American Summer, and also sold the film. But in anyway he was driven to bring some stars to attract his horror movie. <br /> <br /> However, I did not feel very rough, but it was completely lost. Only nude scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I can not see any point to why someone should recommend this. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two Topless Scenes. <br /> <br /> Interesting, horror stories, nudity, and kids do not get together. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (grade: f)
