To use the word "filmmaker", "movie" or "movie" I will start asking forgers to movie makers everywhere, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seems a bit rigid. <br /> <<br /> Writing: Merciful. <br /> <br /> Instructions: Kindly <br /> <br /> acting: unfortunate <br /> <br /> Cinematography: Very inadequate for the words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills involved in this atrocity: None. <br /> <br /> This waste can only be called cinema. The majority of family home cinema comes around earning that difference than revenge quest. No, only 10 car pill-ups caught in this video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the plot in this review, because there are many holes at one time. Let's just say it's worse than the rest of the movie. They will be given credit for acting one-dimensional calls. Beginning from what's in it, it's irrational, and makes worse by terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this torture, apart from the plot, should be the effect ... or rather its annoying lack. There was no place for guns, no flashpets, and there were some sound effects whether the stock was "gun" or they were generated by mouth (yes, you read the correct). The film-maker was actually a "shh" sound record for the elevator door record; I guess he felt their sound more future. After all this, it is supposed to be set in 2031. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Than was worse than that. The sound effects remain standing outside the rest of the sheep's sheep like a screwed soundtrack, and they are just as weird. Check out this picture: Bad guy enters an office building in search of his prey. A lady started to fear. He raised his gun (a uzi), and he shakes. We hear a sound that is not clearly wizards. The woman escapes from the camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (it seems to be hit by a paintball), and she is flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Remember that my description is too much justice for the inability of the actual order. <br /> <br /> Another continuation, which is almost - but not much, makes the movie fun enough to see it, it's stairs. The bad guy protects the good man and the woman with the stairs, pushing his plastic wires all the way. You can duck; There is bad effect everywhere. <br /> <br /> I think Allen's bodyguard can not be locked for breaking the train's ruins, but he followed all the ways to achieve it and release it. . If there is a trial, then there should be some activities there with his name. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this cyclone of industrial wastes, then I will strongly advise - be sure to see the almost verb of Bludrunner for the whole scene and the AM radio which is doubled like walkie-talkie. Try not to make the plot very difficult to focus; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
