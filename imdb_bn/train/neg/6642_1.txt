The movie starts with a simple funeral ... and it insists so strongly in this general funeral that I lost interest in 5 minutes and started excluding the scenes. It seems to me that this film is damaged due to permanent marijuana trance trap, nothing else except death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark kids from SouthPark, I want a movie that will take me in an interesting story within 10 minutes, I will not sit and I will not take 10 minutes to prepare for the funeral. My grandmother was fascinated by the last year's funeral Was, perhaps, he could have enjoyed this "movie".
