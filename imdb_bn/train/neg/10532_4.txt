Madison is not too bad? - If you are simple, irrational, "family-friendly" rental and, more importantly, if you do not know enough about unlimited hydroplane racing. If you like me, you grew up with sports and your heroes were named Musson, Munshi, Cantrell, Slovak etc., ready to be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have long commented on the nature of the film formula and its tendency to use every hackneyed sports clinic in the book. I do not need to repeat what I said. What I felt was sadly absent, "glory year" (which many already debated) had no idea of ​​the real tension of endless pirates. Yes, it was surprising to see that old classic boats must roar up to six, though it was clear that recovered versions (closed to volunteers at Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through low speed scenes. But where was the word? Most of the adventures of the old Hydroses were the six-alison or the heart-crunching of the Rolls-Marlin aircraft engines, which were never harmful to their legendary RPM by their designers, hit the first line in front of you. If you do not hear it, you feel it. Real hydraulic buffs know what I'm just about. Madison has no one. Instead, every racing scene is considered to be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> Then there are close shots of the drivers, smoothly and comfortable to roam cockpits, they were comfortable in the recent luxurious limousines, in some cases spent laughing at times when they wondered how best to prevent the hero from the poor home-town. Or, a special ridiculous shot, takes Jack Lloyd to take the time to give a "Rocky" salute to a bridge over a bridge. In fact, some unlimited drivers wore hazardous drivers to reduce the boats running in rock solid water at 150 feet mph. <br /> <br /> A critic told it properly, "sport is better than that." <br /> <br /> Finally, another user's acrononomics has been brought, I'll add one: Seattle's established shot shows the Kingdom and Safeco fields . Did not exist in 1971
