First off ... I do not think I'm a Uwe Bowler because I never thought I had seen one of her films but this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (which is about this serial killer name) I stopped joining the hate club . This film does not give any idea ... the plot is a joke and although obviously the ball strives to attract the attention of this people, 90% of this film is merely a general semen. You can add a movie like this: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded killer watches clips of victims of TV on TV. It is open to pilot firm's real life footage and the film is ridiculous for "a statement about humanity" and a payala address. Because there is no message in this movie and it is the worst part of the oppression. You have reason to hate movies already. <br /> <br /> 2. Death with death by death, which is printed on the screen after the death of the movie, so every obstacle gets it. <br /> <br /> 3 Police show civil, harmful videos of animals, children and women starving to death and sickle, crying in silly nightmares and their whiskey because seeds are so bad and bad. Actually, though the movie tries to include any emotion, it takes a dive every time ... <br /> 4. The police sow seeds in her house, work stupidly and get lost in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you just see something without flashlight. Seed is a super killer who acts like a fool to kill all the police at once and all the police ... except those who force him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed in the chair and we can see his long-standing power as anything else in this "movie" ... he will not die and we remind the first indication that if he had lived 3 electric jolts then he should be freed. Imagine ... they just buried the living to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. He comes out of his grave, kills everyone in another slashing area and then searches for the chief police to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman finally blows her brain with a fun one point for her fun and shock quality. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed police picked up the family, took her to her house, threatened to kill her wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the police shot him in the head considering what he told him. (The boys are hard pressed because they do not even wear their masks in prison, but do not say any words ... do not remember that the film is just like any dialogue) <br /> <br /> 9. Bull goes to the end of an unselfish shock where the seeds allow the girl to clap her rhyme with her dead father. 3. <br /> <br /> This ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, without any unfamiliar story that has been burnt down as a child without a background. <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is based only on a few original scenes and their shock quality. I do not remember this kind of an emotional or entertaining film. It looks like August Underground ... It feels good to me, some people will enjoy this brainless whiff. But it's really hard to stand up, considering the first pseudo-message and camera-action, influence and even acting, the film is well-made, very good for the deluge of celluloid. <br /> <br /> How do thousands of talented directors make money for making "movies" while working in a shoe budget ?? "Seed" is not just a comedy, it is a living proof that the free market is faulty ... Lucky Uwe, the German taxpayer, is paying for the waiver of this huge loss.
