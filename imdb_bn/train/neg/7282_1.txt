National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. In the late seventies of the end of the decade of the studio, Hippies chose seventeen years of Smug and Sassy Coke-Head (when the comedy was immensely protected with nude babes) but depending on your date of birth, everyone agreed that in the early 80's, the medieval No resident of any starving humor was killed by drugs, and this film is like a sacrifice And the spin-off of individual records are increasingly fearful of further holes cast holes. Outside of a pretty illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this single depressing stinkbug If you make it through a boring opening segment, 'Growing MySail', it is expected that things will be better, tough luck - they do not. The idea that a woman was brutally raped with a stick of butter was the idea that the virgin should have the head of gold on her head on a dog's vessel. If there is a lack of guitar skills, these disgusting negative negative aspects, grotesque ideas and rugged rugged ruggedness may serve some purpose.
