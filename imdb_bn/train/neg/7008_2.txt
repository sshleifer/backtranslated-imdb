Annie Potts is the only brightness of this truly silly film. Mark Hamill congratulated a teenager who is really upset that someone and his classmates have stolen the cartette (perhaps the rowdy looking car in a movie), and went to Las Vegas to track Anne <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is bad for Hamill that he does not read anything from him. Danny Bonaduce also makes a fool camio.
