This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Mess completely! Apart from a few chocolate and one or two scenes of Gore, this film is a waste of time all the time. Call it "Campi" and even do not cut it. "Campi" means this movie which is not fun. You thought of the first half of the movie "It's got better, okay?". Absolutely, it ends up ultimately when the "brothers / sisters" team is explained and what they want but then you rarely take care because you are spending the whole half of the film exactly how Mr. Honority and Mrs. Pakulah are stuck in this bad picture For this, someone badly wants to tidy up. <br /> <br />
