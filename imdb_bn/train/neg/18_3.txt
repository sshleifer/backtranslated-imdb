It was an art film that was made in 1969 or 1972 (called National Film Conservation Foundation, 1969 and IMDB 1972). Despite the exact date, the film appears to be very indicative of the general time period - some camera-work and pop art styling that is pure in the late 60's in the early 60's. <br /> <br /> Three simple images that are distorted using various weird camera tricks. This distorted image is accompanied by music and has absolutely no dialogue or any sort of plot. It's obviously often like a form like the performance industry, and like the most performance industry, it has become attractive initially but quickly tedious. For the film to be more explicit, it will not appeal total fork and any person, but perhaps those who have created movies, their families and friends, and perhaps some people too understand the hip and "with it" us.
