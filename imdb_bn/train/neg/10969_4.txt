Perhaps I have become old or do not know what the electron is like in the current publication ... but the electra which I read is much more helpful and always seems to be a plan. He was generally used by others to do his dirty work and was often involved in double cross. Just when you feel that it has found all your things, it will pull up your eyes and get its way. <br /> <br /> This film was fairly poor in dialogue, acting was not particularly believable, and there was action spot. I'm really looking for something more like Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The hand was not terrible enough, and there was no electra ... enough pulse. She loves to hate the girl ... but in this story, I have not taken care of just by any means.
