Good movies can not be made only on a beautiful garden and on a hill. It is surprising to see that it won two prizes. Extremely overrated. I first saw such a movie from China, visually stunning but with a good ten years ago as well, and I'm sure there are still more coming. It's not one of them, I'm afraid.
