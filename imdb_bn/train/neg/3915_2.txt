This movie is not only written and directed to be fake, but it is only disrespectful. A beautiful novel is terribly wrong presented in this movie. Most of the changes have been made in the story, probably to streamline the timeline. But what results easily confusing? Actually, the actress can not overcome the script, which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, everyone who does not convert to English does not work, when everyone refers to STBiben as Esteban. Horrible Please read the superb novel in Spanish. Do not see this image. It could be a wonderful experience to destroy for you.
