I agree with other user comments that the two main roles have been played well, that person playing Gary Gilmour and the role of Giovanni. Very bad stories were so annoying. I did not know about the story before I knew something about Gary Gilmore, so I do not know what I can expect. I thought it would be something like a dead man walking or chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole movie is just talking and talking about their mother and father. The only cool scene was the flashback where the father lost his mood. I was interested only that this got from borefest.
