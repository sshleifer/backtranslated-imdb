The de-list is a terrible film with Canadian actors who think of the spontaneity of this matter, keeping an eye on their cameras that their performance is too much melodramatic and quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> This picture is badly written, badly edited, and badly operated. It's confused, unconscious and bizarre - but not a good way. McDowell did a great job with his work, but his only work in this movie - he really worked with a bad story and script. <br /> <br /> I still can not see Van Pelusk credibly, even sub-letters like Aisen (his nasal, voice of voice) are certain that we have many things in Toronto instead of a band in Africa. <br /> <br /> What did the director see that 'animal' does not seem to be a jazz dancer in a wedding? The battle between the lightning orange victory of 'Magic' (light! Lack of lack of light) between the lightning and blue ball blue bolts, without any dancer, is entirely the result of the bad actor completely with the evolutionary special effects. Was not the director of the set or editing room for this disaster film (not good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from others' mistakes ... do not waste your time with this time, I'm sorry to be like you. There is nothing I can say about this waste of celluloid.
