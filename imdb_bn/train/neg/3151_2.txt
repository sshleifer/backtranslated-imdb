"Bride to make you you" is another sign that goes out of the Hollywood concept. This picture turned out to be a former police officer writer about Charlie Hudson. Charlie's fianc√© goes outside the city when she stops all of the wedding plans. He spends a weekend at a fancy hotel and meets Anna teacher with a teacher, who happens soon after he is married. The two became fast friends and together plan their separate marriage plans. When the plot is boring, Charlie loves Anna and wants to choose a safe life or Charlie. This movie made any romantic comedy and is waiting for the end of the movie so you can do anything else. Michael Vertan and Natasha Henestriz actually gave medieval performance, which only made this film more frequent for watching the clock.
