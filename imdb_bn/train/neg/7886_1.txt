There is nothing against my religious film. Religious people need something to see on Saturday night, I guess. But writing in the DVD box does not indicate this information to the potential audience, it really stops me. It is not cool to stop religious propaganda as entertainment, bro. <br /> <br /> Even if I was a religious person, I would have to agree with most other posters here, this movie was abusive. Bad guided, bad work, badly edited, and the attempt at a soundtrack was ridiculous. The fake pronunciation was terrible, the letters were mainly stereotype, and the continuity was out of the window. The only reason we sat down during this waste was because it was too late to see another movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not, avoid at all costs. Do not be deceived by writing the box.
