I have seen this movie many times, (and recently read the movie based on the movie), and every time I see it, I just want to silence the four of them. The character of Tom Hanke is out of gaming sessions with his D & D (Ops M & M) personality ("Oh, he's acting in character only.") And after three months of therapy, let's just destroy all that and devour his delusion! People give RPG a bad name. <br /> <br /> Music music by 'love ballad' and 'a cat on cats' and 'if we are very boring then stop us'. Tooth teeth are enough to set your teeth!
