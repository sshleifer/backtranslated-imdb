Being seen in the first ten episodes, I would say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> The most annoying, event in Canada was shot. I know it's cheap, but they were supposed to shoot it in California, so we could have a view in the desert. That movie has more truth. The first scene where they are outside of the other world, in the mountains, it looks very cold where it is cold. That does not seem too Egyptian. What was such a good job in the movie that you thought you were in ancient Egypt? Here in the Canadian Forest, they seem to be running around Alien in the war, And it is so tall that unexpectedly, on other planets, fall comes alongside. Outside Vancouver, you can see the ground on forest like forests. It just makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not a Kurt Russell. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to make a little copy of the performance of Russels, but he is not just calm as Russell. And an actor like Russell is not good either. Russell's way to play Well, well, he was a lot more folk. Anderson O Blue, very soft way. I liked it that the Russell version did not give *** *** and there was no problem in the bomb blast until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks really works well if he wins Jackson from Jackson Spider. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tilak is really annoying character. He is Jaffa. No jafa Just Jafa Aaaarrgh !! A charitable character is seen in a former bodyguard, pilot and yet another episode. Telek spoke and acted like a robot. I saw good acting from Gene Cloud Van Dam. <br /> <br /> And the character of Tilak and Ray and the movie they have saved can say in English that the incredible dumb suddenly. Why was Elien so scary in this movie that he was an ancient language and was a true monster. <br /> <br /> For the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effect of the actual show is done badly and looks cheaper. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is very clear that they walk around a soundstation with a badly created painting in the background. It's objectionable to the audience that they look so cheap. Especially when they can make it in front of a bluetooth screen with CGI backgrounds. <br /> <br /> X-Files had a great effect during their first episode promotion in 1993. It was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they did not have a budget of two million dollars per episode, which seemed to be SG-1. They have to spend all the money on catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly annoying and unmatched shows, which shot Hollywood shows with a big budget, good authors and even better characters, if it could be great.
