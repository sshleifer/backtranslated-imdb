Imagine you are a high school boy, behind your girlfriend with dark, unknown theater. How bad would the movie be, so that you were forced to leave the theater before the end? This movie is that bad. Really Films are often bad that they are good; This movie is beyond the phase of Bad-Nasser. It's painful bad. Fearful, horrific, anti-crime humanity is bad.
