This film portrays Ruth as an impressive figure of sports with hard drinks, gambling, extra baseball. Babe Ruth's first life was quite interesting and the aims and objectives of these films were omitted. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and it was a well known relationship, good or bad, it should have been covered better than it was. Her life was the worst. He was an American hero, an icon that shapes many baseball greats to his later life. I think I'm justified in the memory of a big baseball player that completely disregarded this movie. The makers of this photo are embarrassed to capitalize on his guilt and his greatness.
