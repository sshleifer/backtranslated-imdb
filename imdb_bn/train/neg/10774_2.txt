What a stinkeroo this would be !!! Once upon a time, in his career, Linda Darnell was my darling - not very big as an actress, but very nice and beautiful (especially in movies such as "Zorro Mark" and "Blood and Sand") but when I saw this monstrosity, Her golden day memories fade quickly. The story is incredible and adventurous, acting second rate, supporting cast is in vain. Compared to Tab Hunter, I can not think of any more amazing performance by somebody, and they can be Donald Gray's most boring leading person. It has been added, there was terrible photography (and I'm just not talking about the color!), It must be shuddered whenever it is shown.
