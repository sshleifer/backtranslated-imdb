The book changed my life seriously. But this movie was a disappointment of frustration. Acting, direction, cinematography, and storyline were all awesome. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I told countless people about the book, but now I will tell them all that they will not see the film! I did not expect the plot to follow the book properly, but they dropped many important elements of the book. The film tries, but fails to provide a strong and inspirational message and only destroys the central theme of the prophecy. While setting myself up to not be able to read books, I saw Celestine's prophecy as a bunch of Bobby Bobby. I was completely frustrated with Redfield for the way this movie turned out.
