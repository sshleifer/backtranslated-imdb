This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was a strange thing! I can not put enough pressure! Acting, directions, stories, characters and everything about it was bad! It was very corny and clich√©d. Do not fool by the cover, or nothing to smile on the tag line "The Texas Massacre". "Are you kidding me? It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the film is good till Brendan, okay, now stop it." What I got from the movie is ugly A bunch of boring and unfamiliar people goes to a cabin in the middle of the jungle, and a nursery rhythm that sings their unoriginal and fake ways to kill. <br /> <br /> This movie is my time and money worthless It was your money and time will be lost! I'm moving fast through most movies because it was very terrible, I just want to see how every bad actor died, and it was still not worth it! This serious movie is always serious! Rating: One does not deserve.
