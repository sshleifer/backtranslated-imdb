Do not say to me that I can enjoy a bad Italian horror film or jungle exploitation of the 1970s on Flickr. Seriously <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some unknown western, of course, established a resort somewhere in the jungle. I do not think it happened where ... It is so sad ... basically, people come to resort to watching this native tribe and its' shows, but eventually they go to the 'God of the Magician' a rampage, holiday vacationers and some tribes As killed. Looks like that, yes? Well, you do not get the hope. Ultimately, there is minimal violence, special effects are so bad that it runs like a kindergarten class and laughs the story of love. <br /> <br /> It is believed that in a few scenes a camera is thrown into a water under a pool of severe and thrown into the water and like a toy stalks, a darts and that the gate is supposed to be attacked. I'm not kidding With another wonderfully built special effect, a matchbox van is targeted by incredibly drowned plastic gates, which are five times more than the size of the van. (A few minutes ago, he was just big enough to eat a man, but now he's drowning a full-size cargo van ...) It's really unfortunate. The only other membrane I could think of was that the impact was so bad, I was drawn from the story of Bruno Matei's best work, "Rats," the plastic rats of the conveyor belt and those who are not afraid. <Br> <br /> I usually wanted to say something Sergio Martino wanted to see firmly but it is certainly a necessary pass. Time wasted and definitely no shame is worth buying for $ 15 + sticker price. This one is a shAME <br /> <br /> 10 kids 2,.
