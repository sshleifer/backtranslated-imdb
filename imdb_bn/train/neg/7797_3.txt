This is one of my worst movies, but I want to say that I have heard some criticism which is unwanted. <br /> <br /> As far as the technique of making pure film goes, this directive is capable. He came back by limited budget and VHS camera, but actual performance, camera angle, camera movement and scene staging is quite professional. The "guide" where I saw many movies was very bad. At least the scene flows in a way that is not confusing and here and there are some cute shots. Also, Forest Scenery was a decent environment. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and as long as the technicolines go well, the better. As far as artistic talent, there is no one. The scene where the camera closes so that we can urinate a man in the jungle for 15 seconds, which illustrates the artistic style of the whole film. This pure trash ... total trash. <br /> <br /> The Gori is suitable for a photo of this budget. It's probably fake, but there's a lot of it, and it's too lazy. <br /> <br /> I deliberately saw the American version with camping dubbing. It was a good idea (and this is the only thing that allowed me to make it through film) ... Unfortunately, it's gone, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for the quality of the camp. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than it and puts it in a unique section of its kind.
