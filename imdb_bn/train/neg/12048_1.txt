I went out about 6 movies about my whole life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not know I'm sitting for an hour. I must have a coma on that night. When I came out 8 years ago I saw it in the theater. I could not even remember the name, but I knew Penelope Anne Miller played it. This is my loss while commenting on my time today. Yech! Vomit! To vomit!
