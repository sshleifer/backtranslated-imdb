This is probably the worst movie I ever seen. It's a hell of a fireplace that's bad enough, they've hooked it to issues of football violence, it's 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premiere of this film before, but I began to see, but the writers agreed that Elias Wood's character was able to introduce Mate, enough to open it. <br /> <br /> But the mistake is wrong after the picture. In the middle of the movie you became more difficult than ever before. <br /> <br /> Delete some things: Before playing Huligansara, they do not flip their own pub off of the mill matches in the game; They did not set out to kill each other; They do not only wear the Stone Island (and the crowd, others, hooligans or not). They are not sure, while accepting the new firm's objections, their rival companies get and close the area for mash. And I want to meet Hul, who used to feed grass on grass in a competing farm to the top of his farm. (Even if someone exists then I can dismiss what I said about killing each other). <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I do not see a movie about this yet, which have some fantasy whims, but this is a par with strong for clermessness. <br /> <br /> I found it terrible that the wooden American Nemesis is morally condemned for a cocaine user by its character, while it is part and parcel of British thug scene. The film steers any firm that is firmly in the woods by choosing not to challenge the morality and using coke. <br /> <br /> I could go, but I made my point. For the plot, it's very strange, and I'm sure if I could not make the whole movie a bit embarrassing and made more and more, then I could have guessed what was going to happen as soon as possible. And I believe, I was in front. <br /> <br /> This movie got different ideas with the goal of men, it is hoped that women will enjoy injection of mental problems raised. <br /> <br /> I'm fine, then the creator has failed completely. It is too unrealistic for anyone to know about this scene, and I can not believe that the women who are looking for emoticon films will be dissatisfied with a character given by their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Maybe the scenes of war are good dances and illustrations, but I have been very slowly influenced by the verb-verb verb, it is certainly encouraging enough when it comes to fighting like a war. <br /> <br /> There is something funny, if the unreal moment. I got a smile to go to school at school. But some gentle sunny moments are made to look for two hours of fully made drones. <br /> <br /> If you do not avoid being plugged in as a British, I do not know if the wrong idea of ​​the scene is not extended. If you are American, you can enjoy it, it adheres to the market clearly. But no conspiracy is intense, anticipated and ultimately can not be rejected at the top.
