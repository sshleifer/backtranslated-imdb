I am seeing this move outside the Bratian, sure that this movie will be an entertainment watch, but it is painful for anyone from the UK to have its flaws. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film Elijah Wood got a tube stop at the bank station, which has been trashed. He tells his sister what he is meeting, "what happened here" and he answered "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town .. They are part of town, they will not go there! And if Tottenham fans want to fight the last place on Earth with other fans, they will make it bank stations where there are probably more security cameras anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are many similar errors but the biggest failure for me is the actor who is the main boxer. He obviously decided that it was not appropriate to talk to the East End Actor, and instead Dick Van Dyke chose the Style Muck - which my eyes were bloody. It wanted to talk to fans of West Ham, but the rest of the gang used to say everything. This error makes him incredible in the role and really damages the film.
