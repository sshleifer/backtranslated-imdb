This film was a critical and box-office Fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that was later turned into a game - which was flopped on Broadway. During the WWII time, the story of some naval officer on vacation in San Francisco. They spent 4 days holiday at Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film is much more common and none of the characters seem very real. Carey Grant is usually brilliant in comedy and dramatic - but here he plays a wheeled Chilean player and he really does not stop it. Tony Curtis or James Garner is the best choice. Audrey Hepburn initially started playing against Grant, but his other commitments - so Suzy Parker stepped in step by step. He had never played before, but was America's top photographic model. I think he did a good job, considering the pressure he was under. A couple of short scenes with Grant's junior Manfield - did not really work. Acting with studio grant, she was trying to give some classes - but the character did not have any substance.
