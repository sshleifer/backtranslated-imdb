Rezon is a horror movie! It's very easy. It seems that they tried to create a movie to show the railway life. Just like many years ago in Japan. But unfortunately there is a lack of young young actors in Denmark. Lyon is still very young, and Laura is not good enough to play such an important role in "Christmas Jum". Many times he plays with the soul in the movie and this film is spoiling! <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie, you must see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but I think how it can end, if you are leaving your child. It is very important to support new companies like David Film and "Film Foket"! <br /> <br /> Everybody thinks people will see Rezon. This is not a great movie, because it's a movie that deals with important themes. I think it is important to mention that it has some violent scenes and in fact it is in the scene, Laura is doing the best. Finally, where he is gunning!
