When I say that alone in the dark is a vague film, then it should not be a shock to you. Packing it, it defeats a cowboy giant, drank the result, and then flipped. The final product will still expel this movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on an ancient (!) video game, the film has something to do with anything else in the interior of the planet, monsters, and ancient civilization. Two worlds are dark, and light of light. (Guess what is ours.) And 10,000 years ago, the portal was opened by a true super-dupt civilization, the demons came and an explosion took place, then the civilization was erased. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he was 10 years old. He is hot in search of archaeological technical footprints of advanced civilization. Kernby was part of a secret organization called 713, which was trying to discover what had happened to the long civilization. But Carnibie believed that he could not find the answer to what he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> See, these militants have gone out, and they get their victims in different ways. Make them bent, split down in the middle, implanting the nervous control device among them, or just turning them into deadly zombies. Yes, this is another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Which is definitely I can plot. It is quite convoluted and understandable. In similar movies, one can see uninterrupted researcher / adventure stuff one step at a time, and when we pay respect to the audience, it is very fun. But when the scenes switched from attack with a perspective or context ... not much fun. <br /> <br /> Actor is awesome, save for Slater, who (although she looks almost helpless) showed she was able to carry loads of acting. She was; Get this - they are thrown as a museum curator of Reed! Honest to good, I thought I saw casting all the time when Dennis Richards will not be thrown tomorrow as a nuclear physicist. But Reid is here with Richards, crappy emoting for dead emoting. Red announced on the highlights, "Newfoundland" as "Newfoundland", most of its lines, Rade, offers a lot of lines, most of the lines are a scandalous, melodious monoton (as it was all night bender for the last week before filming), Reid - a museum courier, you Remember - a medium-bearing top and a lot of movies in the Hip-Hoger jeans cost. Oh yes, he was credible as Jessica Simpson to give stock quotes. Oh, why are the beautiful girls to be so stupid? (Note: I think they do not like the red all the way. It seems that he needs permanent food.) The rest of the cast may be completely forgotten, probably for Steven Darf who played Bark, the leader of 713. Dorof's character was not very well developed. , But there was nothing in the film, from the set to the character until his ride. But I digress However, the confusing and completely annoying story is difficult to follow in this boring motion film, but the director Uwe Bowe tosses a radioactive, mind-damaged soundtrack; So loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly said, it can not be right. Although given the acting level, probably thanks to Mr Bowle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a fun note. The movie's opening moments are described ... words crawling across the screen at the same time. Do you remember the first Star Wars? You've heard that the now-known Star Wars theme delights Crawd. There was no need to describe it; Why do I need some dunes to read on the screen? Producer was looking for blind people only? Perhaps it explains why soundtrack so loudly - they are also looking for people with hearing impairments. Also, the story contained a lisp for the first few lines of the cavity - then it was lost. Victory <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a dark light in the dark, a terrific performance, an incompatible script, and ham-handed directing. Sometime a note ring is true. There is so much chaos that the audience simply carries on care of the letters and roots for their death. Even in the dark, it seems cooler and more advanced than the monster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, there were only three people in the theater, I saw this alone in the dark. Wonder whether the Uwe team was planned this way? I can not give it the lowest rating, because I had less hope at the beginning - and it did not hold enough for me to do it. It's violent, though Slater redeems himself a tiny bit.
