Yes, I admit I'm crying during this movie. It's so incredibly frustrating that I could not help myself but could cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First of all, in the program, with million dollar man (former professional wrestler), and now it is. <br /> <br /> Omega code follows a stream of religiously oriented movies. It was quite funny, but at the same time it was boring to find it wrong in the Bible. Instead of following the actual Bible scriptures, the film is known as "Bible Code". This film is made extremely weak; Her ridiculously awesome acting on her direction from her writings. People are actually trying to try in this movie. It appeared more like a late night movie than anyone who could watch live video instead of the United States channel or dramatic movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend you not see this movie even if your life depends on it.
