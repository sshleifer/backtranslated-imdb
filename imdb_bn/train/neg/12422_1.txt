I hired to see this movie as a bloody, non stop action movie, and found this extra sensitive and extremely cheap low-budget action-drama that looks like Kickboxer's Die Hard. Lou and Reb conserve Reb from Vietnam and Lou such gooks, he easily gets the bullet in the head of the worst effects ever. Vietnam scenes have somebody behind the house, swear! Lou is now brain-damaged and Reb and he lives together and owns a bar. Super Homoerotic Faithful to fight in a cage for iron money and Reb goes on a killer spree to get him back. There is no good battle scenery, punches two inches away from a person. Character personality changes the matter of seconds. A guy is a bad person and he is good in the next scene. The acting is very horrible and the music is some extra emotional Frank Stallone that will make you sick. I hate this picture.
