This picture is awful. Screenplay is bad, script medieval, even sex scenes are worthless. The thrill of the original film and the plot are completely lacking. The film was shot in a dark, galactic and exquisite style (a la World War War), which was so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. The Bruding character of Greg Morris shows a facial expression throughout the film. The original plot twists and turns have unfortunately left here; A few of the existing ones are simply anticlimactic. Sharon Stone's only brightness like the Catherine Trimle is faithfully continuing in this continuity, but it is not enough for other flaws. The only situation under which "Basic Institute 3" should be created if Michael Douglas agrees to join Cast.
