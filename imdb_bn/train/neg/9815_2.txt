The movie started to present the original idea in some way, but later it turned out to be a great disappointment. If the rest of the movie does not start initially to avoid any clayed plot, what starts? The movie itself is very incredible. I want to know that someone enters the clinic, gets a nurse's prescription, kills a doctor, leaves the patient on his bed, places his shave pickup and leaves? I guess someone could answer this question, so they just skip from other scenes concealed in this little detail. Performance is just plain bad. Villain is just another "annoying crazy opponent", no depth, full linear character. After the 20 minute film, most of the scenes are incredible, it seems that they were kept there for 90 minutes because they were completely undesirable. A doctor is clearly refused to examine her, to see a woman under firm medicines, takes kick from the house and leaves easily calm? The last scene makes me laugh, only Mickey Mouse can throw it out of the reality. I'll give it 2 out of 10 say 10 minutes for the first movie.
