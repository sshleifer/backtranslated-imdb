> You are warned of a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I suspect I can write enough lines. Great direction shots are well thought out. The actor was very good, especially Richard Prior that I liked to see him more. Madeline Kan and John Hussein were classic. Dudley also blessed God could do good to him. John Ritter again I liked to see him more. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to author failure. Perhaps what the productions he is making is likely to have pulled the producer plug. It is very bad that so much money was lost in this boiler, when I had a slight change here. They must have given the standard rate of the authors. Produce a chocolate.
