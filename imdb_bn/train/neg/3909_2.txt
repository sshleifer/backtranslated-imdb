When I found out that both my favorite actress Merrill Strip and Winona Ryder had a movie, I went through the rooftops! But I was feeling a lot of trouble after watching this leng film and I still have anger. The first of all the characters was Jeremy Irons (Actor I still admired even after this disappointment). The drama was just awful. He performed his family with crap, especially his sister, Glenn Close. I could not express any sympathy or sympathy with a character, and I did not have a prude, but sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could pull down. Wynona and Antonio's characters have been much improved and their romance can be much more enthusiastic. And what was Merrill's character and his "mysterious power"? Why do they not go into this more? Many of the dead have died in this film, and the following line is that this is a really laucy movie and there was a lot of modest talent here.
