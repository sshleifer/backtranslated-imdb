Go immediately and rent this movie. It will stay in a shelf under your local video store and it will be covered in dust. Someone will be touched in the year. It could even be a $ .50 special! It's worth 10, I swear! Buy it! There are not many movies than to compare with it - a few years later, the celluloid version of Gobo can be formed under the trash. Yes, I gave it a '1', but it really got a lot less. 1-10 scale thinking is not designed with stuff like this.
