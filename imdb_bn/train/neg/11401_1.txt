The script is very weak weak w / o arx character arcs you can do about a bit of characters or what happens to them. The script is very slow and does not have enough cows or actions even slow call it. The story reaches the level that you just want everyone to die as soon as possible, so you do not have to listen to them. This very silent, harsh dialogue In a technical note, the music mix is ​​higher and it makes it hard to understand what is being said most of the time. Then again, this can be called a blessing. Overall, this same story can be said in a small film / running time in less than 30 minutes. The reverence for Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" in the obvious "in your mouth" was even more subtle, but here they seem to be close to a severe face rip. Chem, such a 35mm budget and what can be done? Nevertheless, cinematography, lighting design and shots are really working well.
