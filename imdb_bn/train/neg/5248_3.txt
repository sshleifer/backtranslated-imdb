Maya Cigar was highly recommended to be one of the few good action films made in Germany. I saw it last night and I must admit, I am deeply disappointed. This is considered to be "the best of hope" for the German action film's impressive and challenging, but there is nothing left. <br /> <br /> "Die cigar" is sexy, brave and tries to be excited but it's not that kind of anything. Characters are wood and stereotype and they work against their nature when they are unexpected (which is not very much). It makes it hard - almost impossible for me - to follow them or even identify with them. <br /> <br /> Most of them think that this film is very bad. I believe there is not one character. Perhaps the higher officer of the SWAT unit - but it's about. Those who try to look like unified police or work like special units - I do not believe them. Not for a second <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it has been said badly. You do not always know bad guys at all - for example. And when Carl Simon (good guy) heard a "very dark" after asking his already dead opponent "Why? ... for what?" I asked myself the same question that Dominic Graph will not have the answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that even the Germans can do better with action films.
