I liked Adrianne Curry before this show. I think he was great in the top model and was really happy when he won. I like Chris Knight too, he feels like a great guy. But this show just made me sick! I was very angry at both for what happens that show. I do not care that they were of different ages, I can not stand the age in love know. But Adrian, you were together for just seven months. She did not surprise me all that she was not suggested. And I do not see an application to force someone to marry before I'm ready. If this is meant, why not make each other happy with each other and do not love each other and it will come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it is stupid to clear that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, for dismemberment and still shame to offer him! Have you been through two failed marriages, just how you could fit into a fit, could you push into another one? I hope the relationship will last, but I really think the marriage happened and all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can find the right reason to take a breath and get married in marriage.
