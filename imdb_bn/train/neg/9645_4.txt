Bad season for Bollywood with all major releases, with a huge promotion that turned out to be ugly in the box office. Any exceptions to London Dreams. Let's break it off ... it's going to be your dream, and you will go ahead to achieve it. Excellent right word? But unfortunately this image is not there. <br /> <br /> <br /> Arjuna (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it like Christmas. To make 90,000 viewers of his dreams run in honor at the Wembley Stadium in honor of his name. He joined the two brothers, Zoeb and Wasim (guardian Aditya Roy and Ranvej) and a Priyanka Priya (Asin). Together they form their dream band "London Dreams". After printing a record company's head, they become sensations overnight. Arjuna is in love with Priya, which he does not want to reveal until he achieves his goal. Then Arjun brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla Ukun Mannu (Salman Khan) who is an adulterous selfish person, who did not have any ambition in life to join his band. Manu is a trained musician and genius, for which Arjuna Mannu has been further enchanted with his superior skills and his relationship with Priya. We are planning to burn Arjuna Manu with the help of Zaheb. What will be the next form of upcoming movies. <br /> <br /> Coming technically, we only feel the shadow of Vipul Amratlal Sher, which we have admired in Namast London. He easily felt like the player visualized. Cut it down, glory cameraman! Suresh Nayar's screenplay is his moment but frustrated. Define an expected fashion, the screen bore you harder. The camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London. It is the only entertainment part while watching the song. <br /> <br /> Some songs are hamble, others are hired to the toilet Ajay stole grief with his negative character. Salman is bored and he irksonous to you. Unseen forgot and I do not say that he will grow up in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive, Ranjeet is strictly okay. Brinda as an anxiety we saw numerous movies. The case is going on in Ompur. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me make it easy and simple, London Dreams is a suites movie that you can enjoy better in DVD.
