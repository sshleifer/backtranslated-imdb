OK, I wrote a scathing review of b / c movie horror. When I was waiting for another review (for a debrief) for my pop up, I decided to test out the old reviews of this horror movie. Look at all the positive reviews. All of them, I say to all, do not rate any other movie except these come from contributors. Crimminy! And you wait for the review of "rosebud" [SIC]. <br /> <br /> Review other movies checkout and there were amazing recommendations for it. Oh, shoot! They will be the other movie by two writers and directors. Hello window-wipers batman <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you're a writer, and you're taking it as Tony, you can not get out of bad scripts. There is no work for you! <br /> <br /> Always check out the positive reviews for low quality movies!
