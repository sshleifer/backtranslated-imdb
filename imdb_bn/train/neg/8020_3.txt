There were some lovely poetic bits but without any direction or resolution, only an arts-Persian toss-together. How do these people get through film school? Who pays to pay this money? A very good actor, and I always like firuza boy, but let's say, the metaphor of ornaments is simply unable to find lazy things, that's just tired and it is definitely not good films. The director should go away and live for a long time and do not need to come back to the camera until they can say something. It jazzcars a bunch of mere paintings, just like the wall in the art of the art-spaghetti-wall, and hopes that the poem is the hope of the hope that it arises. That's what the director can really have a kind of perspective, or if there is a brain chance, it knows during the possible presence, but here it is not a place of fate. I felt the lazy last coming moment before hitting it, and when the credit was popped on the screen you were yelling "lazy bastard".
