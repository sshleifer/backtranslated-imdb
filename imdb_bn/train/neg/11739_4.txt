Often reliable Leonard Maltin is a "delightful romance" and that's the "superb" Sanders. Maltin must confuse this movie with something else. Sanders snide and droll and spanking, as usual, ?? You can imagine the delivery of adulterous lines, "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so heavy that they should run three of them" ?? But lower, wood and dates more accurately describe this film. An autobiography, an autobiography of Sanders, such as France's Eugene Videck, who is the police chief, but can not hide fine johar, it is enough to be entertained, but it is similar to the simplest historical Hollywood treatments which are fatal. Such as the term epic * Marie Antoinette *, and of course abusive * forever Amber * (which screams for a classy remix). However, in his defense, the sander tried very hard to add depth to his character, it is not everything. I am an endless Douglas Sikk Fan, but it is 1946, and it is one of Syrak's first American efforts, lacking its signature touch, which defines its Florida, Book-Hooting Potbulls. Sikk is going to wet his legs here and in the next ten years, he created some extraordinary films without hurting the gold * with great tears, and ripped our bombs with athletes-festos, which allow us all of the heavens *, * written on the wind *, and * Imitation of life *. But * scandal in Paris * rarely his best work ?? A relatively low budget affair with sugar set and viable costuming.
