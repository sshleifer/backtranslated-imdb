I recently watched this again and there is another version of that shorter 1999 I get the feeling they are in the same movie but I do not want to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One Japanese and no pikachu short I can come up with. Why not double the same movie? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy is rather annoying. He seemed to be sleeping almost, there were no expressions with some of his lines. <br /> <br /> It was enjoyable but there was not much of it. <br /> Collector <br /> Try to capture Lugia because many people try to stop him because of the many reasons of destruction (Explaining who after Lugia he has no plans to destroy the world). <br /> <br /> Pokemon movie is a little better, with deoxys (poke 7) great, no. 8 around here.
