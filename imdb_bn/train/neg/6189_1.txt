I bought the DVD version of this movie on my wife's recommendation, who liked the television version. But the DVD version was a disaster. The light was unincorporated and the whole scene was simply excised. In one instance, Adele is kept in bed, and we are immediately running on another scene - coming in the middle line - where it is next night. Characters such as Grace, Powell and Mason have never even been introduced, it's a surprise that they stop for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw was made by Platinum Disk Corps and even it was a GPP for $ 6.32. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you are buying! We're sending this one back.
