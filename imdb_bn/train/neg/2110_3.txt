Now I love Lughosi, do not make me wrong, he's never been one of the most interesting people to make a movie, but he must have shared his partners. It's just one of them. <br /> <br />> Logosi Dr. Lorraine played, who received a medical license for a doctor's unreasonable cause. He is trying to keep his wife young and beautiful. It has been revealed that even though he is 70-80 years old, he still does not explain why he is married to this old woman because of his mid-50's. However, in this treatment or study, the wife given to the altar is married to some sweet perfumes, but they are considered to be dead. Lugoshi and some of his associates steal the body on the way to the morgue and take it to its lab where it is placed in a suspended animation or catatonic condition. Then the stolen wife has a needle blown somewhere in her body, perhaps the throat, and then rammed into the needle to bring Lucio's wife back to her youth and beauty. We never see that Luigi needle comes out or how he comes out from the deaf, but it does not restore his wife in any way. The whole old age shakes you with pain, because Lucio's wife screams until she returns to her little bit. Labisy is the only good thing about this movie within her lab .... A strange old hag and her two deformed boys .... One boy is a great Lumpi slow-acting colleague who likes snowsing brides and other sons, that means a small dwarf. ... little person, to be politically correct in today's world. All three are just below the Logosi darry lab at night. Who are these 3s and how they came to the fearful coworkers of Lugosi, have not explained much like this stuff in the film, have ever explained. <br /> <br /> So a female reporter is recruited with her throat. All the stolen brides are going to find out where the editor is going to find out. He is one of the common things among the wives to steal all of the fastest representation, and is a rare orchid that is available to them. So he asks around and it is said that a renowned orchid specialist is living nearby who created this special orchid. This expert said suddenly. Find out Lorenz. She quickly keeps her hold and wanders in a terrible little house. I'm not sure where this police was, but after journalists did everything, they entered. Dirty work <br /> <br /> It seems that there were always unnecessary miraculous plot lines in the movies of Logosi, which pushed the whole thing to high air. I mean, the world's famous orchid experts kidnap Bride by sending their dopeds. Orked up he known to enhance himself? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the attention and newspaper headlines? Why not just grab a prostitute on the street like a common prostitution? This clunker reminds me a lot Lugosi Stinker, "The Devil Bat" .... the same silly plot line and bad acting and the same silly reporter gets the contract of bad guys. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he is suddenly scared and eager to see him so that you are interested at least enough to visit him. A woman playing a reporter was a terrible actor .... she had no emotion, she just delivered her line like machine guns, spewing out as soon as possible as soon as possible. Everyone came out to be good actors when everyone blew quite a lot. <br /> <br /> But this thing is watchable, only if for Lugosi fans. Lugosi was always so intense that the image was still in the dog. He certainly knew that he was making terrible pictures, but perhaps he knew that if he gave everything, his smallest plots and bad hatred that surrounded him could have some intensity. <br /> <br /> She was right ---- We always love the horror fans for the Luigosi. He always gave him all the time. He was in front of the camera. We can give you two f ** for tomorrow.
