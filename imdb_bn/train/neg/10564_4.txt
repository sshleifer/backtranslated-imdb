The true shame of "gathering" is not bad, and it is not a frustrating shallow plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series that started, though it was a major attraction: Takashima. I would like to see the room's tacasima with Susan Yanvova for only five minutes. He is that annoying, that intellect, that double-generation personality that is once endless and lovable. Sadly, the "Babylon 5" pilot movie has incredible storyline with the killings. Patricia Tallman - who did not return to Syria much later - fortunately, Lita became much better as Alexander, who is more than a shiny, tedious telepath here. I'll leave you with a final thought - why is it that looks like some frogs outdoors (though she is a woman)? Thanks to the sky for the way way after the show in the mint show.
