I was unhappy to see this trash of Sky movie Max on a cold winter night. I'm a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just trash. This one is even worse: It's one of the cruel pieces of crap I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror movie Yes, there are terrible things: acting, scripts and special effects - Gosh, I laugh at this ridiculous effort to create Flick for 90 minutes. Actually, it was a comic movie, which I gave it 5. If you do not want to ridicule it, do not even think about renting it. Vote: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 - did not vote because it makes me laugh all the time ;-)
