The film illustrates an interesting and strong Shannon Lee introduction of two very compassionate side letters through a good start and the first half. But after some things happen and all of a sudden Shannon faces it straight away, the second hand is bad girl and the movie is lost in its context. The second half is full of any kind of charisma and it is full of clich√©s, bad acting, a terrible plot and more bad stunt combination. Do not mention the awesome actors chosen for Chechen mafia gang <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and hugged Bruce, but his daughter became twice as embarrassed, who double then played back Bruce Lee. I really believe he can do a lot better than this and I hope he will participate in better production later. <br /> <br /> If you're a real hard-core action fan and do not care about quality and go ahead and watch this movie. I personally was looking forward to it but got very scary.
