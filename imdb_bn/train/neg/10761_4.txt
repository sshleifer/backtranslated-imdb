This movie was a zombie. The worst bad editing I have ever seen was. To fulfill the dream of the writer, the filmmaker added black screen to the second screen, at the end of a scene, it was almost identical. <br /> <br /> Under the dirty direction and editing, there was a good glimmer. A good idea, a compelling spark. But it has gone wrong somewhere. <br /> <br /> This story is a small-minded cleric who is trying to solve a striking assassination attempt. The first thing to call Richard Greco as a priest. Well part of him does not call him to be a good priest and he rather succeeds well. The second problem is that Dennis Hooper as a crazy bad guy. He always plays crazy bad guy. Very humble <br /> <br /> Oh, I had an idea that maybe all the nasty, horrible edits and isolated conspiracy were trying to add confusion to the character (Greek) facing it. And it is proven that it was built on credit backwards. A good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
