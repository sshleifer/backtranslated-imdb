Director FW Murnu was stunned with intelligent mobile phones, so well known for covering this story of the native island life in the South Sea. Documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. Landscape is beautiful, interesting to see the everyday life of the islands. The film is reduced, however, when it starts to pay more attention to the story of two lovers lover. Despite being well managed by Murnau, the storyline does not just get that interesting. Although the Academy Award winner for Best Cinematography, the award was probably supposed to be for the best view. You can not really credit the DP for getting such a beautiful position shoot.
