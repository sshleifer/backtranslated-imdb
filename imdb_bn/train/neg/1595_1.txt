This picture appealed to me because of the new kind of Pokemon celebrity. But the plot was certainly out of place and was not as interested in other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. If you want to make Pokemon famous, then there was no use for the movie. The film should not be well-liked with animations such as Dragonball, Dizimon, or UG-Oh. Drawings and settings are in incremental levels with the main enum values. It takes even shame to talk about this movie. I will be frustrated with the result of the movie of fans and release the cocktail. Digimon is more than an anime and does not fall anywhere near Pokemon. It's coming late late late 2002.
