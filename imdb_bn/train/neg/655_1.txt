I went into this with my hope, by twenty minutes in the movie I could not be given more down. Although it is thinking of another terrible bad rebuilding, I have kept my expectations ambitious ... maybe someone might find it right at the moment. Sadly, Promesh Knight's recent April Fools Dame remix, bad script, bad side, Chasey Ovadon performance and generally on the same level of quality as the worst horror. <br /> <br /> It is annoying, repetitive, and almost a dozen eye rolls worthy from start to finish. We've seen it all before and we've seen it a million times better then. If you go to see theater night of the theater (I will wait for the DVD or PPV), the laughing laughing at the audience, because they laugh. Laughs are not funny, but at the point of the movie, they are reacting to the "thrilling" moments in the movie, which you've done so horribly that looks like you are watching the latest pest of the scary movie. Seriously, is this supposed to be a reunion or a spoof? The filmmakers have missed out so badly that most of the viewers in the theater that I attended played around halfway through the film. Which is the retreat, I wish to work. Although not mine, I had to torture myself and it was expected that it would be better. Did not need to speak. "Awful" scenes are a joke, not just because of acting, but also for instructions, scripts, "special effects" and camera work. The film seems like they have spent a fortune to make it, but still it has come out through a small budget movie. I expected to see the dollar store tag on half a few props and I would spot a porn star cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> These movies are horrific, if it's the horrifying future of the big budget, but the horrific genre is destroyed.
