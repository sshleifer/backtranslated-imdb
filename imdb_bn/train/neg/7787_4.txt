It is one of the movies that is more interesting than an entertainment point of view from an entertainment perspective. I rated my rating based on how much I enjoyed or entertained the movie, so I'm giving it 4. If I want to rate it as an academic film, it will be 10. <br /> This is shot in a very interesting manner, such as sound effects and reality, such as a pseudo-silent film. It meant to mean mood and brain breaks, and interesting in this case. However, there are many hateful elements for the film that I did not find that all the entertainment. They're mainly just annoying. It has some interesting imagery and some interesting ideas, but some character relationships (especially between mother and boy) are quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie will appeal to you or it will not be. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it was not a good watch, and I'm probably not going to return again. <br /> <br /> 4/10 If you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic perspective
