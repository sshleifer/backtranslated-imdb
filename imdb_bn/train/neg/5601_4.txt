I just saw it because it was directed by Luciano Flori and I like an actor Claudio Casilli. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because I grew up Jason Statham <br /> <br /> Most of it was just a sister. "Kyl Bike" action was ridiculous. "Training" was a snooze-festival. It just could not catch me and would like to take care of someone with "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose to mention the other and you'll be better off.
