He can not deal with Veronica Mars's biggest mystery. <br /> <br /> This mysterious rating is still in despair. This week Veronica marks a nadir for Mars: It has 6 146 146 placements in 6 huge (soon to be bigger 5). Yes, you read correctly Veronica Mars is now beaten by every exhibition of U.P.N. and every event. This was great in all Fox shows and certainly by all shows of ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now, hip hypermarkets are going to say: But it was replayed. But in that week everything was backed up by the TV! It seems psychologically why the CW will choose the certainty of frustration, because it shows some shots saved from U.P.N. <br /> <br /> Behind the scene is a bit clearer. Contrasting and being influenced. <br /> <br /> so sorry to be sorry, but there is no other explanation? The "possible Veronica Mars" line has definitely been dead that it took two years to establish itself and failed to do it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Joel Silver's impact and clout, but in truth, I would love to see how bad a witness who is seeing the audience is losing their clout. <br /> <br /> Very bad episode for a great mystery and CW.
