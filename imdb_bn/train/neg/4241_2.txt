Yes, the character of Madsen - while talking to a woman at the TV station - Right: LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie changed nothing about it. All right, here are good policemen, moral police, even a black, whow, a Christian, a martyr. But it's a fairy tale, acknowledging it. The reality is not like that. And the most important for action fans: Bitter Out Boring Out. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. not so more. Play Counter Strike, then you have to do something at least. The only moral of this picture is: LAPD is better now. This is no bad police. If you are reluctant, prefer the euphemistic commercial for police and military services, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen (Camera and 2 points for editing).
