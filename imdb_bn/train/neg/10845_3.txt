It was a plot nicely! ;) I saw the movie with less plots (I do not want to mention the Asian movie ...). I think the camera was not bad for a cheap movie and the atmosphere was not very bad. There is no reason for what the people do for the main reason and the consequences of what will happen. Although I was thinking of many movies, but in this case it was awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The movie was bad but I've seen bad Seeing this movie, understanding, boring fun, death, sorrow, discipline and low level entertainment entertainment <br /> <br /> So if you like poor movies with stupid plots, this is the right film for you. <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10, because if you do not expect to see a good movie and you are in the right mood it can be entertaining.
