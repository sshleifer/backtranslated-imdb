'Anita and M' are becoming larger than the multi-ethnic Britain, but rather 'Bend It Lake Beham' or a drama similar to 'East East East', with which it shares the setting of the 1970s. The tone is firmly sticky (despite the Drool Black Country Actents), but the film seems to be 'short of earlier tides' and its result is rather slim and slower. Moreover, in the film's central relationship screenplay, an Asian girl and her white friend, the film is inadequate deep to justify the way it is protected around it. I've been tired of films where the heroes are to be years writer, this natural writer has experienced some naturally often, but rarely a fresh element in a mythical story. 'East East' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and I' seem to be comparatively and neutral.
