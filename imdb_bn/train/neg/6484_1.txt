I think it was for Temple Mathews, who was originally written in a remix though there are some changes which make it worse. Spinner: It is similar to the original. Melody, Ursula's sister, Mourinhard threatens Arrell's new daughter! Morgan escapes, but promises to take Melody away from them. Ursula has a sister? And like Ursula she is not a great villain. This is where there is similarity. Madolie was kept from the sea until Morlie was captured, but she did not know anything about him, because that happened when she was a child. A wall surrounds the palace to keep morgana inside and in it. He goes under the wall every day to swim and talk to Sebastian, which is not really fun or funny. He finds a sissell with his name and goes away from home and finds answers and finds dead. There is a similarity here; Morgana Melody tricks, making her happy by turning a mermaid here. Meanwhile, Eric, Melody and King Triton find her. For having a mermaid he needs to steal the trident from Triton. So Melody, because he does not know Trinity his father. He makes friends with a penguin and a WALARS and here's where the horror is. Penguin who lives with them in a lively sea, they hate them because they are nasty. So they prove they are heroes and fail. That is not according to the little mermaid. And between the Penguin and the two letters that the dialogue is running during the conversation, the ear bleeding You know why Because the first was a great story. This is one and not witch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> When they take the trident, then Arl finds Morgone Melody. Madari is angry to protect her mother from the sea, so she gives a trident to Morgan, and then she looks once to catch her real colors. Poor Ariel and Melody are in his custody. When Penguin and Wallar fought with a mortar shark friend, they began to prove themselves. Sorry I did not mention him before. They finally prove themselves. Eric, King Triton and his soldiers have reached, but it is forced to kneel down to death by quarter-power. Melody takes it, Triton threw it and he was Morgana (literally). Then Ariel prayed to Mary Melody and she thought it was her fault. It was not! Ariel did the right thing to save Mary, but they never said that way. Triton offers sea or land-dwelling Melody. He actually has a "good idea". People and mer-people can be together so that he uses the trumpeter to vaporize the wall. Then everyone sang a horror song. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone who saw it and liked it did not really see it. Do not I dislike this because I'm a teenager I liked it when I was very young too. Then when I grew up I started to see what bad about this picture. Young, young children will enjoy it, but perhaps when they are in primary school, they will forget it. Normally I think I've judged a movie over and it was good to remember when I saw it again, but it's not. It's even worse. No exception to the story. If you think that the story is good, reading this comment will allow you to know even more bad points: Well, you know the story now. I'm sorry for spoiling it for you, but I had to point it out to some bad part. One of the worst things is animation. Color terrible. The original was a beautiful color. I want to go blind to see this almost. Even imagery and landscape design was not good. The original was beautiful, witch color and beautiful underwater landscape design and land, it made a joy to see. <br /> <br /> The music is intolerable. Compared to the first, here is the music shit. The songs were not well written and their strings (I think it's the name of them) who could not sing Melody Occasionally, he did not sing too much or watch for music. A lot for having "Melody" as a name. And the music is not all beautiful or moving. Little Mermaid won an Oscar for 1 and it really deserved it. If it exists, it deserves a Razzie Award for the worst musical score in a sequel. <br /> <br /> I did not like voice. Many people who play characters from the first, do the same. Jodie Benson is a great singer, but now she is old, she has no crime, her voice is very deep and is no longer beautiful. And I was really frustrated that this was the first part of her and others in others. If I have to read the script for this picture, then I can say that this is a bad movie. The letters are now different. Ariel is now more intelligent, but annoying. They overdid her character, too mature to him. You do not want to change the characters due to a special reason in the signal. He was the first solar. He has little chance to change. That stage will be the person you are going to be for the rest of your life. Screenwriters should think that. They should think about the character <br /> <br /> All right, I think it's for me. I hope you find my comment useful, because I'm sure many of you will agree with my opinion.
