STUDIO 666 (UK posted lawyer) is another sub-par slash which has a direct-to-DVD movie presence. <br /> <br /> While direct CD-DVD movies are so fast or unintentionally so bad-in a good sense, STUDIO 666 is a mourningable failure. <br /> <br /> While writing, each comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Obviously they saw a few slash movies and there is more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> I can only create positive side effects for this movie that it hired better than chocolate and one of them <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie can be wrapped in only natural expectations (and can be handled badly). A depressed singer commits suicide. Shortly afterwards, his soul returned to one of his surviving friends. The friend of the alleged friend goes to a killer spree. The rest of the plot really is very bizarre to add. You'll just see it for yourself, the contribution of your interest is certainly not waned up to the point of devaluation. <br /> <br /> In most cases the movie is very poor. Dora acting actress had these exceptions. Her character was always attractive and seductive when she was on screen. She helps improve the movie above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of his lines that were said to have been written poorly in writing and thus saved him from film preservation. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. Villains did not think at least a bit annoying, each killing was completely lacking in mystery or tension, the environment was in existence and the camera-work was incredibly basic. Some special effects (if you can call them) remind me of the TV series, Ghost Stories. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, Gahst Stories has made smart use of scripts, credible performance and camera angles intelligently. Perhaps the producers watch the TV series closely, but they chose some more strategies that could save this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> This music is completely inappropriate for the movie's voice. This is not just rock music and the best example of this type. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the film (or it should be down) so bad-this is a good level. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I only recommend those who are fans of straight-to-DVD movies and have ever seen every single slash ever made.
