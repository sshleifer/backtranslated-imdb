I do not like Shan Pen's instructions too much, and this is the first thing, Indian runner, not an exception. There is no substance in the film, it is Renaik, colored with anti-authoritarian conflicts, in all honesty, most of the work in the pen is far more than its latest work. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clean Eastwood, Shan Pane, seems to produce a whole lot of fundamentally inactive products, apparently in a somewhat loyalty with honesty, but in most cases, glorious competition, and moralists, almost as if the hallmark cards are one of Hell's best wishes. A delicate movie which creates lines, and delivers me a long time for Deliverance. Acting Viggo Mortensen, he is much more credible here than that ridiculous prediction commitment with Carniborg, and that's about it. The movie is meaningless, and an exercise, a series of tricks, more than a story. Cudo for Charles Branson, but proves that he can work. And I wanted more of the character of Sandy Dennis. For Indian Runner's Bread, from 10 to 3
