I saw this movie that every time I want to throw it. If you take the first movie and reverse the plot (Aurel wants to leave the sea, his daughter wants to go to the sea), accept the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then lazy animation and the biggest suction material, you can Little mermaid 2. It is basically a copy of the first movie with a reverse plot. I'll take you step by step. The people of this first film: First, Prince Eric is still with Prince Eric with 3 lines in the whole movie. Ariel is warm, annoying, and we are concerned that we saw in the 1st, head is not a strong spirit. In fact, he is right on the contrary. Sebastian still less savvy than the lessest, less stressed people, and the jokes are no longer fun. Flounder has around 2 lines. She has now kids and she talks with a fool nasal voice. Scuttle is still funny not a fool scuttle. King Triton's character is probably the best, he still maintains fear and love for his daughter. Ariel and Prince Eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter. <br /> <br /> As I said, they used to play the characters of the first movie and copied them. What they did was: Ursul - New evil villain Morgan, sister of Ursula, who feels that she always lived in the shadow of Ursula. If he looks at my door with a knife, I can not fear him. He can not fix anything and he fails as a villain. He did the same voice ursula. Sebastian and Flounder - Perhaps the most stupid sided, tip and dash, was replaced by a walter and a penguin. They try to be heroes but always fail when trying. The plot is so expected. They finally became heroes. to yawn. Flatson and JetSm - now replaced by a shark, which has become 10x small in triton. Hess really really bad. Morgan and shark (sharkbite, I think his name was) There is no chemistry, good or bad. Ariel-Ah, Ariel. Our lovely mermaid is replaced by her non-lovely girl, tune. Melody can not sing, her voice should be more than 2 octaves, and because of you want to punch her in the mouth so mask sweet shes sweet. She wants to go to the sea, she is painful and the kids make fun of her, she has to find herself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is not boring and incomprehensible, seeing how bad it is. Some parts of the movie claim that you want to call Disney and why such a horrific movie was created in a series of such extraordinary origins. <br /> <br /> Basically, little mermaid is compared to a little mermaid. <br /> <br /> Compare and Ed wood movies are like Casablanca. Do not ever watch this, even when your bored.
