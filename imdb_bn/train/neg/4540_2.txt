First, three words: Read the book! Truly guys - real presentation difficulties arise in this confidential matter. I liked the book and the film was completely frustrated. It was ridiculous, half-hearted and the story misinterpreted. Novel - at first place! - A adventure was not meant to focus! That's just the neighborhood. In the movie, the focus is just the opposite and the message is coming back! Extra, visual effects showed the power of all living things and ultimately showing the precision of events was disrespectful! They screwed it up! I will not see it again!
