All right, friends, movies of all types of a serious movie buff, look bad and good, and this movie is expected to keep me in the exam. I will not mince the word. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. Always wonderful Sissy Spencer did nothing to make this movie even better. Actually I asked myself why I was bothered to see this hijacked movie? Why did I waste my time and money with something that I thought was bad? Answer, of course, I can not buff a movie and avoid what I should avoid otherwise. I will not waste your time explaining what was wrong with amateur movies of this period, except that the qualities of acting were neutral, except that Sahbaar A serious movie buff might take responsibility to watch this movie. Otherwise. Stay at home, do not waste your time, read a book, take chores or have a good sandwich yourself.
