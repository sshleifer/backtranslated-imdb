An Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinij as great CGI influence and Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hans is the crime of Morgan Freeman, a year-long piece in the movie, the year he won Best Actor Oscars. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with "Human Rights" resolution for Forests in Forest, in Vietnam, with a bare right-wing bias, a scary boyfriend's love letter to the baby Boom generation. Last but not least <br /> <br /> <br /> This is very entertaining and an American film through. I thought that some parts of this movie were very aggressive, as Jimckis drowned the movie about a Gump level. . See this picture and ask yourself, "Robert Zemkis is talking about making good Americans?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Forest" seems to be the "right" choice and in the last 45 years it is "the right place at the right time". Those who think wrongly, according to the director's view, they pay a heavy price. So Jemkis says that the celeb images as innocence and despair are a patriot, even American quality?
