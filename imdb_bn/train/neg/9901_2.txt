It should really have been a star, but many, checkies, expected twists, before being slashed by Slashar Flick, saw that I actually gave it an extra star to make me laugh ... though it was never the motive of the directors. Sure <br /> <br /> I often do not comment about movies, they have to be close, or really bad in this case. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw it in Jeff Fahey I know that it was bad because there is a unique nose for choosing her worst movies. <br /> <br /> In a similar way, all of it has seen me, perhaps, for the heart of the MRT, (Relay Mr. T, but if you're annoyed to see it, you will understand what you mean), if you see it Make sure you do not pay to see it. This work may have added to the supposedly comedy, but I'm sure you will find its strange humor here and there.
