Turkish movies have a big problem. Director is not interested in global movies They are local and folkloric, but want to be international. As a result, this movie brings teenage results. <br /> <br /> The movie has been translated from Turkish to Spokane and their non-Turkish viewers have no meaning. Even after 10 years for Turkish listeners. <br /> <br /> Even the players have even played back worse than Senseo's average. They work like dolls. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot in Cuba, but nothing about Cuba was included. So Cuba seems like a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Waste money, waste time.
