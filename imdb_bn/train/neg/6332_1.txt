When I came to watch this movie, I was waiting to see this picture, because I was a huge SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see it, the people who came out of the show were shouting, "Do not waste your money!" But we had to find ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were a few fun bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), but most of them felt that it could be seriously edited. The ridiculous 1 hour show. It was bad <br /> <br /> When the open singer came, many people got up and went out. It made me laugh, because I realized that Odnaghoo has just pressed the human button with the intention of this film. Otherwise he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not have to waste your time while watching it, it's bad.
