My mother is dennis el. Worked with Ryder for 11 years, no office was shared with him. When it was announced that he was a BT, he was frustrated. All day he told his story that he never seen him as a wikita killer. I heard him say so many times again. I asked him a lot, and I went there to interview him in whatever interview he was told to go. I read the whole book about Ryder, Wichita came to my house and I was surprised that such things could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Another BT movie on TV was not long ago. It may have been better to portray the murder of Danice's murder, perhaps his intentions may have some intriguing touch. <br /> <br /> I am getting very annoyed with the errors of this movie. This is based on my mother's screenplay, my reading on her and the video tapes I saw. <br /> <br /> First, the camera's angles were terrible. It looked as though it was shot in a home video camera. Acting was terrible and I could not bear to see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Ryder never had long hair. Dennis Ryder was a "very adamant man" and a "follow the rules book" is like a man. The film was not as nice to show her, she was kind and casual, business-like. We all know for his killing. If his confession is seen in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And to the horror of the dead house? No Dennis Ryder never reads or confessed to the problem of animal cruelty or harmful people near Dennis Rider. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for shiny approach. Yet through the whole movie he kept the animals in the mouth of his victim and played acting. He killed those people. But in her first assassination movie she tells the lady that she knows him too. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go to this movie too, and I'm already bored. If you are interested in the actual facts of the BT, you do not want to see it. You do not want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want to shout a shot badly with some deadly scenes, but it's like your movie, as well.
