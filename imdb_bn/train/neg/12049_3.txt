The box "Die for For" began to laugh me - a shirtless violent man and some smile and promise of sex. There was plenty of Thomas Arkley (Simon), who was easy on the eye, but there was no laughing and little sex. <br /> <br /> Couple, Mark and Simon have been together for several years, but care is not enough to be interesting, so they are difficult to imagine that care for each other. Having fault scripts, performance does not seem to be; Both actors can do well with what they offered. <br /> <br /> The end is sad and irrelevant (well, not completely irrelevant; I felt it was finished). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about homosexual relationships and AIDS, the "Partition Glenses" is a lot better.
