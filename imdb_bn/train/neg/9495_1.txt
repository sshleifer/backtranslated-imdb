This is a terrible movie, and one view has an ounce of true emotions. Characters are unselected, clearly drawn, expected, and the story line is clear and generally full of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> While making this film, William Holden (very sad to see him in this role) at the age of 55. He is playing at the beginning of the 40's and has seen that in the 60's. Who Lenz considered to be strange to him at the age of 20. I think the dogs found on the street were sex workers and had more life than their boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he ran the film, not (in) short - 60's pre-hippie cooler is placed with clear trappings: bachelor pad, swinging hi-fi , Yamanashi's Luncheon. But the film is ridiculously silly, a claggraph clappap of old fog, which they saw in the Sunset and Laurel Canyon free spirits, and their large Hankin cars can be sexy. <br /> <br /> Wig Youth culture was not that frustrating. And I wanted to think that Bill Holden was so disappointed for the young man that he accepted this embarrassing part.
