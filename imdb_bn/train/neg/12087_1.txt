I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> Kaneith was the most ambitious of Branagh, Mel Gibson was fast and at the point, Lawrence was best on Olivia. But now we come to the Maximilian Shell in Bird. <br /> <br /> One by one, this is a doubled version of William Shakespeare's pretty brown German television. But if there is a slower, more ploding, more neutral and bad phase version, it must be done at grade school level. <br /> <br /> Seeing MST 3, it makes Mac and Robots take the old boy with good jaws, making black and white TVs, Shakespeare and science knowledge (?) playing an English game and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman Reject. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best part is MST riffs. Best line? "I'm going to publish the Great Dane", "I do not think, 'breathing sensor'", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey Dad, you'll help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, "Gerrison Killer going to Germany (YAYA !!)". <br /> <br /> But Shakespeare's manager of Shane's Shawk's best play is not as a publisher. Undoubtedly, he is a great actor, but here he goes along with Paul Newman in "Silver Chalice". Ever see that one? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At least the book is Ricardo Montalban Is not dubbed by <br /> <br /> This is the only star "Hamlet"; Ten stars, naturally, for the version of MSST 3. <br /> <br /> Good night, very sweet princess.
