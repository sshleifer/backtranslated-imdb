*** Spokela *** *** SPIRIT *** When I saw a preview for this movie, I think it's going to be at least a pretty pretty story. But I was disrespected because of most of the supermodels. This helpless family drives to take a break through this "desert" city and this video camera shows that these people are seeing everything by donating them and they finally find out they disappear, the family goes to these mysterious levels and never discovers. Or do not show. Hack is stalking them. There are far more spaces than I can count and they do not explain how and what will happen. The family gets in a car accident and get it posest or brainwashed or something (which is not explained). The next thing you hope is that they can find out how it happened, but it has completely misled you.
