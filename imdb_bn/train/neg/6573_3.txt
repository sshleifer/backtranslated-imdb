I read such reviews and hoped for a film of some substances, rather than expecting a personal saving. <br /> <br /> The film has become very tall with the usual article in history and in how the unit came to be. But immediately it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. Pronunciation is very poor, because this unit is considered a Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone speaks in a very poor language, such as a Japanese Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I gave this picture 3 out of 10 10 minutes later I could not see it. The letters were dimensional in 1 and although they probably did not have any sense for them, depending on the real people and left to not care about them. Very bad aspect of a very low TV movie that is displayed in some cable channels at midnight. I want to avoid and try even better. <br /> <br /> This is a good story but it was a good saying. The director realized that the director saw the band and thought that his movie was enough to sell. My advice, to avoid the brothers' band, see Taskzy pilot, glory or any other movie when the trumpet is blurred ...
