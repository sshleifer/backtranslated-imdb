One of the main flaws of this movie is that while provoking young people are laughing, filmmakers consider themselves to blame. One of these features of Yuppie's kind is mistaken for misunderstanding that they (Yuppies) are sophisticated sophisticated only for industrial understanding. The film ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on the misunderstanding of dining, but I think it is weird that people who enjoy this movie only feel proud of the same tastes in the film, because the characters like them according to their preferences. If these great characters in this movie have a video library at home, I would firmly say that American psycho is one of those movies.
