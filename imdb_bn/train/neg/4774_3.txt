I'm not sure that the filmmakers were after any type of movie or 12 Agri Angels (people involved in gathering with truth) later. Whatever it was bad and was not able to show. <br /> <br /> I do not see movies for blood and gore but there was nothing else for this film, it should have shown actual killings much more. Most of the cameras were closed, reducing the horrors we wanted to experience the death. <br /> <br /> It also hugged me that the police were among the hunters; He acknowledged the proven proof in the proven chamber (given by the MJH) and went to jail to unknowingly contribute to innocent young man. (And MJH was a prosecuting attorney, could access this proof - accept it and bring back the wrong evidence - however, did not he need police help?). When others did not understand this often, they had damaged this particular person, yet played a major role in its final death. Gun dealers should know that their gun will be used for evil intentions. The insurance person must necessarily reject a person, etc. But the police seemed to be smaller than his crime because he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could take it one step further and he encouraged him to encourage this fact, which he might be more guilty. And the MJH is shouting that he (police) did not understand the world he got in any sense. <br /> <br /> If every person dies in such a way that it gives a clear idea to others why he was there and was deserving of dying. For example, the insurance person may have leaked apps under his neck, so he imposes on them; Oriental woman could open her eyes because of her false testimony, etc. Yes, the death of the gun, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not surprising, there were not twists, and the last one I've ever seen (if not bad) is bad. Finally my rating fell off three stars. <br /> <br /> Actors did a decent job, especially with garbage lines and motivation. <br /> <br /> Overall, waste time.
