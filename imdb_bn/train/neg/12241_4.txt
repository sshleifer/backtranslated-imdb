This is one of the few episodes (if not the only) with a controversial error in his story. While handling the Ralphi situation, Christopher said he had heard about the death of Pi-ma-Moyer. This is an important story because in this context Christopher knew from the beginning that Tony was the one who killed Ralphi. Chris has heard of the accident but there is no way. When and when should he tell? When he came out of his disguise through Tony's voice, nobody else told him. Tony knows that - makes it worse! Christopher's conversation about the death of Pi-May-Moyer can lead to Tony's conclusion that Chris himself set fire. I am really surprised about the interesting writing process by telling DVD writers that none of them understood the problem there. The story just does not work that way. Unnecessary that I add a huge fan to Sopranos. Otherwise, I would not care about it.
