OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake cinema coming up with some pretty big features. I think the great actors Freelance Ur Morgan Freeman, Hollywood's wealth, but this movie was completely destroyed. Then we got Kevin Spacey, because I saw American beauty and general suspicion, so I was a great fan. Both of these great actors seemingly have signed on to the film that it's going to be a great movie as I've heard stories. Then write a fresh face to face with Justin Timberlain. I face fresh because it has not hit him in his first movie and those tomato tomatoes yet. Well, I can add, because nobody can see this movie or even bother reading this review. The movie is so terrible when I reached in the first 15 minutes. The letters were so diminished that it looks like some Bible characters like Don Corleone. They got one liners and sound-biting stuff. Token is the troubled black guy (LL COOL J) who is a fantastic woman who he otherwise does not even belong to in real life. Captain speaks in this small tone of this small whiny guy. And what would be done in a crappy movie without a hero becoming rich due to an experience. Oh and lots of gun fire, I mean a whole lot. SPOILER (NOT !!!) This type of gunfire, the police force that everyone dies and the hero is strong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see Edison, the bottom line is a great fan of Justin Timberlake, or Justin Timberlake as a great fan, if you get its Warm Fire and Rocket Launcher, > <br /> All 13-year-old girls, enjoy there !! I had more hands, because I would have more thumbs because this film is so terrible because I can give it many thumbs that the thumb down will not understand anything because this movie is so terrible because it is so bad because it made me laugh about the frustration of the story line It will not end because firing and cheating are just happening. <br /> <br /> Major G will forgive us all and protect us from this terrible movie. Well it might be bad, another RNB turned into a terrible actor turned into a terrible actor turned into a singer, he checked out in Mix Lol, 'Die Get Even Rich or Try' Die. Now the special feature of the movie is 30+ year old male, 16 or younger players. I could go with this.
