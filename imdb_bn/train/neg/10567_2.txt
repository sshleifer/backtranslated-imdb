I think this film is mostly a case study that does not make a movie. Since I'm a filmmaker, I can give it two for continuation. <br /> <br /> As the issues are very predictable using bit and most pieces, from the beginning to the end, the story of the previous successful war Computer Generic Graphics was too much to watch in a video game on points and there was no effort to add a few realistic features of the story to the manager. I was interested in the budget that had to work with him, but he could not find the information. <br /> <br /> This project seems to have removed the budget movie limit too far. Imagine a fantasy that drags the viewers apart with the imagination. The actor was not bad, but the plot needed more innovation.
