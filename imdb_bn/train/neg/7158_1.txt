This is something I've ever seen played the worst. I love Almeird's Nadja, but it's just free. Along with interesting cinematography and music, this movie is not only bad acting and idiotic elements. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but such a remote is not good at all. The plot is a joke, but ha ha is not of the kind. I do not know whether I can forgive that bad movie. Remove the last hour and half of my life. How does this director Nadja and another girl do another planet?
