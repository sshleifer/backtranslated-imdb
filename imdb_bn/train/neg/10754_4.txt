I was waiting to get inside Thath with my hand ticket, I hope an interesting fantasy fantasy movie which can finally be my hunger for robot-technology, instead I feel frustrated by every aspect of it, the effect can not help an annoying plot, which is my opinion This year was bad. The performance of this movie displeased me, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I did not see his acting change from "Man in Black", which in my opinion was his only success. She had to retire from her without spoiling her name with the title "I, Robot" and "Main in Black 2". 4/10
