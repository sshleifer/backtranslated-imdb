I decided to read this movie reviews and give it a shot. I was an open-minded man after all and I gave some pretty good flicks good reviews. Based on the last achievements, I searched the money and looked nice to say something. Here goes: "This image was hungry short." I got all that. <br /> <br /> All right, all right. The set and the visuals were well done and the music helped in the mood of the shelter, but the film was painful to watch and continuous dialogue from good bits. I saw myself smiling in this picture but laughing at your best friend, who himself embarrassed himself in front of a big man. <br /> <br /> Until the "chicken dance" at the end, decided to bald and roll with just the film and let the dead bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what this image could recover. The acting was not bad and it looked like it was a budget but it was not any way to make watchable; Even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should shock a dobby or drink a lot of beer to get the full picture experience. However, I'm not really frustrated until I see this movie again. Then I can say to myself, "At least I was not there". Terror of Tarr Dungeon 'I am better than those boys. "
