1940 - With the uninterrupted cooperation of the Jewish community, the German cameraman recorded in Nazi-Occupied Poland, as a philosopher of Lodz Vetto, archive footage, international newspaper clips, and collective cultural films as illustrated by Jewish swindlers and parasites in the world. This 'documentary' explains the Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Racist hate is a clear, cinematic-unique expression. I personally find these pictures as scary and highly objectionable. Someone may expect that such images will not be re-screened.
