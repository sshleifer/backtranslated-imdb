If this film refers to discouraging people from drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and sometimes I could not do anything. This movie is not awesome or drama. It's just myth paranoia users This film can win the award "F" for so many times and to use it silently. It was not well said, but I felt as if they were to replace meth to debt to someone. The hectare became worse and the film became more paranoid and the girl became more optimistic. The end is really made in no sense The film does not give any idea until it shows how annoying it is with a math-head stuck in a room somewhere in the middle. When I decided to watch this movie, I rely on other reactions and the rating should be very low in this movie.
