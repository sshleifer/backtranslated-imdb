Bloodshed leads to dance - what a ridiculous title, it's so confusing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> This picture is very rare. And when something awakens the audience from some of its visitors, then the stranger is a comedic dialogue by the voiceless group of voiceless artists. These guys are so bad that they give voice to make the actors look like a group-like group of symptoms. It's really hard to determine how bad this abysmal dubbing is when acting. But voice-artists can not be blamed for the script. This is a quarrel. Unexpectedly the most fun, the merciful at the bad times. The general story is, at least, to say dishonor. Women characters are especially stupid; Men are awesome or tiring. <br /> <br /> The whole enterprise is the victim of pure exploitation. It does not promise a remote and even when the murder (eventually) starts to happen, they still close all the screens. Half of the hearty head shots we've got <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is a gaolosome I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys the Italian thriller has to give this film an expansive part because there is no remote thrill about it. It is basically a soft core porn film with a horrible angle. But it's not too lover. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it to anyone.
