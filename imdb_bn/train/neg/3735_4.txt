Actress Patty Duke writes her insightful, funny, rough book about an actress, her crazy-comedy love life, and her emotional depression and suicide attempts, which often leaves him well. To get hold of this rich element (and Patti plays herself in the final act), someone would think that a catch-like television director-TV-director could bring it all together, but "call me Ana" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. . For those who did not read the book, sketch imaginary (during the period of time) is not exploited, we are not allowed to get our bears with what is happening and the production is affected by the low budget. The actors make a mistake, and finally do not close the price of appearing in Duque - the film's reality is so thick that Patti can not bring the stability of the scene. It seems that the producers were perfect enough (and passionate), to direct the movie's final determination and emotional independence in order to manage this film, but they gave away many dramatic opportunities in the process.
