I have quite serious problems with this show, quite a few. A simple list will be enough for now, I will go into more depth afterwards: superficial characters, a sunny and annoying humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to look at the rest of this review and just read it so that you can feel higher in Canada's frequent bothersome miseries (like I did not see that I'm watching this show) I would say briefly: Friends only suck It does not, because it gets destroyed, the TV audience for the new, good show (grade development, decelerator etc.). Like television executives, friends responsible for reality TV, "to and a half man" and "queen's king". Now, take a review. <br /> <br /> There is no soul in these characters, they are very similar (out of genders and hair color). They respond to boring situations in the same way and are completely safe in their own body. Where does the conflict and humor come? After the hanging with Rachel's enemies, Rachel did not have a storm in Monica? Why does Joey think herself confident because nobody wants to take her seriously? Oh exactly, because he's dumb and he's comfortable with that. Curse of having these perfect characters: Permanent clashes and (God forbidden) personality becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The laugh-track is something that died after birth. One of the show is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I do so broad generalization? When a program claims to be a "joke", for a comedy, a visitor must be sent to Bisid, which means that the audience will not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy the humor by preventing fast return. Humor becomes a constellation instead of a free streaming entity (see Office, see arrested arrests). <br /> <br /> It comes to my next point: Humor is annoying. There is no way to make something more perfect character (apparently without a sunny) than a humorous character simply because our daily humor comes from our fault detection. So what if Monica is 17 years old? He immediately acknowledged that what he was doing was not right and broke with him. There will be some kind of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe his mother finds out or one of his friends tries to get rid of him and ends him. It would be better, it would be like a custody war! So now I've provided proof for my position. Many of my friends love this event because they do not hear about your Enthusiasm or arrested developments, many of my friends hate this shot because they recently started showing Curb to your Enthusiasm or arrested developments. <br /> <br /> I've seen many "friends" in my life, but I am looking forward to seeing huge flaws that my opinions are completely obsolete. If you read this far, thank you, and I hope you start at least the ones I've mentioned.
