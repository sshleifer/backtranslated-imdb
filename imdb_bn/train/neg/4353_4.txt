The class is a comedy series which illustrates a bunch of 27-year-old ex-classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​this event. That's why it makes me sad that the class is not funny, though it has obvious possibilities. It's not enough corky, just dorky. (Hah). This is due to a slow motion and really lacking in the sunny punch line. Also there are some difficulties with actors timing. <br /> <br /> The most innovative characters are the twin cat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldberg), but they seem to be a little too square for the show's best. On the other hand, the characters that I think are most reluctant are the main character Ethan and used-to-couple Doncans and Nikol. <br /> <br /> What disturbs me with the series that the character of Lorraine is only selected for its expression (even by an unreliable character, but anyway).
