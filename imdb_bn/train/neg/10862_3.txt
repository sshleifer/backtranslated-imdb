I saw 8 or 9 HarzG movies and none of them had any effect on me. <br /> <br /> I saw several documentaries about him. He is clearly with intelligent people, great knowledge about the film and passion of creating them, but this makes him a good director. Of course not! An absolute anti talent Can he make a good documentary because of the previously mentioned characteristics, but a film with the actor ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She can not write anything else. His screens are full of worrisome situations, and many situations in his films / dialogue are so young and badly done that they can not hide behind the word "art" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the strange aspects, so amateur-like. Not saying that he wants to give such directions and it's a lie to write shit like that. <br /> <br /> Like the scene when the shop is arrested and the store is secret behind the shop. Who is he? <br /> <br /> She is a deceiver; He knows what the fake intellectuals and critics want to do. He knows your attention and needs to keep what elements he has in script to get complimentary. Do not remember the script and the rest of the runaway side. <br /> <br /> Just see Julio Medeme. If Herzeg can make a movie like Madame, then I can try to re-examine its old movies and find talent in them.
