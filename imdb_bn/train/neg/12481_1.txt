This sword - and - an evil king is worthless in almost every detail about the myths and stories of the unpleasant cruel "hero". The role of supporting support is terrifying from the leaders. Learing, Glotting Gli, whose director, director Hiroshi, sheds blood around blood, is absolutely annoying; Nor is it freed by any trial for his trial, because the person he wars with is bad. Z-Movie is a lot of editing, including a character that has been completely missed with a single character "dead"! <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly banking on female lead and Barbie bentons and characters. Lana Clarkson, who is mostly paraded around the nude, mostly in the movie. 20-Like some men, I do not pretend that the woman on the screen does not attract me that does not attract me. But the treatment of their character is so frustrating and sex scenes are so casual and fun, that I could not enjoy this view of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of Cesi's films of this era have been released at least a little by heart, feeling the tongue-in-cheeks (this is a sequel good), but Deathloster seems to take it as seriously as the heroic imagination itself. No way! Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Ratings: **** of 1/2.
