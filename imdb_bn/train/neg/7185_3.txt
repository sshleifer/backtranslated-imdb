<br /> <br /> For my frustration, the comedy has become more transformative than this horror. The film's acting, dialogue, and the flow are all done very badly. Most of them do not understand. For example, there are a group of about 30 people, and despite all they are in a secret position, they are all scared and looking for all healthy young adults and the man is threatening them. I was thinking, maybe there was a parody of another movie like this scary movie, but they tried very hard to look terrible - emphasis on trying. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood have also been done badly. I saw the Halloween costume more credible than this. Closing a guy with his head ... looked clean - missing signs of bone, meat, blood, or even head. A strong downstream strike with an ax on the body itself will have to be somewhat stabilized ... It seems that the man is bat swing rather than the barn. <br /> <br /> Chief villain was thought to be a twist, but the other part of the story is the opposite. Did that man's heart become like this? If going to be a wrapper, you should at least build it to add mystery and mystery.
