In the 1966 film "Blow Up", Antonioni's hero question was true against a patronage of British youth protesters. Hippie set such questions against the fabric of the youth movement, Antonio asked intentionally or not, about the effectiveness of this organization. How can you fight for any reason when you think it is true? Next to the flip, the film said that we must fight and actively challenge the challenge, because others may deceive us with false pictures and false facts. Although the hippies were the strongest part of "blow-up", they made a nice texture and otherwise paid more than this. It was a very careful and mature small film. <br /> <br /> Antonioi with "Jabersky Point" leaves all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes completely leakage Hippies. As a result awash with a picture to say bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy handover stories. How can anyone, who can show such restraint and intelligence across his career, so do something stupid? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Suddenly a person (Mark) leaves up and leaves. He hated the nature of nature and the nature of revolution. He acknowledged that even though the revolutionaries struggle for independence, if you want to bind yourself for such kind of militia, you have to effectively remove your independence. And so the "passenger" like Jack Nicholson, Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> Thus, Mark became alone by buying a gun. He took an order. When the police attacked his university campus, Mark shot a man. Then he flees at a nearby airport, steals a small private plane and flies in the desert. Antonioni behaves as a peaceful peacekeeper in the desert, and disagrees with the capitalist cities with their billboards and empty modern equipment. He saw the desert as a Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark Daria met and quickly fell in love. Hundreds of hippies sand sex is provided by Antonioi then gives us a ridiculous sexual scene. Free from the limitations of modern life, this tree and student fundamentalists can now celebrate their personality by sunning the sun. <br /> <br /> The picture ends with fleeting palaces with Mark Meing and Daria and fantastic fantasyings. The houses of the rich capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioi's challenge to its audience. He takes guns, pickets and explosives, he says. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Jabrisky Point "recognizes another self-centered commercial effort as a radical. A sort of commodified radicalism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Must have to go (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). That's all good and good. However, artists are warning us about such dystopian nightmares, but unable to show how they can effectively manage the changes in our administration. As the end of "Fight Club", unconditional and violence does not achieve anything. In the real world, social changes have been started by small inventors, which are progressing through small technological advances. I mean, women are more independent than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad picture. The problem, Antonioi insurgency does not really believe. He is a calm and thoughtful man. An introvert who seems to have made an extrovert movie for more loyalty from CounterClercraft, which took its previous film "Blow Up". For example, "Gibbenci Point" comes across as a very persuasive and stupid film. It is a 50-year-old man, "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many movies that are encouraged by viewers to "system" war, but they all fall into one of the four divisions. The first section includes movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Look", "Kaku's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the lives of the freedom fighters have ended in failure, though in every case "the spirit of revolution" survives. The message is that you can not influence the change, but due to dying or failure, the optimistic idea of ​​change survives through the martyrs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It all tears. Blow it all up. Everything is false, so you can go blinking as well as guns. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Master of this genre of Terrence Malik and Antonio. "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" films show people who they do not like and create island or peaceful air for themselves. Both directors are frustrating, that the owner has destroyed his island and Antononii has no ideas of happiness or solutions on his island. <br /> <br /> then you have the fourth category. Movies like "The lives of others" of Donmarmar, Ashby "Stopping for glory" and Cubic "A Clockwork Orange" act as a force to change artists and rebellion. In this dystopian world, each of which has the subject of slavery of the state, it is the ruthless creativity and freedom of artists / criminals who check the system. By just existing outside feathers, you create waves. Challenge your comments, actions and critical eyes, status. For example, the novels and artists of the DonSarmar movie have weakened Nazi Germany, fighting Kouri with Alex Artist / Criminal Nazi Dugas and filmed in the city of Blood and Sperm.
