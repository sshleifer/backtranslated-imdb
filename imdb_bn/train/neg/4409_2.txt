Strictly a routine, the numbers are Western (indicated by Gen-originally Andrew V. McLaglen, so any surprise?). Army Colonel Bryan Keith Sparks with Memorandum of Bandit Dean Martin, who only kidnapped the Colonel's wife (Ann Blackman, who did not find dance after playing Pussy Galor in "Goldfinger"). Boxer, Shooting-Out, Stazcoach Robbery and Denver Pill have a helpful introduction ... In other words, nothing is new or original. As soon as talking to the least low monitored, Keith is a prostitute (some of the shock after the TV's "Family Affairs" run), but otherwise it would have been less costly for Keen. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not feel like notification or care. On Hack direction, poor writing and Lowball humor on various illogical attempts. * ****
