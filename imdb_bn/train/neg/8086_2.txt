When I first heard about the "Solar Crisis", I got a Cast Cast, I was surprised why I did not hear a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> I know now <br /> <br /> <br /> For a movie that is in the outer space, the sun, the vast desert and the broad metropolis, it is a horrifying and clustrophobic characteristic; It seems that everyone is locked together so the camera will not be too far away. <br /> <br /> And good, though there are very good effects. A team of scientists and soldiers could not resist a fierce solar flares if we are talking about the planet's impending destruction. But there is no other emergency situation except screaming, sweat and red light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not start me casting. What is happening in this film in Haston, Palenas, Mattason, Boyle, etc., is that someone's idea is without bothering to work with any feeling for any element. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If this kind of motion can be retained by the film, then I may soon hear about the "solar crisis". <br /> <br /> <br /> Two star. For almost missed opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised, how is Alan Smith junking his work?
