Mt is a little sister and I self-declared horror movie buffs. We have just seen about everything, especially zombie flicks. Now, we've seen a lot of good junky movies, and a lot worse. This is the perfect movie I have ever seen in my whole life by FAR. Acting was not terrible, but special effects, graphics and sometimes "zombie" make-up was the worst I saw. If you can make it make-up (black eye shadow around the eye) even though it is a complete proof that you will never judge a book by its cover. The only sweet thing about the film cover. Make your own bias and do not see this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so curious about this movie that I left a sticky note inside the movie before I said in the movie, "This movie is going to waste, do not waste your time, go back now". I do not want anyone else this POS movie a good movie night Waste! I do not know how it got ratings, it would be negative
