My "boom!" It has a terrible pan-and-scan videopad, and I want to see all its widescreen screens. So I voted "1" and hope you too will be. Together, we can drag this movie to cinema drawers and hopefully "Boom!" Have a great opportunity to publish. Extended version of its director's cut. The film is one of my curious favorites? You just see people involved, director, actor, cameraman and you say to yourself, "Yes, I think you can fool some people for a long time." Producer DVD release considers "Boom!" Note that it has been shown everywhere, there are crowds selling in the theater. But it has not been up to Frostbite Falls yet.
