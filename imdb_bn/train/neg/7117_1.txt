Before the film begins, a narrator warns us that you can die terribly in the scrolling school - and if this is the case then it is guaranteed to bury free. Well, I do not think anyone was afraid of seeing this movie, but some people might have died because of frustration. Screaming school is a movie that looks good on Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Based on the story of the famous Francis Marion Crowford, a very wealthy but nervous woman who is married to a gentleman, whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed on his home, he is half-intelligent gardener, a badly executed portrait, peacock, and finally a pole that surrounds the house and shouts him a lot. And for her achievements, actress Peggy Weber, rather shouted well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the ability to do such a thing is its main point. The plot is quite transparent, at least to say, and when Cast is really okay, then the script is awesome and the movie is so obscure that you will be ready to run your scream. True, the thing runs around eight eight minutes, but it all feels much more. Add a really awesome print quality and there you are. <br /> <br /> Movies are so bad that they make fun of. It is true that there are some salwaras in the scrolling school - but the film is so low that I can not do more than occasionally abusive, and at that time the whole thing on your head will roll from NNU. If it is not with the scream of Peggy Weber, it is a sure remedy for insomnia. Give it a miss. <br /> <br /> The GFT, Amazon Reviewer
