Acting bad ham, all jokes are extremely and very young people of target audience, they are estimated to have below average IQs. I understand that it was for the kids, but in the middle of it is Malcom, yet they still throw in adult humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What can we expect from a show directed at the only comedy Bob Sage? Smiling on a man's neck is less than happy to say, which may have stopped hosting the most fun home video in America. <br /> <br /> Do not allow your kids to see this show unless you want to save money, disclose the stupidity of your kids in college and they will be bigger dumberer.
