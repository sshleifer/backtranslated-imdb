Yes, this is a painful movie! I do not understand why people are so scary about "fault" The director plays a joke (I want to admit that a very good one, which makes life very stylish) and then he repeats the rest of the film. As a result, I was surprised at the first quarter of the movie a few times, but once I knew the drill I once started to sleep, because the Grudge minutes became more hopeful. In conclusion, I can say that in the beginning there are many good movies in the genre, the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was in the street and money was purchased by buying a ticket for "The Grouge".
