This is the least scary film I have ever seen. How does Blob manage to eat is the biggest mystery of the film. The blob that runs so slowly can reside on an O.A.p in a zimmerframe. Blob is a common horror film that stands for half an hour instead of running away from people who have a big piece of luck across women so that they can be eaten. If you have seen this movie, I recommend you, this very interesting thing will be taken seriously.
