This movie was a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow ... really very slow. Even if someone thinks it is a classic classic but I think many good films of that era will be seen. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not great, but not the worst. The word is ok Ok light. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this to anyone other than a filmmaker yet. <br /> <br /> There is no music in this movie, and the horse is not sex 'It's not a good one. And the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was simple fool. <br /> <br /> To win here, avoid this complete annoyance. I believe I saw more bad, but this time just waste, and I do not get good reviews here. Especially high rating ...
