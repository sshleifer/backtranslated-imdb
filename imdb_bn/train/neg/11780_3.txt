At the beginning of "The Godfather: Part III", the son of Michael Corleone wants to leave school and wants to be a musician. Michael Corleone does not want this. But his unhappy wife, who is a former wife, directs him sincerely because he wants to follow Anthony Corleone music. So he's doing. <br /> <br /> It seems like to start a review as an unwanted way, because it does not really have to do with a small plot point and main activity. Just bear with me here; You will see where you are going with this end. Now let me tell you about the big plot. It is about to leave good crime for Michael Corleone (he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business). But then together Vincent Manchini, an illegal nephew, who is involved in a dispute. So of course, Michael certainly must bear crime and gun violence and another brush with all that good gangster material. Meanwhile, Vincent is a semi-sensual affair with Michael's daughter. Oh, and Michael and Kei are trying to patch up all the awesome things at the end of Part II, <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a soap opera. A terrible, awful, 169-minute soap opera Gone is a kind of sophistication, romance, and emotional relevance that makes the first two movies so difficult. After a 16-year break in the franchise, Francis Ford Coppola had completely disparaged disgust and prejudice with the first two films, his last work was again proved in the 1970s as "Apocalypto Now". <br /> <br /> What's worse, "The Godfather: Part III" is not even a logical follow-up of "The Godfather: Part II". Michael is a totally different person. She has just gone to the seeds (which may be legitimate, even fun to see it). That part has become a nightmare trying to solve all the second tragedies that made Part II a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough, but in the middle, the diabetes that had been infected pushed towards flexibility. Come back again with fun! There is absolutely no way for heaven to happen, the second movie has made a lot of clarity! He kidnapped his child, and his Sicilian fasting hated him for him. Francis Ford Coppola do not even think about these things? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not even start the case of Mary and Vincent! For a banned ban so, it was suddenly unengaging. Sophia Coppola's acting did nothing to help. He took the smartest step of his life by switching from behind him in front of the camera, because he is perhaps the worst actress of the nominated personality film. The lines he had distributed were painful memorable, and every time the drama rested on his acting abilities, he was going to be an inappropriate giggle. In the climatic scene - I will not go into detail, but you know about which scene I'll tell you / when you see it - he looks at Michael and says, "Dad?" I think I wanted to cry, but the line became so weak that I was long, We started to laugh loud <br /> <br /> Now we go to climax, and now I understand why I spent some time in Anthony Corleone's musical rhetoric Start with a review nksara details. After 140 minutes of small plays and irrelevant events, Antoine Corleone returned ... with an opera! So Michael, K., Mary, and Vincent go to see it, and walk around trying to kill a couple murderer Michael for about 10-15 minutes. Regarding this climatic order, I must say one thing: it was really good! But not because of the killers - they were quite annoying. I just loved opera. It was some great music and a great set piece of real. And, from what was shown to us, it seemed that the story was originally encouraged by Corleone's family. I bet it was a swell opera, and I would be pleased to let Michael Corleone bett let his son switch switch from law school. <br /> <br /> My biggest wish is that: Francis Ford Coppola was merely antenna drying for the 169 minutes and the rest of the negotiator mailed to Melamedram. Still good, I did not make that "The Godfather: Part III". Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was self-motivated and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> PS This film is not an intimation. I saw all 3 godfather movies a month ago (though I was reconsiding the first one). This does not mean that my expectations for the third part were not drunk (actually, I set a bar for less than what I heard), but its meaning was also a good time to think about three of the films. I was a little disappointed with the first part of the second, as much as I thought about it, well it takes it. But starting with Part III was bad, then I got worse. The sad thing is that many people will stop by part 1, but if they can see part II, then perhaps they will be in the third place. If you like, then see Part I & II and do not move like Part III.
