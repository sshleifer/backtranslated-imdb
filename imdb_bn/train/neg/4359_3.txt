Wow, the discovery of "Route City" by Timo Rojess about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a meaningless curse ...) I think some people might not get it. I was interested in this movie. I was a lot of positive stuff and packaging and film appearance away from the total trash expected after "Route City". <br /> <br /> Surprised: The movie is not a total trash but the problem seems to be right. Timo Rose tries to walk on the foothills of Germany's Horror / Splatters, such as Wolff Ittenbach and the choice. That means "barricades" are very serious and in detail. The Gore FX is not really believable but it's okay, but in some cases plain sucks. Hollyish chick is ridiculous at the first end and it is not better until she shoots. <br /> <br /> What is the problem ... The movie is poor, a common German Underground (including classic) booby shot), OK FX and packaging like it already promised a modern feeling?! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is a total BS. You've got a simple mountain cat / lost story story with some people + gallery camping out and salon with a downhill hillbilly family. Everything just moves towards torture / separation scene and feels incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that "barricades" make half heart. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is a perfect description for many camera work (I have selected repetitive cut trimmers in the view of torture in the extended bobby ... they have no material or the editor works in a hardware store). Even the correction is even worse ... Sure, it's much better than its modern and continuous film, but its random. You got an overuse of that common exposure impact everywhere and with no money ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there's a nice / stylish film that has been thrown here and there for it, I do not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3 Here are many repetitive elements like the previously mentioned effects. For example, most killings are executed with multiple repetition of hijacking and punching. Its just once but here its annoying and fake, especially in the end. Boring is also the "music" feature which is used permanently without any changes in the background. It does not take long until it makes the movie less portable. <br /> <br /> 4. This is the biggest problem of this film (and many of my opinions come in). If you spell a splatter movie with the trash, it feels very stupid to polish it with your special FX and new school editing. Looks like they made it very dead. It's no fun because the decent Gore FX is lost in this context. And the classic Gore FX is just like the pseudo-like or visible look in the computer rather than in the scene like Computer FX (and 3D splatter mostly suck and even me in the movie with a budget and decent 3D artist). <Br> <br /> I was often surprised that the serious splatter movie time was over and "barricade" is just another example that might be the time to keep it in the tomb. It has no fun, no character and too trashy for its appearance. The script is an inexplicable attempt to move right now to "wrong turn" and "TCM". You can take that literally ... The last is here and there are so many more random ("I love you" a splendor flick ... come !!). "Barricade" tries to integrate a lot and fails ... You can proceed strongly through this film to make a 13-minute stabilizing of a couple in a wide range of disambiguation, acne mouth melting, nipple pinning and classic friday (bloody boro haiyai! ). But to get through this is really hard to find. The total failure is especially because you can see it may be something.
