Is this "bad" Star Trek TOS episode? Probably, at least it gets me the vote as below 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense. Seeing something that goes crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music has increased, often forced to increase the feeling of hardship. For me some clonans, gourns, tholians, roilants, tricksellans, or other days without medullaine, these are a very boring alien to create an episode. McCoy says his famous phrase "Haid Dead, Jim". During the carrying of the ambassador, the speaker keeps the protective goggles but not Kirk. They may feel annoying, for the third time now it remains from the annoying "obstacle". The next episode of at least three episodes will be "Specter of the song" and "The The Dove" and others will follow, so that a good show tray is made to watch syndication where it likes people like me. Personal observations, like tray-colored purple, prefer to use its pink purple, as they are in the prison outside the quarter, usually the gray gangway is now violet. We were not a purple bridge sometimes but it was interesting to see, I noticed it in different episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode, the ship's rug is quite long.
