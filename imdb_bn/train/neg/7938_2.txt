A family comes in an ancient, old-fashioned phaikak show in search of some old streetlights that include a father's coffee table book, which is operated by a bright one-eyed man. When their family van fell out of favor, they were forced to stay in a jail-breaking fishing camp almost a decade ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the humorous 'Freaked' (1993) of Alex Winter from 'Good' subgenre horror, Todd Browning's favorite 'Freaks' (1932). Those Classic will be both (or sooner with 'Freaked'). 'Side show', but never will. And it does not ever reach the classic condition. . . Well, it will be a clear formula of sad state of our genre. It's not too much for the film, which is 17 years old, which is probably older than its natural mother, from a happy opening song to a 17-year-old girl. The writing was subpar, but not entirely horror. . . Annoying The direction was poor, and the effects of the rare fog were quite terrific and incredible. The acting was unrealistic and the cast was even worse. Anyone who believes in the age of two of these camps can not fill a teen for a long time. There was plenty of violence and violence for lack of any other quality. . . And when there was a slight violence, it is not working well. And, I can not forget to mention the final battle scenes, which are all honestly, sometimes seen in a film, which I have ever seen. Overall, it is a easily forgotten and weakly made horror movie that can be left alone underneath the dollar. <br /> <br /> Final ruling: 2.5 / 10.
