There are some nice shots in this movie, it has some natural scenes with such beautiful light, in fact the film is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> It is more and more made for TV movie, and although it has many twists and turns in its plot, which makes it look very interesting, no subtitles and key plot development in Spanish is published, so Spanish Speakers will be a little lost It was with me as a gift from Brazil, because it is a family feature that we have found talent to work through an actor's films, and Matthew McChaughie was very extraordinary in "All Time to Merrill" and "The Newton Boys". I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> Although it says in the DVD box that it is a Matthew Megonagahi film and uses it as a marketing play, it has a few lines and the screen is at the end of the film for a very few minutes, that is basically an extra and when the screen is properly Hard fans can die when not light. <br/> <br /> <br /> This photo star, although Patrick McGauge is very good and very easy on the eye, and his character is a very nice and kind and caring one Saint A man, he will be well written in ROM. <br /> <br /> So, for the performance of the scenes I have seen for the real MacGongo, for brightness, I would recommend, "Murder Time", "Newton Boys" Freelity, "How to lose a guy in 10 people", "Adve "And" Amistad "and avoid too much" bigger life "and" Angels in the Outfield "until you are not like children's movies or dictate their talents to kids around the kids But a funny movie for children, the MM is really nothing but an assistant artist in that line some more. <br /> <br /> Springr Scorpio, but it's not a bad film to the screen is not stolen.
