Today I saw most of "My Bollywood Bride" at the IAAA Film Festival in New York and had to leave the theater because of the feeling of nausea inside me. I saw Bollywood movies, and I saw Bollywood movies. It can not determine which movie wants to be, so it has become a joke on itself. <br /> <br /> It has been generously copied from brides and movies such as prijoodis and bollywood calling and what is that a sloppy, idle job. Could it ever stop Bollywood from sticking to the overdued, well-written scripts? The real, interesting stories of billions of people who have come to the screen, of course, and there is no one who can transit in one billion people's country. Extra smart auto drivers, street cows, peculiar scenes of foreign locations, dotted streets in Mumbai, all of them are there. Almost every possible credibility of India is included. So sickly predictable. Threat !!! The performance performance is weak throughout the board, without Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why he would take a project like this.
