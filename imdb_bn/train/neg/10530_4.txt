In 1946, Margaret Landon's film "Ana and King of Siam" was brutally scattered, in which Deborah Carr was a widow school teacher and mother who traveled from England in 1862 and took up the job as a teacher, in 1926, with Irene Duney and Rex Harrison. Do it. King teaches a lot of children - and perhaps one or two things in the process of the Royal Single! Stagy pictures start well, but quickly lose strength and focus. Yule Brenner, as the King restored the victory of his stage, is the presence of a commanding, but is used - per concocted story - as a buffoon.
