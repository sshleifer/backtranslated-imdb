Gang Ho was a good idea, but American viewers should say a lot to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. The lead character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) went to Japan and helped Japanese auto company America and his dead Pennsylvania town. Two things come to you. First, why the Japanese company comes to America in America, and so good? Secondly, does anyone understand that all American companies go to third world countries to create their products to come out of labor costs? It creates the basis of the film that number one of the world's number of makers will go to one of its top competitors (excluding Germany) and put a plant as unrealistic. Keaton was still in her comedy mode by this time. However, he has proved that he can go from comedy to drama in a few seconds and still not be embarrassed himself, but director Ron Howard is not going to be a TV movie that is over. However, their unforeseen story does not have to end the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations happily. Gong Ho Happy Happy Days and Lorraine and Sheryl think both producers of the TV shows have made this movie and then made the film's version of the movie, which makes the movie its lightweight. Japanese director American workers feel that he and other Japanese people can learn from Americans. Two of his male sits, who do not believe in Americans who do not think they are. I liked all Japanese characters like Soft-like Goffball characters they created Japan. This makes the film more interesting.
