O Lord, what are they thinking ?? !!!!!! Here's your spoiler alert, though I think it really will not matter. You will not see this segment of the trash anyhow. <br /> <br /> A team of handpumps is behind a group of really stupid people, who are looking for a foolish person to try and kill them, and the things are complex by letting the doll live out of their stupid imagination. In other words, the whole thing is actually stupid. <br /> <br /> You know that Mike and Bots can not save anything when you get bad !! And they did not! I know, some of their lines were funny, like adding "hits" and handwriting comments, but, geez, it was very nice. <br /> <br /> I can not say see this peach O CRUD. It does not work your income.
