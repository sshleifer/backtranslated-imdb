The first episode I set pretty high bar sets. It played William Hart as a hit-man, who contracted to kill a Tomomi. We have given very little information about his character or who is giving him money to kill him, in fact this episode is not significant for any dialogue. Returning to his modernist panthouse, he distributed a package containing toy soldiers, it smiled, but he canceled it and went to his business. But for the night of hell, the soldiers are alive and fighting, fighting jeeps, machine guns and bajukas and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for a TV show, and it becomes quite intense when she walks around using an apartment in her living room, sometimes with no hands on top and other times. I can not destroy the end but saying that it was a cute little twist. This was my hope for the rest of the series but I was up for the frustration, all the other episodes were garbage and I lost interest by the fourth one. The adaptation of Stephen King is always a mixed bag and this is no exception
