I would say many things - everything about this director rouge image ... things are not quite ready for our head. Sex, suicides, murders, and people "releasing yourself" are constantly bombing the audience, which makes me wonder if the directors were trying to contact the idea of ​​relief or release. Although I do not think I can see this film again, I would say the director has good eyesight. There were some really nice shots and "moments of the film" in the film (fans, their hair wire fish), but the story made me more important (strictly as we asked ourselves "we've hacked" just see?). <Br / > <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to gog or vomit easily ... do not see this movie.
