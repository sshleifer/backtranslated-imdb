Maddy (Debbie Rokon) is a mentally unstable young girl, who gets more than her in return for going to a pool party with a fellow-colleague. When his date and his friends joked that they belonged to a 'Murders Club', Maddy took it seriously and in a parking garage, one woman was disturbed by her brain (to suppress her car) and went straight to 'Level 3'. But did Madi paint a plastic mask and kill other members of the group or have lost another? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally titled MakeEm Bledhead) is very weak, before the end of a ridiculous, out-left-field bend, the hole and the spiral are completely out of control. Something is ridiculous in the dialogue I had no problem with Rokan's performance, but supporter Cast was violent. However, I managed to sit through this full moon release, thoroughly entertained. There is plenty of skin and blood and it's a choice to sit with your group of friends and to be different. Horn fans can enjoy Brian Stevens and Lloyd Kauffman (as Debby's parents) and Julie Strain (primary victims). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
