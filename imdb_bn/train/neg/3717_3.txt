Chris Rock, obviously frustrated for a great star-car, will exceed his appeal to white and mainstream black viewers, by updating a 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Wet" by the urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident, who soon removed his soul from his body - as a result, his angels must keep him in the other body, and it could only come with white traders. Recreating a movie as "Heaven Can Wet" and showing as sensitive, only shows that Rock's eyes were at the box office (this was Hollywood's corporate business organized by the majority of tenants). Why not try something longer or more memorable than a neutral rebirth comedy that ended in Apollo? They can do what they can do with awesome support cast (usually reliable Regina King, Wonderful Mark Adie, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levi, and Fierce Frankie Fisson), but Rock seems lifelong and uncertain throughout life. * **** to 1/2
