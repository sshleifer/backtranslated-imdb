I do not have to say anything new: 4 hours people have died in the same mountain. Cast star was, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God Gupta. He wanted to eat silent pie (not for his own for men who died in Curling), rented one of these bright Bollywood directors, rented a real writer, hired a genuine editor, rented a musician, which was not related to him in some ways ( And I think of hearing a bad version of some of the cheap Indian drugs "The Apocalypse Now" ), Had to hire a true professional crew, all firearms had snatched a real story. Unfortunately, he decided to make big cats like the Indian Army, which was terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all died over over. <br /> <br /> Please do not do that again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> Later, an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I think he has appointed more Nepalese to represent the party. Certainly many Nepali men are working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
