This is a decent effort, but a person who wrote a screenplay seems to be somewhat impossible in the dark, which just cools a zombie movie. No, it's not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually I'm not sure whether it is a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what I was saying about them. Anyway my point was - instead of throwing your fiddle ass donation animation to waste your time, do not throw more zombies and more actions. 20 minute 2/3 news bulletin, bugs, something yelling about something. And makes matters worse (more annoying) Most of the deaths occur on the off screen. I do not understand that this is very common for movies in a budget, but then there were some influential effects (good, kind-of) which surprised me why the director (or the authors, whatever,) started this epidemic Focused attention - it's a short, no matter whatsoever to take care of.
