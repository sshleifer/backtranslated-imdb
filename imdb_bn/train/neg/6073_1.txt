* Many of the spinners in this review * were terrible. I'm a huge baseball fan, so I thought I wanted to see it, and I was very frustrated. It's been okay .. When I saw the bad effects of his younger son, Dionero, I hope he will become a good father throughout the whole movie or anything. However, at the beginning, it seemed as if Déronero was considered a hero. He was the only person to believe in Bobby, and he lost his elite son in custody, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when he did not completely kill Primo anywhere ... that song "I **** you want to repeat !!!!" Later, when Denio Bobby's son was saved from drowning, I hope that the movie can free himself. He can save Bobby's son and forgive himself for killing Primo. But of course it's far away from the depth of the movie, because of what he thinks he has got credit for the assassination, and steals Bobby's son, car and dog and kept them hostage - Bobby has to run home only and Dérono is a "true fan" Announces when a picture of a picture knife is shown. <br /> <br /> Now we can see the absolutely unrealistic scene ... It is poured like hell and we are not expected to play the game. Then Denarro appeared wizardly on the grounds of the umpire's suitcase and pulled out Bobby from his house, pulled out his knife and started throwing everyone outside the field. There is apparently no officer in the field (but the police are on their way), so Déronro stepped on the head and shot Bobby in the knife. But do not worry, this delightful and happy movie is a happy end, because Bobby finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is not a sports movie. It's not about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not suddenly psychotherapies that threaten their praise, loot, and throw knives. This could be the worst movie of my life. The plot was shallow, sucked the soundtrack, there was no purpose in the movie. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.
