I hope a comedy like "insurance mama" movies. Instead, the film was a diverse mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> There are three plots on this movie: The first is involved with Madake and her father's child. The second involves a woman who is associated with a wealthy person, who is insulting her. In the third, there is a relationship between single mother and single father with two children. <br /> <br /> There are actually very few comedy movies. There are too many tweeted messages in the film. For example, Meda gives birth to a child (in a ridiculous way) to the child in order to straighten the child. Children, in fact, turn themselves around. Apparently, it gives children a beat. <br /> <br /> Plot involving child rape (with mother's consent) Younger girls related to older men were shown. (Ogling in a family reconciliation takes place.) Skip to the movie plot so that you always balance off. Is it a comedy, a love story, or a drama? It is, in fact, nothing ... without waste time and money.
