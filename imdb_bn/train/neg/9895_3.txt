This book was faithful to the book, but we can only assume that the author is unaware of history. Mark Anthony has never seen the war due to injury in the war. He died in a coward's death by suicide and still, he asked his servant to do this for him. The slave instead chose to kill himself. Real story Marc Anthony decided to be slain by the great courage of slaves and copy him. But even after death, Mark Anthony became drunk and failed to try his own suicide. He shouted for Cleopatra and took him for bloodshed. He hauled his garbage on planting and later died Mark Anthony. If you want history do not see this movie. If you want a romantic drivel you will probably enjoy!
