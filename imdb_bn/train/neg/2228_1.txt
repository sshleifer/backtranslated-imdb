The movie is weak, the box-cover is the most difficult gang in East El and it really says Santa Anna, James Cahill Clolette accepts the queen to take all the tough guys in the gang. It's fake, annoying, stupid and scary, I tried to get my money back from the video store that was so bad in this movie. It was homo-erotic tips rather than a video-box announcement. James Caillhe gay gay should be played in Paris. In each scene of James, he can not work to save his life. This photo is in Eva Langriya who is hot, but James can not even score with him !!!!!!!!! I had occasionally felt gay porn observers and have become by the whole film. James definitely wants to be with the men but then he gets back to gang members again and repeatedly to submit his gay desires. Best of his martial arts skills lowest, some real gang members would accept him and his weak skills and make him a new ripper.
