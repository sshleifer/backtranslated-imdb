"Fly Me For The Moon" will be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. Since I've seen every animated release from my son for the last 4 years, so some say. The story is to be generous ... trite. The voice acting nasty, very intelligent word. The ridiculous roman room is different. Animation is transmitted for nicolodone type cartons, but it's not just a big screen cable television, it's released. <br /> <br /> This is only visible to 3D because it gets 2. The scenes had a slightly tender picture, but we saw a lot in the past. I forcefully ask the filmmakers to fly away from the screen in most of the scenes. First of all, it was interesting but it was tired after the third or fourth time. It remembered my ingratitude on behalf of the creators. <br /> <br /> I would say it was a beautiful cool soundtrack. And my son for the record was not very crazy about it. Bad movie
