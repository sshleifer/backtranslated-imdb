I was very excited to see this image while coming out for the first time in Promose in November! It looked amazing and the song! I was very disappointed when I saw it! This is a movie that combines 6 couple couples. 12 people multi cast! A large number of stars worked in this movie. I think director Nikhil Advani did not operate well, and there were not many people in this film, because it would be easy for him. Nikhil's director's day is far behind than 'Kal Ho Na Ho', 'Salam-i-Ishq'. I think I should throw a small star in the universe. I think the best lyrics in this movie! The songs are nice and I think the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsan-Loy has done a great job and has done wonderful work over the years. I think the rating of this movie can be due to excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed was that the director should not include nudity in this film that is done by Sohel Khan and Isha Coppikar. I found this observer with this extremely rude family! Although, some may find this as a comedy, this is not something you want to see with your parents! I think the best actors Salman and Priyanka were done overall, I think this is a correct film!
