Someone can forgive Ang Lee. Actually, many people do not. And I'll start. Due to some of the worst bad reviews, I was not interested in Anne Lee's film. Even the premium cable channel rarely showed it. I finally decided to look at it in the United States network and, wow .... <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm almost the owner of Ann Lee's Hulk It was not done through. Eric Benda was unclear, Nick Nolt was horrible, unlike Sam Eliot (and it's not funny, he's usually a great character). Actually, I genuinely think that they chose Eric because his unrecognized face was the easiest to match computer graphics - and it is clear that And Hu Hulk had to face like a Bruce Banner in his unruffled state. When Luke fought a mutant puddle, I was ready to accept Halk as the worst superhero movie. <br /> <br /> But something happened. It was a real thriller in about 3/4 of this exhaustive film, and I boldly said - Reasonably convincing - M Border and Helicopter in the Comchanch Desert, breaking into the concert chamber from the Consulate in the military, then a F22 Raptor roams around the stratosphere, only San Will be detained on the streets of Francisco. This is one of the best action sequences created for a superhero movie. And I would say, CGI was quite good. That was not entirely believable. But many non-superhero action films do not require suspension of more disbelief than this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,. And overall, in addition to the animated mutant dog, it seemed like the Hulk CGI that he tried to convince you for the real and in fact interaction with his environment. I wanted it was better than certainly. <br /> <br /> OK, but what is incredible hull? Guess ... It's so annoying! This is only a few appearances by HLK and here is this - CGI terrible in this movie. Maybe Ang Lee's version saw fake and cartoonist at other times - but he had strong moments too. The incredible looks looked ridiculous. It was the tone of the skin and the muscle that could not look like a living creature, just like the computer's textured texture. It was really preposterous. Light, environment and facial effects are not new to the 5-year-old Ang Lee, they are 10 years old. And there really is no excuse for that. We are really living in an era where a computer director programmers can completely destroy the film, like a movie, actor or cinemographer. Worried, the writer and director of this movie can not learn much about and Lee's "failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner Effectively Emotional The general is so relentless, incredibly one dimensional that he feels weak than he is. Love interest is uncertain (I have to pay leverage Tyler's credit for more mentality than Jennifer's counsel, although both are very easy to eye). Team Blake Nelson has done a lot of filming as much as Nick Nolt, though he is in the film for a few minutes. He does not really do much in this movie, certainly not much in Anne's version. The incredible horoscope was a little faster, but since nothing really happened because it is not very valuable. Oh yeah, every bit of look as villain hawk is. He is actually a lot more interesting than humans as a demon. <br /> <br /> This way I can say that Lee's version was even better: If I have an opportunity to see Ang Lee again, I can sit through him to see the order of good, or else try to praise the conversation. A little more (maybe I will move faster in good parts) But unbelievably, there is not a single scene in sight which can be viewed once, only once in a while. It's really the superhero movie hip bottom Cartoonish CGI obscene viewers - at least in the edition of Angie Lee it seems that they are trying to make it realistic (of course, without a huge giant). <br /> <br /> It was a mind-boggling story about how the filmmakers make almost the same film for the purpose of removing the bad feelings related to Angie Lee's hull. <br /> <br /> Because of the achievements of Edward Norton, he is turning away from the film himself.
