About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I will watch over over over. But now ... I do not. Actually, I think this movie was great for Science Theater 3000. Most of its comments-heavy actors (Macaulay Kulkkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Hypie Goldberg) and a beautiful chessy plot. My favorite part is that while Kulkina is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and the gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where do you go?" See also for the classic line, "Do you feel the feeling of your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than "The Good Sona".
