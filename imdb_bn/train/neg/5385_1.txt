I do not know where to start. Cast is full of people who did not do anything before or after. Debralee Scott is listed in the cover box, but the movie is not displayed at all. Writer is also bad for college. With a very low budget, with a view on the similarity with the exaggerated execution. <br /> <br /> Characters are very common for college films - horrible people, sad, black people are na√Øve, tough boys, stupid people, attractive girls, girls in small town etc. The special teacher talks about what you expect ... a heavy set of middle-aged people who easily get upset. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the college flick, stay clear from this one. It's too bad, it's not even fun.
