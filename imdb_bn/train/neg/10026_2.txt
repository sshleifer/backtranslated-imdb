I had some expectations for the film because it was a great star cast and it was the return of both Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to see the movie because this guy wrote the story of the frog franchise, because I hated the smoke 2; But if it is compared with smoke, I would say smoke 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the credit, I felt very nice because it was set in an excellent way. Well, close the first scene yourself * Close me. Then, the main error in the film is the verb verb. My and my friends were smiling at our condolences close to watching these crappy fights. Against 30 letters it was like Akshay and all and even thugs even got machine guns! Pauru ... to see how bad the work you see in this verb has to be seen <br /> <br /> <br /> Another thing about this movie is the much anticipated story. This reminds me of the first few 80 films. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is really just Karin, because it looks really hot. And for this I give a rating <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, you can smile something in this horrible battle scene. <br /> <br /> All things.
