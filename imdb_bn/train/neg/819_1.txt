"Domino Principal" is one of the worst thrills ever made, without any questions. No sense can be made from a narrow plot in a solid sense and by half point you throw your arms in frustration and "I give it !!!" <br /> <br /> Gin Hackman and director Stanley should categorize the worms involved in this zombie only by their piccakes. <br /> <br /> I hope they will spend their money well.
