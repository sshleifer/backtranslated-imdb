Knights could say just one in a series, a pilot, one of the series. Plots (I do not want to say that there was no plot) were not logical and many were wrong, such as [alert, I summarize the plot]: <br /> Some people at the beginning of the movie said that some cyborgs ( Bad guy) but after Climax, he discovered that many of them left. And it was said that it was difficult to kill Siebarg, but after one month of training, Nia could kill her with a single blow. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a genuine kick. I was not surprised when I saw that a handful was a kick boxer. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < If you need a smile, I recommend watching it.
