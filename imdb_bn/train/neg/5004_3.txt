Since the movie went out for a short time, it was ironic. I think someone else reviewed it the same day just before. <br /> <br /> However, I just saw this movie because it has Nick Stahal for the record. </ br> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. Characters have happened to me INSANE, they were SO clich√©s and stereoped. This movie was something of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. <br/> <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the picture, the scene is: "warm heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl kills infamous daughter in the shower . (Well, in fact they were all obnoxious.) But that scene was nice in his acting. The look of his face, it reminds me of American Psycho (a good movie). Viewable but the rest of the movie is not worth watching, do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
