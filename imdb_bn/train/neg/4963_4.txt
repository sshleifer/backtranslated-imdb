Sunny science has become another failed attempt by channel channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was by a young 17-year-old who thought it was extraordinary for the scope croquet in the movie. AAAAAAAH! The part I saw, I lost all hopes. Then ... they were closed for Herod, which saw that Christopher Columbus was on the ship! When they reached the hero, (which is believed to be Nurse Mede), the rebel scientist group agreed to see Hirot as a big stone fort. When I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but the scientist has not been able to make a good film yet, so I do not know why I got my hope. Oh, the grandsle and his mother, fool! (This comment is not about "Grenelle") if it is reading from a scientific channel but here are some good suggestions. There is no idea about every movie you can be about a big monitor that can hijack half the people! And also, stop stuffing the little Grade ACTOR as your Bad Buddy in the film! It does not help the movie, but it works !!!
