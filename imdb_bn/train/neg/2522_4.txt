What a terrible movie! Ideas of robots fighting with each other are great, but the story is ridiculous, real human action is ridiculous, existential and special effects (which depend on this kind of film) are old. I think it should have been made around 80-84 and it was astonishing to see it since 1990. Alien after 5 years! All right, many said that it was good considering low budget, but I think 'What's the point?' It looks completely incredible. I do not want to see a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still like the idea of ​​the great robots scattered from each other.
