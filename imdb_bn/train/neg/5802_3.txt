Nicolai Gogol's story "Viayer" has been recreated and released on home video in the United States by traitor film. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who will only keep an eye on the witch body with her faith to protect her. Extensively expanded in America and it is clearly illustrated in Russia's film (despite all the English marks in the house, cloth and upholstery content, all wrong), this is an extraordinary film that does not really work. Its part is a strange setting that is very difficult to pursue America, but it is not clearly. Some strange, deliberately rare moments, such as a journalist at the beginning and later a priest for a short time. Another reason why dubbing is made in DVD is not sure why they do it. Dubbing is awful. Everyone laughs if they do not have their lips in the camera - or if they have voice, then the lip flap does not match remotely. I do not believe what his films have been blaming, or the producers who are hoping to dump the film in the West (published in pieces). <br /> <br /> The image is not very good. I said it's all kinds of technical issues that just make it a weird ball car io. Despite some really good looking horror images the film does not work as a horror film. Since the film was about to imply the belief, it would have been very confused with this restoration that anyone could surround anyone with God. <br /> <br /> Although I have a choice, I want to give it a pass, even at a dargah bin Nimo. My advice should be to find the story known as Via, the Sanskrit version of 1960, which will explain some of the peaks and some of God's beliefs.
