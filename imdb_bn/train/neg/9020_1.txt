I kept myself awake on the last night watching this thing wrongly. The only thing I could say about this horror film is that it can be used in film school to make a movie without making it. No proper character development, waiting, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hockey and ananeine and the excess use of split screens was lost, sometimes they could not synchronize with alternative shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating. Sadly, this is not too expensive for a little laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a tragic example of the money lost by Hollywood, and now I do not think of my time.
