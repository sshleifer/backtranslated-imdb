Until this new season I have been a big 'little mosque' fan. However, the new season has closed it down. <br /> <br /> The new Christian Vicar has destroyed the whole object of this exhibition. It has always been about living together to overcome the competition. New Vicar ruins that proves Christians in a very bad light and shows Christians. <br /> <br /> I'm not Christian or Muslim, but like to watch the show and see Amar and camaraderie in Reverend. Nothing else. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and complete it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
