As a "Jane Irie" fan I was excited when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "Following this story by the author, someone will turn this movie into a movie." Wrong !!! If the casting director wishes to cut a "jane" he must be successful. But he certainly can find someone who can work. Where was the excitement between Jane and Rochester? Where was the scary mystery of laughter, when laughs somewhere in the night floats from somewhere? Children crying crying crying crying? Finally, why the plot ended? One wonders if the screenwriter was actually reading the book. What a disappointment
