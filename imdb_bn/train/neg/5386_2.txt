Despite being the "big" of this movie, I did not give the sage insight, I knew a little about what was there first ... and what was finished on the screen. I think the "impending freshman" seen the original cut and is being very happy. It was a fun, sexy, raunchy, all-core requirements of a drive-in film. You have to remember it was shot and the rest were released ... animal houses, pigs etc. ... So on their own way, this flicker was far ahead of her time. However, the film was given to half of the original distributor and then edited (What do I say "shuffled?") Sometimes the most random scenes Lean man, man with goat head .... what was that? I'm sure it was kept for extra and so on, but it gradually gradually becomes gradually painful to it gradually gradually. But above all, this is a fun story for me ... especially I can say that I've never seen the worst movie ... I'm inside!
