* Spoiler * Some people claim that the brutal criticism of the media's emotional response to the violence of the natural landmark killers. But the debate overrides the actual content of the movie. Oliver Stone may show as serial killers of innocent people as tyrannical, inhuman killer and reverse it with a morbid media flashy. Instead he supports their argument. The film only depicts every victim as being worthy of being damaged. Incorrectly involved in harmful stereotyping, stone presents offering as unexpected caricatures - stupid rednecks, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The person who is a stereootype of hygiene love birds. Of course, they use old, hallucin-American-Indians - because they are trendy, friendly? Let's make her a pretty letter. Fat, Chinese Clerk and "Hicks" are uncool, so let's think of it as deserving of die. Changing, disgusting, that is corrupted by their miscreants, their anger makes them happy and loves even more. Mickey and Mallorie are sexy and cool and lavish visuals lured to lure people even more outnumbered. Justice is fun. Compared to the GQ killers, police and prison officials are portrayed as cruel, ugly and stupid. Again, this film is not in media reports, but "reality" in the film. There is no flexibility in movie or not impressive - only enhanced performance and visibility. The film does not say anything new or specific about the emotion of violence. The fact that the film has failed in its message is among the real world reactions. Seeing this movie, some influential young people quoted them as inspiration for the assassination that they did. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people to the opposite side with the result of terrible real-life. The tricky message is not seen anywhere.
