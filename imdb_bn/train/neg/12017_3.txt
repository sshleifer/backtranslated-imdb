I was a big fan of Ludl√ºm's work and secret books, and often wondered how incredible they would be in a film. Then imagine my excitement, the movie that really exists! The first Hadith factor in the series is a clear place to start. <br /> <br /> The film was frustrating from the beginning. Grafin is different from the simple material books of the film, and much less joyful as the first interview with Smith. Several characters are thinnerly cast. Sadly, like Darf Smith, at the start Not a bad actor, he just likes an incredibly bad choice as soft and fails to show John Smith's specific characteristics. <br /> <br /> Rename, re-recruit and even reduce this film more inaccurate specific characters. For example, the removal of Victor Tremant and the complete back-story of the virus, because of the involvement of Vacaxham, makes the whole point of the film somewhat frustrating. Marty Jelarbach is a big part of the book, and he comes a lot behind the seat (not to mention that the film's character does not share anything with the character of the book) Another big mistake <br /> <br /> Rachel Russell is probably supposed to be Randy Russell from the book. Although he is considered to be the sister of Sophie Essenden (not to be called Sophia Russell), she wanted to work from the CIA, not "secret-one". Which brings me to my final level, and I think the most important one. The cover one does not even exist at this time! The second book in the series is the secret plan designed by the President as a preventive measure against secret terrorism. <br /> <br /> I could go all day to be honest. In short - if you like books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be frustrated. Even as an action movie, it is usually an average, mainly due to very lazy editing and poor impact.
