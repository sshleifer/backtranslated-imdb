It is incredible that many levels of it are successful to be terrible. Scripts, acting, directions and sheer custom choices are all terrifying. The clothes, sets and pseudo-medieval languages ​​are also awful. In a great way I really enjoyed this movie, once I acknowledge that it is not going to be any good. It seems embarrassing that people will spend so much of the poor and spend time, when they really could do something nice beyond any angle (although not very believable!), But instead of making us rather boring and sugar-free. The story of dragons and knights, that no other lack of charm can be found in the fabulous films. Let's hope the ring lord is a little better! Oh, and David Thewilis's hairstyle makes him think he is Man. It does!
