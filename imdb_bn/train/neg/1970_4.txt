This film is rather spoiled for action, because the pictures of the ship work better than the people. It is a mercy that Anthony Quinn can not persuade anyone else to do any other film after this Turkey. <br /> <br /> But it is filled with entertainment pricing, because there are Yule Brenner's hair, Lauren Green is the French language showing helpless, and the other big names related to comic-book fashion.
