I'm the main fan of the worst genre! I love all kinds of horror / slash / gore flicks. Some of my favorite ones are really "good" bad horror flicks. But there is nothing warrant to watch these movies! I have not been going to talk about all the mistakes in the long run. <br /> <br /> The script is awesome. Acting awesome FX is not even worth the discussion. "Set" is an absolute JOKE !! The sad thing is that I think some actors may be some real potential, but this car has nothing to do with them !!! <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that I think it's "free" I've been looted !! The time you want to see in WASTE this time will spend your cat flossing well.
