After seeing this picture, why not understand why it was not made in the theater! This movie is not eligible for the "Preview" tag. Instead, turn off the previous good movies with a general theme of Hollywood, disaster estimation, and so on. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film jumped in all places like Ping Pong Ball and the development of the character was non-existent. The acting was very bad because I thought I was watching a comedy at some point in the movie. PDDC has to stop filming his horrific act, he really laughs me all the time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I do not recommend watching. If you want to see it, treat it with the film so that it closes the original, because that's exactly what it is.
