This long wind image appears to be less about its effect on Barkovits and NYC, but there is more to illustrate the character of a particular group of Italian-Americans, locally known as "Guidos". The problem is, "Guido" is reluctant, it does not matter which type of story or setting they are submerged. They have already survived the characters, so Lee simply increases them instead of just portraying them. <br /> <br /> Someone else has a joke, they do not go home and say, "Hey, ears and nose should be too big!" Lee did what this has done. The two most striking characters of the film (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape from the "guides" lifestyle. Especially it is one of the top stories with an unintended story about John LeGuZamora and you've got a great movie to fall asleep. Especially considering its long run time. One more strike against it: Someone announces Yankee fan and has grown up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phill Rijato, which made off credits wrongly.
