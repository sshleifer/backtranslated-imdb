John Goodman's program was pretty awful, but this thing just stinks plain. The only and only thing in this world that gives me the recognition of Patrick Starfish's voice frosty to laugh at me. The story is hopeless, anyone who wrote down the memories of childhood rebellion, but did not achieve an adult's view in the interim period. Paranoia is the rule in the dark world that these characters live. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the exhibition churches are unexpectedly unexpectedly from an insufficient view, and on the other hand it is not fun to see it. The worst thing is that the production worker seems to have seen the snow ever!
