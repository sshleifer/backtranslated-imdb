We like Rock and Jack Black School. We could not wait to go and watch this movie. The only time in my life was that the movie was so bad that I wanted to walk. My husband is very hated The only interesting part was the trailer. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and people wanted to save their money. The writing was horrific. It was terrible stereotype to Hispanic people who should be completely offended. The film was not so long, but it seemed to us like an eternity. People in the theater were so unstable and were silent to see it paint dry. I let my husband stay because I was certain that some might be part of the liberation but were not there. You save money and your time.
