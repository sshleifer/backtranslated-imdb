Richard Tyler is afraid of everything. He does not like to ride his bike or climb up his tree house because he knows that any kind of accidents can happen to him. So one day he is riding his bike and the rain is starting, so he decided to wait in the library until it rains in the rain. The whole story takes place there. He experiences all types of staff and ultimately he is not afraid anymore. But the whole story is unbelievable and McClei could not make better than Kulkina's good actor.
