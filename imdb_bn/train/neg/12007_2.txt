Until the day of the liberation of All-Advani, it was astonishing to be able to attract people to the theater. I mean ... look at the cast here, the promotion is superb, good enough songs and trailer fines. It makes a house full on the first day, but whenever people go and watch the movie, they realize that their money is not refundable. House full of the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> This picture is inspired by 'true love', what they say is not managed to manage the whole cast. They tried to grow bigger, but ended up ending with an average management performance. The stories are Hole and Chesi, so the audience can not connect with any of them. After the big success of 'Bara ho na ho', it is frustrating for the big stars or for the full admiration of this matter.
