Have beautiful landscape shots. Authors putting trite mouthings in the mouth of the author. This show will be stupid with fewer actors. 'Art must be humanity or it's raising BS.' Not only that, all of the art of highlighting the movement of humanity and the dark side is also revealed. Say no to the lead character even those shadow sides do not get hidden. Wrong, he lived in the dark and impaled his dark side and one dimensional that stretched his horizons without his underground. The expression of his work or his pain was not a breath creature. All artists had limited themselves to a dozen visible dime. The discussion was in the grade school, the staff of the staff always gave a letter of the above character wanted by the author. I try to like it after reading all the first fan comments here. I had to dig deep to see who agreed with. I was from those who attached great comments images. I was removed only once on the end. The baby was very passive way. The scenery was fantastic and the music was ridiculous. Just show me my opinion but somewhere for me.
