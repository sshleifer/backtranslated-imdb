Speaker Alert In this generic and forgotten action movie, Lorenzo Lama plays her usual tough guy / beautiful boy and beats his future real life former Catholin Kimmant Hot Chick Aleka. Oj Simpson is a detective intelligence agency, who is coastal on her due to her invisible general public figure. Translation: Cable TV Fillers There is not enough skin to qualify it as a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> There are some gaping holes in the script. Best / worst moments: In a blurred scene, Ozz's partner expresses his abortion in the morgue. OJ responds that some of the body is quite hot, or that effect sounds. Reference to this vague necrophilia is quite offensive; But after the release of the film shortly after the release of the murder, it is really dissatisfied, and hence it is an unknown, dangerous way of entertainment. I was so frustrated that I smiled till the champagne was out of uncleanness. Now that's a guilty Pleasure. BC
