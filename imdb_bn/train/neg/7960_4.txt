The second volume made me gooey like a little goat because I rented it. I snuck down in the morning in the morning, starting watching HBO, and the Rough (Segment 2) good terror to me. Almost this time, I still enjoyed Theft, although I could not say whether it was for nostalgic reasons or it is actually a good summary. The other two parts were full trash. I can not believe in a producer somewhere to make this junk. The more I've accomplished by seeing all this, the memory of a childhood is destroyed. Crippo 2 will now be added to the list of my childhood childhood classics. 4/10
