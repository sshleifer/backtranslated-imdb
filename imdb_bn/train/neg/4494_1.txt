*** Spokilar *** *** Spokilar *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> The whole film itself is broken from here. First we fill in a rogue program with hints and hints to get vampires and VruVolve and the like. We've got a man with a boring expression that is a continuous trash, two 'ghosts' which do not serve any real purpose and there is no character which is a collection of eternal and spying. Someone told me that they are vampires (just outside Blade 2), but they are so indefinite that I did not understand. <br /> <br /> Funny funny man with laughable name enjoys the same problem as Oracle, only far and away. There is a common point about its cause and effect, it creates it, then it creates it and it creates it until it becomes slower and stupid. Before traveling, Storm's final line was "You know what will happen to anything ..." Line lines can be compared to linear disorders in X-Men. Chocolate cake is such a lazy, kind cliche and Monica Bellucci is the wife as we have nothing else to do with anything else than what we are just in her face. <br /> <br /> And then we get another Kung Fu war !!! Why? Neo, spoken, one. He can do anything He has the ultimate power and he uses it for what he is. Kung bloody fu all the time. And when he can close 1000 bullets, he is still using the sword and still feeding 5 unknown henchens (vampires). I wanted to see the power of mind leakage. I wanted to see him the most intelligent, crazyiest most crazy *** people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without 'oops'. <br /> <br /> Stealth Car Chase. That can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's not going to fix that's what we've been typing it on. All cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Everybody So perhaps all is well received from us so we now have a good Chase sequence, guess what, a Kung Fu war !!! All right, it was not, but you thought that he explained the matrix reality to his closest friends. At least teach them something. It's not difficult <br /> <br /> "Do not worry about what's going on with you in the Matrix, hey, morphias, this is not real, as long as you realize that nothing can hurt you if nothing is real." <br /> <br /> you go there Simple <br /> <br /> All right, so Chase is not bad. It's not annoying and it does not look like 16 minutes. It's just so damn it And yet, it becomes worse. <br /> <br /> The final measurement of the film is probably the worst imaginable. They are involved in three crews that have this full comprehensive plan. They only see it sporadically in Morphius's long, super-racism, stubbornness. To make it worse, how they never explain the three groups that need this plan. You know basically, but you do not know who is working, when, when a crew goes down you have no difference and you do not know how it is going. <br /> <br /> I'll sum it up though, so it can get back to the matrix to setup the Trinity end. That's the only reason that it is. Which raises the question, why were they essentially sending 6 people? Trinity itself gets in five minutes! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the matrix (so to speak) is lazyly operated. Ooohhh !!! He runs in another 100 agents Smith !!! Woooooo !!! That must certainly be a lot of thought. Just now they have no scale of fighting in a corridor and over a moment. People, what a grand finale !!! <br /> <br /> and then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember what I said about Orrell and foreign people? Add them together and double it, the way the architects are really dissatisfied. His only reasonable possibility is that he is going to set up Clifting Climax. Choose a door and die all humanity (without 27 !!!). Choose another and all humanity dies !!! The preferred choice tries to explore this movie which it does not really give to its hero. If he has an alternative to preserving humanity and Mrs dies or saves a mother and kills humanity, it is patentic for internal pain and pressure. Also, along with the collapse of the Trinity, the actual caliphate was expected to see the third possibility. But not He did not save anyone or saved Mrs. <br /> <br /> Now, Neo was the worst thing about the original Matrix, and eventually came back to life. After the year came out, how stupid was all, they did not see that the last part of the Matrix was watching Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me that I will fall in love with him, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br Well, they will end up with the main look. How? Well, almost doing the same thing again (only sipping the letters) Just so bad I think if I keep writing before I become worse, then my phone and the keys will be refined. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is not really just a cliffhanger. This is a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this picture is just bad. I do not want to be really bad, but it's Just so many ways are bad. And to make things worse, it's not a movie that's not a budget enough. It's not a film with a schedule too short. This is not a movie that has come out. This is not a film that has many effects from the outside. This is exactly the way to make Wachovsky's film with the fate of Warner behind them. And that's what makes this terrible so. At least the Ranceed Aluminum can say that it does not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
