After seeing and showing the post (yes, I really like the duct), I decided to try another UV Bow movie and I chose the shed because it fell on the local DVD store and it could be better films <br /> <br / > <br /> The first 10 to 15 minute film was very committed and at the very start of the mainstream emotional thrill, it seems to be soon Here it is turned aside, and eventually received the maximum reduction. I have seen Generic Slashar films so far, there are plenty of plot holes, unrealistic emotional reactions and sub-atomic roles. It seems that Bull did his best to bring a decent plot but after a while he left it. Maybe he should stick a comedy?! Some good things about this movie are that they are able to create an overall obscure atmosphere, special effects are better than my expectations and soundtracks can work well with the overall atmosphere, but the unsupported pensing story of this film makes his last appearance in the last half of the watch quite tiring, Which completely destroyed my experience. There is a very fairly good shocking view, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will create a good picture one day, because she is hoping to make a decent in many horror movies. The film is now and then. Seeds are not the only ones.
