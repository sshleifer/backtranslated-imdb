I give this movie 3 because it is worse than the best version movies. 2. Is it no mean for you? Well, do not have to do this. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, I am incredibly stupid plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hatches) fight a space race of vampires killed. <br /> <br /> Is it any advantageous? Than this? The only good thing in this movie was the Natasia Malt, with its wonderful Norwegian beauty. God, I want Michael Iranside and Dilus brothers to stop playing stupid role in foolhardy movies! I mean, at least the Saguists were nice! I know Mr. Iranside from many movies, he has played 164 movies on this day !! It is true that he rarely had a major role, but still!
