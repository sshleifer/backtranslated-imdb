The only aspect of this film to preserve it from my favorite favorite part of the celluloid trash is to tell a man who tries to infiltrate humans to a tomato dress by dress: "Can anyone pass the key?" I used this film as extremely harmful to induce someone with a sleep disorder; It works better than an overdose of Demraul.
