I saw this movie at a toronto film festival with fairly strong expectations. It would be good if the movie was off on a great cast and festival, so did not? I was so wrong. <br /> <br /> I knew that when the director of the movie was instructing when we were in danger, he was an unknown actor named Kevin Spasi (author of a director / scientist / writer) debut = blah ... as well as Edison The director / writer must have pictures of some pictures of homeless man killed in Kevin Space, because I can not see how he (with other actors in the film) Agree on. Disaster <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely scary! It is a mixture of every superhero super cup of warm clich√©. There is nothing new to Edison. The acting was bad and the direction was even worse. It looked wise like that aforementioned episode that wiseguy. This video I've ever seen was directly casted straight into the movie. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples of bad evil moments in Edison ... Because there is no reason for Morgan Freeman to not dance around his apartment, there is no reason to rock and roll songs ... Justin Timberlake got creative criticism from his Bell around his apartment By candle ... llcoolj driving an alcohol firebird ... 3 guys are being shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a good contrast. Stay away from <br /> <br /> EDISON!
