Spyware can be ... but it can be really obvious! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One word can be summed up in five eyes .... amateur. This film tries to be different from most of the movie 'Blair Witch' .... It does not work .... It just shows up in the end and it seems like someone has decided to make a cheap video camera, a van and a movie. There is no explanation for the story, the hero has not given any real motivation (and looks like a lesbian with a tail-lace compared to five daughters) and there is no violence to speak ... only the words of screaming and cries. The whole movie takes place inside the van, which means that in the beautiful scene the question is beyond. Five girls do their best with what they have really done, but they all come across as a terrible actress ... although they can actually judge the given elements, but it is difficult. They spent the whole movie screaming, screaming and blurring .... It was hard to do what was said in the half time and the cameras are so bad that it's really hard to tell who it's really hard to say. This video portrays itself as a violent torture film, but in reality only five of Van's girl screams terror ... that literally uploads the whole film ... we end up after 5 hours, and then all five daughters still alive. ... one minus one with a finger. Only fingerprints (finger ... LOL) have received hard work for poor actors and probably lost their voice (and their pride) after creating this terrible movie. Do not judge by this poster .... You will be very left.
