Often, films about self-disgusting characters are not usually for drama. 'Downloading Nancy' is no exception. This is based on a real story, that anyone who visits the Internet with any woman on his own request has killed it. <br /> <br /> The drama (Maria Belo) who is married to Albert (Rufus Seal). Albert is a successful software developer who has created a golf game that has successfully sold his company in several bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive characteristics (without his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a serious and dour expression on his face. His patronage does not sympathize with his wife about all his mental problems and resorts to patronize. When his wife asks for sex, instead of masturbating in her hand, she is punished. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He could not get married at the age of 15, but when his uncle grew up, the victims of sexual assault Be (thanks, the person in the film has no flashbacks). Her self-hatred takes the form of self-disorder, and consequently she is forced to do therapies. However, his therapist has such contempt that no progress can be made. Finally, Nancy is so depressed that he contacts Louise on the Internet. She is a sadomasochistic gigolo type, who is sexually active for women while inflicting huge amounts of boots. It is known that Louise has two children but they are no longer seen (the kids do not want to do anything to her) <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is a painful sex with Louie Then kill him. During Lisi's relationship with Nancy, there is particularly unpleasant scenes where her vagina area slashes with a broken piece of glass. After an interview with Lewis Albert, these scenes are shown as flashbacks, who compromise him and attack him with a golf club. Looks like Aluve has two dual plans with Albert: 1) Take him down for Nancy's treatment and 2) Enjoy the injury he has received. Louise Nancy's fate will take some time before publishing? First, he forced Albert to take his dog to relative so that someone would take care of him in the future. The fate of Nancy, of course, is that Louie is finally pushing her to death (but she has some hesitation because she makes clear that she has some feelings for him). We soon learned that Luis was imprisoned for life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Should we feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and victims of domestic violence? What is the main point of this photo? Nancy actually sympathizes with sympathy? I do not think so. Which of the characters of the film's author Albert has created a Stro Man? Someone who is so distant from his emotions that he is responsible for the fall of Nancy. But man is one dimensional in real life? I do not think so. Their vengeful Louis, a man who lives under torture, calls on Albert to ignore Nancy. Then, expressing the expression of his love towards Nancy (before killing him before), was supposed to show his 'sensitive side'. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, whether the filmmakers are lying with their sympathy, it is a little too important. Different characters in the film They are so anxious to headline their audience with unidentified violence scenes that Nancy does not have much more than the poor taste and soft pornography exercises.
