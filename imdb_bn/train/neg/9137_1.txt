What can I say, it's a part of making an awesome movie that won Oscars A copy should be kept safe in a safe vault for breeding. It should be needed to look for all the high school students in the world. Sam Morovic is the best writer / director / producer / chef / babceter / walmart girter who is always a genius in the cinema world with his industry. <br /> <br /> Where do I start from? Ben and Arthur Milliskund was so exciting! And Arthur as Morovitch, wow, he's so attractive I'm surprised he's. Do not go for the Universe. I could not hold myself during the nude scene. I lented this picture to my brother and he called me by phone and said that Arthur's nude scene turned him into a gay. I certainly must be helpful because of this movie and of course the well-equipped reading of tolerance. Why did I burn a church yesterday and I wrote for his "Smoking and Arthur" in his Smoking Eishme <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing about this movie. When the Fed-X plane took Vermont's date tree to the sky, I started crying! Why, I did not even know that they had palm trees in Vermont or people could travel to the Fed-X plan before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new state of possibilities. This film inspired me to register for Sam Morovich's screen writing, acting, directing, composing, casting, producting, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Marovich. Thank you for bringing this creation to the world, we can not pay you enough money."
