I have already seen fantastic stories, but this account is so incredible that it comes near very ridiculous. A rich and young man can prevent heart disease after his marriage, and he can kill anybody by looking at his own surgery and the conspiracy of his surgeons. Even if there is a medical explanation for such an incident, then what happened next is a mix of dialogue ... Say ... soul? ... Perhaps and in real life where dedicated mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shadow of mystery or thriller, just a combination of a bad and simple plot which can not live with narrow continuity. It is not like saying that this movie lacks the full quality - actually, for the first time, director Jobie Harold has done a good job in managing a good team of actors, among which Henden Christian's first major role is Anacin Skywalker's clothing, Fantastic Jessica Elbow and Super Gifted Lane Olin. All will deserve a good story
