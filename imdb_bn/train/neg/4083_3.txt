I saw this movie when I was released, and my distaste for me is stuck all these years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Will be in the sense. If a character says, "My heart flies away," then we will show an actual human heart, to connect the feet to the bird, to flap across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process creates something delicious for the table, but ultimately it is a simple practice. And it has become terribly annoying. <br /> <br /> I do not feel ashamed of the joy that other viewers of this movie have received, but it is worth knowing that not everyone was happy with the audience.
