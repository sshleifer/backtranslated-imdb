I saw this movie (originally Brady Carbot is in it), and I would definitely say that I was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were amazing, but there was a need to touch the lines of the story. Also, I think this movie has worked better with more sharia and blood, as well as it is rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> This will certainly attract more people -> teens What will be attracted to more teenagers (especially teen girls), will be a big close up of Bradie Corbet on Thunderbird poster! <br /> <br /> While the movie was below it, I have seen it and it looks okay!
