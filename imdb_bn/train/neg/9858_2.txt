This movie is not funny. It just takes diamond stereotypes of D & D and enhances them. All major characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially annoyed, and their women have no luck. Curiosity is terrible and unimaginable, as two gamers were hurt by the black dwarf because one of them was looking for KKK (this was his wizard's costume) and another guy was up John W. Rakker's warm up (oh how fun, he's a nerd so he's about sports I do not know). You could be a boy's high school to find any fun in this thing. Watching badly done mockmuntaries is so painful, but probably highly inexpensive. I'm sorry for Kelly Labor and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess this is the only opportunity available for hotties in their main past ways.
