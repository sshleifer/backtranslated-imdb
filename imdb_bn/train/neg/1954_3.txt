First, find out the way. . . Yes, this movie stole a lot from 'Darkness Fruit' (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Fruit' became something like that: Toth Fair, a murderer, who hides her face because of her face, kills people to take revenge. 'The Tooth Fair' (2006), The Blind Tooth Fair (who, yes, hides his face) reveals his fierce vengeance only to someone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />? It definitely made some bonuses in the box office, but it was strictly for the fairly dramatic experiences of the film's release. A low budget, direct-to-video movie will not have the same effect. And it did not. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations really increased. At least some production quality started to happen. The story does not seem terrible, just ripped off just blatantly. The first scene is past, we can get a perfect cast of characters with the former doctor along with the secret doctor (he is played by a person who looks like Bushi) and some hot veterinary students (Argentina's Master of Horror: Jennifer to Jennifer). But after a few minutes, the film gradually moved down the drain. It is not limited to, but with all basic horror cliches: some illiterate alarms, deaf stupid jokes, emotional, and some crazy persons with stereotypes of heart hearts. <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this movie is the disability of the target audience. Like this, filmmakers wanted to change the voice for any character at that time. There was an adult screen, it was a more mature feeling. When the star (stripper) and the hashfaces (joke) were on the screen, the dialogue became more stupid, unexpected, the mistake was made. When the child was on the screen, it seemed as if 'hey u Drain of the Dark?' . . <br /> <br /> <br /> Technically, this image is everywhere. Visual range from visual plain to plain rare. Acting as the most part of the writing, is subpar. On the plus side, in some areas there is a lot of grape presence (a fairly cool (still painfully expected) with a wooden leopard scene and a beautiful nostalgic nylon scene. Also, if you look for some of the sexy stuff, then a short tops scene (but you want to see this chick topples but there are better movies to do this). Even more, the movie never gets annoyed. <br /> <br /> If you are a huge fan of 'Darkness Crop' (they exist?), then you can test it to see a different story. . . But, this is the only reason I can see it. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
