Many critics are honored by one of the biggest stinkers of all time (especially the biggest stinker in the career of director Brian de Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hendes) is a smug-rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in an injury and run. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, to remain? It seems to combine comedy, drama, and satirical, but it does not add much to make sure. It is unlikely cruel, one is neglected by the dimensional character which you would never ever get the satisfaction of real-life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not finish it because it was not my favorite) but it is clear to me that those who have enjoyed the novel / this film are completely Thinks extremists. <br /> <br /> I have never worked with many talented actors low quality films for quality adjustment and failure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the role of Peter Fellow in the novel was a Brit. Bruce Willis badly, the role badly miscast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is turned into a strange French. <br /> <br /> I like the combination of talent; For that I would give ten out of four, but I'm sure some people would say that a source material could be made much better than the movie.
