Of course, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. She was a fine actor till a woman's fragrance, where she apparently overdosed unexpectedly. I hope this picture, in which I could not grow up, it would be a nice little gem. A skeptical, ahead of his time, intelligent and compelling city-political thriller. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once that you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. Indeed, however, due to this mistress and concussion, finally the result of the trivial and very familiar urban story trademark, such as corruption power, the two face politicians, the mafia in the relationship with the police, and theoretically, this setup has some exciting excitement, fear of someone who is safe, and some Fear may happen! But again, it is not really that. Unfortunately, the only thing that's happening is quite predictable, and many of our "confession" is left with psychology, which becomes completely modern. The kind of a text of moral ambiguity in the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of the name and missing reports, false and cover-ups, a spider-web viewer is generally considered to be a little more satisfying. I do not think we are left with him in City Hall, and when it is a complete movie, I can not find absolutely rich.
