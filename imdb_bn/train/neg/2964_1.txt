Very disappointing - because it's so incredibly bad - sorry guys, but of course I'm one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, however: Actors behave like soap, dialogues are absolutely painful and last time I'm weird The picture was seen ten years ago at a trash night on some youth video festivals. I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least one specific quality should be earned. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were silent and OK - and the score was really audible. The DVD cover promises a lot, but this is the best offer for this movie ...
