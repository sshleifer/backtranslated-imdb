I think it's almost all necessary to say this. I feel compelled to explain my actions though. I basically have not seen such a armature production, and I mean in all sense of the word. Although he works on physical cameras, MIIC operation and other technical aspects of this movie have been threatened, unfortunately it is not the only area. <br /> <br /> Some classic independent films that have been preserved by their scripts, in contrast to character and plot, unfortunately this is a scary script, horror performance and the worst, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is an offense that has 101 other indie films for every independent film distributed like Heku Tunnel, which has died silent. I do not know who the Koranblut brothers knew in Soni, but this amateur family can never be produced as my only explanation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope this review will save some people who might be interested to see the title of this movie. I saw many movies in my time, and when I was very sorry for the movie, but it was too much. To identify an important aspect of my experience in the film, I will never forget the 'tunnel'. Shame It's so Low Point.
