Gadar is a vague story because it tells a fake story. It is very unreasonable and it is a common sunny deal which aims to ban Pakistan. The aim of the movie is to distract the viewers so that they think that Pakistan and its government are bad. You can not try to hide your mistakes. All the songs and songs in the movie are all bad. In most cases, Sikhs will love movies because they are confused. The film became tough. I think Amitah Patel was just fine in the movie. If I could give 0 to 10, the minimum is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not see this stupid film. Dyestar
