This whole film should last for 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme, it does not really develop as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid) bomb disposal specialist (cowboy?) Was introduced and it happened very early in the film, the rest are repetitive. Characters are not searched, and the position and politics aspects are ignored. There was some great insight into the problems faced by the soldiers in the foreign environment and the differences between friends and enemies. But in that way the unit-driven belief! Personal performance was good, and special effects were enough, but not enough to exceed the basic lack of content.
