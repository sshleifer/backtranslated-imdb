I was so frustrated by this show. After listening and reading all the hoopla, how it was "ground broken show" and the quality of all wild wild promises, I tried to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What! The acting path was compelled and very much. The story made very little sense. For any indication of "look at the lives of teenagers", I could only see a relentless effort, which was a reality for him as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some people wonder why so many people have a negative comment about this show. Because it's not really good and the drum on the quality of this show helps to attract attention only to how badly it is made.
