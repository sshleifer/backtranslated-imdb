Thank God! I did not waste my money to rent it but I downloaded it! This can be the worst movie of all my life, f ***** g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Night of the Living Dead and others like other Jabber films. There are lots of movie loop holes and mistakes. Okay if you get the time after reading this comment, then see the manager (Ulli Lommel) profile. I found that why the movie got such a spontaneous explanation, I understand that each movie directed by Wolfy Lomel gets a rating between 1 and 2. Now I do not want to search for movies that are directed by him, but I can finish all these by saying a strong sentence. Please do not even see this movie, for fun or time pass or even for an extreme annoying situation.
