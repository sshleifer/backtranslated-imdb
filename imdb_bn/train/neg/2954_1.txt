I see many bad movies, much !!!!!! It's really a hobby type. Almost every Saturday hates friends and I get together and see the trash from around the world - some Turkish Super Hero Movies, Vampire Flight from Brazil, Italian Gorilla Transplant Film, Kevin Coster, some films (probably helen raising), but no more movie than ivy Theodore Rex. Ever. And it's not even bad in the Ed Wood way - it's just SUCKS. This film was famous in Hollywood when it was hippy and stopped the gloves and made the press clear and anyone else heard that he was frustrated by the crash of the crash = he tried to get out of his contract, he screamed, he moaned but nevertheless They are ghastly to see that this leather skin poured its fat butt into the tight future police uniform, okay !!!! And you can only see his time - doing everything but watching the camera for his agent so that he can scream at him. Dinosaur has almost three facial expressions and the script can do a great job for such a terrible third class class committed cookies.
