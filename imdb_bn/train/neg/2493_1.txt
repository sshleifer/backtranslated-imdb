A really awesome movie. I did not initially know that it was a Kiwi effort - but soon I realized that all the characters are rarely talking to the masked QE accents under fake Americans. Why is it still necessary to set America? - It could be set in NZ and then the actors could use their normal voices. Of course, anyone in the production team can hear the terrible effort of talking to American accent? A bad bad film I'm surprised this has been going on for a long time - how can it do it? It looks like a Seagull / Willis type action man Flick's very bad attempt. The total meaning of money! If there is any tax payer in this piece of trash, I will conduct a revolution to return all the money in the Treasury. I still saw that the absolute trash I saw (it's crazy, reeling!). Why do I continue to watch? Well, I'm a movie playful and can not help myself!
