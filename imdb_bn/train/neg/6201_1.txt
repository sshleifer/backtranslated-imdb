I saw it. It's not "good" but interesting in an understated way. The boys are quite natural but ................ graphic / unexpected final gang rape scenes are overwhelming and yes yes - intentionally insertion of the footage of World War II is objectionable. It is the way to compare the real horror with this misogynistic talent. . The real torture is real - this movie is just rogue. However, the film is a look which can attract you. But I think that "Emperor's new clothes", but actually the opposite. The movie looks good, but you take away the direction, story, content and final feeling that is away from this movie, it is empty. If a feeling can be null - this is it.
