I just have to be vague about my potential spoiling comments. This movie contains adequate canadon plot material which is essentially pre-damaged. <br /> <br /> This movie has achieved some ideas from McKinnard on Southern Classic to Two. I think that Tokyo has got its ideas from some sources ... at any rate, after you see it, you say, "oh yes, it's a ripoff". <br /> <br /> I really think this is about amusing things about McMovies once you are detecting a plot element, whether it is sticking to the original with the sticks, or trying to wrap it around. This one does not have a lot of twists.
