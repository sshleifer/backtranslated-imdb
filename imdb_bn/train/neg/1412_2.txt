While watching this movie, I came with a script for a movie, "The Making of 10 IT's or Less": Producer: I have good news and bad news. Good news, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Author: This is cool! But what's the bad news? Producer: We can only hire him for a day. I think we have to get someone else. Writer: So we hired him for a day. A movie is an hour and a half long. One working day is eight hours long. I fail to see a problem. Producer: But ... he must spend time in character. Writer: So we play him a character <br /> <br /> Producer: But he still has to understand his motivation and all that. You do not say we have played him a big-name actor, who is doing low budget movies, producer: it's ridiculous. ! But fine, at least we will have our movie Morgan Freeman. And I guess we need to set the movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Authors: Of course, this script is a burden of greed. We'd better earn money on this. All right, Morgan Freeman's character is plug wall mart or target or a shop, so at least someone wants to sell the DVD. <br /> <br /> Author: Sure thing! Producer: Wait a sec ... What about a small bandga with a "ten or less" express lane? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I guess it's weird. But now we can not change the title! <br /> <br /> I think my script is very similar to the real reality, but still "10 items or less" is not. It played well, but is a case of bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. While watching an independent movie, you hope to try to publish some kind of message to it. I think they are trying for tired adults, "Do not return anything", the message has died in many good movies. In any case, "10 items or less", the message I received was "See Morgan Freeman!"
