This movie was enormous, totally unavailable, and it was disgusting with friends while drinking at home empty-handed. I really LOVE the opening element with lisa folding around in a fantastic city. I want to be a beautiful stranger, who lost some foreign European local, although not in a low budget horror flick. Will definitely end where weird non-sex scenes are cut (anyway in my DVD copy). Do not try to understand it, just go along and look for the weird bit ... which is everything. If you really want to plot or characterize or understand something, do not see it. Beautiful, though you can give it up and like to watch a real horror movie, like the DaidAlive.
