"Tapeheads", a scrappy, music video business, can sometimes be funny, tricky, comedic, short, and instantly, in the jumble of the nonsensical chaos involved in star junior cusack and team robins. They are playing two semi-intelligent security guards at Los Angeles, who start their own organization, video access, group, team, and star of death for funny videos. It is very bad that filmmakers had to discover a lower level plot to pad the running time (disciplines involved such a notorious politician and her pregnant who did not do much beyond the primary power of the movie, sending music culture late ' 80s). Yet, Cusack and Robins have created some original origins here: Silly but loose, hipsters or road-smart without position, these boys are in the same soft wavelength, and they do not put each other down. They are real things in a friend-comedy. * **** to 1/2
