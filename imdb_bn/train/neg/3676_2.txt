Susan Swift is an attractive young man, replacing a flower baby in 1980 (like a young Susan Day), but there is no voice range for her dramatic lead and she weeps; Still, she has rather sweet and bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In "The Coming" (as was briefly released in the theater), Swift could be a Salem Witch Revival. Flick is a very low budget and many other pictures from the series that I've been able to spare for about 15 minutes. It starts strong and has some camp appeal. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the Salam witch trial which can be seen in this regard. However, as junk goes in the movie, it is not very scary. A specific plus of Boston local, and throwing supporters are amusingly hammy. * **** to 1/2
