I did not know anything about this movie and I went out about half an hour to know everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm usually a nice person but someone told me that they liked this movie, probably I would not talk to them again. Perhaps it's likely to have a very dry, innate kind of personality probably like it's instant. I'm going to include them as they think they are very intelligent, like a self-centered furte bag, who make voice for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people can not even like me, but okay; Although I do not think of any range of this comedy. This movie is flat and dull as the mind of Was Anderson. Go inside and get ready for a walk; It is very good to get your money.
