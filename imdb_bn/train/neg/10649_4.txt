16 years later, the final film as Jonny Weasmullar's 'King of the Jungle', playing the role of Tarzan and Marymidas, is the brightest of its fans, but everyone is frustrated. At the age of 44, Hollywood's most active 'party creature' was a former Olympian who was far away from the thin athletics of his youth and was tired (though he was slightly better compared to his previous entry, Tarzan and Huntsre) <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Was not too old for his role in Vesemulara; Jonny Sheffield, the little 'Boy', she grew up from childhood (she was a strapping 17 years old), so she was written from the script, 'far away' under the farce in school. At the age of 35, Brenda Joos was present as the fourth movie of her five film 'Jane' (she will be transmitted while Lex Barker becomes the new Tarzan at the Magic Fountain of 1949) and is still sexy in the same way as before. <Br /> <br /> In Rocko, small budget, produced by Sol Laser, cast and crew took advantage of cheap labor by filming in Mexico. Although the location was the most dark Africa, it definitely gave Hispanic winds, but senior director Robert Florr greatly included this country in the story of the arch diving and the Eggetic Temple. When a small island girl (Tiren Power's future bride, Linda Christian) was rescued in a jungle river in Tarzan, she learned that the local director-general (George Zucker, one of the longest villains in the film) slaughtered the population locally. And threatened the punishment from living God. They do not bid it. She was elected to be the 'God's bride', so she ran away. You can say faster than you, 'Is this a fool plot?', This girl was abducted by the priest's pregnant and returned to the island and followed Tarzan, later Jane, the colorful Spanish character 'Benzie' (charmingly John Lorenz, Music), and a government commissioner is stopped to take the god and his priest (left behind Cheeta). After a series of discoveries (everything else), everything comes from the 'God', an ordinary mask of the mask, working with the priest in the milk of a pearl bed in the milk), a great deal of victory, and music by Comic Relief and Gun Benzie. Expected happy conclusion <br /> <br /> In particular, Tajan and Merimidas score a musical score from a bright film composer Dmitry Tommkin, and is much better than what you expect from this 'B' movie! <br /> <br /> This image will give the best of luck to the time of Wrestler of Linecloth in Linecloth (although he will soon go to play jungle gym, AP Man's more diverse change, Khakis) The genius involved in talent raises a little above a little above the total mess Taken <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
