With most of Ben Affleck's films, comedy is dry and the story is predictable. If you want to call this a story Many points were left connected with any thoughts. I want to thank the director for not pointing out the points well. I say that, because torture means long lasting. Ben Affleck's failure is not an exception for any reason and it may survive by other actors. Yet, in most cases it was played and not credible. Memory lane was not worth the price of trip trip with the actors not seen in the year. All should think about it, they are very quickly joining the "have been" posts. My choice was to fix my car or wait to watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. Above all I would give it a smile ... mainly because of all that I got to find it.
