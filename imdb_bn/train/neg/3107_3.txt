Woody Allen had created "September", even a genius could even screw up evidence. This is Mel Brook's "September". Man-made stupid, annoying, and lazy, I must admit I did not see it in the end. Some of the insulted ones (e.g. "Money Pat", "Out to the Sea", "Spitfire Grill") Flickr forced me to sleep or forced me to reach the "rewind" button. And I'm sorry, as a dedicated mail Brooks fan. She should leave straight comedy stick and social comment alone. The creator of "Young Frankenstein" and "Spotballs" could poke a dog like me. All costs will be avoided.
