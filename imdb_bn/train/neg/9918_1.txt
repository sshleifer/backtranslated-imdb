Other British movie flags flutter. Here again the real trash offer. I do not understand (and I'm British) why at the top, patriotic confidentiality was ever created. EIGHT years marked you, when World War II has finally ended! Here the commenters of other commentators commented on the continued use of the footage and the archive. This is extremely poorly observed. The archive footage is in abundance. The model airplane hangs from the cables in the windscreen 'action scenes' like many children in the air. Normal Map Room Sequences make the movie tattooed in our entire Malta event. Guinness must have his worst performing performance. The threat back to the dog fight scene ridiculous. Hawkins says that the room area of ​​the map causes death to us. Ealing made many great movies. This is clearly not one of them. Stay away from the strangers!
