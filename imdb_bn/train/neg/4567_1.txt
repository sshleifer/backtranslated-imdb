While watching this alleged reality show, television shows a poor picture of professional police officers. Someone may expect that the real reasonable suspicions that lead to possible causes, which result in the overall situation involved in "stop" and then "pat down" outside of its garments, then why can the officer take someone into pockets and ban, Outside, because if not, most of the places will be arrested, even the supervisor Tikrama will do. A warrant report on the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant, unless the sender has the original warranty. If the sender is reading from the computer printout then it is good enough to arrest, but this does not mean the warrant is still useful. Since I did not see any claimant from CBS (I missed it), CBS could be the problem.
