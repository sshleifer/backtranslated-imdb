I dislike Frosty and this one. Both images are illogical with poorly written letters and bad voices. The voices could be completed, but the return of Frosty was worse than they because they were frustrated, they created the current. Frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming drama. About this picture, Frosty was the only good thing, which was like the Slimman classic 60 and had a funny line when they were talking about real things and then Frosty walked through the window, what was doing was happening but everything else was happening. Written badly and badly animated and I just got the plot I saw the DVD cover on the library almost 2 or 3 years ago and the industry looked vague, so I did not pick it up until this year because the pictures in the back touched a little but I played this movie. It was a quarrel with bad industry letters just like the DVD and it was just terrible about what was happening. I saw it at night and I was so asleep that it was relentless (I always did when I saw it while sleeping) but this movie was almost boring. <br /> <br /> The overall rating: grade-c <br /> <br /> It's like returning to the glacial and bad breaks special to this one other holiday. This one's Bad Fourth Signal 4 Home Alone 4 Well I thought that the movie was just fine but at home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad house alone 3 and 4 people hate like this. My sister did not see it too much because when she came into my room to see her 2 minutes and half, she "hates the animation!" I agree with him as the third one frosty income. Little horror!
