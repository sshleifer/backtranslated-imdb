I was disappointed to see this picture that it seemed to be false and the letters were not strong enough to make a very weak attempt at the horrible time. The film's basic idea was interesting but unfortunately it did not make me excited, really scared me or shocked - there was a part of the whole film that I was afraid but it did not break even. At the end of the film I liked the character of Kate, as she became soft and eventually became a bit more realistic, Jeremy Sheffield's character was not actually needed for this movie, and I think the director / writer thinks that the characters used for any purpose are exposed, if he Keeps it in the original letters, but it creates a single attempt on the part of Kate, a Jarmo could have done - Jerome's acting was minimal to say wood and I was uncomfortable watching screen chemistry bad - or its lack. Such shame Frustrated
