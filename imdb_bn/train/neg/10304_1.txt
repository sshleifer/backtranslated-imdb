Here, give me my hand on the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad she is going to order. Over, works like a charm: he's like a talent, omg how do he do it? My Boolean Detector Freaks If I pass this show while scanning channels, I have to be careful (this is a lot more useful on this day, so I do not have to break it in the idiotic scrap ... be careful that with remote!). Could this be some fascist campaign so that people can trust Uberman's control and the invisible kingdom of authority? Or what? Why does this exist? <br /> <br /> This is the most insane show, completely incredible and transformed, and I do not understand why it is still in the air. So geeks can give such a hard time such a hard time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but these nonsensical drills give a pass. Looks like a fire (if there is anything) goes after a season, but it's a stupid stuff like that which continues in empty logical sense. yeccch
