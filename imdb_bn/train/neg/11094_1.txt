The movie is not disturbed by another topic in my list. 40 years ago it was seen as a teenager, it was late for doing so, it was very annoying in almost 95% of romance, 4% others, 1% in search of history. I call it a bite and switch movie, one with an interesting title, a movie of real scams. This is a subject that is eligible for a better film treatment, almost an insult to the filmmakers. Lafayette was not celebrated by the actual member law of Escadril and they were not the product of abusive houses, they were real idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from more class background than Tab Hunter's character. The Flying School is not for the Smart Alex and it all knows, the person pictured here, as illustrated here, will not last for two days, it was either stocked or infantry. The discipline of the French army was often terrible. In short, the other Hollywierd version of a historical episode, which deserve the right treatment.
