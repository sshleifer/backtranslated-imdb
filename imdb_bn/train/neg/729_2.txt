Before starting to see the show, I heard it is very nice and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the script is so stupid that I am sure that the author's son and grandson of the skubid writers And what about SFX and color, they are so painful to see it, colors are not involved, they have become involved, such as the scripts are overwritten and the songs are exaggerated. This show is a bad pie that a baby only thinks sugar and butter feel that these ingredients are best, because they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two elements of this show are finally the total lack of vacuum and credibility.
