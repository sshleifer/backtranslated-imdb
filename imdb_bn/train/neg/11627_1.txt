I wonder who is responsible for this mess. Jokes did not work for Gillian Island. If you go to this series, then there was curiosity about Ashwitz, or would I have to replace her oven, only Adolf would have to suggest that there are 50 seats? I love Lucy, compared to this show in another post. The problem is that Lucille was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre conditions, and this mess is very easy and humiliating my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the loss of the Nazis went to England and how many were killed, I think the idea of ​​a joke about Hitler would seem overwhelming and before any episode, the most normal people killed this idea. Is produced.
