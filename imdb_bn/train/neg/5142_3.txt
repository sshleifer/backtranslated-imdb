Chaplin made his best films: Duff and Dynamite, he is one of his worst: Nerve's Gentlemen. In the first year of the film, Chaplin made up one-third of all his movies. Many of them were experimental in advertising-lobbying, editing, gag, location shooting etc. Trying to get this chaplin and his friend without any means. The Mabel Normand has with his friend, and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both Mabel and his friend. Then he did not respond to any objectionable response to his behavior. There are mostly skeptics here, but there is little to recommend to this film for Chaplin's development. I saw the printing badly worsened, which might affect its enjoyment. Charlie Chase can be glimpsed. * 4 stars.
