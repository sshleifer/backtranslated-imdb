I do not know much about T≈çb Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not be disturbed. Another commentator has been mentioned, it is not terrible to bring fans of both types, or Iraqis. The plot is incompatible, the sequences of the sums are ineffective, and most of the performances are so. England was doing its best work with weak elements, and Joe Trill was really a great bottom, but this film was not enough to carry. This one is over a tape. Grade: F.
