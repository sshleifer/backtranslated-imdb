I can not understand, follow, picture or story for my life. It is very unknown as the plot progresses. I'm going to guess and say that there was a reproductive story / plot problem which was never sorted. The producer is neither a novel nor a novel concept, which can be isolated from the other concept of time and place, which is a serial killer and can make a film about the killer's search by the police. They end up with a lot of things happening in an inactive feature film time limit. Really very bad because they had a strong throw, a director who removed things around and knew about extraordinary cinematography. Indeed, a well-made movie that can enjoy for a few hours and take a break.
