Lahore Rahu Munnabati is a really frustrating movie. I saw the first part of Munnabhai and it was really good but this really bothered you and disappointed you ........................... <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has really destroyed your time and money. On the first day of the liberation war, I went with my friend in this film and got both of the films of V film .......................... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sinoc's role in this film was very small. I think Sanjay-Dusha Arshad has played the role of Vashariya ....................... <br /> <br /> The film's character is not well defined as before. . This movie shows you the results of over Confidence ......... <br /> <br /> Illustrative ideas are not defined and confusing ..... ....... ...... <br /> <br /> Really bigger displacement
