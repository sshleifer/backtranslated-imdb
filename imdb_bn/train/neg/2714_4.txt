60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Styles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sasto, Jordan Brucester, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Anne Curley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini series (later released as full-length feature film in video / DVD), which was trickling in the 1960s, was seen in both eyes as a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is inspired by Doton's excellent performance as Reverend Willie Taylor and equally spread the story among the families. However, Dutton's character was killed through half and the black family completely forgot the second half of an inferior, incoherent, and intangible terrible. RATING: 4 out of 10 ratings are not rated (Post-PG-13 for video release / DVD release).
