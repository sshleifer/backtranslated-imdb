This remake of the original film of 1962 has some pretty parts and it has some great actors to praise - but some excellent actors are heading towards the death of Shakespeare's biggest source of plot and an embarrassingly influenced Shakespeare. Looking at my watch <br /> <br /> Dino is a wonderful actor, dedicated to all of the work he has done to him, but his talent is concentrated. The direction of direction is needed, and it's rarely lacking in the last five minutes <br/> <br /> Gregory Pack's Camio is also enjoyable, but it's always interesting to see more than Robert Mitchell, even with some of these lines <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nick Knolt gets better and better than Lorongo oil but not the same as "weed". Joe Dawn Baker has got some great lines, Juliet Lewis again proves that talent sometimes releases a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? Credit at the beginning (!), The first scene of the back of the caddy, the scene of attacking the baseball bat with the cadie, the full panic of Sam Bowden, the codey is outwardly quiet but unreasonable. <br /> Worst? "Clean lady - but not really !!!" Part For the one hundred miles at high speeds, hand down to the bare hands of the car. (There is no movement in the United States?) "He died - but actually !!!" <br /> <br /> I can see the original again, but after watching it four years later, I will not be tempted to see the remake.
