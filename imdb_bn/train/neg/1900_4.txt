Randall "Memphis" Reines is a retired master car thief who is forced to play "small" when his younger brother died for not giving orders to British cricketer Michael Raymond Calatri. The job will execute up to 50 vehicles in 24 hours or carry out the penalty. So the rain is quickly assembled in a crew that he can believe and set about the task of hand. But the police do not have easy access to her and some of the cars on the list. It would seem to be completely impossible to do the impossible. <br /> <br /> In 60 seconds, Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duval, Will Patan, Deloitte Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Kahn and Timothy Olifant. All those who deserve it. There is enough acting horsepower to run a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is, it is a lot of cars car parking, too much characters, overstocking too many vehicles. From the closure we have no doubt that it is a Bruhaimar / Simpson production, the woodcutter scripts louder and louge aloud together with a louder tilt. It is basically HB A big budget remack. The film of the same name in Halaki's 1974, Adrenaline suggested the possibility of fueled car-based films. Sad is that the perception is not possible. There is one or two high impact moments, daft for sure, but no one less enjoyable. But if you forgive the penalty, then the film does not go out of the first gear, it gives more items of labor to repeat characters, who try to do the stupid screenplay {Scott Rosenberg}. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But no, it's really all rather poor than most. 4/10
