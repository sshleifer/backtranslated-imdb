Originally called Changer. The notorious picker is a poorly made story about a lonner named Jon Bukowski (Carl Jasering), who likes "OEM Lake". Unable to communicate with the girls, he learned a special Vietnamese chant who bumps into a tramp This "chant" is involved in whistling 'falling down the bridge in London' while hopping almost like a hart Morris dancer. Yet, ugly Joe tried it and hey pristo! She is now a girl. Ideally she will be a young guy to attract girls. But let's not talk about the ideals here - this film was created in 1983 and was released in 1993, it should never be released on an ideal world. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Worse than that. Nostril picker really takes the bake, actually cheating the whole God-braces cookie. Extensively written conversations delivered by brain dead actors, a ridiculous plot and an expected package. Only when things can not be more irrational, the story closes in its own nonsensical tangent. For example, Joe decided to kill the girls by changing herself back to herself. But I thought he wanted to be close to them? One who was not involved with a murderer became a canobal and ate some of its prey, of which only 3-4 were there. <br /> <br /> Joe picked up a hooker (Steven Andrews) in the highlights of this terrible movie then returned to his apartment in his "apartment". What happened next then denied the belief ... Joe again goes back to a human, but Hooker discovered a man. How does he respond? Well, in the fashion of Beni Hill-Esquiera, he continues to "follow his" to make the doll move around the apartment with a bunch of "scotri dildos". God knew what Patrick Jay Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking about. At least this scene has made way for another invaluable moment. A male hooker involved in this incident reports a cat's haircut police officer with a 2-bit fun shop 'Police' uniform. The ridiculous acting must be seen in a course. Hooker's inability to claim "dildo" and his "satisfaction" in particular. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above mentioned information, this uninterrupted slash flicker was completely boiler. You know a movie bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting. Generally, I'd better speed up the bits faster, there was not just anyone here. Joe Bucket involved in the main action sequence repeatedly stabbing his victims. Do not forget to cut quickly, using a mattress fadeouts (one during a stab scene) can already limit any suspension. A girl's non-reaction to her fingers is ridiculous. Naturally I would enjoy the words "misconduct" but in this case they were far from a blessing. Just more agonizing cinematic torture. The whole film felt like a dedicated episode of Midsummer Murde, only less entertaining. I hate to see the cut version. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Unusual performances get worse by a terrific tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing. Do not be fooled by the label of the box, it is not a ritual classic, but if it does not qualify for use-usage-critical-DVD-for-coffee-coaster culture. Which I think. Stay away from this coma education mess until it is re-edited within 30 minutes.
