Occasionally I did not understand that when the directors made movies, what would they think ... I got an injury after seeing Wellcome (2007) and thought that they would not do it again. But after the amazing publicity load, Tanan finally died like a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 3 great songs in the promo - Dil Hara, Chalia and Tasan Min ... and what do you get in the movie? There is nothing interesting about seeing Kareena after Zero Story, Predictive Plans, Lots of Akshay Kumar Stunt and her weight loss !!! !!! <br /> <br /> Another big disaster like music ... In the music album, they spent the 4 years of annoying little dialogue and Akshay Kumar stunts when the background of the scene was not supposed to be given ...! That song is so beautiful, comparable to Tasan Girl and it was not taken on the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, then I would say, to see that background song, see what happens ... 'Bachcha Bachchan Pandya ...' <br /> <br /> Overall, very frustrating, ViVi bad is bad Trying to speak English! <br /> <br /> Leave the people, I have to joke!
