The film has several great start-up credits (an offscreen statement warning that movie sponsors will offer a funeral to death, pool and universal horror music), but sadly, the film is' There streams from there A widowed man takes his bride to her home alone ... advises friends of her friends and friends that the new Mrs has very weak attitudes due to her past tragedy. Well, at any time he could not see and hear the mysterious thing that anyone else could do. Her husband assured her that it is only in her mind ... and well, perhaps you can see where this is going. You've figured out what's going on long before our helpless heroine ... Perhaps you've seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and made better). Most of the films (in many cheap DVD sets) seem to be missing some key scenes, to add many violations of the film. You're walking around the window slowly ... she's going to open ... you know she's going to look scary ... and then ... suddenly this scene rush into her husband's surgery. So what did he see ??? I suppose we do not know.
