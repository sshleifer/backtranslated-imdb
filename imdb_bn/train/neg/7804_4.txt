Temp (1993) did not do much dramatic business, but do not stop direct video videos you are directing here! Allen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a high-scaled brokerage firm, new women at Millennium Investments, who started receiving help signs from the public eye perspective secretary Deirdre (Sheela Kelli). Deidre will stop an ambitious dad girl who will stop moving to a corporate broker, including screwing a top broker, he can not stand and hit someone who gets beside her bad. He pulled the skeleton out of Allen's closet, tried to create problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), when she died like this, she kidnapped her daughter and tried to embezzle her money from the company. <br /> <br> Harris and Kelly provide capable performance, the supporting cast is OK and it is reasonably well integrated, but it does not fully compensate for a script that travels under a protected path and gives some surprises.
