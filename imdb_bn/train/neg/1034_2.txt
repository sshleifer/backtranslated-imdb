After the success of the scuba-do, where you are, they decided to give their own show to the school and the chagie. But unfortunately, they have added a new character that has always caused the success of the Scuba-Doo. They discovered a new show with a new headline, skua and scrapbooking. It was a scrappy-doo that completely failed the shot, probably for adults and kids. Scrappy was the stupid bold puppy that always ready to beat anyone. Skuki and Shaggy were frightened by Villain's fear, and they were trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not require any small annoying freak puppy nephews. If they want to be more successful in the school, they must either die or never recognize the scraper. It was just poor, probably your kids would love it!
