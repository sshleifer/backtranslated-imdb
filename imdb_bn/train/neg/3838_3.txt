Terry West had a good idea of ​​this movie. She just does not meat through it. The obscure looking school exits that go on forever and probably have continuous shots in the running time of the film pad. There are also only 2 students in this school. Mistri Mundi is good as usual, but this film is always Ruby Larkoka (which is the only reason to watch the film at the beginning). If we have a movie to watch the script based on his funny character. He is so big !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's previous (and better) movie "Blood for the Mouth" is a special feature. One thing I want to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at the end of a long joke for the punch but in the same way. Then again, see this for Ruby LaRocca.
