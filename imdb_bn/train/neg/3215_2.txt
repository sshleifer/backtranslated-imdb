The movie has a nude scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed robbed his open bush in the middle of the screen. This is quite a long scene. What was the point? I think it was meant to be fun but we were seeing it with my mother and it was not funny to look at us to feel like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. None of the characters are even liked. Audrey Tatou is certainly cute, but his character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I will not really recommend this movie. I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. I thought the director was very educated in the French family, from the very top crust and he saw these characters. <br /> <br />
