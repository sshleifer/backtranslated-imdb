Let's face it - if you rented an STDVD of an forgotten 80's jewelery and it might be better than the previous one, but you are stupid. Wargames: Dead code joins a long running list of unnecessary sigs that are so easily filled with the DVD market. Because these types of movies are not required spoilers, you already know them. <br /> <br /> "plot" for this "film", as follows: Nerd meets the girl; The girl likes to be sad; nerd likes the girl; Secret secret secret secret computer is involved! Mute and girl go to another country; In other countries, tortured by government suits and tortured by the girl; Nerd and the girl meet some important old man that dies in the "film" main point; nerd and girl are captured; Top secret government computers become crazy; The top secret is to hire the official computer to pay; The first Wargames beats the top secret computer nerd using the same old top secret computer from "Film"; nerd saves days; Found continuous. <br /> <br /> end <br /> <br /> What you expect - acting, scripts, effects, scores, and cinematography - B-grade There are some familiar faces here and if you are not a mega fan of pen fair, you have to avoid it. Imagine, the movie will not be insane enough to eat your own toes, so if you prefer STDVD seagels looking cheap, but you're at home at the right time. Sorry, Matthew Broderik was also involved with some "masterpieces", he could not even do this one-five second camio. But can you blame him?
