This is the most boring film I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me. I know that it was set at such a time when life was tough and I know these people were poor and crops were important. Yes, I get that all. I do not remember what I need to be a single light moment in the entire film. Maybe it was true, I do not know. I am sure that the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of the movie were wonderful, and I know that every film can not be a happy ending but it is strict in my opinion as a family film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend any person who wants to entertain a movie. I can not put enough pressure on how this movie affects me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came back to flood. I think it's all about fools for Prozac but all have arrived.
