In another review I said, without the story, you can give all the smoke and mirrors to the audience whatever you want, no one will blame yet. <br /> <br /> For the 30D Art Dico (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all the digital backgrounds and thus the future of the movie can be wave. However, the director of the film was so interested in the digital rendering that he had forgotten in many scenes, which greatly helped the film with a surprisingly sticky plot. (Speaker) crying loud, they forgot this thing is a villain! All right, they have one, but they have died for 20 years during the movie. Connah misses the point of becoming a villain. As far as possible, let's see, Sky Captain (law) has shot a robot, two or three flapping wings, airplanes (before decks (RBC) before shooting him to stop !!!), and a few robots, but most of his time Feeling expensive and spending money to fight for his war for others. POLO or PEGI or Panki as Palti or whatever the film was completely destroyed (critics who commented on him and lack of jurisprudence is so accurate) and I have seen him get a little sick of seeing the repeated shot of the camera on top of it, There are only two shots left, which he later abused in the movie, one impossible, one funny, although I saw it was 70 years. Who is coming away. There is no significant time on the screen other than the law and the Paltrow, and this is the real error of the film. An audience is not identified with robots, they need a hero to root, and require a visible, hateful villain hate. Without that, plus a good compelling story, all the CGs in the world will not help.
