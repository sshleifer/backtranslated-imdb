I cringed all the way through this movie. Above all, there is little to no idea about a poisonous plot in Paosan's own story. Hollywood tried to create a comedy car charger movie. Imagine "Engelbert Sings Hendrix" <br /> <br /> Do not take anything right about this movie. The title of the title and his body's theft is used only as a springboard for the low-budget charge film, a conventional attempt to earn some of the odds from Person's Legacy and its fan base. The father of the village died in 1973, the other global character is fantastic, he has nothing to do with the life or death of the Graeme. <br /> <br /> If you are a village fan, I do not recommend watching this movie. I was not interested. It is saddening to see something special regarded as such disgracing sheets. I swore and said, the film is going on while visiting the grave grave. If you are not familiar with the life and legacy of the village, then do not take this film as a representative of the Gram. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything bad enough about this movie. The village was alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe he might be afraid that he knew about this movie.
