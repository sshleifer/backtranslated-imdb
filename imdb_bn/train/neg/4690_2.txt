This British film is really awful, and it is hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he has slept through it. The concept of train bombs looks good ... but it turns out that this train has been parked for most movies! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train has been parked has been evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone. Indeed, this film can be used to show how to make a suspense movie in a movie bracket. The true mystery is made by the audience knowing something that does not character, in fact the director is unknown. SPEINER: The train actually has two bombs, but we believe that there is only one. After the first bomb collapsed, it seems that there is no reason to watch the film again. But in the last minute, Villain, there is no clear motivation for his actions, it reveals two. We are not sure when the bomb will stop, so we do not have a classic "tom bomb" tension order. For ten minutes or more, Glenn Ford's French wife is thinking of leaving her and then thinking about where she is. He does not make any distinction between the kind of annoying character that we reconcile with him, so when he does this, there is nothing psychological about him. Most of the other characters are fairly out of personality, and there are no problems or problems. It's just 72 minutes, but it seems for a long time because it's tiring and lazy. Do not waste your time.
