Dark Rising is your usually bad, probably produced fast horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It's a weird, unknown plot with which you can measure an elephant through them. Most of the time I do not know what is happening, but it does not really matter, it was a simple demon hunter, it was to preserve the peak stories coming back from the level of hell, so that documents and misconceptions about misleading elements could be linked to a book. No ideas are completely invisible or completely invisible to those plot elements and characters. I do not guess acting bad but genuinely they can do that with this script. There is only one reason to create this evil movie (like some bad movies). T.V. If there is nothing else to do, give it a pass.
