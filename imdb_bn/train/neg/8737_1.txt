Dennis Hooper is without doubt a doubt among the best underrated American actors of our time, and it was interesting to see how he plays his role as a policeman in the case of child serial killers. Most of the movies, Hooper have always played with emotional damage, threatening to play stuff or kill, but in this movie, Hyupper did his best to keep the shrewdness and emotions while carrying a shield. Once I got into the plot of the movie, but my picture was murdered. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is great - not only to catch the police killer, but how we managed to get gangsters to catch the killers. The theater of football stadium is ridiculous, but to involve gangsters in search of the killers <br /> <br /> While Hooper is a solid, experienced street smart policeman Tried to work, but I could not help him but could not feel his acting was equal and did not have strong conviction that he was involved in a real case. The order was also terrible - it was not a real movie feeling, but rather a TV-movie production. This is the most obvious when gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite group in search of the killers. When the main gangster shot the other face gangster, then the acting was weak, expected and horrific blurry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be scary, it was not. Everyone's acting was terrible, even for Hooper, I did not feel for his character, and I did not care too much about his relationship with his daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most swat team. Once I saw the activity of Swat, I was thinking, finally a little better. But I was wrong. First of all, there were 4 people from the whole swat party. That's just impossible. Secondly, there is obviously no training in the Swat team, because in the film many times they carry HCA 44 submarine guns with their hands. The killer was hiding near the stairs with a shotgun, these 4 Idiot bits were blown up because they did not even focus on anything. They should have both hands in front of the gun, but it seems they are not taking this task seriously and only turning around. Third, such as the Swat team members "Keep your eyes open, keep an eye on yourself, we are good to go ..." Such commands are not shouting. In fact, they use hand signals or have radio. But they are literally shouting at each other - how can you catch the killer when he hears you ??? And to top it all off, these guys have no plans - apparently they're just running a wild turkey running and running down. Finally they ended up doing nothing. That was the end. I'm not an expert in special forces, but basically the general sense of what I have decided. When the audience knows that the movie is horrific, most of the action becomes a biography of a movie - when you can not even try to enlarge it, the movie is lost. <br /> <br /> I give 2 stars for the idea, but the rest can not be submitted. If you want to see an offense thriller, do not bother with this one. There is a lot of crime in the movie - but it lacks Roma.
