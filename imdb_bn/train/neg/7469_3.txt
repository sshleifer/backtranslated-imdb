The script of this TV soap opera is so bad that even in some cases, Hopkins has to play something like a downward drama student to bring some life into his graduate character. I do not know the director's intention was not, but Hopkins' Ciano reeked nothing without lack of fear, fear and self-lack. Actually Sieno was all there, why did he create a movie about him? Mussolini was a little more believable, and his long way was closer to the truth. Ada Mussolini was simply ridiculous (not because of Sarundan, but because of the unexpected script), when he had to be the central character of this family drama. See it only if you enjoy Venezuela's soap opera.
