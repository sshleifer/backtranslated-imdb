If you have missed the movie before reading the book, please do not leave the series. I bought my first copy of a book in May this year and already I'm almost finished with the book. I say this movie is a piece of trash which does not work in a smooth series of trials. Although "Left Behind: The Movie" simply vaguely follows the story of the "left-handed" (book), the characters are not even right. <br /> <br /> Some examples: his feeling for Randyford Hattie never works (she's about disappearing when she's about me); Buck Williams is a blonde-haired, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Let's go to Stanford, and details of the book, Royford thinks he is alive; Buck and Cloas founded by Hottie at a meeting in New York do not meet much later; Irene and Rami are not the 'books', but only Robertson's flashbacks are concerned; Rifford and Hatti helicopters on the coast ... etc ... etc. The streets are filled with the debris of the debris filled with water ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They're about the third release. Please, even if you do not like movies, then give a chance to the book series.
