Sometimes a movie is so terribly terrible that it has a destructive effect on your morale. You started asking yourself, what does it mean for our society so low? Can they really expect us to bear these checks and still entertain? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the mainstay of Hollywood, whose main character, plot instrument, and the conflict and resolution in the source film of all. Characters require a gun. Gets a gun. He can not cause that there is a gun. First puts his gun down. O my God, what are we going to do? Has his gun! He acted more contaminated than the actual man, waves around it. He pushed someone in front of the face for 90 minutes and asked the question. The hallmark of any conclusion would be the comfortable sound of police cineans. <br /> <br /> It's a real challenge, working hard again, Hackneynid's formula! A film is very clever and well executed. This is not one of these. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck this material from you. It will make you think of working about living that time and place. Really, who needs that? So yes, I'll say it: I think it's a bad movie I've ever seen. Anyone who was involved in destroying this intermediary soul should be publicly embarrassed for the helplessness of all of us.
