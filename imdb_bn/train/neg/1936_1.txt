Spiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka beside her, it seems she is drinking. But just before she died, her sister called her business partner (Teri Gara) and said that she did not drink within 4 days. Yet the police did not mention the results of a poisonous report! And, when she falls down the stairs, her character is being drunk. is not it? This movie is really a bad mistake, which is fairly awful. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully bad, consider the great cast. Some errors: The text is not very good, the music is bad for the TV, and there is no excitement because since the first scene of the film, we already know the answer to the mystery.
