This is a dry and seamless feature of WWII's most striking facts and filming behind the front lines in the history of war. The bad image of bad film as a plot to kill Hitler is quite bad. Tom Cruise believes that there is no development of the character and it can be assumed that the deepest internal thinking of patriotism and rebellion is completely insane. I believe Mr Bin will play well. Generally speaking, since 2004, the film looks pretty good as a chip copy of the German TV movie "Staufenberg", but that film can not be closer to any movie's perspective. However, the film is likely to achieve its financial goals with pop-mc audience that promotes the hype's rapid-moody blood and shallow industry value.
