Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Sighal) was appointed to France in a reunion mission. After disobeying the direct order from above, three new youth strikers were appointed. However, due to the strike, they are all murdered by the killers with apparently inhuman strength. With the French police ate for their own investigation, he went on to investigate his responsibilities, to discover only a serious new gang of drug addicts that changed the DNA of a person and gave them new strength. <Br /> <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Smacking of bad post production And bad trailer. Bad film. But, I must say, I do not think the attacking forces are his worst. I know that it will make me irrational with many other critics (probably not Stevenine!) But I think it was a lot worse than the bad news that went far beyond the actual quality of the film. <<br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There was dubbing (which made him sound like a martin with a fatal problem!) It was awful and quite frequent but I think it's a segment of the film Not used. The plot was flowing quite well, and along with Harvester considered all the mess with the original ending film. As another critic, as mentioned, the film has a nice gothic look, a new touch for a sigal film. <br /> <br /> Absolute killer low points, although there was a complete and complete lack of an exciting step <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, though, I'd rather see it than a criminal flight , Today you have to die or kill. **
