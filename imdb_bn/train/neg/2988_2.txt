Firstly I enjoyed the Zombi 2 by Lucio Flori. This picture was poking. I can not stand to see it. The story was a joke, the act was a joke, and zoomer 3 did not have any relationship with zoomer 3. This is more humorous. <br /> <br /> We jumped to death from Voodoo 1 deadly agent Bringing people back to life. However, this movie costs $ 1.00 to cost it to rent. I really enjoyed the lucio fulci movie but this one was terrible. I think zombie3 and jb4 and 5 are going to happen, if I think Zombi 3 is an indicator, then I will simply exclude them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
