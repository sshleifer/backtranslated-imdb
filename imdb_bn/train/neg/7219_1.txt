I still do not understand as a movie that can be made in Hollywood. Acting and story is simply unfortunate and horrible in the direction. I did not see any argument behind this trash without the director that nothing was better. I realized that I lost my precious 30 rupees. It was terrible to me that I was going to waste some more time in my life. I made the movie in less than a day. I do not know what class it falls in. Please, avoid all costs at the moment, just do something, even push your head against the wall but do not go for this movie.
