I've seen it long ago, and I must say: this movie is terrible. I see crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun Scarecrow stupid You have an incredibly capricious villain that he enjoys screaming terrible puns as he kills his victim (actually there is a worse than one in this sentence included). He uses the story of his stringent fate that he justifies his assassination. "Everyone loves me, the only girl who thinks I am not trailer-trash, I like the one who chooses me. I want to kill everyone." Okay, I'm exaggerated. But this movie alone is enough to keep the movie in the bottom of the list. <br /> <br /> By adding what I said, baby mother is extraordinary, she is walking on her mother and getting her present boyfriend, the mother's boyfriend told him to leave, refusing the child, stressed that he is not leaving his own house . Boyfriend Chasing Backpack On The Field She killed the baby in front of her mother, screaming terrorism, boyfriend, "OMG! I did not mean!" Then he told the mother that the police had nothing to say. Although, were killed under a scarecrow. So, any child who is killed horribly, he comes back to a murderer with revenge. His victims "have never been stalked like this before ..." (Scarecrow's official tag line) <br /> <br /> To make it worse, this movie was impressed in a fantastic 8 days. All right, 8 days. I'm going to give this movie 2, because despite its own, it has one or two redemption moments. (They're spoilers, so I actually want you to see this bend, so I will not loot it for you.) I could forgive some bad acting, awesome special effects, abysmal scripts, and bad cameras, but I only try to level those levels Not respectful of deficiency <br /> <br /> This film is not as good as I am doing well. If you like to see an example of not making movies, or if you like to watch bad movies, as I do, then see it at your own risk. Everyone else should have a safe distance away from this moment.
