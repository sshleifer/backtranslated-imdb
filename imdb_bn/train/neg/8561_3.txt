Cowboys can leave you in a little sore in the clay. Of course Johns is not one of the best movies. Do not make me wrong, since there is some good spell to move a John Wayne. And this one has a fair share of it. But all the images continue to slow down and it may be that they are. Bruce Dern again did an outstanding job as villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The children of the film were average but well cast. This will be a good movie for eight to fifteen year-old movie gear. <br /> <br /> This is a good family step to meet your children. Just be aware, there are some scenes that you might want to focus once you let the youth see it. But most of the kids I know, who saw this movie. Maybe it's because they get to see kids working up to all the stars in their age.
