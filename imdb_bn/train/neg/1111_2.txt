The song off by the Johnny River was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately I can tell about this western movie is all positive. In order to post my comment, I will have to write 8 more lines, but there are more than 8 horrific lines in this west. I'm not sure whether the movie was the only tribute with Hopper, or just a mockery. The heroes and villains in this movie were very plastic. Not all realistic. Many supporters of this film looked really real, but the shooting scene was a joke. A previous commentator believed that the movie was superb and received a cheap shot by President Bush in comments. It was not a democratic or republican Western. It was a bad western movie to be commercially sold. I wonder if it made any money. Occasionally I thought I was watching a movie made by college film students. If it was, then it was a great movie.
