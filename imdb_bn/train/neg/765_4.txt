What were they thinking? Over the years, the Colombo series has tried some new things and has moved away from the usual successful formula, but this movie is really affecting it. This movie is basically different from any other Columbu film but the difference is not good for movie. <br /> <br /> The movie that separates itself from any other Columbu film is a murder. The entire premises of this movie is completely different and it places the Colombo character in a completely different environment and circumstances. Also completely totally different and more 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan Jay Levie has made some other films in Colombo in the past, which is very much liked by all the common formulas. It's a strange favorite that he chose to direct this film. <br /> <br /> The Colombo character also seems to be different from himself, perhaps for the reason that he sets in a completely different environment and situation, after the marriage disappears, he helps his nephew out. The absence of some good release and trademark combo humor does not make it a good or enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> The movie does not start very bad in all the facts, but the movie starts to be even more. And it further ridicules with its story as progress. This is a silly kidnapping-thriller that is a story that starts to become more and more impossible. It makes the movie more obsolete. This is a very interesting columbo entry that really can not entertain its viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> This is not the most gifted for supporting actors. . Although his character is completely different and the film is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falc is still good and his presence still preserves some of this film. Can you just illustrate how this image has expunged her? It was a very bad and funny movie that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange columbo entry, which can be described as a failed test to be removed from a common formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
