I was interested in watching this movie. Many people seem excited. I have my faith. I believe in Christ, but I am open to any kind of opinion or opinion. It would not be important for me if it existed in the written text in the Bible. Maria is a virgin or all the other same pagan phenomena. What is the concept of movement for me, the idea of ​​love is the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> who gets angry, when someone takes a sentence, it represents the truth. It was written without showing in the context. For example, they showed the big sentence in this movie: "Do not tell me about you" what Jesus did (Lucas 19:27): "My enemies who do not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" (Lucas 19:27) Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no article in the Bible where Jesus supports the killing. He love After quoting Bible errors, they hate us and cry out loud (pseudo-Christians). Most of the viewer does not verify the submitted information, so they start to hate Jesus = hate = not good for me or for anyone else. This is pure manipulation man. Use your brain. Do not accept what they tell you about this movie. We destroy our own bases, if our civilization, we begin to break the message of Jesus and the message he sent to us. You saw the branch that you are sitting on.
