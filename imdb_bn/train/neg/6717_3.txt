This was god awful. The story was everywhere and I was not confused because of terrible editing. I did not feel any sympathy for anyone because their letters were not very well developed. They were extremely superficial people with no dimension. Cheesy, sugar stereotypes with subplots that went somewhere. Even if the camgirl was just a distraction of the chick, she was looking decent. I do not know what it's going to be like, but how frustrating it was when they showed this dampness? I almost canceled my subscription. You think a channel that shows more quality films. There are many more gay and lesbian themed movies. "Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I've totally enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there is something that has leaked my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it's not just worthless. If you catch it on TV, all right, but do not bother otherwise. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < There were lots of places to light in the way. I think some effects were tried to be used and it was used to add something that just did not go for it. <br /> <br /> I can not deny Johnny Rebel very hot (of course, without brown hair). Very bad his performance did nothing for me. Stick with real porn, friend. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
