All right, I rented this movie to the director ... he made some interesting flights in the past (you're enjoying the fun if you do not see the waqsk). However, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but I decided to suck it and give it a look. It's bad. very bad. If you do not see the movie and do not think of the spoilers you read later. Above all, the old saying 'you can not judge a book by its cover' applies here. This membrane box highlights with long hairstyle fox. The back of the box has a cool shot of red leather jill and some other shots. Description It sounds great because you want to hire movies. You start to see it and suddenly you see that the movie happened in 1977 (unusable). Jill is a total dog who is not the cover girl. The film is not expected as much of your opinion ... and this is not a good thing. Character motivation is not many stupid things without any modicum ... It is embarrassing to see it. 10 minutes before the end of movie dolph and any other woman is sexually good. Also, what was the problem of killing this other lady in Dolph's cold blood, which helped her? When the author reads the script to Anthony Hykox, he saw a stinger. It may be appropriate for new millennium underworld and half the intelligent characters have been created. It does not make sense to set it to 70 and there is no effect on any story. Avoid it!
