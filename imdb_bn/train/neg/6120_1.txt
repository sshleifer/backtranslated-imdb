There are three types of bad films - cheap, annoying, and transparent. Only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> Boring movies are OK, good, annoying - if you do not go quickly, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Casual movies are actually their protector; But really they are mesmerizing aids for very sick people. The only bad bad movies are really funny, because the filmmakers wanted to make their movies so strictly, they exceeded their crossing capacity and available resources. <br /> <br /> Bo deerk is simply naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, the lack of luck and funding and skills makes him feel cheap as well. This image is ridiculous and it can sometimes be the last fun-bad movie. <br /> <br /> I saw in the theater first, God can forgive me; I was very laughing, I was roaming my seat, and with a lot of audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband-promutor, partly, a mockery of this picture; Unfortunately, dereks are definitely lacking any necessary resources that pull off; As a result, the 'barbarian' element comes in the form of some girl-girl's impression of trying to provoke her Robin in the perception of some girl-young man's imprint of Radler's imprint - it can not fly over our head, there is no source of any other head. <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diaryk's infamous tendency to reveal his breasts - I have less boyfriend nudity photographic She can not imagine Shan, she looks so wide on her shoulder, I'm very curious; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Derek pursues Africa, and knows why God alone Then her father-Harris - pretends to work on some emotional dolls, and then it seems to have been surprised to know that Hong Kong's product has changed in advertising - probably the reason is not seen in the script - there is no one apparently. <br /> <br /> Unclear camera work, sticky editing - if it is not for chips 3-way the film will be intolerable - <br /> <br /> <br /> As it is, it is a real hoot
