Everyone just seems raving about the subject, and does not really think how the movie is made. Deaf, silent guy has won the underdog - it's good, the cricket side is great, but the film's overall average I think it could be much better than that. <br /> <br /> The plot for a movie that is not based on a real-life event is very predictable. I'm sure that the movie could be more interesting. The songs are stuffed only there and I have to literally move the scenes where the same thing will be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> played well, though. Watchable.
