(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to see this tonight. I had to stop it second hour ago because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for the girl or mother. Both came together as a self-esteem with a little respect for others, the girl added rude, disrespectful and lazy to the lump. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we do not need to see him again." Keaton did a good job of moving between his stunned state and sorrow, but until then it has gone too far for me. I was not just enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the hero, you have to take care of the letters very soon - if it is almost an hour and I do not care, it is too late. <br /> <br /> Throwing hearty and well played - I felt for them! * - And gay best friend was nice, but even combined, that was not enough to carry the film for me.
