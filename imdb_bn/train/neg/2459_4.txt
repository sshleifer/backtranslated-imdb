Obviously, I was not worried about the Things coming (Lawyer "Things to Come") as many viewers as This means that you have a good chance that you'll enjoy it than I do. At any rate, it may be useful to hear the movie you have described from another scene. <br /> <br /> directed by William Cameron Manzie, who has gained much experience as a production designer and even more as an industrial director. , Is a movie adaptation of HG Wells in its novel by the same name. In my eyes it helps to show that a great novelist can not become a great painter. <br /> <br /> "Evertyown", like London, opened in 1940. The war is going on and Everton's people are worried that it can reach them. Do it And it's a decades-long relationship which basically destroys the civilization. Wells and Mengeis continued to advance in order to show various scenes related to the war and subsequent events. We see two pilots, one low, bringing the consequences of their war. We will be meeting with a post-apocalyptic community ruled by a war warlord. We have seen a man from a growing future society. We see the way that technology changes. And finally, we have come to the fullest understanding of the future society of 2036, where leaders are debating about the ability to send human beings on the moon. <br /> <br /> This is probably very possibly exciting, but it just does not work as a film. Structurally, the film is a lot more fanciful, dramatically combined with a little closer to it. Through the third segment, I've always lost interest in trying to keep track of letters. I have been able to sort them out in the first couple segment. There is a constant parade of new faces. We can not learn anything about some of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that strange parts, with some exceptions, are curiously executed and edited. They are occasionally manipulative - it can start to feel like a campaign. But perhaps on the contrary, the segments are a bit cold and dry comfortable. <br /> <br /> In fact, an additional part is like a music video / art promotional video. If there are features of future city construction including plenty of machinery, lots of welding and more. At one stage, a person who looks like a celestial wave with no future glass of the camera. Music for this section is now somewhere militaristic and an overblown horror score. I can not say that the upcoming things are made up of compelling elements in the drama. <br /> <br /> The common tone in supporting the things is "A movie about the concept". That may be true, but if you look at that way there is a couple problems with it. One, it still does not work as a movie, which acts as a visual and operatic dramatic artwork, and there are two different ideas available here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is to fight and what is the civilization. It's a good thing to make a film about. This is an extraordinary perspective of World War II, such as Things to Scripts and was filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). There are some interesting topics about the Battle of Wales, some of which are against the general explanation of the film. For example, the last seems like another war is going to break, or at any moment. The overall message seems to be a frustrating disappointment. Wells shows that war is just a part of human nature that can not be provoked, even though it does not prevent "progress" - in fact, it can be progressively indirectly. <br /> <br /> that would certainly be enough for a film. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene in the two pilots is more scary scenes of the film. It deals with a complex hesitation. One pilot shot down another, but now he is coming to help. But the pilot who was shot, was carrying poisonous gas which is now running across the field. They can not breathe gas without both damage. A girl comes along. They have two effective gas masks. The pilot offered his mask, he said whatever he is going to die. What do you do It is not the view that the length of this scene can be expanded to extend, but the ideas - to help each other in the middle of the war and to try them oddly complex - enough to make a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scene of the will-wardered scene, in the environment of the scene, there is a dangerous infectious disease that is known as "rotating sickness". It turns the victim into something like drunk zombies. In the normal procedure, the victims were shot on the site in an effort to stop the disease. This material is tackled as it was a test. It is a great idea and deserves its own film. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wales represents a society in the future as a controversial socialist theory. That was enough for his own film. It is impossible to effectively implement with so many stuff in 100 minutes, especially when it is supposed to be a movie cruise rather than dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> Yet, there are reasons to let things come in at least one visit. If you are all a sci-fi buff, it's a historically significant film. Manzir's background, production and set designs are attractive, even cinemagery seems highly dated. It is interesting to see how Wales was ridiculously pricent or reverse in its previews. I especially enjoyed the Moon trend, which was strongly influenced by George Melius's 1902 Chip to the Moon (Arc Leo Weiss Dans La Lun). Just do not expect too much to come thieves.
