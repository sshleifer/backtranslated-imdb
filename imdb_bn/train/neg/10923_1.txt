The TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse was brought to the United States in the 20th minute when filing the first edition of the 10th Commandment Demile, and it was reunited when Demil's sets were discovered in the desert. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was the filmmakers serious or curious when making this film? It's a great movie to pick for a ridiculous bad movie and its bad if it's serious. If it is a comedy less good but all the wrong reasons are funny. You will smile long and hard in this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
