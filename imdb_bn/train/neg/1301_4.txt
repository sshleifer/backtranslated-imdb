I recently saw it in the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This feature length should be its last based on the length of the Dutch actress Monique van D. Van's director and my observation based on it. I hate movies that are unlikely that you are choosing each scene individually. This image immediately leaves scratching your head. This is a young photographer and his girlfriend who started work for the international aid agency, is running an excitingly through Taliban-controlled mountains, Afghanistan talks about their love when a rocket closes a truck in front of them. They came out of their cars to see all 5 trucks like Taliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades. Bob (Woredom's Torrestra) took all these pictures when he saw one of the rebels, who killed his girlfriend and presented a hand grenade in their hands. Since they can not be 50 yards away with the distance of hand throwing, even then they go away. Her girlfriend has swollen and she took a picture of the moment of grenade effect, which killed her and won the award as the year's photographer for the photo. Every scene and situation in this scene is ridiculous as it is open. The following year Bob appointed himself to be appointed for the National Geographic in the Dutch Resorts Island, where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hillbrand) and entered into his cruel underworld of the international drug trafficker. Avoid this film. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
