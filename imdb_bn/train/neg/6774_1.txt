As the warm fan of Kerry Grant, I started watching this movie and laughing, because AMC bills it as a comedy. I have never been frustrated with any film! This is the usual charm of the whole film and the traditional comedy AWOL; She is disturbed, disturbed, and just comes across as herself. Mississipp's character is one of the worst tendencies I have ever seen - its pronunciation is over-exaggerated (and mistakenly claiming it as part of Mississippi), and whenever he provides a line, it is more diverse than the other cast members. Mississipp himself tried to stand in the movie as a loving, country-based pumpkin Gobble, but in the end, he had already managed to refrain from a weak plot. Mansfield also looks more like a ghoul-doll than a Hollywood sex cat, and when he was never known for Hollywood acting power, the film shouted that he had no power to ever start with it. Ray Walton's character was sugar-shaped and finally converted. For the four men on vacation on the shore, there was the least holiday I've ever seen. I've seen this nightmare at the very end, and since I'm not looting it for anybody, I'll tell you that it's the most irrational that you'll see. This film tries to spark the ideas of patriotism and war criminals, but the film completely misses that point due to its weak plot line and weak cast. Sorry, Kerry!
