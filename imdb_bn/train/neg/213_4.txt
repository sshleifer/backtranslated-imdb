Yes, indeed, it can be a good movie. A love banger, (Sorry for the license of the poem, but not a triangle!) A funny story, unfortunately, it has been said badly. The picture sometimes looks weird, sometimes ok, picture crowd and narrow sight. The term requires more attention (usually it is in Roman cinema), light and color filters are sometimes badly selected. Soundtrack is short and action is not helped. About acting ... sorry but the best actress zamindari. Others are acting unexpectedly and can not satisfy the viewer. Acting poetic when it is realistic, and realistic when it should be poetic. This is a photo for adults, called by children. Highly provocative is only bothered.
