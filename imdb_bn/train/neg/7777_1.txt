My grandson once saw it as it could be an intelligent movie for kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, my 3 year old grandson is not watching a movie like this picture. <br /> <br /> Because of her rating for children. The child should be friendly. That's what I would expect. Warning Brother and G rating out I hope this cuss sound is there. The sound does not fit the movie in most places as it seems to be associated later. And many parts of the movie drags out.
