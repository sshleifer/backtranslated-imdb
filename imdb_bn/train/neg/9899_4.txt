Essential movie version of the ridiculous literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore Captain Ahab, who fell in love, fell in love with the priest's daughter Joan Bennett. His brother Derek's rival in love with Mrs. Bennett. When Mr. Barrymore lost his legs in a crazy accident, Bennet refused him. He must surely kill Him and win Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that the 1930 theater audience can be delighted; Particularly Barrymore is involved in losing his legs. The film is not well, however; The silence of the 1920s and the 1930's Tokyoese have better movies than both. Two names, John Barrymore and Joan Bennet are not the best of them. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
