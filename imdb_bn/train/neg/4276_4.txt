This overrated, short-lived series (about a seasoned two season) is almost as experimental and unique as a truck driver going a trump bar. I'm not sure what they mean by "lever breaking" and "real" words, when they surround Lynch and his stupid little TV artist. What is the key to their capital? Of course, it's the original compared to "Bill Kosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues". Clearly. As well as "law and order", Tippi originality spread to left and right. <br /> <br /> Tip fans often say that this event has been canceled because many viewers were not smart enough, supposed to be "odds" of the show, its alleged wild consciousness, or whatever. As a strange fan of myself, I The wrong idea that needs to be corrected is not far away from TP; it is a mere observer, rather a smart hoodune that goes around the circles, trembling on every corner of the web The (or the reason) is not going to end there. The supposed oddity is always forced; the characters do not behave oddly as much as they behave idiotic for half time. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the scene scene, I think Lynch.Are you curious?

Felini's and Leon's movies suggest that TP is an extremely narrow TV crime drama which looks like all the young fashion fashion models. Cast TP gives a plastic look. Kens and Barbie en masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of TP's producers said that the "unique face" was looking for the Lint series. Unique face? Like Lara Flin Boil? Sheryl Fen? Men's catalogs (or gay magazines) are directly out of the miserable "miser"? Do not make me wrong; There is no mistake in getting an interesting cast, especially like a foam (then Madonna will see if she was 1000 times beautiful), but then do not say that you are doing strange show with strange people. "I never understood Lynch's confusing attraction with McCain and Kyle McLachlan (I got a medal for bothering to make her name). She is not unlikely, but lack of charisma looks like a very dusty and polished. Her character's ridiculous" bokchandra " Not only was Lynch's only curiosity, the only one to try hard to achieve her fame - she was completely his All of the posts made by Leitch - "Elephant Man" - were many sub-commodities compared to their first two films, much of what was followed was a medium effort, which relied on the relatively small but fantastic fan base of Lynch, He can keep the eyes of the public in his badly organized stories, which are closely related to him In other words, Lint is the darling of every intellectual-wannabe. <br /> <br /> So, did his father kill Laura Palmer?
