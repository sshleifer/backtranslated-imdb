Good sorrow I can not even begin to describe how poor this film is. Do not make me wrong, I'm not expecting anything to start with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slash flick is premeditated to ummm missing ... slashing, so do not be surprised by the absence of Gore. But the level of incompatibility and clearance in all other aspects of this movie has shunned me. <br /> <br /> We have a hero who is quite simply so vain that you transform yourself into a bad guy. And here one has been transformed for books ... He will never change - hence breaking the main character of writing the basic screen - Character Development If you think at the end of this picture, the poor little girl is going around and finally kicked some donkeys and think again. On <br /> <br />, we have handed over at least the fantastic (and of course, the least terrible) killer to be consistent. I do not joke when I'm fun, that there is a terrible villain than the Scarlet Explorer movie. Finally, because potentially all potentially inactive (or apparently thirteen-year-old) for tension or gratuity), maybe what's left to fill 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Closet, what is that? <br /> <br /> Many more and many of the Colors: Large Coets, Small Colots, Mirrored Collets, Nornier's Colts, So Many Snail Coats You will not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact, the film should have been called "off" and in the case of DVD it was a big scary picture. Backwards, it was a picture of the audience, which fell asleep and quoted Roger and Ebert - something like this: "What happened * f * @! We just ruined our time!"
