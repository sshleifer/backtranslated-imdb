Although I do not like being like someone who denies the personal taste of others; If you like something, it's okay. However, this movie was awesome and there is no way around it. I do not like Annie Detranco, but he is a great guitarist and song writer, I can admit. But I can not accept any of the freedom fighters in this film. Many people have highlighted the problem of facing high school students. Maybe, but everything is fetched too far. It seems like a "nude gun" - the type of comedy of the kind, but time has stopped; There are many more places in each actor line, as they hold for laughter (there is no one). Anyone who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to debate many controversial issues together in a film, almost never fully developed (especially a girl inspired by a teacher). I do not smile once across the whole movie. I was very humiliated by this effort by humor and rage but roll my eyes on the screen.
