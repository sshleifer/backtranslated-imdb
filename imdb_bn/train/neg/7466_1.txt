How nice. Some movies just leave me stupid. It was one of those movies regardless of. When I left the theater, there was not a single word near my mouth. For the last one and a half years, I had an incredible wish to cut my head against the wall of the theater to forget me. Unfortunately, it does not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. There was humor in the first grade level, the best performance was very foolish, and the plot was astronomically distant. I do not see any promises made by Chris Cutting or any other SNL acting film.
