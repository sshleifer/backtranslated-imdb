I do not even know where this one started. "It's all about family." This can be the worst line of dialogue ever in any "horror" movie, although it may not be a horror movie but it is also tried !!! Threat !!! And I know that Oven Wilson is a good actor. He must stop playing the Token guy who dies in each action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote with "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". She has some genius. Also, Lily Taylor should be in indie films. He has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones would be a porn star. There is no room in the legal acting for him. I'm serious One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER
