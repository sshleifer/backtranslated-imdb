Last night I attended the premiere and did the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. You have not been qualified to make movies just because you pointed out a ton of music music. There was a great deal of filmmaking, terrifying angle and awesome light shots. All mess does not help at the execution. When "Dixie" is delayed for the memory service, his mother comments on his hand, but he is not clear what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plots were promised, but the scripts were thin and the Ford truck full of size holes. We never realize how the characters run, they are really behind the conflict with each other or exactly how they solve them. Six years of distance are erased by magic in 4 days. Deep conversations were fatal by stupid clich√©s. (Actually, the entire city was a major part of southern life.) When Toby drunk, half the audience laughed, "Yes, my blood has gone to your body in the lungs" ... and we were not treated with that intense line. But TWICE! These verses were awake, and dramatic confessions were "I became stupid and vivid." <br /> <br /> 3 It was okay to work with them to consider a script debris. Toby was mostly bold and curvicty, but when he was up to sunny and light he was charming. It's embarrassing that it does not have any screen time. Kelly Preston's acting chops rust beautifully and it shows. Lindsay Hun is gifted and it is certainly not his fault, the authors said that his character was so impossible at the beginning that you would not blame his father for coming to his father. Bert Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to do more to this movie, but still have less or lost. (And in fact, their character in this movie is lost!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a Toby fan then you love the song. But the movie is often felt that the scene was compulsory only to force them to publish one or the songs of its record label. For example, the film's official love song "Crash Array Tonight" You think that it will play around a flexible love scene, but Nap ... we are going to memorable service when we hear about 45 seconds. As they said, "Well, we'll use this song somewhere". Hunting the song "Breakdown" and the best thing to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> ... A plotted plot never fully develops and the movie is very disrespectful because it tries out loud. For truck truck, Toby Keith's music and cars for the product place. People are becoming more concerned about the rebuilding of broken bridges to try the power of the song, but the story is so bad that both of these points are lost in this extra video. I liked Toby and wanted to really like "broken bridge" but the people who were counted for making this movie leave him and one of your famous boots is where you know it.
