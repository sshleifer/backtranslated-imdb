In the last ten episodes I saw "Fantasam" ten years later - due to my very clear memories, it is still not very good. This day is acknowledging, I am still a huge fan of the first two installments, so I thought I would go back and experience the 'final chapters' again. Part three is definitely the worst of the series because it obviously gives less importance and throws it into a bunch of confusing stuff which does not give much knowledge ... Again, kicking the previous movie where it left, to save the regime Mike, tollman who later Pledge to come back, but for a long time things that are not safe within the Jodi, which are unsuccessful Stabhabe able to take the form of spheres. Clearly his soul keeps Tall Man's captive, so Mike is dragged by the evil generation of the Netherlands and the rig has to find him ... On the way, he meets the 10-year-old child and the noon chalk. Protects Rocky Black Chick, who helped him throughout his journey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing memorable about "Fantasium III" which is stupid and forced to be "ridiculous". Only a positive outlook that does not help the film and that was the case. The return of Michael Belvedin and Bill Thornbury, who reviewed their role for the first time since the classic 1978 classic. The problem is that they mostly appear in the presence of the camie ... Regi Benstar comes back to play his role, but his fool, love illness makes it so annoying to like his presence. Angus Scrimm also does not seem to fully "be" in his role. He speaks too much here and is not boring and vague on the opposite side with "waistband", where the film is cheeky. The opinion of most people on this Flickr seems quite emotional and seems to be "still entertaining". Maybe I'm just too much of a net picker but I just could not get this one. I dislike it when I was young and after seeing again - I can safely say - nothing has changed. Don Koskelli presented the scene with his original low-budget, night-savvy, legendary film "Fantas", which I still got as my best favorite horror film, and his respectable series is going on and in the dark there is excessive and poor, but "Lord of the dead" (Stupid title) just ran very fast and was silent with me ... include two new letters The team and Rocky (the only thing! The only thing!) Was a strong indication of the way out of Cascella, and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to say more?
