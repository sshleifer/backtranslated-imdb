Was it awakake two years after the awakata? Orca is not just a "jazz rip off" but it has tried to profit from the success of the jauses. In my opinion, first of all, Orca was a bad movie, was not terrible but was certainly not good, average was average. <br /> <br /> This plot is basically a male killer whale who wants to take revenge by killing a fisherman with his companion and his unfamiliar calf. I can not stand watching this movie again. The film's direction was poor and often more intensely like director, producer and authors than Jaws. <br /> <br /> It was very average and credible for acting, but the actual characters are not at least bit desired. The effect was just for his time and the killer whales looked pretty good in the footage. <br /> <br /> Violence is not confusing, bloody, and is not recommended for more sensitive people. Music overdone and very loud, sometimes sway out the effects and irritations of the sound. I exaggerate the intelligence of the killer whale (the intelligent vases do not meet the only companion described in Oraq). <br /> <br /> Overall this movie was bad / bad because of my opinion, because the reasons listed above are listed above. Some people might appreciate this picture because I am not going to disable this movie because of the revenge of animals and people, and I understand why some people might like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (But his idea is probably a 5/10)
