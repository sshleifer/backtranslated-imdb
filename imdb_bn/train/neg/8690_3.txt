Everyone (and the audience) involved in finding the "candidate" to see how well the movie can be. What happened to the story of South American? Julie Christie and Kate Capps are thinking of allowing their roles to be cut-out of cardboard. Up until now I've liked each gene Hackman performance and / or movie. He was frustrated (which I can rarely believe) or be terribly ill. I liked and guided Richard Gere (and has been vilified for it). But here he had no "power". She was never scary and only occasionally persuasive. All I was very frustrated. I really expected this much more than director and cast. If you do not find the "candidate" clock "can not rotate the dog" again or even "bulworth".
