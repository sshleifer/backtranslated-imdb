One of the reasons for my life to take 2 hours of my life (it was only 35 minutes) and I think trying to appreciate the Indian film. I have sometimes seen S. Ray's old films. I saw this by browsing through IMDB and seeing the rating at 8.7, it must be one that will open the door and bring artistic enjoyment. Oh how wrong i was The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that 970 people voted who were outside of Bulldog production and their only initiative was the Adam Sandler film. <br /> <br /> This rating will be ranked 9th in the list of 250 best movies list on Citizen Cans in IMDB, Cyco Gooddels! I'm not really in the mood to review and criticize because this painful experience is not easy to remember. My only hope is that many Hindus who like me love this movie - as fascinated with stupid and fascinating music.
