Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Pure Fish' is a cartoon that is frustrating and filled with one or two wonderful moments. Set in the preservatives of the cockpit's fish, 'Porky's Pure Fish' was an unusual black 'n' white back cartoon and an uncomfortable area in the life-of-life Mary Melodies, which was popular at the time. Generally, among the first pink cartoons, far away from the Porky star, only a modified opening musical number and the measurements of the movie are available. For the rest of the time, the star is a sticky cat, who sees the fish shop as a free meal, but more than that. Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than necessary. Sometimes, even in the book-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown on a mark that can work alongside non-animated media. Although the smile is very low, and the cartoon is preserved only by the energetic of the clamp, but there is rarely to recommend the 'poor fish of the turkey' in any one of the lowest cartoon cartons below.
