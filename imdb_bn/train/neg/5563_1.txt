The dolph shouted its way through Lundgren Breed and this inconsistent mystery / thriller that would convince you that the box is not nearly cool. He is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess of B-Movie cliches (detective, revenge, tycoon, hooker, s & m) that they seem to go along with. The film chooses a bit of the second half, but for the more beautiful Lundgren flick, instead of red scrapion rentals.
