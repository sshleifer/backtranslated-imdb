When a movie is not independent and rated, like Hamilton, I was hoping outside of the norm, you want to spend your heart on violence. I know that good films do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website and I agreed to pay these friends more than $ 9.50 to see the horror movie with me. When a festival called Horrorfest, I do not have Dawsons Creek with terrific undertones, hoping to be awesome. My expectations for this photo were very low, but once it was seen that the film was shot in hell for an hour before the film got out of the finger for the first time. There were many plots and there was too much left to imagine. I do not see the happy feet, sorry. I think this movie has more violence and thunder than Hamilan!
