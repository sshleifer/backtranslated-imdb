So what is the biggest mistake of Indian Jones Winba, when you have an actor who has acted as a fantastic dude from adventure stories who do not want to do any adventure? Someone who wrote the script for Jack Speed ​​could have been fired, but for any reason, there is an exciting lack for this movie! This does not mean that it does not have any action, but see the dark side of the picture. It was not consistent with Indiana Jones or other action-adventure adventure events, which were cliffhunner's and narrow reverses, and Jack Speed ​​was preached by clever publicity for me and many others to be interested! Besides, I have never heard of that person, so who needs his attention?
