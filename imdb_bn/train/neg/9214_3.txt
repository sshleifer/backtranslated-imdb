Seeing this picture many things are clear: 1) Acting is terrible. Tom Hendes and Wondi Cruison are so-so-soap opera-ish between father and son and child conflict. The other two guys: An excessive dummy child is progressive and your stereototype i-a-baby-but-i-really-sensitive-inner blonde dreams; 2) The whole movie is frustrating and frustrating; 3) Robi's dreams and episodes are annoying (played by Tom Hendus); 4) Begin love ballads are an odd choice ("we all are special friends"); 5) Strange lines and side plots are not made any better by acting awesome; And 5) It's a really bad movie. Expectations to be frustrated - and perhaps annoying.
