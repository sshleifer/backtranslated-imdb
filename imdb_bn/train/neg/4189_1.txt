Among the worst movies of 2004, I got the unfortunate distinction of returning this morning: Firstly, the CGI-based vacuum of Rickick Chronicles, and then, the embarrassing Vanity project known as Grenandel. One costs multimillions and other costs, but they're both bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> At the top I should know that I'm not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he shared his classic melody: Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were from the young composition) to the Rast Never Sleeps, Crop, and Mirror ball, people wrote some really great songs. Sadly, there is no great song in Grenandale, and some of the few valuable people and the film that they created are truly actionable and simple political atrocities. Apart from the talent as well as the industry and unimpressive as the spine, Greendale left well left. If you are forced to contribute to Young's bank account, then buy the book.
