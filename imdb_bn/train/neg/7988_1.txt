To maintain Anita's and English barriers to English and general barriers to English, Mera Soyal seems to be more than an excuse for the novel and screenplay writer. In this film, the general feeling of Indian superiority in English is false. <br /> <br /> The English people of this film are involved in excess weight, violent, stupid, obscure, child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, poor food, and gradually - to return to Indian culture, only the local priest The end can be "free". <br /> <br /> In contrast, Indian families can speak beautiful, cute, educated, many languages, caring and loving parents, and grammar-school sheets. This film is so grim exogenous that I am surprised by the BBC giving it money If it happens in any other way, an English family of Indian community was portrayed this way, the film was seen as a racist. <br /> <br /> In a few moments, my eye shot on my head. , I will last it in my hairline. First, in the celebration of Deepali, the Gospel scene in the women - intrinsically: the English are dirty and vague - and men - underlying: English women prostitution. Secondly, eating food with uncertainty where the Lima speaks lies about the family of Katli - lies: English is so stupid, you can do anything to them. <br /> <br /> Something underlying humiliation in English - even an object in violent English marriage - is clear all the way through the film. Amit's character became so attracted - almost fallen woman trop - that I ended up feeling the film. <br /> <br /> This is a "Beckham-like band" where a girl focuses on the love of a community and treats a community, and a custom of customs, and a movie about two daughters of different backgrounds coming together. Instead, Anita and I think that a form of cultural alphabet is inevitable, because English is almost a version of India's untouchables, and it is covered by a thin screen attack on the "other" community of the film. English. <br /> <br /> I felt unhappy and I was filled with hate, acted on the basis of complaint. On that basis, the BBC did not have its manufacturing fund.
