I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I saw cast and crew selection in one of his DVDs and saw 'Going Overboard' and agreed to go out and rent. So I went with a few friends of mine and rented it. We left it and we were surprised to see Adam Sandler, who has not been injured in adolescence, looks like he was 12 years old when he left the film. I did not see the 30 minutes of this movie, I did not even see the smile, shivering, and even scarves in the movie, when I was fascinated by this moment, I saw how awesome this movie was. I could not believe how much the audience tried to laugh at this movie ... and it did not work once. Even though seeing horribly scary camera angles and listening to the scary script, I realized why I never heard of this movie ... because it was earlier sucked more than a milk. This picture, in my opinion, was the best movie ever, .... ever!
