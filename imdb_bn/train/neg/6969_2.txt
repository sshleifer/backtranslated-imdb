It was known in the UK as Blue Makki (1987) or 'Audition of the Physicists', an excellent horror film about an old man who bites Greenhouse with some mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man was taken to the hospital, where the insect like a creature came out of his mouth, of course it turned out to be a monster of the insect and could get angry !! Despite Steve Rails and John Vernon in the film, I think it's annoying with a rare predictable story, non-striking character, cheap special effects, and lack of action! Awesome fans do not really have to track this rare movie, you will not lose much faith in me !!! I give this movie 2/10.
