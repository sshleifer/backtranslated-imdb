"Do not be bothered to see this movie." If you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles, it would be a better advice. There was a great disappointment considering this great actor, not only of Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, of course there was nothing like the VHS box described. There was no secret, there was very little tension and many dull spots, most of them tried to show why "Nelly" (Monroe) was so contaminated. It was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not need to know that he could play this character. "Like something" There was enough evidence for me alone. But this role did not fit him, and it does not surprise him that it is not one of his popular movies. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that the film is Richard Weidmck, Anna Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jane Cagney, Donna Kokuyen and others. <br /> <br /> Description: It is not entertainment and the name of the entertainment.
