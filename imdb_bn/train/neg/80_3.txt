I have really wondered at high ratings for this movie. I got to be absolutely stupid. Mother gets "vision" when touching things or people? And one thing he has continued to double his touch ... just seems ridiculous. Daddy Puffer's performance was terrible, I thought. She was very annoying. She played a good job playing Laurie and most of the supporters did Cast to work with them. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and film seems very open, but this movie is a ridiculous plot and looks over acting and it was not just for me.
