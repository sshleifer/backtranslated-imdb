Black 2 men had a real disappointment for me. Actors have done a great job, especially Smith, although there is no remedy for poor script once in production. The film was actually a "seagull" kind of feeling, closing part of the first movie episode. The story was, a word ... bad, good. It was not well thought out, and at times it felt very sticky and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> First Flick, MIB organization had a kind of "elite" ball feeling. You had a few special agents, and it was a "secret" kind of feel. In the signal, there is a JRTC Summer camp in MIB organization. <br /> <br /> This movie was not terrible or anything .. its first "coolness" (lack of a good phrase) movie. The first of the same old comedy was reused from the second and it really did not add any fundamentality to MIB University. <br /> <br /> There will be a perfect analogy for the first 3 films. Was it appropriate? Yes Is it worth bearing the title? Not really.
