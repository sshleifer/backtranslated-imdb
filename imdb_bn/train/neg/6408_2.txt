The IMDB films are surprisingly rated by the animation quality, Lonnie Tunes, Disney and MGM Prime Minister's light year, despite the surprises of UP's films. Sadly, due to the rising cost of making beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA Style (which began since 1950) began ruling in the late 50s and 60s. Finally, films were cheap for making dirt and they received many Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were now mainstream. As a result, lazy animation was becoming an ideal, and this trend was not reversed until the 1980's. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie of the UPA. Characters are very easy to draw (a straightforward and they used to stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawing (often a sponge and very rarely meets the items) with colors added to a sponge-dash method. <br /> <br /> For the story, it is a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love it, others find it very soon. Because of the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and shooting and all, this is probably not a great movie for kids. Because of hacks, animations and jazz, this is not a good movie, especially for me! Some will read my review and do not doubt I am a crank (which I am a degree). However, I like animated movies and this little UPA style goes a long way, and you can not seriously consider the great workings of their artwork - they soon make cartoons very fast. Ignore the Oscars and try to see some classic cartoons or something - something else!
