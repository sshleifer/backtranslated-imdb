I have seen this review a few months ago .... The trailer looked quite committed to me to buy this lump excuse for me. This is a complete joke .... and literally a spit like the Tasks Chanso Genocide (1974), which was the face of the early generations of the early generation, which was also the backbone of their cover art. Brandon actors should go to flip burgers and serve sticky hamburgers .... maybe he might not be as good as hell! This picture was bad and was a big annoying movie, sometimes you could not even see the actor's face. I do not remember the rest cast members who are really sad, they do not do anything to impress you to make you memorable. At the time I'm going to waste this review, so far as far as you are away, as long as you go from this junk pill, if you get it for 25 cents, then at least do not buy the pieces of untruth, it will entertain you! <<br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy good quality budget much better than this ... then watch the movie Jeff Hays ... because it takes the talent to create it horribly and the child does it! <<br /> <br /> I just gave 1 star for this cover art .... This is the only thing to choose from except for the "film" of this thing <br /> <br /> <br /> - Rick Blake
