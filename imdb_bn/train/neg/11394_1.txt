Oh, to scream loudly, I found the Lamest movie that I saw throughout the year, and I'm sorry, in general, the extraordinary cusack was even involved in this cute, intelligent stupid piece. Where Seattle's laziness has reached the same amount, more subtle, slightly more mature level, the cerebridary provides it with a slimhammer, and then it reaches your mentality for the next quarter hour and half of it (and that one hour and a half of my life will be back again No, thank you so much !!). It is quite bad that the main characters of this movie were enjoyable in addition to Jeremy Pavel, in addition to the psychological maturity level of 14-year-olds (actually I knew better than 14 years of age ...). Only the first 15 minutes or more of the film, where Kate Binsell's character played in the boring ciline about a game of throwing all the sensitivity to the air, was my best friend and I got bored out of the belief. I said, my husband was more intelligent about Rockstar, and at least, the characters of Rockstar were not as effective as half because the idiots were in this "Srendipitis" world. The novels that do not seem to have a source of their life are boring, and they seem to be nothing more than wishing the fate and fate of the dolls. How totally tiring I am sure that the film will not be involved in the uncertainty of chaos in order to choose a more complex life and then want to live with the consequences of accountability. Finally, here is a movie where our hero and heroine live happily after the anger and suffering of two people (as well as their native language), not to mention other relatives and friends. <br /> <br />
