Agreed Red Planet (Quikky Review) <br /> <br /> Like "Planet X Man Man", this is an odd science fiction story which is imagined from an era, where fantasy and science fiction were close to the same thing. Meaning, we have some extremely ridiculous special effects and masquerading as latent pseudo-science science fiction. And yes, this is one of the "classic" that gets released with a tiny picture in a high quality and sharp sound - through Midnight movies <br /> <br /> So the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is good. (What, did you think "Angrie Red Planet" is Neptune?) Before that, the crew filled with less important space crew entered into a space ship, inside which they smoked and took refuge in sexist fascists for a "sinful female" member. Crew It would have been somewhat objectionable by today's standards if it is not too funny. But the real reason for Mars is that we see this thing. The film is usually black and white, but on Mars Tuesday bloody red shouting. The angry red plaster has been angry with the angry Red Planet an attractive look of overweight redness. Is it really good sight ?? (Haha) Alien has to testify to the audience. The best is "ratbatspidercrab." Do you think a joke? They call it in the movie! It is a big chimera (small doll) that features rats, bats, spiders and crazy. It binds all the puppety and scares us out of "heroic crew". Another weird, and poorly imagined, will be seen in the alien, but that takes one cake. Eventually, after their frustration in Mars, the sexual crew increases their "ships" and they come back to any planet. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Science fiction film buffs and curiosity seekers, and some ordinary film buffs. Supporters of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one day (if they do not find it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 modern score, 6/10 nostalgia score, 4/10 overall <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
