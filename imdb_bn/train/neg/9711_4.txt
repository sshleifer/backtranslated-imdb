The reaction of this motion picture to the comments made by the residents of this region: A person suggested that the end of the ocean scene entertainment park and destruction of the park created a recession around the neighborhood. This is not just true. Before creating the Interstate 64, which crossed the ocean scene area, the primary route of traffic went through the oceanic philosophy. Once the internship is completed, the ocean scene quickly starts business and crime grows into a ghost town. This was reduced by a huge amount of Park Revenue, which faced a new competition from Bush Gardens near Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the last few years, Norfolk has done a tremendous job to revive the city's rehabilitation so that the area becomes the next place for high-end housing construction. Also it has been said that the footage of the roller coaster was used in the film "Rollercaster". It's untrue. The scene was played in two cast cars, which stopped the journey for that movie, but the real explosion and collapse, the monopoly for the "death of the Ocean View Park". Like the movie, the "supernatural" power in the water near the park was definitely silly, but for some time it was ideal for B-grade movies. Due to Caste's involvement, the initial actors almost all scenes are destroyed. I do not believe that this film wanted to be "bought by citizens"; I believe that it is believed to have been an area for the company (apparently not!) To determine whether the playboy is experimenting experimentally with a new non-nude format. The strange power that caused strange events in an old amusement park probably looked good at the conference table, but failed to execute the execution. Roller coaster and the rest of the park were regularly for debris; "Let's come up with a strange way to justify the death of an explosive!" <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But for thousands of people residing in this region and for the memorable memories of the park, the film is "walk down memory lane" for the footage of the park, as well as the old footage of the Norfolk city of the city's "Norfolk", and the Old Dominion University. Even the limited release of this movie will be welcomed in DVD.
