This film looks rather ridiculously annoying by reading the box in the video store. You know this kind of .... funny but supposed to be afraid of you .... It was not funny or awesome. Writing was lam ... impressive impressive and even cheerful me failed to joke .... They were so expected. Actors did not do much with such a good script ... at least I hope that it was not the best. See this movie at your own risk ... I'll give it to negative 3 big outfits.
