After watching this half, I was ready to give up and stop, but in the end I suffered. This is a movie that fails to be a romantic comedy and fails. Actor is poor - much worse than acting in 80 T & A movies. <br /> <br /> There are a number of humorous attempts which fail unfortunately and the movie is expected 100%. Perhaps, if you are a teen, this movie will keep appealing, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how it will be in the first 10 minutes of the film. Your remaining time is waiting for the end to end the credit. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time while watching it.
