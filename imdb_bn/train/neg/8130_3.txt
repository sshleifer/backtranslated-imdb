When discovery of some caves with his wife, the doctor was stabbed by a bat that caused some dangerous side effects. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the ambiguous environment and some modest (though used) makeup effects do not save it. B is a terrible man-creature rushing from a sub-titanic story. The Bat People's Eak It's Livy Night has plotted the night's intelligent story and there is a lack of pensing. The plot seems to never go anywhere and does not give an explanation for what happens in the movie, even if it is not satisfied with its conclusions. Cast is a moderate intermediate between their performance. <br /> <br /> I still give the film some points for its hunting theme songs and beautiful filming positions. The late Stain Winston makeup work is also good, but it does not get a showcase here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
