This was by far the worst budget horror movie I've ever seen. I am an open psychologist and I always love a good horror movie. Actually, when I'm renting movies I'm especially looking for some good underrated horror films. They always like to laugh, I believe, I've seen many people. But this movie was so terrible that it was not worth a chocolate. I was considering turning it into the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it, first and foremost, camera crew suck3d a $$ The article was just stupid like the end. Acting and special effects were terrible. I'm begging you, do not watch this movie, you absolutely hate it.
