This can be NC-17 due to all the tortures of this movie. But the Gori could have been Pag-13, and most of the oath was when Mama had the main Jackas bad boy boy friend. Many of the characters had developed that made the movie look better, then after the child came back to life like crying, one lonely hour and ten minutes killed people. Violence was excessive too and I think bodycount was a bigger number than a big number for movies like this. Almost every character of the film is shattered or their head is cut, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (although the character's lister is nothing other than hoodlum, even without closing, i'm hoods and part hood, they draw in class No, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). The teachers deserve more terrible death than any of the characters, but the back was just stabbed. There were two suspicious scenes in the film, but these could not be quite horrific. As I said, the killings were excessive and sometimes the people whose story is not about to do with the story wiped their heads. Gore was really fun to see, then it has been NC-17 Describing a body found in two areas of butter, they actually describe it as much more serious than that, they explained to the police that the boys are surrounded by maggots in the intestines. Though I did not want to see if his stomach was not even open, there was no way in his stomach Maggots. The act was unfortunate, the characters were damaged, and scarecrow could make many gymnastics stunts. I propose to rent this movie for the death scene, I have never seen it again, but I have enjoyed so much violence. Also, do not get bored with a seagull, I watched it five minutes and were worried about death, but it does not look good. The original scarecrow actually kept me interested.
