I think it's pretty safe that it's the worst movie ever made, when I saw the trailer on TV, I knew from the second exactly that it would be a piece of **** and it would be better to avoid it. I pulled some of the friends to see it, I went to the movies with low expectations, but I hope there will be some cheaper smiles to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" face in this movie, they mostly take hit and ball hits, the child looks weird and act like a horny gangster, and generally ethnic jokes we often see garbage comedy nowadays. The film is clear and the story is not only believable but predictable and lazy. The characters are extremely annoying and heavy stereotyped. If I do not ever want to see this **** film, I'd sometimes like to take a bullet on the legs than open these pieces of fuckwood. If anyone can see, they liked it, I would physically face them
