This is a very old and cheaply created movie - in many ways a common low-budget B-Western. Gary Cooper is not yet a star, and the film is very memorable for John Owen's early films for "John Poverty" studio. With both actors, their familiar style and personality is still not fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper is not like Cooper just a few years later (he talked about the first film among other things quickly) <br /> <br /> Contrary to the average B-movie, at least some interesting elements to make the film unique There are (if not better). If you want to see a woman who had married Ari Fleen for seven years, this is your opportunity. Lily Damita is big for the love of women and it liked a very, very weird casting, because she was not even close to having a heavy pronunciation (she was French) and "movie star commendable". Eventually, she married director Michael Cartridge. <br /> <br /> For me, the most memorable and strange aspect of the film is probably the gay subset - like Brockbaw in the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). The character of Girl Cooper was raised by two men, who hated women to hate women to hate women and mostly do what they can do through movies. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many sources throughout the film which indicates that filmmakers are trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, in the end, when one of them was killed, the other shot by an arrow and died long enough to crawl in his fallen friend and then fell - his arms covered his surroundings! It was a pretty good thing for the time and I think it makes this disgraceful movie really interesting! As far as Cooper and the plot is going on, the film is frustrating and very capable. Unless you are interested in costly or gay behavior, you should be biased and find a better western.
