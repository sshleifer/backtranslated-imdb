This picture was totally ... I can not find the word I'm waiting ... Shit! I started to say when I started it I was just fine and then it was very annoying. I was almost asleep and I had no relation with it that I was looking late because it was completely abused. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best but Cast could not play the original Sholay, meaning he meant to rebuild it. What was he trying to do? Sanjay Lelei Vansani be good and next year's prize will be completely black? Ajay and another guy that was good was particularly the other guy who played the raj because one of them all looks out. Amitabh is doing what? He is spoiling his own glory by making these stupid films. The first nishabad, then Jhoom repeatedly jumped after Chini Kuma and now I understand, laughing as much as possible before collecting some money and moving away from Bollywood, and I tell you that she is already half of her I mean, because of the recent fall of Amitabh, it's really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan. I do not really like him because he thinks he is God and I'm just going to be an actor in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it well, go to Hey Baby because it's the only fun movie and it's number one among the charts!
