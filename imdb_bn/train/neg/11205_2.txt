Yeah, well, I definitely apologized for this strange little observer on my Saturday night, too long, film. Apparently my life is not the main character for stealing two hours. Here's the epitome of antihero at 'No Regrets'. It is only a physical attraction of our mess, it is so hateful, so terrible, so selfish, aimless and impossible that attraction was very difficult to attract to an exotic businessman and his upcoming son, Gemman. She claims otherwise, love it. But after seeing it, like the loving Charles Manson because it digs great. (OK, that's not bad, but there is still no true release feature). I could not find Jerry's infinite traces due to the sun's cause. It has never been shown, Jimmy loves Sumin. Perhaps it's a culture that flies over my head: crazy / crazy = crazy love Seoul This is because more than half of movie movies are pushing others, and the last part is back in point, and it seems to be turning into a sculble comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to make a look. Okay, so while going to school, Sumin does two things, trying to do well is a lot better than trying. But after the first taste of his attraction, he left his job for some days of prostitution ring. What? All right, just as mentioned earlier, the job does not stop ties due to career / career change and if you throw a lot of other angry characters then you will get a confusing movie where unbelievable incidents can happen only without buildup. Basic movie, 100% not terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
