Overall this movie was awesome, and should never have been. One of the problems of this movie is that there is no link between the audience and the character, for example, if you are going to be attacked, then you want to feel, "Oh my God, no!", But you do not, in this case, you do not know because you know the character There are no links. In the trailer, though the movie seems to be great, there is no doubt about it. Perhaps there may be some mysteries but not there. "He has a toolbox." The DVD was said to be behind, you would think that this film is carefully designed and designed carefully, but it is not the end, it was very awkward, very straightforward and stupid. Acting is average or below average, even less. In my opinion it was an hour's waste of my life. The "special effects" and sets were also average, which is not as typical as before. There are not many pregnancies or bloodshed, blood count is not shown much. This film was advertised as an amazing thing for advertising, but in reality, it is not too valuable, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, through some fights and annoying stories.
