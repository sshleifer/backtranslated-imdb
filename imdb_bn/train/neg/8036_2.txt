Do you want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Actually I do not really know because if you allow you to attach yourself to a stolen version of original films, then perhaps you can see this movie amazing (this is a stolen copy of my film that I knew last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a common story setting; The so-called quiet young people are enjoying their holidays in Florida and they behave like very young people themselves. At this moment we get the only insight that the director can describe in the letters a ugly feeling of teenage despair. The second half hour of the film achieves slight momentum and portrays any beginning near the far-sighted murder. The third half hour of the film would certainly have been a mystery because I had already shut it down so that I could confuse myself further that the movie still shows some interesting and left-handed. As far as the story is concerned, it can be easily explained in several lines. A bunch of tens of thousands to go to Florida on holiday. Even though they are busy, they start slaying slowly (and I mean slowly) because they know some kind of stupid secret. The only thread to kill is that all the victims were a general high school matriculation. Anyway, one thing that makes me wonder about this movie, how much of the box (its not sure about the name ... blonde character) looks like dry. Another thing that surprised me about the movie is that it jumped me from my seat several times. Does that make it a work of art? My 12 year old nephew made me a glass of orange juice because she made me "wife" when I was walking through the door of the guest room ... the director and my 12-year-old nephew. The <br /> <br /> Do you want to know secretly ??? I'm not sure about you, but I do ..
