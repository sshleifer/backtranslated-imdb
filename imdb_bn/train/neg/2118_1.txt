What can I say about seven pounds ... I saw a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and the flight was long and the movie did not help boring. Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost completely impossible with his release. The film's two-hour plus run time cuts most of the screen time with random trash, which stitches the plots just as slow as possible. Rosario Dosne's character in the film's defense adds a little more life to the film, though not much. I did not understand that when someone can cry during this movie, I stopped doing what I wanted to do. Will also kill himself with jellyfish at the end, Will Smith proves that killing himself with a jellyfish is the most foolish way to die.
