I do not know who Archangel wanders around killing people and destroys things for rebellion, but my God is stupid. Orcas is most definitely cold blooded killer, not out of them in this movie ... makes her fool. Orcas extremely cute, do not make me wrong, but I highly doubt they know and revenge understand such an idea. So I talked about getting out of this movie, how entertaining it was that was unrestrained. So I was amused by at least a bit. Personally, if you want to watch an animal-killer-type-type movie, I would recommend watching and watching the jaws. But if you're like me and want to ridicule so far from the reality, then I'll ask you to go ahead. : D
