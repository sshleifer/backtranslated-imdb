I realize many Ben Stirlier will be out of the movie or this year, but perhaps he should emphasize the quality, not the amount. <br /> <br /> I thought of what the filmmakers did for comedy "Along Cam Polly." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stiller's schtick is getting tiring. He undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to take another schtick or a break, to find out that some are actually fun. Because his movies are being frustrating unreasonably bad. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Steiler and Jennifer Aniston, it's a shame because she's a good, smart actress with a good career. As long as he makes more films like "The Good Girl" (which is horrible) and more movies like "Come Polly", then there will be his career so that he can be proud. <br /> <br /> Anthony tries hard to overcome the lecherous stuff with his work, but it's a tough job for an actress. Except for a few moments with Rubyber's best friend Sandie as Alex Beldwin, Ruben's Boss Stan and Philip Simmur Hoffman, there is nothing interesting about this horror movie. Other supporting characters, such as Lisa and Hans Azeri, like Debra Messaging, are annoying. Aziyar's pronunciation is not just stupid, it is very strange <br /> <br /> The promise of "true poli as well as" is surely promised. Unfortunately, it is necessary for a writer who can actually change it in an extraordinary comedy, instead it is a ferocious, weird, boring excuse for a comedy.
