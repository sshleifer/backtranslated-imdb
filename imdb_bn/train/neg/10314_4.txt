The one who likes Chase scenes and the story of this impressive true life was really stimulated, I was the optimistic title of this film but there were many obstacles in the way of good story. BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duval and the character he has played, but his role here is as an insurance investigator as neutral. <br /> <br /> The dialog is fuzzy and beautifully narrated Harold's original junk-face. From what I read, there were many directors to replace each other in this movie, and it is very bad. You can not tell the story accurately with stories. I could not be "involved" with Trip Williams Cooper's screenplay. She was interesting, but she did not have this movie. It is also a sad comment that a criminal is a "hero of the man", but I acknowledge that I am also making the root for him. <br /> <br /> Not everything was frustrating. I can not complain about the visibility of desert from the green forest of Oregon in the desert from Arizona. <br /> <br /> I want to recreate and make this film better, because it is a story of a kind.
