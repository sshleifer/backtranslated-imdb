I say I was very interested to see this movie, which was released in the 1970's by Fox of the 20th century, it was considered a notorious disaster. It has popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and it only deepens interest. I just saw this movie making it so bad. Seeing it, I think I have the answers. Although I would say it's strange to see, acting, direction, and the script is so ridiculous, that the supposed ridicule is completely absent. Rackel Welch seems to be trying to carry the picture, but after the sequence of sex-change operations, the film goes so far in the mountains that he can not handle this task alone. Uncle Buck Loner John Hawston certainly does not help, because he leaks on the screen and lace, sometimes he has seen that he is surprised by what he is doing there. Rex walks around Reed Myron, has changed the arrogance of Maya, and even has his own famous masturbation scene. Bravo for the first debut! Froh Fossette played a stupid blonde; He certainly believed in this role. But, of course, reasonably the most notorious role Mae went to the west. The view of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face seems more suitable for a horror movie. I personally do not mean to throw this up; But nobody looks good in this film. The direction seems so helpless and incomprehensible that the film is not only bad but rather annoying. Return to the old movie footage of old stars, and the movie is more disconnected. Everyone enjoyed it by anyone who enjoyed it, and I was happy that at least it was seen, but Mothers Breakeridge thinks it's always going to start from.
