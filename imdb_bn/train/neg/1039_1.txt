This "film" is one of the most awesome things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please make a favor and avoid this inactive concoction. <br /> <br /> Camera vibration and your actor is not counting as "direction", taking Scowls, which requires these film draws. Not all of the writing was surprising, but we were put together with a cluster of artificial characters operated in the artificial way (these pseudo-documentary "genres" who are not directly aware of them). <Br / <br /> <br /> This picture shows that critics have made an objectionable appeal to those who do not know the first thing about making movies (which is the most among them). <br /> <br /> Just terrible. It is a lot about Sundance and it is happening there that Victor Vargas appears there.
