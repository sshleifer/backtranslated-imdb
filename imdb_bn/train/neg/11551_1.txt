Seriously, absolutely nothing is good about this shit festival. Randolph Scott, a close homosexual living with his boyfriend Kerry Grant for twelve years, is boring at most of his wooden and at least roles. He was completely old for these romantic roles at the age of 57, although there is not so much of that, because Gaail Russell feels older than 31 years of age and because of his chronic alcohol and chain smokes he is so ugly. Lee Marvin plays his usual harmful role, but this garbage is not enough to save. Thanks to God, they are not westernized, they are just dated, racist old films that glamorize guns and killings. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
