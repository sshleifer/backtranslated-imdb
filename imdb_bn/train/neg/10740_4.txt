This movie starts with a certain amount of promise; But, in my view, it started to lose when the drama kidnaps the Samaritan better when it comes to its help when its car breaks. This meaningful newborn begins to fix his car, while he is making a phone call, it is impossible to do, but he is one of the few people in the country who can help his family to keep track of the track. In the beginning of the storyline, the authors are warned against using them in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found the best average of this movie. Industry aspects have been very good, such as cinematography. The performance was good, and so was the singing of Eva van Dar Guicht.
