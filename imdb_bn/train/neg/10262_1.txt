Now, I've just been confronted with this curiosity and I see, in the same way you see a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I am truly grateful that it is a fool, but it does not stop I fear God, terrible And criticized the dialogue. Seriously, this was one of the poorest movies I saw - it looked more like a episode of the Crypt Keeper Tales, and its a poor one ... <br /> <br /> OK - some criticisms (1) when the monster The doctor's heart attack was attacked in front of us (we do not see him a giant attack, so we feel his heart attack), then the army starts giant shells, rockets, bullets - which Aktarera legs - yet doctors did not touch any of the missile is still alive, and (2) about 100 yards away from the military, and we are using a flame thrower - Geez, those things are not more than 30 meters! (3) When the giant tries to take the professor, the soldiers enter the classroom and set fire on the roof; The monster threw the child, and the soldiers are not trying to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) Giant looks like something outside the Power Rangers! (5) In a scene where five "good boys" (pastors, daughters, doctors, reporter and children) are all surprised and we have received feedback after each other - so natural! (6) The general just goes away, time after time (7) refuses to try and does not listen to normal electricity (8) Acting is awful. (9) Did I mention the rubber case monster ???? (10) That God is awful music, non-stop!
