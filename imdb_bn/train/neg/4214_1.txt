I spent quite a few hours in total disbelief and 80% of that time, I can give this trunk turkey for the trash year, there is no problem. Plot was incredible to say something big understatement. To tell the truth, I lost the words to describe this curiosity. The characters are not entirely complete and completely without any mismatches (these kinds of things have been better than dozens of 'serial killer flicks') but the act was terrible. Those who pay to see it, I hope you get your money back, who paid for it, I hope you return your money. Believe me that there are many new releases that are much better. let's see.
