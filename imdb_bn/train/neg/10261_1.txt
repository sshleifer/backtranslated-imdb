Wow, I've seen it on TV in the "Scary" films shown around Halloween. Was this g rated? This movie was really nothing to be awesome, or something valuable. Also, other people say it is a fool, but I do not think so. For a spoof, you need something called "humor". This low budget strap-comedy was not a comedy, and it did not give too much knowledge. You basically see a secret looking monster (people in a rubber suit) coming out of closets, killing people, I suppose, since you are not doing any violence or violence for the monster next. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess it's good enough. <br /> <br /> The army tries very hard to kill the demon, which is not bigger than the human. They have a very bad goal. Then the military flace! Wow, is this film suppressing the US military? The monster is hard to kill, without a shuffle around and not much without much rage. Oh, and sometimes a second head pops out of her mouth and shrieks. It was a little interesting, yet there was a total of Allian Ripoff. <br /> <br /> Was the scientist able to attract the monster by playing the silhouette? Due to poor sound quality, many conversations were difficult to understand. Also, why the monster carries around the main wimpy guy for such a long time? Why did the giant go in the closet when it was a chance? Why I insist on trying to figure out the intelligent?
