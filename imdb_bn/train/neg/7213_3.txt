I certainly consider Exorcist to be a horrible classic, I would admit that I do not hold it as too many other horrible fans as it is too high. As a result, I did not see much of the Exorcist Rip-Offs, and whatever the exorcisms, I would say it's a good thing that this film is hellish and certainly not expensive, it's ninety minutes! It is often considered bad for other Exorcist rip-offs, and it is probably not the best place to start for me. It is not hard to guess what a plot is: basically it is similar to Exotic and it is possessed by a demon spirit (which can be the soul of his dead father). The village priest is then called to perform exorcism. Like many Spanish horror movies, this is Paul Naschchi, which is a great thing about film. Exorcisimo was directed by Juan Bose, who previously indicated the derivative Spanish gaelo 'The Killer Way Gloves'. I did not see any other film on him, but on the basis of these two: I believe fundamentalism is not one of its strongest positions. I can not say much about the film; It is mostly not just valuable to wait for plods and exorcism scenes along. I certainly do not recommend it!
