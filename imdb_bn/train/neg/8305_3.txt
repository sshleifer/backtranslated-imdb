Like most people I like the "non-Christmas story". I've never heard of this picture and probably for good reason - it's awful. The same local, same descriptor, was the same director but lack of original warm laziness. Charles Grodin Darrin McGavin was a poor choice to replace but I can not imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems oblivious and the lack of original sweetness. Contact with neighbors, Bumpuses, ridiculous The horror of the BBC's "Christmas Story" rally seems to be beautiful, but his emotions in this movie are boring. Scud Farks, the main neighborhood bandit, is replaced by another child in this film and with a braid and weird hat, but with little appeal to the short faucets, Although this film is made with the original film, it will be equally similar.
