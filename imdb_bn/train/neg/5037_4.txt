Plot = A new girl in the city of Melissa, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is coming one week. Melissa is beautiful, so every boy in the town wants to make a command with him, but some people who take my interest in mysteriously die. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see this picture because I was really on Friday 13 th pt 3, it is not a valid reason why to see and watch a movie. When I started to see it, I realized that "Sweet Salton" is not a very good slash, it is really dull and annoying and can not go anywhere. More than an hour later, only three were killed, and this story was not developed in any way possible. <br /> <br /> This picture has been shot nicely with beautiful photography and good guidance, but like many other slashers, in the 80s Flickr, the film is sometimes very dark. Acting is really good and although Melissa's character is completely sympathetic to her, it is easy to be sympathetic to her. <br /> <br /> The line of the story is not entirely rubbish, but it was very neutral to be interested in you, Melissa was the only subject of my interest, she was stunning and Dana Kimle whose film is really sweet and beautiful. <br /> <br /> All the beautiful nifty flash that does not go anywhere. I certainly would not recommend it to slush fans.
