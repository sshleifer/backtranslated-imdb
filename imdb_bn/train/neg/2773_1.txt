To this point, Genel Rain was the worst film in history. This is provided by 'Blockbuster' from Asia. It's a "star" and it has John Rhys Davies. He swashbuckling the way out of shape, the magical flying Baddie he is throwing here. The rest of the people could not do their job outside of junior high school play. No clich√© was missed in the dialogue, and special effects were made as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see that some people in Asia have some money and some actors need to create a car. They wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or a writer who needed credit. I guess this movie is with a carrier's identity card <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Thanks to one hundred thanksgiving this turkey could not eat. <br /> <br /> A funny scene was unknown. King Brother's view is visible King? A handsome, older, younger Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? A six feet European. (Also a bad actor.) There is no excuse for this. They hoped that this poor man could not take Jett Leah's brother Pius Brosnan out of the fifty-year-old western film "Injun" at cheap prices.
