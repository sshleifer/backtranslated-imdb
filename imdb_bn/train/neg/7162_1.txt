This image is a good idea, 2000 year old witch can be a good idea and can completely destroy it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who are dry to go to Ireland. They are going to be with her nuns and uncles. The uncle was discovered in a pit of 2000 year old witch discovered. She revives her and she takes the form of Nora. He can not be killed conventionally, (more sorrow). Dora, however, works in a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a Gothic horror film that is done cheaply. It's a wide mess. I have to ask why anyone wants to create such a bad picture. I am tempted to learn magic to make it invisible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs
