This image was probably inspired by Gorded's Masculin, Feminine and I request you to see that movie instead. This film has two strong elements and they are (1) realistic acting (2) impressive, unexpectedly good, pictures. In addition to this, my biggest blow is the impressive continuous flow. Lenna Nyman will be the world's most annoying actress. He is so stupid and working with all the nudity of the film, ... it is unreasonable. Compared to Goda's film, intellectualization has been replaced with stupidity. Not to go too far into this matter, I would say that following the difference of ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> its time and place. 2/10.
