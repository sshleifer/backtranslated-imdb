The worst thing about crush is that it is not a bad thing, or the plot is not actually existent and it is not too bad that the camerawork can be good. No, the worst part is a few great moments in this movie, which you can expect more to come. <br /> <br /> But at the end, it's too late. If you are a fan of 40+ women voice-music and cheap tierzing scenes, cry and talk and marry about kids and marriage - so by all means, do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I'm really thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie itself, and as a result I had a pretty awesome time. Some of the most brilliant jokes can not be made for the rest of it. <br /> <br /> judgment: 4/10. The crime of wasting my time <br /> <br />
