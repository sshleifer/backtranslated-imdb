This movie is just plain terrible. To reduce the number of young San Savitz to another movie, this locale had to be reduced. He acted as a rare vampire who helped wash a lady as a dancer in a local strip club and throw it into the street hooker. He felt a drop of blood from a dancer on the outside of the dressing room floor. Sage is then determined by a small leader of this rare vampire species, which looks like a cross between the 80's punk rocks and the Olsen pairs with violet hair. This movie is just crazy with Savage Rapping and gets mad with her spiky spider on her head, even rarely one. He quoted Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. And then they can bring the biggest special effects, throwing their organs out of their mouth and expelling them from their mouth. And you can say that all of that fake. His son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and more than pest than the object of peace. I enjoy a good vampire film, believe me, but I just hit it. The camera also comes out with the camera and comes out and tries to play it faster for the camera, and the camera shines behind the son of the son. He's nearly blind until Corri's. Avoid this one !!
