I sat on the screen sat, riveted, yawning, still kept a visual eye. I waited for the next horror special effect, or the next ridiculously cleared plot item to show the full power, so I can not learn to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like they are ready to do this, the crew watched every single action / science-fiction / shooting-at-up / good versa movie movie movie and saw cool things and said: "Hey, we're I can do it. " For example, in one mile, the parked car does not seem to be parked like a shoulder road, it is a car that gives birth to a protagonist, a beautiful baby girl born is thrown. Even on the cars they are sliced ​​into pieces beforehand. The special effect was quite possibly my biggest beef with this movie. But in my bad books it was really impossible, and the lack of the reasons for so many factors! For example, rival, a flying monster with the ability to harm strange means, is the only military truck on an important VIP transport. Find unnamed safety boys trucks with guns, you know they are already dead. Then the VIP defender says, "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" When he finds out that the animals that killed his 3 friends, he gets pumped into fashion in a nearly ridiculous fashion. Then there is no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and general sense, Fool ass gets VIP track out !!! The film did not understand what happened. Transparent acting keeps me away from movies as well as bad cameras and what lets you let go: "Wow, that's incredibly cheesy." Sini has saved the film from Appleby 1, because she gave the film an element that enjoys audience experience, sexual appeal.
