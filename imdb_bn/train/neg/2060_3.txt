A repressed housewife (An annoying lisping Angie Dickinson, whose body doubles her / delicates her with an extreme tension) is sexually disturbed by her husband and decides to branch out. It's a straight killer string that will soon get high-class prostitution (Nancy Allen, obviously I'm in a wrong business if she can bring $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Kenn). If you see De Palma Rip off (excuse me, "pay tribute") to Hitco, see "sister" clock instead. "Shahidul to the Kill", being loaded with style and technical expertise, I sit among the most busy thrillers. The plot is absurd and tired. It features some surprisingly effective shocking and nasty graphic killing features that can make a horrible fan happy, as long as they can overcome the shameless storyline, which should be dates in the 1980s also.
