Keeping me saying that I think myself (more!) Is one of the open-minded film exhibitors ... movies are my passion, and I have a great regularity in my local culture-movie-rental space. Whenever I go there, they feel the need to ask me often for advice about movies and I do not think I can leave the place in exchange for any discussion or discussion. Civic-movie area ... I like to rent strange things, and why this film was recommended by a person in this movie's movie-video-video. He told me that I would see it. , And since the cover says something like a movie with the situation of Jordosky (my darling!), So I hired it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not really fair because I do not think it was terrible, I do not know how to rate it otherwise. A question mark may be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only movie that literally made me sick in my stomach: I actually felt physically ill! Am I whose sole stomach turned literally? Still I do not want to stop it, or I just could not have been fascinated by a bad way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, like 1 I said. Just do not want my cup (or oder for that thing) ...
