The plot and characters are ridiculous and rarely qualify as "plots" and "characters". The biggest problem is that everything is dark, focus-out and blurry. Phulchi does not fill the entire movie. On the other hand, the whole matter is completely weird and filled with gender and violence. Inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the main characters says that she has no friends, but she is tired of a new person in a minute of screen time, and there is a whole hunch of women in her side. Even though he has set an arrow arrange randomly among the poor, he shows his socio-social trend ***** who is thinking of own business only! Images of blood or cow flow attract more attention than letters but what you want from Fluchchi. Maybe it's her career has been destroyed, but it was not really stupid than the Jumbo. If you like poor Italian flicks or rent a fare, then frustrated for some of the sword and sorcery or malicious things. How do you suck in a pit from 2 feet to your head and do not sleep through screaming for help?
