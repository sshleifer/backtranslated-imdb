As far as haest movies are gone, it is very weak. The continuity of the series is quite strange, the continuity of the character is not such as you really understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he's one reason to look at his value. The folk has some great lines, such as "He'll come back, he'll go to 'buy some saga' or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, although they are entirely due to actors. Directions, scripts, and editing are quite lousy.
