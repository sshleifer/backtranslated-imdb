A romantic and completely false view of unemployment from middle-class "artists" with a comfortable motivation ... It is clear that the writer-director has never been faced with unemployment and of course there is no personal experience. If you believed the ridiculous story, the unemployed people of all ages behave like teenagers, do not have anger, fear and frustration. They never look for work, almost never refuse or suffer, etc. Living on the dolly is just like a summer vacation from school ... wise. Especially if you compare it with Ken Loach's preferences to contemporary masterpieces.
