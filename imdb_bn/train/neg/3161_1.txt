Most of the "over his dead bodies" are so pessimistic that I was actually excited for the embarrassing for the actors in my constituency. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eva Langriya proves that she can not bear this horrible romantic picture. Comedy, and more, that he really does not have any ridiculous timing. She is grating and annoying as a Scratch who returned to Earth to keep a chick psychic from her widow fianc√© dating. Pierre Rud, a drug addict and shiny solo actor, played with Paul Rod, when McClel played Bell Lac, which brought the film to any animosity. I felt most sorry for Bell, because he seems to have some comic power and was working overtime in an effort to create the material. Unfortunately, he has stood against the extraordinary task of making a film to tolerate Jason Biggues, and he is dragging the rest of the "Titanic" with the rest Cast like Leo DiCaprio. <br /> <br /> "Pie on his dead body" actually stopped me because of his lack of laziness and complete lack of effort. I have started thinking about such attractive projects that can not be funded because lots of money is being screwed into such a soft whip. Really, Hollywood thinks this kind of movie is good enough? How stupid they are to the people of the film? <br /> <br /> Grade: F.
