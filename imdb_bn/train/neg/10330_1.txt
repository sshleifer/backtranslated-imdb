Wow, here is finally; Action without action "movies". In the future, a real low-budget setting in Seattle (do not miss flying bright flying pieces a few times), we would like to work hard in a brain to take revenge on his childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing, even the original or interesting of even the background and the performance of actors competing stupidly by attempting to steal in other movies, basically without the meaning of "matrix" meaning correctly. Yes, we can see some walls and slow drawing-out (about 45 seconds) running, but these scenes are now cold like an attempt to make fools about man's inadequacy. And, yes, we served a number of lead which does not lead completely anywhere, such as before the visualization of the script was previously thought out by the invisible cast. <br /> <br /> Believe it, it's probably as bad as it can get. Actually, it's not seriously advisable, but perhaps I can give you some rent and save your money.
