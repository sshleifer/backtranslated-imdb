Naming the most painful piece of monotony in the history of the film is not an easy task, the candidates have so much, but Namesis 2 is my personal choice. It was very interesting that we had to hire it again the next day, and once again I laughed, I was literally roaming on the floor. (Usually when I can see Monty Python's "Antartic Scott"). <br /> <br /> Holds strongly to the audience throughout the whole movie. I am completely surprised that this painful home video has ever been made at production level. It is supposed to be a seagull, but there is no apparent relationship with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time the "Alex" woman, although this film is about to throw us half way, to stop guessing, with all the muscles and barrierian-namated outfit! <br /> <br /> It's not really a plot, it's just a chaotic chase scene, but it's very slow and intelligent that it calls a chasing scene and it makes it a more interesting word than it really is. There is almost no conversation that takes its quality into consideration, and then suddenly it comes to a wonderful end, which happened with a lot of gasoline explosions, without explaining what it really was. Thankfully, it's not annoying because some fools and fools are running all the time! <br /> <br /> Horror movies are usually very tiring, but the nominees 2 are the most important and the perfect blend of illogical helplessness, it's really entertaining. Rent this film, or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
