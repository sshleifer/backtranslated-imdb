I'm the real fan of the original cracker series, and all of them own DVDs. There was a tendency to be top of the cracker, but Robi Coleton and other cast members and writers always carry it despite themselves. I count the main cracker in the Great Britain TV series of that time, and there are some rigorous competitions: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes and some others. The cracker with Prime Suspic, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> which has created "a new terror" and more sad ... <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a very pale imitation of the former glory of the cracker. I forced myself to sit with the whole thing, it is true that it can not really be bad and some sparks will eventually blaze. I was wrong, was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Some criticism: First of all, just get a straight-forward favor right from right to side: I droned across most of anti-American anti-war shows, and that drowned. Leading: Americans are innocent of any crime and the threat of British whistle killers is "understandable, but not fair". I thought, "I'm alive for two hours after hearing this rogue bit?" So my negative response to anti-warring American tones against my beliefs was ... out of politics, I had the clarity of the idea that this cracker was only for the sake of the campaign and it was really a horrible weak script <br /> <br /> Second, how much is Robi Coleton Get windy time? Fitz was almost a bit player, as he was associated with some of the main stories without any thought of the role of Fitzger's. Coltrane could carry her own wide and still suitable flabby shoulder show, but the writer was definitely thinking of other issues, and missed the opportunity, and by a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: An irrational script! Some were shiny and a few bits of genuine character development (Fezta's son believed that Fitza could miss his plane if he misses his plane in Australia, the detective likes to hit on the back of his poor actors, the head, and the old sparks between Feitz and his Ms.) But not enough to carry tiring tales. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where was the Pahalagan? Now that was interesting ... after all it was in Manchester, and he would rank up for 10 years. Another isolated opportunity (or perhaps the actress was not interested) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> This is broadcasted on BBCA), the advertisement declares that "the director's cut" was available on the BBC's on-demand, I thought I was AH! The director's cut, perhaps, must be paid for one, maybe all the items seen tonight may have, but never did it like a coherent, interesting storyline. Unfortunately, in the hope of being valuable, somewhat, something to look forward, after being disappointed after setting myself up for the terrible free edition of "a new terror", I have no hope that I have to be motivated to pay for the second meaning, perhaps longer and more tedious Version Along with this, it disturbed me that the BBC had showcased the hours of cutting and dying of ads and infinity (every ten minute or so) of the ads, and then turned around and asked me to pay for the version of the broadcast version today <br /> <br /> To stop, I quote the first paragraph of the "A New Terrorism" review S: It really says: "Robi Kollenren's initial enthusiasm, Jimmy McGawron, author of the BBC's Defective Delegated Political Statement, is determined to reach this revival in Vedic." The criminal psychologist first jolted his message - that is, Americans are a bunch of Hunan Nimbi-Pambians Terror does not take care of our terrorists before our doorstep crashes Against others were attacked - myakagabheranera chest-clearing rent this story aroused and were pleased with the fit of this case.
