Wasted wasted on custom unread scripts. Ten or more adults re-enter the summer camp, which they were present as youth. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy, and that's an annoying one. They become a teenager again? Do they reconcile their curiosity, games, good times? They can try but ultimately the answer is: No. There is no conspiracy? Which mystery? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. This drivel is how anyone can be entertained by me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
