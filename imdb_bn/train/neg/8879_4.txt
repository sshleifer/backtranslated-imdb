I think Cliff Robertson is certainly one of our best actors. His achievements are half a dozen classic. He is fine here as heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pacing is so tiring, it gets off the mark. The story starts well though it makes me wonder how to hang up with her wife. Still he carries the best mugs and things along. Death knees are twofold. After all, if we spend time periods from one room to another or to a part of the house, it will eat almost a third of the film. Adding that, Robertson's character is sitting in bed in blue light, looking confusing, that could add another part. I said half-hour shorter that those who agree it would be a pretty decent, though tiny film. The biggest weakness is simply a cunning plot that is called when it is done and leaves unbelievable questions. I'm not putting spoilers, but when it's over, do not worry too much. I can come up with ten key-ifs without sweating. It was good if it was a ghost story.
