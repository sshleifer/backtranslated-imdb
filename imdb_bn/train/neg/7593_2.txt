I do not like this movie, but I do not think most of the book, although although many are praised as "best compositions", I have found stupid and unreasonable in the development of character and unreasonable in the plot, although it was much more readable than the first of the fiercely first attempt, "Los Angel's Road "was not published until the 80th minute became fashionable. <br /> <br /> I saw that any kind of soup town would be made with such small elements. To correct many errors in the book, he worked hard on script but it was not recovered for my money. While trying to stay faithful in the book, there was no movie in The Dish Dust. I consider the folly of this picture town. <br /> <br /> A word: forgot.
