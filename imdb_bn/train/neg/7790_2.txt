Like some people who reviewed this movie, I was also vaccinating nostalgia about it ... I was unfortunately ever seen to see it again. Well, my childhood memories of this movie were completely unbelievable, and the dangers of the polyline were now expressed as an embarrassing exercise to create banned, racist, and general annoying films. Even the presence of old professor Edward Everton Horton and Terry-Thomas can not be crossed by a ranked screenplay, a terrific theme song, and some harmful 'special effects'. In addition, stereotypical illustrations of African and Arab characters make it painful to watch, especially in the wake of the civil rights movement. Michael Walden's original psychotronic encyclopedia reported that the dangers of polyline were originally produced on television but unrealistic the theater was released. Judging from the consequences, that is a completely credible (and annoying) scenario.
