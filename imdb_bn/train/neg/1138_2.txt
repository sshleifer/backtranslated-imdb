It was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I thought that I had to stop, but sadly I made life a lifetime and it made it a little embarrassing with the whole poor movie. OK. If you o.k. With impressive moral plots and widely misunderstood Whitman that does not mind watching a movie. If you want a sugar fictional story go for it.
