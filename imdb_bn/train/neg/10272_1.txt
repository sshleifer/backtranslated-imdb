When I read the DVD case, I thought that it looks really interesting ... so ... my mother was thrown into the movie Crown in Blockbuster's "4 dollars for $ 4" section. When we come home and pop in the movie ... twenty minutes in it, we see ourselves looking at each other. "This sucks. Let's do something else." I will admit, some lines of caf√© friends laugh us a little. But let's get at least some decent actors! Each time in the movie, if the acting is bad and the film is not going to a slow pace and is actually attractive, I can stop it and get some smiles (or bottom) on their line how they end. But I can just take it so. Watching the scenes looks like the actor is laughing laughs, there is no supply for their line ... amateur does not come close to acting in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here says that they are watching this movie when they actually got some good medicine. It was the most incompetent thing to watch I was ever bothered. Do not see this movie buy !!!!!
