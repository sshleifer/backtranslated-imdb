Quintin Crisp once said that when things are shown very nicely, it is a romantic When things are unbearably deadly, they are realistic. And when some ugly treatment gets, they are on spot. Unfortunately for Leon de Arano, he falls into the second catagory. This director has tried very hard without the Spanish "Cain Loch" type film, comedy, and characters, without being able to lift greed films only from 'sadness'. Los Lunes Al Sol, just that, only depressing. Things are irrationally scary. Characters The extreme extreme moments reach a climax at the same point, and if the glam story is not enough, the arrows wash the story with a visible gray and intense color palette. These films got ridiculously high ratings in Gooseas. A film showing sympathy for the weaker citizens of the society, in this case unemployed port staff, does not automatically create a good movie, although I would be the first to be sympathetic to the fate of these people. This movie only guides their fate about failure. In the 21st century, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and public transportation ferries are good creatures, and there are few problems with the birds and there is little happiness in them. Leon de Arona clearly does not have any formula about Spain's working class Spain, and it does not help in any way. Pretty, I can draw the only conclusion. The scene that has seen a free football match for men is directly copied from a movie that is a "poverty trap", that is, "purely belt", which is much more compelling, ridiculous, and still sad.
