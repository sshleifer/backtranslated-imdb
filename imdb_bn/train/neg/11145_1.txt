Where do you start? . . . It seems ... violation! OK, violation! I spent 1.5 hours in my life, 1.5 hours that I could spend something more useful, like the paint looks dry, on this so-called horror flick. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, it's not funny, it's not a work, nothing's there ... <br /> <br />'s prediction, its annoying, its sad ... <br /> <br /> I can be a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... no ... no, do not see it ... unless you want to violate it.
