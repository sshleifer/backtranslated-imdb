Bashkie should congratulate the English fiction for converting a great movie into a movie and then it should be fooled for this effort. The animation was poor, the characters seemed ridiculous, the music was very shining, and the film was a ramshackle blitus by the first book and the best composition of half the TokyoView. When I first saw, I could still hate for my frustration and the movie. Now I realize that any attempt to transform a book into a book is bound to fail in many cases due to the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply benevolent. Bashaki is able to do much more.
