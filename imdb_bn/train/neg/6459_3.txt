Such great actors such as a disappointment Marlon Brando plays and horror character, the movie is not funny, a subconscious message can be seen "It's a dump crape !!!", "It has become so bad !!", "Your TV becomes virtual", and soon It's just annoying and annoying. There is something else besides humorous plot, humor. The way the rooms are sorted, paint. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause diarrhea. Generally I'm not worried about the decoration in the movie, but it makes me angry from "free money". Avoid all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Shane, Sutherland and Brando, but one viewer does not get anything! Watch it at one of the cost of sanity.
