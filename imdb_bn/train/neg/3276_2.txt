1980's TV show, updated with fresh female meat, and raunchy language. "Hajjar dukes" passed me; Whenever I was in New York or in California, it was not repeated; Or, perhaps I saw it. Yet, from somewhere (clips with the updated version of the film 2005), I knew it was about a fast, orange doss charger - and, "General Lee" is still good to go. <br /> <br /> Hanki cousin, Shane William Scott and Johnny Noxville (as B and Luke Duck) are the new riders of Orange Rishi. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as a daisy) fills her scimpy little well - but even her brilliant pink bikini can not lose the competition from bouncing, a format of topless code. Very stupid plot threatens to turn Hajjar County into a strip-house involving a gray Butt Reynolds ("Boss" as Hogg). <br /> ** Hazzard Duchess (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ San William Scott, Johnny Noxville, Jessica Simpson, Bart Reynolds
