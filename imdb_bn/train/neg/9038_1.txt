It is one of the critics, because it is "impossible", because it's a terrible product, though not, this version does not retain the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so Looking at it, I can start and follow pages in my book, which does not make fun with any adaptation. Rather, see the 2001 version of Craig Pin Glover. While maintaining the novel's spirit, this humorous version brings new details to the film. Important is not the minutiae of things like spirit, setting, character name, and clothing. Differences between these film editions, such as night and day, are tiring and ridiculous. An adaptation is poor, painful, mind-numbing schlock if a version of this version may be wrong.
