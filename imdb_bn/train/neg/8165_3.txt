This is a ghost story. This is a cannibalism story. This is a revenge story. This is a very bad thing in many violence. I think it follows the cheapest along the lines of each slashher movie you've ever seen. This is the usual isolated place, chicken campers, heading off in the desert. Guessed, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's just so dull. Bad edit and whole work Ghosts crying as if they were talking about a waste point. I'm not really sure that the rules and rules of Scratch and Seed are controlled by Psycho. This is a full scene scene where a man eats a piece of meat which actually rests his wife. Once a friend of mine asked me why to show such void, sick violence. I'm afraid that this is another step in our evolution of spontaneous. Three here no cleverness, no tongue in cheek, only a sad waste during the time. Lots of blood; Little plot
