2005 gave us a very nice "big porn" flick hostel, and 2006 gave us a live feed; The hostel is so decent rip off. Live Feed Eli Roth follows the same formula as the previous movie, in addition to this, the mobile phone centers are located in Asia instead of Europe. The plot focuses on these fools, and disturbs one of the locals among them so that they find themselves in trouble. Locals decided to lock them all in the theater and kill them. Even though I've heard somewhat less sensible about this film, I still hope it can be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson is 45 minutes before rape and a revenge film 'Torch' but this picture simply falls down because it is mostly ridiculous or annoying. Apparently Greenhaus Cinema (which hosted the hostel successfully) is trying to return to the old days, but it does not really stop. Wonderfully, considering the previous work of Nicholson in special effects - even Gore is not impressive ... though it's much better than acting! I will not say anything about this movie ... it's not bad and well-meaning. Avoid it!
