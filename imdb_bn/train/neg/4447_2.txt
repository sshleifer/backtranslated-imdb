Yes there are bad movies. Most of them are made as shoes, shoes, strings budgets, or a TV. The movie of the week, but this week's movie will not be more than two stars. This is a poor movie which has been shown to an insulting woman who destroyed the king of poor people in the hands of the protector of the people. (If it is trying to show that a person does not need a person to protect him, then the movie should be superfluous and not in it). There is no doubt that there is no character development, and a heroine that can be expelled by a rolling onion. (I think she throws her wedding ring in the boat instead of putting her own wedding ring under the ocean (where her body should have a condition), and the husband finds out that she is dead, because she is still often killed because of her children's feelings. ) I am always surprised when I usually see a high rating like this movie and it realizes me that The lead is still challenging the people have an unread market. By her work. I keep crying laughing in humanity.
