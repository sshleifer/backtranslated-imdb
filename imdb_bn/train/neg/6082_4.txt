Although there are a few known "television" names related to "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary about the movie or any performance. Actually, this is a separate issue from the 1960s-70s television series "The Pat Patrol" which is a big cast and a lot of violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thinking that he should try to refrain from all the light comedy stuff ("Manveric", "Support your local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter" etc.). . Unfortunately, the choice of her soil works against her, because Sledge Clint Eastwood's spaghetti is a ridiculous character for the popularity of Western characters. But Eastwood's staff was not flat and unintentional. <br /> <br /> I think "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as Spaghetti Western though the pen is very slow to enjoy. Slow-down "Combat" television series fans will feel the instant connection because Vick Morrow ran the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kölsky. Throw in some broken slow-shots and cross-mixes, instead of serving a story-spoken purpose, focuses on itself. <br /> <br /> This plot is a "big hist" thing (here, insert "War Wagon"), which is about slate plating on how to learn $ 300,000 in gold shipment. His gang includes Cloud Echinas and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that the shipment is protected by 40 outdoors during lockdown and when it closes it is locked in the Regional Prison Vault. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> This story will create a beautiful hour of television, but the very padded feature will be out of date films. Garner does not allow leaks in any of his impressive characters and does not make enough sense to keep the audience interested in the film. <br /> <br /> After the involvement of the gang, the event eventually crashed and burned. Play a contrivveled and completely irrational card. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
