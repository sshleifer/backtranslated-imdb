<br /> <br /> <br /> Because of this, film studios publish big budgeted films on weekends Avoid doing Every year a studio publishes a major competition female competition (2001 "wedding planner") competes with the big game. The Super Bowl week will try to make the title "The Wide Day" title successful and will not see the audience's game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lover for his sister's wedding in London. His family is giving him a hard time not to marry, and his seven-year-old mate, who ran him without reason, is the best man. In her absence, she was not able to see what she was missing in Kat Parkes Nick. But finally Nick helps the Kate to know that she can open, and someone lets her love. <br /> <br /> This picture lends a lot more to the same wedding movies. It is mixed in 1999 with almost carbon copy of "Picture Perfect" and similar scenes of "The Wideend Planner" and "My Best Friends Wading". Contrary to the film "Beautiful Woman" is the theme and informs its audience, the director has clever references to her and other movies. <br /> <br /> There are all the cooled elements of "Wedding Date", an ordinary wedding film, Stereototypical Overberring Mother (Holland Taylor, "Lawful Blonde"), and actually stole wedding lectures by family and friends in marriage and rehearsal dinner. The wrapping was done before the end, but it was something that was not completely expected. The real reason why the cart was dumped suddenly and suddenly changed the direction of the film for the last half. <br /> <br /> Although "date of marriage" is predictable, it can stand on its own. Deba Messing, her first major role, proves she can be charming and funny. Demo Mallorini has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his conversations were very scary and unrealistic. He can do the best he can give and protect the character. <br /> <br /> Using a lot of clever intelligence (often sex), the film is really fun. Originally a chick-flick though the film material can enjoy everyone. Good story, and humor make it the best movie movie to release a long time.
