Bad news It's still really awesome. I think it's a bit of fun because sometimes this kitchy slapstick parody has something to offer. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be better than Mulva, "Zombie ass kicker", and progress should be rewarded. Or when I saw it and felt generous I might have consumed plenty of alcohol. However, "2" It is probably the best thing to do in this movie that it is quite fast, it battles most of the elements and scenes from the main themes of Bill Bill II and II, hack them down, drop them down, <br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy it, you will smoke a lot and you get this DVD back from the video store! You'll really hate yourself if you pay fees.
