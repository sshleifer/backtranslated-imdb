I agree with most of the other guys. Photo price and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is written on paper. My highlighted only from Pov as Olli Dittrich Pinocchio. ("Eagle, ech Mace AA Waldestaben") It reminds old bars with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe performances of actors because most of them do not seem to be good during production and only "do their things". The camera is okay, the plot is ridiculous, I think you'll be ashamed to discuss it with a lot of beer. <br /> <br /> In addition to this I have always been awake, such a script may even be considered for production and will be waiting for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old boy was satisfied, but then at this age he was satisfied so much :-) <br /> <br /> 1 point too many points here. .
