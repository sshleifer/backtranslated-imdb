Hair, hair, hair !!! The 90-minute cringe-fest is 89 minutes long. A setting ripe with atmosphere and chances (a abandoned convent), the cluttered scripts with intelligent conversations are very straining from the hip, which is squandered by a stinker. Most of it is disgusting, and Gonso's horrors have flashed (a sample of this movie's dialogue: after performing his artillery, quickly shot Dolby's Barbeau's impressive character, he said: "no question?" Hick Haque hook). Judging from bad acting, stupid, homophobic joke and the effects of animals, it seems like the director's 'Eve Eve Dead' way many times. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of time for my friends to rent this turkey and leave them for 90 minutes and they will not return. What a turd
