A clear B-grade attempt to cash in on the hostel / show, my expectations of this movie were less (really low!) And it was still frustrating at every stage. The performance is so bad that it is not even funny, the plot line is non-existent and only frightened that I saw 1 hour 21 minutes! I was surprised that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that these 33 cast and crew 34th is probably the director of the director's mother? Although I'm sure that even more than 22 years will be difficult! The DVD includes an extra hour long "created" features. Which raises the question, "Why?" (It probably works to show what to do!). To avoid all costs.
