I am sometimes seen in this silest movies, I am unhappy! I should have expected it after seeing the first two, but with the idea of ​​"this time they just got right at this time" I scream in such movies. Nope - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about the special effect ... In order to know what can be passed for the SFX in this movie, one soldier is shooting at "Rapster" while running Halvey at one moment. Even with less than one second of the screen time, the viewer can easily see that this is just a man with whom the tail moves around it. Bad bad is bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If you can call it. One character, I think, is supposed to be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard of this talk. Probably he has some weird disability - usually the inability to speak. I found it fascinating that the character is not something that he wants to pronounce - so there is no reason to try the actor to do the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How? It's quite basic - to escape the Raptors, people with guns must make them victims. I am surprised to wonder why the dinosaurs always run on the nearest system of the tunnel ... they can not be out hunting. Oh well, at least they have a good idea to show the little scene of the movie, which supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Anything else - let's say you're in a building and you know that people are eating raptors running around it. Do you have any argument about the army or the marines? Will you decide to spend time? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? They have tracked the raptors about the idea of ​​stupid ideas - divided into two groups. Have they ever seen any horror movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, it's one of the dumber movies out there. Miss it until you embarrass your way through a movie.
