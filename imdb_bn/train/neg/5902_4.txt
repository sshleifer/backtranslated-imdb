I went to expect the movie to be completely foolhardy. With so much expectation, any form of entertainment will be a fantastic surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but the nonsense in the single ward was fun to have fun. <br /> <br /> There were so many things about single wards that were completely annoying. The whole picture was dubbed and it was very annoying to hear their voices. This lack of professionalism was exclusively crossed by the Mormon celebrities, who are not operating any business. <br /> <br /> This film will work well in the modems, especially in college communities where single wards exist. But in conclusion, for poor people who do not offer any hope for their unmarried. (Only beautiful girls of single weddings marry, not fat, ugly, but all ugly men work) Finally we realize that the whole film was advertised on LDSSingles.com.
