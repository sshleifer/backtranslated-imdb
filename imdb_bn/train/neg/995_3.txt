Rosario Dawson acted as a girl who was raped and then there was a decent start in the dark until she was given a chance to take revenge. Why Dawson took this role, it was an opportunity to showcase his acting chops and to create a lightly independent, neutral non-Hollywood movie, making it clear that Doson does not play the role as well as the superb looks. Forgive me I just can not find him. There is no mistake, how I felt, I had no idea where I was. Yes, I know he is on the screen but he did not have any impression on me even after spending more than two hours. For the sake of the end, I blame the script, the whole heel of what happened on the screen can not create any real connotation. People seem to be more posing than real and do not seem to fit together happening. Forgiven me for being obscure, but there is nothing other than the end of this movie (which I want to talk about, but it can not harm it), and Rogerio Dosne's picture is more than an image. What can I say, it can click with you, it can not be, I can not go back for now. Rogerio Dawson should be careful only for fans, although it has some real reasons for NC 17. (And Rosario - please, you choose a good actress, good scripts)
