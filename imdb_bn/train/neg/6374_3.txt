This movie was initially confusing. I usually like Jina Phillips, but I wanted to say that the movie liked the badness of the movie Ring Adown the Rojie, which was not a good movie for her. Zippy Cripper was the best way. However, Fay Dunaway was good. He creeped me out completely and at the end, that was crazy. It was about Jennifer Casey (Phillips) who came to the funeral of her two sisters. She is the owner of her sister and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives in a house that lives with an aunt called Emma. Mary Allen (Dunaway) dedicated her relationship to being alive and as long as she wants to live, she will not die. Even if Jennifer tried to kill her, which she tried. Ravens have a strange part in it. When the relationship goes to sleep, Raven eat organisms there, so they can not sleep. But they do not. Basically it's all crazy and Mary Allen will never die and her relationship will be buried, but she is not dead, she / she should be alive forever so that Mary Allen is alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, sorry. Love
