I have seen some episodes of this show and have found some of its components so that it can be interesting, which can be treated. But this is completely upstaged and lost by neverending immoral relationships of the characters of the show. It seems that everyone is asleep with everyone, even in office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. It does not seem to relate to a firm, lasting marriage or the whole show - everyone is broken and trembling - just a true reflection for all Americans. In fact, there is a lack of respect for marriage or stubbornness and it is truly full. <br /> <br /> Then our endless little moral 'Binomas' is presented and they are generally resolved that anyone who does not agree with the management and workers under all the knowledge of private practice. For example, in one of the last episodes, we present a very rare condition of the child born with an impossible gender and the addison completely refuses to undergo surgery because we allow the child to decide his gender later on. Anyone disagrees with this is portrayed as unclean and foolish. <br /> <br /> And I think that any person who opposes the abortion will be shocked by the behavior of the show-lipers. Addison has commented that no person's opinion is permitted in this regard, and only a black character has been honored on moral grounds to oppose abortion. The general feeling was that if you oppose abortion, you are a scary - very popular feeling in the US The main characters of the ceremony unknowingly mention that when they were young they had a miscarriage and they did not have any pardon or regret, the study found that women could endure severe depression. Another young girl for abortion comes to the clinic and then thanked the staff there and talked about how someone helped this young man and it was something to be happy about. The script has written a planned parenthood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
