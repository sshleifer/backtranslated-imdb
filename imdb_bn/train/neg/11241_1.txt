If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is a video game of injection with live actors. Visials look nice during the whole movie and are interesting. Now, saying that the scenes are just good things in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew I was always seeing one of the bad movies. I hope this movie will be even better, but it did not interest interest. Thirty minutes later, growing and growing wanted to walk. Now, I have more than 2000 movies and probably the number has been seen five times. Yet, this is my second life that I felt like walking around my whole life. <br /> <br /> acting - nobody got there. Three main actors are sad. The title role of Jod Act (the way I wanted to walk in other movies) is just awful. I would like to see the law again and sit in Ben Affile in Gigli. <br /> <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries so much hardship to stay in the camp that he faces her. In the last article I read that Paltrow was thinking of being a mother instead of staying at home and acting. After this performance, I would appreciate that decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soap opera is well written. The story behind Sky Captain gets worse and gets worse. <br /> <br /> directions --- no one. The story that everything was kept in special effects, plays and plays widely suffer. Even "The Phantom Menace" played well and it is not a great deal. <br /> <br /> I have to give this image "0" to "0". Wait for the theater to pay the price and release the video.
