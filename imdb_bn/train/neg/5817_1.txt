The most difficult thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. Characters were stereotyptical "white trash", the film's "plot" had ceased from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so funny from the duals of the body. Sadly, the movie was the only interesting thing. In the future, if Mrs. Jenkins would serve better, she would prevent her living from being "entertained". It was that bad. A positive view of this movie (nothing to do with the lack of this film) My brother has snatched away for this sticker.
