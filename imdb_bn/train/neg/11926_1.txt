I've rarely moved to such a comment but after sitting under the horror of most of Rankin, I think that I have earned the right to say about it! I did not really make it to the end, and after half an orchestrated plot, half-a-dozen or more walks (one-third of the audience) became one, the sad dialogue and the humiliating character became too much to bear. These pictures are all pos and no art. All styles and no substances It is weighed by terribly played, a truly scary script, indifferent cinematography and student-level production standards. How to fund it, start, and finish is a mystery to me I'm telling you one million beta it does not go on the general release. Proper critics will separate it. A really bad film. Suddenly bad. Without mentioning the moment of a really really really effortless effort and that even bare-born new-born-cat-to-be-a-deep-fat-fryer moment. Completely meaningless, completely lightweight; keep them together weakly; This movie is a terrific embarrassment for UK movies.
