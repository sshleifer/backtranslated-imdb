It was not only the most expensive Canadian movie ever in BC, but it was simply the worst, never seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but the British, and the boy shows it. We are all made to be inexperienced dope fiends and a bunch of morons. What does it mean to be a Canadian, it is absent, and for this reason we take fund in this trap. Of course British character is normal. The rest of the Citok stereotype crop - are you "soft !!" Can you say that? Cinematography ranges from obscure indoor silhouettes to gorgeous postcard images. The actors always seem to be fidgetting. As they bored as the audience, or the director of this movie director? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce McDonald's films. Some true Canadian boys with the original say cinematically. After 10 minutes, do not be forced to act in his film.
