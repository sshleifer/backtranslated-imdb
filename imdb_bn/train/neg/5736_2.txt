One of the worst movies I've seen in these years! You can knock off 5 people on the road randomly and they can do better than any of these films. Full waste of time watching. I like poor films, but I only gave it 2 but this is just a common loll. Acting (and I'm using the word too) is frustrating, someone tell me that these 5 main actors are making their first film? Do not waste your time while watching this. The hostel was a good film in some ways. I can not believe that someone has spent the money to make it, I hope it will cost only $ 50,000 for producers - it looks like a school project, a child project that has not got any sources. Make this even movie ??
