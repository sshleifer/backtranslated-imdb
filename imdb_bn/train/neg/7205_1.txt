If you unintentionally enjoy watching the film as a 2-hour blast with an explosion, you would love this movie. Otherwise, you will be surprised how they can create a movie that translates to a big screen like Inspector Gadgets. In the preview of the film, many scenes were shown which were not in the film, and in the film, some scenes do not just make sense. Although the film is less than 1 hour and less than one and a half years, I can only think of a memorable moment and it is only in advance or during credit time! <br /> <br /> <br />
