The plot was quite interesting with the Russian Revolution background. I enjoyed watching Budapest as part of this movie was portrayed. Sad, there were zero chemistry between the two main characters, so the love story of them was difficult to believe. The love scene was compulsory and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really tough, almost snowy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and old, so he looked like his big sister than his girlfriend. The end, when we finally illustrated those who were after them, were quite weak and had no knowledge. I think I've enjoyed this movie even better if the relationship between the two actors was a little more credible.
