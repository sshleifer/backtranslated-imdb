When I refer to Malice as a film noor, I am not comparing it with the superiority of Sunset Ballard, Double Reimbursement or Multish Falcon, or I compare Baker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Crumer or Luis Bunuel. I'm just protesting against the dark start of this film from the beginning, the amount you can not just create what's happening. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but the film was in darkness even in darkness, because I do not understand. However, although the director unemployed painted it in full darkness, it did not make much difference.
