I want to say bad acting, but I think it was an instruction that made it. I did not think of Highlander (the same director) but he could be blamed in the 80's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When people poke in front of him, people shot! These types of mistakes make it a sub-par movie with incorrect type of deadline, curious warfare, sub-param cutting, and poor visual effects. <br /> <br /> There are many similar comments, all this American bullshit. The German General is really afraid of his Captain American Private <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
