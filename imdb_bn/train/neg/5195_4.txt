I've heard (and read) a lot of good things about weed that I was waiting to jump on another great cable series (such as Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it was gradually wiped out from every episode I saw with Session One. (It was not made before the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The text was an illogical, transformed and black letter embarrassing figure. The conversation felt compulsory, the author is trying to be tricky and hip very well. It was a rare moment when I really had an audible smile. <br /> <br /> The letters were not developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unexpected. As soon as I hated it, it was so unreasonable to remove Hudson's daughter Quinn from casting her brother and sister (who should have taken away a producer) and sending him to the boarding school in Mexico, the authors were examining the audience's loyalty. I read less about the episode after the episode <br /> <br /> and I could not find most technical errors in the story line. <br /> <I have heard that the season was not good enough so I lost all motivation to continue watching this game. <br /> <br /> If you're fond of casting well and writing, I suspect this show would be a challenge to you, of course you did not rob the stone and then all bets are closed.
