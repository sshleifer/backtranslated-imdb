A film about Harlem Renaissance and a writer in particular. It contrasts with a modern story about a young, gay and black artist. <br /> <br /> If it seems to be unclear then the movie itself is in it. It is well-directed, fairly well written and (in most cases) played well. Also in the past scene Moody is shot black and white. It is also one of the few movies dealing with gay men, which does not move away from sex scenes (it is clear and incompatible). Yet I hated most of it. <br /> <br /> This image is processed throughout the place, with unlikely characters (with major drama) full and it moves to a shoot speed. Three times I was thinking of leaving the theater because I was so annoyed. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His conversation shows that it was a labor of love and it took 6 years to complete. I really want that I can do more to choose (there are several films that have a fair deal with Gay Blacks) but I can not. There is no reason to see if you are not very interested in Harlem Renaissance.
