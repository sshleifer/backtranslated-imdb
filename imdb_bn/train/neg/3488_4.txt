You <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Angelopoulos is a master of the art of cinema after all, right? Wrong At the moment, when his methods are becoming very artificial, like Photoshop's filtered image. His usual tricks are seen: Blurred windows, lighting of light, a strange marriage, walking on the banks of the river, and yellow water-coats.
