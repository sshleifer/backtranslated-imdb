This could be a strong candidate for "worst flickr". Perhaps in the presence of John Hart, it can be tolerated as a child-film. However, TRAGEDY of all these efforts, the screen's greatest actor John Hart, reduced itself to this topic .... I gave it two points because Mr Hart showed the UP ... I took 8 points, because he did not run faster than it did . As far as the cast is left, they are simply, terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she could, could not work to save her spirit. And the main actor, all purpose and purpose, AWFUL. If you can feel yourself embarrassed, please, please. It's very bad, it's almost HURTS
