Sheesh! What a horror movie Dodgy works in the camera, a script more corn than Kellogg, and so played hammy you can open a pig farm with it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> - Anyone smoking cigarettes at any time while going to his soap box about smoking hazard, oh dear, and in another strange scene, our body, Lobo, with his force, ahem, if you want, striptease dressed in a bikini to make 'male friend'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A special edition DVD, though any time soon.
