This movie is probably the cheapest, cheesiest, and poor seagull. <br /> <br /> This is the most fun and most stupid film by Disney, and will give laughing at the sad stories and lunatic plots from the beginning <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then, the decision to patch things with a letter of forgiveness to give three new new letters to Bell. Through this little episode, Bell's wall has eyes, which made my brothers and I smile so hard. Then, he wars more on the letter and ... and then learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is coming from some woman who could woo. And they make Fifi a psychological villain, who tries to kill Bell and eventually releases the air. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> And afterwards the beet became overbearing on the bird, where it seems to be simply neutral. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly, it kills. You can see at least 100 mistakes ... and color is terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the next characters are annoying ... (I mean, Kogsworth and Lumia fight almost all the time. I know they did it in the movie, but it was overdone.) <br /> <br / > But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is destroying this. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I can give it 1/10 for snake, but I give it 10/10 for comedy.
