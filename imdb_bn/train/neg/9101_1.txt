This movie "Dark After The Disney Channel" Take the language and themes out of "we're not naughty" and you are with conversations and plot devices that insult the smart insult that does not describe the quality of the "Bell saved" quality television. The conversation is so ridiculously and genetically messy, someone may think that the screenplay was made and the Harga Aschers locked the room so that every written script contained a written script for creating. If Roger Kumble had his intention, the mission was completed.
