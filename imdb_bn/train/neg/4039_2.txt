Shield has two types of characters: those who try to create good and do the right things, and who follow their own selflessly interests, and each and every one of them, who follow their own interests and they can do heroes, and everyone's only hope . More than any other program, the shield is about hypocrisy and self-confusion. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and heroes of self-deception show, and as the heroes of ordinary customs and imagination are unlikely to be defeated or caught, and they come up again and make their colleagues stupid <br /> <br /> This event is an excellent camera- Appreciate it The lead intervals and fade out are always fantastic. It really is an art work to see. Unfortunately, the story is a cartoon, unwanted violence, rape, and oppressed supplementary view of falsehood. <br /> <br /> The failure of failed warrior failure failed due to the failure of the protagonist, who cast the hero with him, the character of the Wiley Cartoon, like the warning bro, always elmer fudds (who does not support him for his lies and crime) She draws supporting figures of any good looking woman to listen to her, always pursuing any effort to bring her to justice, and always Incentive child with self-righteousness, your ears scraping. If the other police detect something wrong to do something for him and hurt someone because of his actions, he always blames the suspect police, his plans and the broad lies and destructive plans are always the reason. Every time <br /> <br /> Like 24, this show depends on contrivances and numerous delays to drag her story for the season after season. Annoying, unbelievable long-term stories are inserted into the story in every season, which may stem the bloody, distorted parts of the bone, which are corrupted by characters and inevitable cover-ups. <br /> <br /> While being the most disappointing, writers, they try to change the sympathy of the audience, form shiny letters away and far away. Sometimes, they want to see Shane as an enemy. Sometimes they want to see that we understand him as a poor mistaken soul. Sometimes they want to see Vic as our dangerous, sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor man with a gold heart. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as inferior jealousy. Then they think that if they are sitting on her and talking about her dream with Shane, then we'll feel sympathetic and sad to her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once these characters have destroyed the lives of other people for their own end, it is being done. It is the pick of trying to flip behind it. But even then, producing seven seasons of these disguised garments is unclear and draws every super model in each of their beds and under the right-hand nose, a crime syndicate is run directly from the police station.
