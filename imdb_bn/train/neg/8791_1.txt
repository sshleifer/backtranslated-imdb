Stickman! <br /> <br /> This is a bad word that will not be with other companies because it is below them! All right, tell me to tell me something that came out of the way. <br /> <br /> I have seen many times during the Ashes, thinking that it is a new material that is a respected author, due to the rising fame of Wong Kar Yi, the highly respected Voxia Tommy. Well, many WKW fans did not succeed in enjoying the novel on screen; In most cases it is to tear the water, sweat beads, horse-to-walk shots, etc. I could not sit through most of the movies. <br /> <br /> After many years when I want to give Mister Wong's movie hearing much praise after another shot, especially from the ear. I was confused by her latest, 2046. A friend asked me to start the w / Chungking Express because it is the most accessible movie in it. So wrong! I just p.o. That which I had wasted in my time and money, is on this hypocritical drug. Some professional critics mention it as a meditation on isolation and loneliness in a modern big city, Blah, Blah, Blah. If this is true with all of these things to happen and the director has something to say, then it is OK. But no, he just looks what does. Wang's play is very common in the Hong Kong style: the proud expression, try to play deer, fancy and girls among the wide-eyed expression of headlights; <br /> <br /> I think the word "Atyur" is to me, a director who tries to do something new and different, is appreciated, but not for one who does not appreciate it. Still has earned the ability to tell the story of the movie, in the last 17 years Mr. Wang!
