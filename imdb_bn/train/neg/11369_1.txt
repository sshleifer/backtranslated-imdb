It's ridiculous, I hope many people will be open to Muslims who live in the US, the UK and all over the world. There is a billion followers of religion. I am born and raised in America and through my religious classes and education, I have been taught to take care of my country and contribute to society. I emphasized on following my religion and devoted to education and to come back to life to prepare myself for success through education. I know many Muslims from all over the world and I have traveled in countries like Pakistan. I still do not want to meet a person who believes that we do not want to harm anyone or accept any religion other than the people of the media. Why ... It is also unfortunate that these extremists use the media to represent the whole religion. It is one billion people's religion, and these are less than one percent, I am sure that other people of other religions do not want to represent who are KJK, IRA and many other common people, who are very few extremists who are old and do not use their so-called religion through their own Literary phrases of respected books for revenge, private or business issues
