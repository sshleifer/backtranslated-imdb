This image should not be created. Verily, I acknowledge that I saw it before I had some serious doubts. Director Holland did not make much movies, and the young woman receiving the key part was a TV-personality, slowly towards the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played another major part recently I saw the Bride Flight and although it is good, he does not trust me. To start with the story, I could not read the novel, but a script that is underlining the movie that might be something that is supposed to be with birthday children on Sunday noon calendar. The director likes to watch a good movie as well as the same age. There was something really annoying overdubbed, it was mostly loudly spoken during the time. My reporter went to cameraman, at least he tried to find something. It is a sad matter that the film was light edited, if not, then some scenes were certainly more credible.
