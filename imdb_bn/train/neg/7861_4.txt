The original foundation of this awaited sequel was really good and I was very sincerely hopeful after the huge success of Remix. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this movie is really stupid and inaccessible. The situation is stupid and out of the factors and acting really awful. <br /> <br /> This time the rickety does not have the opposite character or violation. Also, the horse is not abundant and when it happens it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is less and it is shameful because many arguments that make you think that there is a place for heavy violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I saw it in movies I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> However, how the movies have spread is a clear example and poor quality of all aspects. <br /> A mess that releases fans like Remake like me. That sequels are never welcomed; At least this movie is not terrible, like the original 1985 movie.
