First of all I want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... This episode creates a comedy of the whole show. <br /> <br /> They do not know what I tried to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the successful episode of the whole series. <<br /> <br /> There is no story line, everything is disturbed and jokes ..... crying <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .... For example, "how it feels like making fools" is such a stupid "before ..." ... ...... easily embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's clear that the authors are running out of ideas and that's really very bad.
