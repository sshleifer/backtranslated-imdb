This death is even worse than the original game. A patchy, inconsistent story takes "Billy Lo" down from the helicopter and kills him, because we'll be going to follow his younger brother Bobby. So we do not start following some Bruce Lee clones, the film closes one and follows another thirty minutes in the story. Bobby lowers a lion, when it is a major reason to watch, a man in a lion's garment. Jang Li Huan also villain, who is usually pretty good but significantly less during his screen. Mainly it has seen the death of the original game because they are part of the set of Bruce Lee box. There is nothing surprising that it is not included with Lee's finished work. Nobody would buy them otherwise.
