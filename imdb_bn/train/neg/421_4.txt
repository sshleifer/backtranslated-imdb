My title says it all. Let me clear it. If you've seen the BBC's Planet Earth, which I'm sure most of you do, you will not like this movie too much. And I'm not the owner of all the "Planet Earth" discs, I've seen this movie's rating very much and read good reviews about it. I was excited to test it. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw it was a Disney movie with Business BBC and inventory listed companies. And when they started the first scenes of the smoker beer, I recognized them from the "DVD" on Planet Earth's home. <br /> <br /> The movie continues and continues, all of them were "Planet Earth" to recognize scenes made by me and my friends. <br /> <br /> We were very frustrated, I think 90% of the footage comes from "Planet Earth". I'm 90% because I did not recognize some scenes. <br /> <br /> So finally what is this movie, the compilation of different footage from various planets of "Planet Earth", whose goal is to aim kids. Yes, the description is quite ugly. Let me give you an example. When they show polar kids running away from the clay, the narrator says, "Pole breed is not like children's kids. They do not always listen to their mother" (I do not remember the exact word, but this is how it is) so briefly. "Planet Earth" is narrow for these kids!
