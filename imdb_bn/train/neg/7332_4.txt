Despite the 2001 film, the side is a 90-year art-style style that was considered "old" and old by a few years ago. The sugar cut and impact watch was painful. The script is fair enough, and some scenes make me fooled (like the taxi driver brings him to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective, who was obsessed with the murder and suicide of sisters who killed himself, was just plain terrible. Actor acting actor Salma Blair's married boyfriend disturbs me seriously. I sat with the whole thing, even though it's random, whatever-you just watch this movie and decided to watch.
