This movie is one reason why IMDB allows 0/10 votes. Acting awful, even here some have been praised, Carpathia character! The script seems to have been written quickly. In one case, the black preacher who was going back, when Buck asked what computer graphic "Dan 7" means, "Daniel 7, * chapter * 24." He probably meant verse 24, but filmmakers missed this slip up. Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is disproportionate to the Bible. Although many Christians have clarified the interpretation of the film in the end-time events, but my opinion * in this commentary is defective. To understand these errors, George McKeev and George E. by "The Big Hope, A Bible Study of the Second Advantage and the Affair" Read "Read: Christianity will go through disaster" by Loud.
