Easily known about all Shakespeare plays, it is given here with importance. Shoddy instructions, permanent studio work and uncertain performance litter a fine tragedy. <br /> <br /> Towns of Venezuela have been temporarily interrupted for centuries, but Romeo (Patrick Rickert), when the tragedy occurred, Montague, Juliet (Rebecca Saire), fell in love with a Capulet. Bloodshed will soon emerge ... <br /> <br /> The studio's work, especially the scenery of the day scene, seriously determines the power of the game. This is a story that, with its power, should be shot outside. Combined clothing with this, with many tights and ridiculous codpieces. Stage war looks terrifying, moving closer to being too much stretched and compelling. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is very lightweight to be a really powerful Romeo. While managing the plot, she manages the intensity of the character, but her strong pronunciation and softness often limits its range of inexperienced eyes. It is very difficult for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is a very good young Juliet - she has grabbed the character dinner, but got a little more naive. <br /> <br /> The helpful roles are not much better. Joseph O'Nearner's Farer Lawrence is good but many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Markuti is on stage and not camera. He gurns and excessively gesticulates and the resulting result looks rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. Over the next few years, he developed an edge and intensity to provide some fine screen performance, but it is not proven here. Prince can play a good role with his brief appearances, but actor Lawrence Naismam fails to participate in any part of the camera. Only Michael Horten, the best part of this series, comes from it with no respect. His capulit played well and enjoyed watching See one version of this story instead of <br /> <br />.
