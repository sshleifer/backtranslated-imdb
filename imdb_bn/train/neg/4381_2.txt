Cut behind the back, one of the five bad films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> They do not try. There were some decent text with some elements of the structure, a good cast, some good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it's been a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> Some elements are bad formations and can not be a real story, which is far more effective by leadership (perhaps better than when restrained), some bad directions and editing. I had enough time in about an hour, almost an hour and a half of my hair torn off and ran in the hour and fifty minutes. There was a discrepancy about it, I went with someone to join heroin. He was excited that it had done something glamorized that did not have anything good for him. She was stressed by the 17-year-old girl who fell in love with 30-year-old Junky. There were structural plot points which were an attempt on a structure, but the end result was uninterrupted (uncompleted time line). Characters were colorful but ultimately, which makes me feel bad for quality actors, which you have not seen enough. Avoid it <br /> <br /> I think that it was the first time the director who was enamored by his own turds, but he did it before. I think these and many other really bad ideas will actually pay their money, to get someone to get confused.
