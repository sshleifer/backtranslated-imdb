*** Alert - This review contains "plot spoilers", although this movie can not "hide" more than it already has. It's really that bad. *** <br /> <br /> Before I start, I want everyone to know that this is certainly one of such incredible-one-violent-frustrated movies. If you are in an impressive mood and need a very heartwarming smile, this is the movie for you. Without furthermore, my review: <br /> <br /> This movie is found in a dargah bint at Wal-Mart. It should first be noted how good a movie is. Second, it makes Lum Action-Star Dolf Lundar bigger. It would be the second formula as to how well it is to a movie. I am still surprised that it has been put in DVD (who does such things as their meaning?), Although you can imagine that the DVD does not have extra or bonus footage. Actually, there is not even a menu; The movie is just starting <br /> <br /> First, the writer of this movie is entitled to torture and kill. This is one of the worst scripts ever written and deadly by the terrible one-liners. Extra incredible, fake dialogue; And inappropriate comments (such as Lee's comment about the wrong error of Lundgren, which I will mention later). There is no single sincere sounding line in the whole film. Conversation and plot goes hand in hand, as both progress in script and plots in a completely candid fashion. The two policemen hated for some reason to hate each other, and then there is no reason again, Lee's character reaches the road, goes to the other side of the car and says, 'I will not let you go alone,' despite myself, I like you ! And I do not want to kill you! . Or whatever amount, whatever, whatever. Mostly Li said there are hateful one-liners. For example, when it is said to a bad person, Lee said, 'You have the right to be silent. You have the right to death! Finally, I would like to mention Leita completely undesirable and unreasonable comments about the lowlands of the London area. Bad people started attacking after an unexpected random love scene in London and Carrie, and Lundgren decided to fight them with their underwear, Lee told him, 'We'll die, I just wanted to let you know that I'm the biggest dick I'm ever a man Have seen . Yes, he actually said that. It does not make any sense and is not even possible (how does he know LuanGang nude, so how does he know?), But how the author threw it in the script. The whole movie looks like a video game and Lee even accepts it. Lundgren, just for Lee and underwear, defeats those bad guys, Lee made the comment that is really beautiful: 'Wow, it's like a video game! We just defeated the first wave! Second, the plot of this film is hateful. It is in my opinion, mainly that it actually does not exist from being suffering from it. The film's trailer - which is available for viewing IMDB - makes it sound like a movie, Japan is trying to stop Yakuza from defeating Lost Angela, almost two police. This is very confusing, however, the film does not really have anything to do with it. They give a very brief, vague reference to Yakuza, attempting to start Methamphetamine business with local drug drugs, but the whole film is turning to a poorly written attempt for the Kenner (character of Lundgren) to take revenge of his parents' death. Yakuza leader (named Jesse) died at the age of 9. The whole plot can basically be summarized thus: Yoshida wants Kenner to die, Kenner wants Yoshida dead, and two two tried to kill each other. And of course all of Kenner's cartoon sidekick (played by Johnny and Brandon Lee) works like an unconscious ass, and Tia Carrere gets naked. Twice <br /> <br /> One of the worst parts of the whole movie is the acting. The conversation is so unreal, and its completely disrespectful illustration makes it even more stressed. You would expect poor performance from action stars anyway, but this movie shows some of the most inaccurately bad performances ever recorded. Finally we can reach the heart of the neutrality of film: Badly flagged acts. There is a sequence of so wonderful, unrealistic steps in this movie, it is only cruel, dominant. They have managed to fit them all. Although Lee has a good partner with his bad scenes, most of the most serious acts involved with Lundgren For example, Lundgren took four or five Kung Fu bad people to the full without spreading their tea. Then, when surprised by an upcoming cargo, Lundgren casually leaps on it. Or how did he reach the closed door, while holding the villain on the other side, dragged him back by the door and beat him? Or when he picked up the Tea Carr, then chasing the glass through a glass door (not pursuing), and raising the height of one-height with tear, only when the whole car is not able to save the bullet and save them from the bullet Using it as a barricade? Landgren and Lee kill every bad guy immediately with him, when the bullet rains can never hit them from their fifty attackers. That, of course, until the final battle scene of the movie. Lundgren has got empty spaces in his chest chest in a region, even if he is able to miss his heart, he will immediately begin to fill the lungs with blood and kill him in a few seconds. Despite this, Lundgren is in the top position and has managed to duck in the middle of a parade with the evil super villain Yishida. And of course, the passing paradigmen of the paradigm are carrying a real, full sharp katana, which is used for fighting two battles. Now in addition to his bullet wounds, Lundgren receives several deep slices of chest and arms. Does this stop him? Not sure! In fact, after a few seconds, after easily killing the wicked Yoshida (who pinches on the wheel like a dartboard and for some reason it explodes in the fire), Lundgen goes away with the impossible Tia and Leah so that she is not injured at all. . God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Drip-free hot tub and love scene with strip clubs, Japanese spawn nude women, and tia. There is no mention of travel in odd times, where the rich Japanese men eat delicious food of nude women. However, he urged Lee Leigha to give a lot of nets to say that after defeating the bad guy, he and Lundgren will eat those nude girls' fish! Which, of course, is followed by a boring high five. And we're pushing a man stuck in a car at terrible add, as the editors have seen a truly clear picture of a cheerful dummy, such as the terrible edit can not be forgotten. Credits also lists a huge list of stunt workers, which means that most movies are not usually completed by the movie star. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film repeatedly exits itself through this evil evil. It is unreasonable and impossible, and consequently, significant entertainment. If you are looking for a kind of thoughtful movie, this movie wants to kill you. If you are looking for a good time to look good and have fun making bad movies, this movie will make you happy. As an actual movie, I will make 0.5 of the 10 meritorious of this movie. As an entertaining way to destroy an hour and eighteen minutes, this beauty takes a cake.
