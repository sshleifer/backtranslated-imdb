The most embarrassing moments in this movie are when Brady Carberry says, 'You've swallowed', at the end of the film. I practically die I'm still not really sure why screenlists keep that line there. Was it supposed to make romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was bad. <br /> <br /> I did not like the original Thunderbird, but Thunderbird's movie had so much potential. This is not the movie. If Thunderbird's brand has a draw draw card it can be directly done on live TV or after the depoting. Even before even <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about filming is when the credits roll out and they play the song "Thunderbirds with Guy" by Bostad. I can not believe that I saw it with a pay-per-view of $ 7.
