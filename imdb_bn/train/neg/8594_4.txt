At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) told Neil (Sylayer Murphy) why she always wanted to find an adventure. He said, "I have bore-phobic reasons". This means that he can not actually get his mandatory work done with his life. Well, I think its the reason and the way this movie is playing is very ridiculous. Because "intelligence surveillance" is an enthusiastic apathy. <br /> <br /> Which of these characters is doing something really exciting once? Neil is a gaik who owns a small video rental shop. He and his other Gaiac friends usually hang out outside the shop and later debate with them and watch movies. But when Viliot entered his shop, the life of Neel was completely turned out. She is a wonderful woman who concealed a small secret from her. However, after some dates, they decided to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who is nicely joking and can not really do anything, although Neal is completely reversed. The question is. Are they finally going to be love? You bet <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" romantic-comedy of its court And they pretend to do something else it's even worse. From the first couple of sets, we know that Neil is a very beautiful person who has not really made any commitment. And then, Violet enters the scene, looking at all the weird and annoying. So at this time, we all know that they are going to sit in all the nonsense situations to know how they are ending. Is it worth waiting for? I will not tell. <br /> <br /> I said, tried to give something to the audience. "Intelligence Surveillance" is trying to talk about commitment. How far is the goal of reaching out to people who want to expect. We knew that Violet did all of the insane things that he had tested to see how far he was ready to win his heart (or anyway). Well, I think it's completely bullshit. This movie will end very quickly if Neil only said to herself, "Forget it, that girl is a nut!" After recently named after many great directors (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 days later", after Kenyan Loch's "The Wind that Hek Shakes" and Neil Jordan's "Breakfast Pluto"), it was a wonderful choice for Kylian. A film with a broken lizzy comedy army, Paul Sutter. In all ways, he is not bad (as usual), but a talent like his should not waste his time in the movie like this in the movie. On the other hand, terrible horror like Lucy Liu Violet. Her acting is a mess. I mean it tops all the places and so above. Tony Montana was proud <br /> <br /> The last movie to be created is but not the least irrelevant title. You can not really connect a point between the plot and its title; And then you will end up worrying that it eventually makes no sense. In short, "Show Detectives" is very enjoyable, if the forgotten motion picture has the opportunity to capture it on the cable so that you can not imagine it. <br /> <br /> Bloody Monday rating: 1.5 / 4
