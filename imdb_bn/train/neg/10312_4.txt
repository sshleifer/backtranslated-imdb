Like the 10-year old print, I love the 70 seconds "Bridget Lonely Barney" philosophy of "love win". I understood the romantic complexion between both the Jewish cab driver (David Barney) and the Irish Catholic school teacher (Meridith Bitter) and the parents' parents (as the parents of Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald Barney; Adra Lindley and David Daleel Breedgate's parents Like) that there is a problem with the marriage of intermarriage marriages of a young couple. <br /> <br /> Now seeing the experience of experience in personal life, I was surprised that this show was also successful for one, though, the highly rated season. Veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who created a few years after the show was canceled, "Same Time, Next Year", "Brigget Loves Barney" was a very light, devout comedy that broke according to the weight of his own air. <br /> <br /> The real life chemistry between the heroes and the backers could not be denied. However, in the next few years, both actors have shown that they are one of the best actors in other projects ("St. Eljooke" and "Family" and "Family Relations" backstarter role in Backster). Here, they were trying to breathe life into a program that needed a much more playful edge, which could make the subject very controversial deeper due to the complexity. <br /> <br /> The program was broadcast on Saturday night between two CBS Powerhouses. : "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both programs were smart, fun and fairly close (then more than ever), which made me interested in the situation and characters. "Brunettes love Barney" was not very smart and only occasionally had chocolate. <br /> <br /> This is another example of a show that I did not feel good at.
