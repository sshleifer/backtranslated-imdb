When this image came out in the early 1970's and hatred, hatred, hated it! Easiest I ever seen in my life the most booooring movies. Leigh does not know where his inspiration was found, but it is one of the movies where you want to open their mouth and reduce the letters to communicate. The title has all said in this movie because there is no saving time in this movie, only long, long-term people, they (probably) unable to express feelings. If you want to see something that drives you to drink, it is for you. If you do not have any good work for two hours, stick a fork to a toast: the experience will be infinitely joyful from anything you get! Yes, Leigh has really brought a lot of useful stuff for her career, but she missed it.
