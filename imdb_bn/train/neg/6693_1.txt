Run away from this movie. Even the film is horrific by B-movie standards. It's theme is also dirty. The main theme is that those who reject society and do not respect anybody, are appreciable and valuable. Those who treat others with respect are damaged. Guncrazy is a movie that talks out loud to say a lot better than this movie, rather than see it. <br /> <br /> No normal child will work on Trent. State fighters do not work as they do in this movie. Seeing this movie you can understand why the author uses hook-to-heart-gold coolies. Miza is a totally disreputable hooker, who has a terrible life, yes. However, he is such a terrible person, the visitors can not identify with him. <br /> <br /> A thing for a movie can be recommended, in this case there is no one. This is a ridiculous movie, it insults a person who tries to identify with the main characters. The performance is enough by the B-movie quality and the aspect does not present anything new or interesting.
