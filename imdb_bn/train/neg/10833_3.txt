I wanted to like Magnolia. The Plot Grand Canyon (which I like) reminds me. Four different lives / stories that came together at the end, but Magnolia took half the wrong way through the movie and I lost. I almost stopped it there, but I thought I could hang it till finally, I do not know it would be more than 1 hour to be cut. Thanks, I rented instead of viewing the theater. I cried out of despair after about 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the last frog scene. My DVD player still has forgiven me and I do not blame it a bit. It was a unique movie, but there was a bad, annoying, and pointless movie.
