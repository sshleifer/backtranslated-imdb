Anyone who thinks this picture is not appreciated for his classic talent has been smoking with two stoners in the film. This image is not a rating-down ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should not be any comparison between this picture and The Naked song or airplane, the next two films are good writing and fun. Class reconciliation is not those things. The sad thing was that it was such a potential (well cast, good story lines) but good joke less and far away. The scene that was supposed to be funny is more annoying than fun. Stoner, vampire, blind girl ... not fun The only funny character was Delores (who sold his soul to Satan). <br /> <br /> National Lampon has made some really good films (Enamul House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I certainly more than expected from John Hughes.
