A person's polluted, anticipated, and unwanted story polluted by a chemical material (Weller) that goes to the whole country to find only his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he simply killed everyone in his way by touching his hand single. A doctor (heart) and a young journalist (Natasha) tried to stop him from hazardous tracks. The film is not based on the original, but it can be even better. The final result is a movie without just the mystery or gritting a moment. Even the best throw is the complete waste. I give this a 4 (four) one.
