Firstly, let's appreciate the praise of joining this drip of Robert Englands Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark. I had to give it 1 1 it does not give me a blank Want to know how bad this movie is? My mother called me in the town and told me, "Boy, I just saw a silly movie." I said, "Kill the tongue of the killer? "How did he react, how was that? This first appeared like a good movie in Freddy Pinheed Melinda, okay, I will give it a chance, I sat in the rest of this movie because I wrote a column for horror movies reviews. Do not waste your time or even the brain cells into pieces by breaking this disgust. Go away, if you look at this Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and go away .... and I still want to dang it in my two hours behind
