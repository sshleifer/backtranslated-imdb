Yes, I got Paisolini and her mileage, but at the same time, I think her "discamaran" has decreased in most cases and is somewhat annoying. Because he is presented with the supposedly "realism" (public gathering, rising architecture, etc.) presented in a weird and impartial fool manner that behaves character. Behind realism, Pasolini used many non-actors, but their deer-in-the-handlines streaked and painful painful line delivery gave a complete horror off-the-counter and an incompatible feeling. And undoubtedly - many of the toothless, harmful featured people are painful to see. <br /> <br /> and Pasolini's "discamaran" is boring (at least to me) due to casual and common gay sex. Because I'm incited or homophobic (not even me), but because Posolini emphasizes the homorotic picture and position in situations, it emphasizes the neo-reality, otherwise it keeps it secret, so it is ineffective and forced to stop. Someone could say to him, "Oh - in this scene I have to keep a beautiful, naked boy!" Occasionally it seems that Paasolini is trying to play the gay angle to stop his nose from critics, and at other times, he enjoys the benefit of himself regardless of who his audience likes. <br /> <br /> 9 or 10 in Pasolini's "Decameron" hit me as being an aspect of neo-realism in different stories, but Pasolini as a storyteller failed. She seems to get bored with each story and so she rather wraps them unconvincingly and with little firmness. Even the final line of dialogue in Posolini's film, which seems to be some people ("Why is it so sweet to create the work of art when looking at its dream?") - To me, it just makes me wonder why the West will feel if he feels this way Bored to make a film? In my opinion, many really well-planned films (and more homosexual sex content) are "real" of Falleny. It is also full of curiosity and illogical circumstances, but it is successful due to its pacing, direction and strong story, but "decamaran" fails with the same content.
