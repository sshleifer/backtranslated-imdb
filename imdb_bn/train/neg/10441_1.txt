<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then I realized I could see three stugs free and smile more! <br /> <br /> I am overwhelmingly destined for the honor of Samuel Jackson. And Hollywood again shows how they moved from the reality. When I was young, we used to take snakes for fun. Hoodle only under the bay of the cobbling with a serpent. And any amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can not change it. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worthy of a trip to Blockbuster. Be careful: if you pay for it, only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you really want to be scared then I recommend the dynasty. If you want laugh, go to your local stand-up comedy club. Their worst actors will be ten million times better than this trash.
