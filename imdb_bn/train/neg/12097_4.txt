I did not really expect much when I went to see this. Although after Mst3king the JasonX hack with some friends, I'm expecting similar experiences here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie has taken itself very seriously. Do not I care about Jason's problem? I'm sorry. However there is a legion of that FT13th movie that cover. At the end of that day, he is an immune serial killer, I'm just not going to get that sympathy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the bad episode was consumed ... not funny only. <br /> <br />
