Finally, very silly and pointless. Yes the guild has the metaphor of the cage but most of the kids will probably miss that. Forgotten. Instant <br /> <br /> <br /> Animation is, we hope, ultra-realistic. The plot line can be described as the slim but firmest. Although the last seems like a bad thing to me. <br /> <br /> The Suevara underworld is a desperate reflection of the above world, and since there is plenty of resources and money there too. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest in the woman, which makes women more efficient, more intelligent and a pair - it is quickly becoming a tedious (anti) stereotype. Perhaps your kids will love it though.
