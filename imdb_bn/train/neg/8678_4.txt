After watching "The Deadguard" last night, I was compelled to write a review of it. <br /> <br /> This could be a beautiful movie if it was not terrible for cameras. It was beyond annoying. All of the corners were wrong, especially during the war sequence, something was impossible to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is contacted by Judy Lee, who is not quite straightforward with Chiba. The chest involved in the league's drug ring is deeper than thought, because another gang of mob and lip after it <br /> <br /> The story was beautiful, and despite the terrible dubbing, it could have been a good movie. Good instruction and editing, I'm sure that it has been a classic Kung Fu movie. This is like the action movie of another Chasey 70. Note: The opening sequence is a quote known to fans of "Paul Fiction" and then there is no way in the Times Square a carat school that is running with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
