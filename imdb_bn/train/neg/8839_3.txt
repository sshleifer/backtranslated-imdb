Excellent efforts and good ideas (through the release of prostitution, people are helping each other ...) but a bad result ... the director tried to imitate his French colleague, Anne Hung, who was portrayed as a painter restored by Vietnam. The only problem is that this Vietnam has long gone and when there was a historical background of "Green Pepper Perfume" ... Ner ambiance (muffled sound and gradually slow life) tries to. ..) leave a feeling of mesh on modern day. In addition to this, it quickly creates the feeling of Borod and the result becomes very obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only do this work in Saigon or Da Nah, because here the film's former Marine Harvey Kettle, was probably engaged in the war ... but some or few people in South Vietnam are not talking to the clip. The pronunciation of the answer by the actors ... Seriously strange for the speaker of serious Vietnam. <br /> <br /> The leprosy old poet ... is very suspicious (there is no disease for humans in his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write Vietnamese poems ... even more suspicious ... <br /> < br /> <br />
