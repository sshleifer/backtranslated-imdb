Spider Ahhad <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made. There is no release quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite cute - they actually believe you that this movie will be frustrating and will be at the end of your seats. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes when stolen and poorly visible scenes will run without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium, and there was the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their improved teleportation power, for example, Alex falls into the Thomas Lake (drunk) and then ends up in an impossible position in his boat. Angela Haramana as a KG was a stunning performance, which became worse by the space-time continuously disconnected dialogue, which was written by a fifth class at the last minute. An example of this is when he said "Flashlight!" In such a stupid way, it determines how much the human body can cring before it snaps into half. Finally, I have ever seen the editing of this movie that is the most bizarre and horrific. Like cameraman, it was a bunch of chimpanzees, which was given by the scientists by Camcoder. An example of this, suddenly we could get the shuttle closure in Alex's car. I bet some time while performing this movie. The last was absolutely unfortunate. The authors are obviously trying to create some mysterious plot lines that tell the audience, "Oh yes!" Instead, we have left to see some spider some stupid painting that fits in the story line in any way. Unfortunately, there is not a view in millions of people who can save this movie from the hustle and bustle of the scourge. <br /> <br /> I'll call it 5 out of 10, 5 This picture was recorded in the movie instead of the photo book.
