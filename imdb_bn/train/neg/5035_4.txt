Melissa's 16th birthday is near the corner, and she's just discovering her sexuality with the boys. But in the Generic '80's Slashar film, all the boys who had jumped all the time were killed. It can reach the bottom of this murder until Sheriff Dan Cheyke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) in the local city and his killer, mysterious loving shoe girl Mercy (Dana Kimel, Friday 13th part 3). <br /> <br /> This movie focuses more on the mystery and melodram aspects of the movie and is less than the killings and thus, it is able to separate itself from the brothers of the 80's slash. Alicia has a big body (I think the actress feels over 18 years of age and clearly needs the pressure of pressure) I do not think she is distorting it too much. On the negative side, the film is frustrating by some plot points, which is unreliable and unnecessary, some of the frequent themes that are used more and the end is a waterproof weather. But good evil is bad (too much). Rent this, but I will not buy it. <br /> <br /> Candy: Alesha Sheryli shows her tits, bush and ass. <br /> <br /> My grade: C <br /> <br> Code Red DVD Extra: Star Alesha Sheryli and Intruder The role of director Scott Spiegel; Theater version of both the director and director of the movie; Audio conversation with Star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; Interview with Sheryli, Sotos and Bo Hopkins; Still gallery; Theater Trailer for this photo; And for nightmares, trailer, stunt rock, customs, and ballet conspiracies
