It is a good film for kids who love dogs. It runs very slowly but ends with De Vill. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the film for adults is a dog that is thought to be a dog. Birds speak like humans (Eric Idol of Monty Python) and a hole like a dog. It's a comedy film that needs more. Check it out in Mattine so that you do not have to pay a full price or wait for Disney to appear.
