It's not a good west. You've got this nut to sleep around a raging burning sun with a parasol, killing people for its own sake. During the blizzard this same person is sitting in a snow cave, his physiological piece has been cut, which is frozen. Then you've got some woman in a house outside the middle of the wolf shooting somewhere. What is the point of this photo? Can Bruce Darnen do some good? It was a waste of film.
