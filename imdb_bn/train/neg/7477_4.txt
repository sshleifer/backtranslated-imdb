The dense road movie, with some comic relief provided by the wonderful John Claes (though he's actually sending his performance to Fowly towers). The hat drops are to look at slim sensitivity from top slipstick and the worst part of the film is "find out" Martin and haun, who are they, etc. See it in your danger.
