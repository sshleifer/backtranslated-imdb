- There are missile spoilers - <br /> <br /> I saw a number of decent indoor horror movies like Hamilton, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Faware; Unfortunately I did not include this category felt in five across the eyes. From the beginning to the end, the film is influenced by the poor actresses transformed, God only knows why the author (s) thinks about the conversation as "do not go out; He will not go there. He will be there: If he finds you, he will kill you. And if he kills you then you will die. "<br /> <br /> <br /> This picture shows the development of very small character and I    নিই না তাদের উপর ব্যথা ও নির্যাতন কতটুকু ছিল, সে সম্পর্কে তারা হতাশাজনক কলেজ কলেজের একদল দল যারা প্রায় কোনও মুক্তিযোদ্ধা দেখায় না। They are all crying across the movie and whinge and girls are not crying their debate; Things are completely random when they are in conversation: How to date dating to a boy or one of the girls was surrendered recently (the appropriate topics are being followed by your psychotic killer). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> The camera-work is frustrating and sometimes makes the movie obsolete. Because I'm not a little budget, I'm guessing that the director was limited only to a digital camera, that women's cars live almost in the film. I think that the effort has been made to keep the audience closer to the work as possible: to feel what girls feel and experience. But because of a very sticky camera, grain picture and very close to the action, it is difficult to know what is happening during action scenes and only chaos. This is a subject matter for a movie subject, but there is a step on screen that the viewers can not understand due to poor film. <br /> <br /> I realize that five across the eyes do not have a low-budget indexing film but that's extremely poor quality excuses. There is no freedom fighter in this movie: bad acting, poor scripting, camouflage cameras and no stories. I decided to give 1 out of 10 films for all of this because it disappointed me; A meter hit the earth hit me to bring sweet relief. Her 94-minute stupid college-girls cry, arguing, running aimlessly and randomly inappropriate conversations. However, you see how many times you wash hands in the hands of women and tremble in the back of the car's wind screen.
