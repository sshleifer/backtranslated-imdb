I understand that I want to make a movie, which is very clear and different. I understand the comments of previous critics that this is a misplaced film. My point is as soon as the movie is over, my first comment is: "It is such that when a wealthy princess wants to be a movie star and she has no talent ..." she uses the meaning of Daddy which he wrote, directing , And paid for ... obviously there was no development of the character near the film and there was no direction like at the beginning, mid and end ... obviously The visible part was nice and beautiful but what was the point? I have seen that some women go to the house, find some pictures, screw the caretaker, come out of the cold night (not trustworthy) and test the noise and manage his caretaker lover .... the movie ends ... someone What educates my unconscious teaching ?? I really want to know what the point was ... what was the direction of the directors ... there was no improvement in the dead boyfriend? Why is the caretaker any background? What is the point of vision of the night? What is the lipstick point on the car? Why is a dead caretaker? Why do you tell us about a celebrated mental patient / peeping tom? What to sleep with What does the lamp and its house mean? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel like his house? The attitude that has never been followed ... for William Defoe ... I hired this movie because he was in it and known for its shiny character ... and write again and tell me what to learn. I love only a single mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
