Oh, people come to give this picture a break. One thing I liked it ......... Sorry, still thinking. And well !!!! John Wayne came and bad guys shot up Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a good quality film. Now let's see, I'm still trying to protect it. Oh yes, that chick was from Clueless. Stasi dash is not down. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a Duosi. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that has never been done in the West, even a woman cast, they actually hang a woman from the gallows. That could be a Western first. Although he should have broken his throat and he was painful, you still have to give the director some effort to make the first attempt in the West. Also, I did not see a woman from a horse in the west, even though this did not happen in this movie, I thought I would give the director another idea of ​​gang of roses # 2, which should be made right after Ed Wood's mind # 2 Maybe I was going for the makers of this photo. Unknown, especially with an African female cast and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Hey, if the makers of the Gang of Roses want to make a series in this world, you might as well be slang, "Hey, you do not takin about my house girls" and "hands, talk to the baby, in hand Talk to things like that you might have a surfer kids type deputy marshal. "That gun was completely rad man, complete." You know things like that.
