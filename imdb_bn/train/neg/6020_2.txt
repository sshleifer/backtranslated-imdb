I like the last day's movie. I like B-movies. I hope I want this movie. <br /> <br /> I can ignore poor effects, often violent music, cring-induction lines. I can ignore vague facts, and this movie is constantly dependent on the former instrument, the benefit given to the subject. I could avoid trying to reach that hunger and try to reach the world peace bad people. This thing someone wipes the movie. What this movie kills is simply simple and easy annoying. Nothing actually happens; Almost all the scenes in the film are designed to push viewers to push the morals of filmmakers, in reality a coherent story, or the cost of any kind of doubt. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertainment B-movie See elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
