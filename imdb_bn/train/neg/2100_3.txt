You will feel the dramatic enough you need without stuff about it before landing the moon first. However, this documentary seems to be necessary to throw everything in horrible potential light. It discusses the risks related to the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the training force, such as the trainer and the space station have something to do with each other. It sounds like the computer's overloaded problem (1202 and 1201 alarms) in the final landing sequence when the term like a near-disaster was when it was simply a boring and not risky to the crew. And it seems that 30 seconds before the "thirty seconds" call is left, when it is compulsory 30 minutes before the cancellation. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or Apollo dramatization 11, go to "the moon from the Earth" or PBS documentary, but avoid it.
