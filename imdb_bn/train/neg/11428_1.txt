Oh my God .. The best SH * I have ever seen - was the main idea to come to my mind after watching this movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite legends. Although, perhaps the idea was good but the effect was harmful. I mean the role of H Graham in particular. What was that ??? According to me, the producers have destroyed all positive intentions. The character played and played boringly. Every time he appears, reminds you that you are watching a movie and destroying the soul of the moment, the whole movie, because most of the time you can see his stupid faces are more stupid efforts to create emotions. Awesome, do not waste your time.
