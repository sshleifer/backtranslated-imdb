Based on the same name book written by Michael Hoylebach, a controversial writer by the icon film "Extension du Dien de la Lute", directed by Icon Cluster filmmaker Philip Herrell. He also worked on this film scene. According to the British movie Magazine sight and sound, it is also known as "whatever". This film has been called as a fresh air breathing for French films due to its general perception of sexual politics and its impact on two stupid information technology workers. The film is fierce, with its very clear voice that is presented with our main character. It reminds us the audience that we see a book that is read. The foundation of the problem of loneliness is a fine because of the chronic sexual crisis, but the film is lost when the protagonist starts repeating the pain faced by her and her friend. Instead of sticking to its original theme, the film progresses to the other side. Be careful. Caution: Some female viewers can not only find the film, even two heroes of Morocco say the miscreants.
