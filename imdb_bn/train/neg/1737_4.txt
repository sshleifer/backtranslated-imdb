Arnest Lübitz's final film, ending in Anna Prümme, is completed after the indefinite period of production of LouisCheche, it is a juggling act of sophistication and cilineata, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramas. In the 19th century the fort of south-eastern Europe, a countess falls for the leader of the Hungarian rebellion, his sworn enemy; He helped by his ancestor, whose paint image is magically life comes. Betty Grable, arranged with flowers, has never been more beautiful in a long blonde wig, and her song is very delightful. Unfortunately, this script (by Rudolf Shanzar and E. Walshich, by Samson Raffleson from an Opetta) is horrific over the various ideas to make or entertain. The results look better, but are unabsorbing. * **** to 1/2
