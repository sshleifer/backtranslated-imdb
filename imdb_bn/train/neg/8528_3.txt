What is written in the poster: "At birth he was given 6 years ... he started his life at the age of 34." Aamir is an American born Israeli who diagnosed the disease of muscular dystrophy at an early age. After the love of 22-year-old caregivers at the age of 34, he decided to come to America to face the doctor, who said that he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weighs 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as me, even I saw this picture. <br /> <br /> It is obviously brave to live, all the things that he will have his finger on the left index, but why is he so angry with the doctor? Who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother that based on medical history, people of his disease would not live long. What is shown at the door of the old doctor? Why is this old doctor looking for his lifetime journey in the US? There are a lot of things we can have in the life of Amir: how can he create these animations only in that finger movement? Depending on others entirely how can he go through daily life? How did he live in his doctor's prediction? How do they cope mentally when other people look at the strange creatures? The movie tells us that anyone. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set Amir a trip to show the door to his living doctor so that he could see him alive. I thought it was a joke.
