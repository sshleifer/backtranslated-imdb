This is the most annoying piece of shit I've ever ruined one hour of my life. I can all say thank God that it was just an hour. The footage from more than half of this movie's "crazy football" In a very short time, I was able to see the highlights from the rare exploitation classics, because for some real-time corrective reasons, my video store was only "criminally insane II" (such as "Crazy Fat Atlet 2"). But the rest of this movie is the most bad home-video and the creation of backdoor films that you will ever see. Why is this my video store and not the original? Why stuff like this end up in the video store? Why do people rent it and do not copy it once in a constant horror? Why - August - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " To give poisonous tea to multiple wives of cell-killings and then complain that all conversations make their own tea cold, or mentally-impaired fly soup barrier, or just crazy fat athel in blood in a garden Want to dance with a knife: Do not see this movie. Repeat: Do not watch this movie. Do not hire this movie. If possible, please do not walk a shelf of a video store that has a copy of this movie settings. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
