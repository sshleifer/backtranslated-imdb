It was one of the most ridiculous and poorly-directed films I've seen for a long time. I did not like Spike Lee, but thought I'd try this: Wrong mistake. In the summer of 1977 the film was supposed to show how to influence the murder of the real son; It was really the center around the most annoying character, I suspected that anyone was taking care of their drug problems, marriage problems, etc., etc. The scenes that depict the killings are nothing but; A shooting and then it's back Saturday night fever! Speaker Leane's choice is to be seen as a reporter of the film: Spike, believe me, you do not hit cats, stay away from movies, it makes them worse. The most intelligent view was to say that the dog was a stupid voice, which was previously visible where it was thought to have been shot ??? Spike, what were you thinking about creating this image? All thoughts are not my thoughts. Those who think they will see a crime drama, will take my advice and do not waste your time or money for this loss. You're good off watching Jerry Springs in this case! Movie waste, I gave it 1 out of 10: horrible ugly.
