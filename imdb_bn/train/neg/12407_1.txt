Alichenene (Laurel Barnett) lives in The Babysitter for young Rosalie Norden (Rosalien Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosali misses her dead mother a lot and runs late in the night (conveniently located in a graveyard behind the house) ... where she meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> Really eerie sequence in the graveyard Starts off well with ... then fall apart. There are tons of pudding tones to make the thin and 85-minute long film. Terrible across the acting board (being the easiest with Cole). At the worst pace I've ever seen a motion picture directed with performance. The scene (and the word) is cut with just no rhythm or reason. Also the film is terrible (and obvious) post-production sounds. <br /> <br /> For blood and violence - forget it! What is incredibly fake looks very little and there is. I have never seen such a fake look - like ketchup! Annoying, vain - a legitimately forgotten drive-in movie. You can skip this one.
