It is incredible to me that anyone can not comment on this comment that can comment. It's not just repressive promotional, but weird, staggering, dramatically straight-jacketed, and painfully exaggerated. It seems like the 8-year-old child is being punished for writing 100 times on the blackboard "Be Fascist". <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it can be WW2, and Hitler's bold criticism, and the terrible suffering he suffered (which would be sincerely commendable), and I'm sure it will capture the mood of the day correctly. . But it is presented in the way of an unfamiliar, highly transparent, Slaajhamma, which, in the absence of artwork, is unreasonably unsuccessful. Here is Paul Lucas' only good performance, who brings sincerity and intensity as a calmly heroic anti fascist; And Lucile Watson amusingly ill-rich wealthy grandmother who slowly understand how the world has become dangerous. Although their vain motivation has imposed them on all kinds of hardships, children still behave arbitrarily robotically as a little snap. They are not even similar to the remotely human people. And here's a great actress, Bet Davies, every time I was on the screen, I'm so generous enough. Each of his words, each of his gestures, is meant to be disciplined and intuitive to her husband, and to realize that he is fighting for him and how he is fighting for the way he is fighting, if he is brave then he will be painful electric shock <br/> <br /> So yes, this is a very important film, not only very good.
