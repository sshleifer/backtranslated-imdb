And it falls on the square in the "strangely bad" section - meaning that a drunken student hired to kick. I was at the science fiesta festival and thought that this movie was a wave after the wave of violent laughter as the premiere. Other criticism will be described more accurately in the futal nature of this movie, and I feel very poor about poor people from the company I produced, perhaps gauging the response of the audience. The person who got drunk students was equal to audiences' money and after a "fierce" anime film, I thought it was "sky blue", the audience had a relentless temperament and then the film was opened and everyone was rolling on the island in the room. I'll shoot the worst part; <br /> <br /> The most fun and worst part of this movie is that it sometimes walks on a linear and anticipated street with sick thinking. Strange, but laughable sunny Animation: If you can put the skimpier dress gradually for the hero backgrounds and Halloween (I know that !!), put it together, and put together, then see he is dead from a Swedish farmer girl. "Trasforms" in death where montage !!! Characters: So one dimensional is its painful, there is a brief backstory (with dialogue split lines) and little light is enlightened on the real motivation behind the original characters. So, if you are getting a captive audience and some drinks, try and make sure that they 'get drunk' in order to ease the pain), then slip this movie into a DVD and a "mystery science theater 3000 "Get psychosis. There is no other inspiration to watch this movie, it laughs and it's not a comedy. Do not watch this movie alone. Compared to Colin Farrell, "New World" can be even more annoying because you will not be able to laugh with a friend or two.
