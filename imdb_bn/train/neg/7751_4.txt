Firstly, CGI was terrible in this movie. I saw it during a marathon bad movie on SciFi Channel. Finally when the owner of the park dies, it is probably one of the worst examples of CGI. Even the Night of the Living Dead was a good animation. <br /> <br /> That movie was almost no plot. Why were they especially on that island? Well, not told in the movie. And why are people coming to the cat area? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the things standing in this picture was moderately well played. What could be said for the movie "TV movie for BVI movie", the performance was very good. Perry Shane specially stands. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing to do on Saturday, then watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
