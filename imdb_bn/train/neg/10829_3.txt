Magnolia is shouting, trembling, overwrought, hysterical twits who are walled by the wall, crime and pain presents itself as wall canvas wall. PT Anderson is certainly a talented filmmaker, but perhaps he can leave writing to someone else or at least someone will tell him to edit this extra mess. <br /> <br /> A view to cast would tell you that the performance was excellent, and they were. I just want every scene that is not related to the leading mourning match or the sin associated with the long-standing sin, and is not involved in the pain that has happened to them. <br /> <br /> I think Anderson has unfortunately failed to create a story that parallel the odd table opening the image. It is surprising to see how the surplus sequences can combine fate people and situations, the most optimistic believers in a cosmic doll that pulls our strings will be frustrated. But any aspect of how the story is developed that shows these opening conversations. I was waiting for some form of the universe to express myself, but what we get instead is the mood of morally challenged characters, who spread their past to them and now look for absence. Throw it to the edge of the Bible Plague on the left ground and ultimately you will be a cadre of Anderson fans who will be surprised at his talent, when it really proves that he actually read the Old Testament. <br /> <I would say that the music of the Aime quality was great and I was looking for the soundtrack CD. In short, if the actors closed or pulled it, it could be a good movie to watch and listen (music, that could be).
