Sorry this movie does not scare me. It's just annoying. I saw the potential and that it was just so frustrating, that all, fell by the roadside. Children! Dad! Forecast! There was so much potential and ziltch! Nude! I've heard all before. Scary! No! I can feel myself alone, where I live, they can stay there than the movie. Does the woman write that the women should be so annoying? is not it? This movie was pretty atmospheric. Or at least it could be, the director / writer was annoyed to do it. If we could have had some good music that somebody added tension, then someone tried. I really want to know why they get money? Just give it to me and save all that disturbance. Exempt? ... not where we betrayed
