There is basically a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a junk in his closet and his father is always fighting. <br /> <br /> This movie is so slow from soap opera ... And suddenly, Jake decided to become Rambo. <br /> <br /> Well, when you are going to create a movie, you have to decide first whether it is a thriller or a play! The movie as a play is watchable. Parents are arguing like divorcing and real life. And then Jake destroyed all the pictures with her closet! I expected to see a concert similar to Buzemam, and instead I saw a play with some pointless thriller spot. <br /> <br /> 10 only 3 just for playing good parents or ancestral conversation. As for Jake's shot: Just ignore them.
