Again I took an opportunity and rented this bag for crap. The bill, as a horrific flick, was not one scene, one was even terribly awesome. Not a !! Certainly there was some nudity, but all lesbian steps got a little old. Guess I probably would have guessed to be the saving grace of this movie? And Dan, what a boring ass bag !! Right from the start I knew I was for it when I first spoke well at Ol 'Dan. And he was scared? What a smile !! After all, this movie is horrific horror! How does hell make movies like this? If you want some romantic movies on it, do not hire it. About thriller as this movie Teletubbies.
