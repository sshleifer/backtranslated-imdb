To this end, I saw the worst movie in my whole life, and I saw some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looks like it may be a decent horror movie. I know that the covers will be the best part of the movie. Where do you start? The filming of the film was detached and boring. At one stage, there is no one minute view, no one is talking, just a car that drives on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just became silence. The whole movie is boring, annoying, incredible dialogue and basically talk about any plots. If you rent this movie, then watch it with some friends and it can create a good comedy. Otherwise, when you watch this movie, run.
