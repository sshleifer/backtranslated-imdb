I think it's meaningless to make a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it created the second part of a ridiculous movie, in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Kulkin Thomas J.) was killed. The story was ending after the first movie. I tried to try to find a way out why the story continues. That was stupid!
