Generally, I know after a first minute of a movie if I hate it or enjoy it ... but now, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was great; "This is based on a true story" and Blah blah blah thing was fun. Later, the description of the son's life with the cartoon and the photo reminds me that I liked the right one. <br /> <br /> Then, it was very nice to see Toronto's hilarious nude look. Also, the situation and appearance of the house started to make sure my first thoughts. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first 10 minute movie ... which looked like later on forever. Perhaps this is not understandable in English Canadian humor (it is possible that English Canadians can not always understand Quebec's humor), but hey ... there was not enough material for a short film, * nothing * . Maybe the title could mean? However, almost everything was admitted, and very few things were funny in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was better than the "created" movie. At least you understand the motivation behind which everything is bad. The idea was potentially great; That's why I hired the movie, interested in the "disappearances of annoying people". But still, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and even with a point in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are an English Canadian, but you may appreciate local humor, considering the wonderful number of people who gave this movie. Otherwise, think twice before losing your precious time ...
