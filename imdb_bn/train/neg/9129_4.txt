There is nothing around it - this movie is terrible. I saw the old Christopher Lee / Phu Manchur film, I know from letters and its serial origin, but it is still just religious. However, the talent of Peter Sellers is still worried by the screenplay of New Zealand Smith, the power of sorrow, sorrow, and energy has been strengthened; It's a performance equivalent to Pant Kousseau Van Helsing, which I completed in Kushing's "Dracula" films in a tenth of screen time. This could be something special when the film was completed on the Syrian-comic vein, such as the Bubba Ho-Tep, through the 1960 Avenger TV show. If you are complete with a Fu Fan or Peter Seller, then this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for someone else.
