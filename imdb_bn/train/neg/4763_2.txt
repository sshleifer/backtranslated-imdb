The main reason for writing this review is that I am a great game and deserves the 1972 film, it's a terrible movie experience. If I can save someone from seeing it, I've done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with genius, and it's all wrong. Kenneth Branagh is an ugly, sterilized, one note set. She has to draw the cinema from every arty, confusing, self-centered angle possible. We offer reflections of stainless steel actors, security surveillance, their head shots from 200 feet above, eyes closed, chains, and more and more. Screenplay by a Nobel Laureate, Unexpected gay banner is long stretched, which is being faked by both sides .... I think ?? How do I know the character "Twist"? Characters between themselves are so rich, crass and unsympathetic. Running time has been cut within an hour, which is the real problem or the director is the best thing for us. The actors effectively execute their lines, but they say or do nothing reliably reliable. The Jewish law is the leading, but notable producer of Kainen, Brangh's blessing. <br /> <br /> I saw everyone, a former classic vague shell. Why is it even made ??? The paid people spent 4 million dollars to see it! A terrible piece of work that fails to turn every turn.
