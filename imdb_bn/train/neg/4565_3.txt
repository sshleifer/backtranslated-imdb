That's right! Under 9 years of age, but under 12 for a little bit! I was 11 years old when I watched the video and this young man in fact that I could not see the strange cartoon-quality and that the classic characters we all are in love do not see the same or do not look good. Just here everything is 2D here! Belle is, I agree, only a plain looking woman with beautiful but skinned leather, she wear bright blue dress in the same way with the same glitterous dress, the wardrobe is less, annoying - if I hear every day my ear becomes blood ! Lumiare was both Sue and Elegant in both original and Christmas versions, but here she is a feminist, strange tweet! Famous for Kogsworth, who is known as the Nonsense Housekeeper, he is a complete TT and what I want to say is the most amazing character! He always feels his hard-hitting pie-hole shutting, and whose watch must be used to return to the unforgettable two movies of this series! The poor, poor Mrs Pots were not brought by Angela Lansbury (one of my favorite classic actors), but there is no crime against Rogers, who has arrested Mr. Potos' character! She is not his best! When the animal roars, it clearly defaults to pregnancy by an additional thunder, scalp or microphone. I am aware that it is only the third feature after the other two films. So it's certainly not good, but I'm sure that more contributions will not hurt any Disney artists, who have actually made such extraordinary years of animation style. It's okay, I guess, and when I sometimes suits it I do not see it. It is very difficult to make a recommendation to read it, because it depends on how old you are, but remember that what you can expect after following the previous spectacular movies will not be right! And in my video, the cover behind it is "proud of the bright animation"! It's a nice little flashing but for one thing it's very poor and for others, those 3 words should be stored for the next release of the original release!
