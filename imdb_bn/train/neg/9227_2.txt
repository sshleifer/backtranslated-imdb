Siu this year I saw the worst movie. Almost every movie I want to see in the theater is at least entertaining or something to say. This image looked like a movie operated by its film for its prints. Filmmaking class Her father makes great movies. Her sister made a good one. But brother Roman? No! A critics were curious to compare this movie to Gordad's Li Maprus (humiliation). Coppola, Junior took the same idea, a movie about the film, he tried very hard to think of himself as a European, artist, and a wicked, when it was all right. The lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film, as he is frightened or frightened of the film that is made around this. Schwarzberg has no way managed to stop his role as a brilliant director. Depardieu is okay. In any scenario, there are idiots of genre films, surprisingly, not scenes of B-movie, but a scene in Italy; A montage of various different character shots inside a very small car, driving around picking up and dropping random people. This is the only thing that reminds me of the movie, I guess that he is trying to fool me. Or rip off Or both. The documentary is played with the camera after talking to the camera and with the filming of various objects, the last one is tagged for "turn" or artistic quality ... I think the most interesting thing about this movie was that the film was, and the way is not intended for it. . Whether or not a film is re-edited or re-shot or whatever, this movie was sent again, no surprise, which seems bad to me before. I can not believe it could be worse than it is. If you want to see a good parody of the film then see Austin Powers films. None of them. The opening of the third is more entertaining and more gifted than the whole movie. Lil 'Romy for the movie, please go back to manage your cousin's music videos. Dad left the godfather.
