This movie is no longer a waste of time ... why am I giving such a lash? ... someone please tell me ... * Pain * Oh well. Return to the movies: If you really enjoyed the very first movie (as I've done), however, Cub Zero is probably worth it, and the actor (actor) and screenwriter recruited to verify that the last (expected) film was apparently uploaded, of course Movies for But you are good looking and looking for a good movie with a fantastic plot ... * Bad grin * Then this movie is definitely for you: - D .... OK I'm lying ... best sucks this movie. All right, I have to admit that some of the ingredients were cool in it .. well .. cool ... and I smiled several times, precious in the wrong things, but still I was amazed. :-) But everything that just creates the "OK" section, is not enough to make this movie valuable to it. Unless you count on one of the top ten movies of "Mana - Lucky Arm"!
