Anyone who made this film, especially the director, did not give any idea for the reasoning of the storyline? These are not only the plot-holes, but the grave of the plot, which always gets deeper, because we lose any sympathy for the main character and its plight. This means that if you fall in love, enough viewers to really ignore the gentleman for the movies that are cemeteries, or annoying and unlucky for most movies. Or, in the case of Dinie and Hanayer characters, apparently lazy. Due to the existence of significant screen time in the movie, I decided that the director chose his character and unnecessarily increased the screen time (as a director, he did not change anything about the script as the director), or his character was being sacrificed on the evil plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I do not understand why Robert Olman will take this task. Of course he has some power to pick and choose. Actually, I do not understand why anyone will take this script, without looking for the first time director experience. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Donny Jr. needs money for his practice. I think Kenneth Branagh wanted to try a southern accent. I think Robert Duval was given only a few pages of script, and the role of separatism was playful. This is the only motivation I can see that will encourage good actors to take part in this movie. For Robert Olman, he has been making great efforts to make the film look fantastic. I myself saw how he used this scene and how he made it, or in another scene used a bright orange float dress, he used a nice filter to draw the eye movement or to create a special mood. I do not usually look at such things as movies, since most of the movies I'm bothered to see eventually, in fact, add to the good storytelling and understanding of interesting characters. I saw it in the end because some ridiculous elements of the optimist have shown that DVD cover and believe that because of the talent involved, there should be some reason to release this movie. <br /> <br />> Excellent direction But why do not I watch movies
