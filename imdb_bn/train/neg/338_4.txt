Definitely a funny story about the mysterious son kidnapped in Eddie Morphy's small film, the three-year-old dragon and "nominated one". <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "nominee" on the question and offers the opening song as "He is the best man in the world" The founder of the missing and missing children, he contacted a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who told him that she was "selected nominee" and her fate was to find and rescue "Golden Child". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie starts. This plot is hateful and enough to destroy the whole film. Murphy is going to be another car for comic brand comedy (comedy is not so big a mind for you), the film fails at many levels. Even the evil Shadow Numspa as Charles Dancing could not do much for the proceedings. Very stupid and frustrating. <br /> <br /> Sunday, 12 December 1993 - T V.V.
