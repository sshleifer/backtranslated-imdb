I am waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because of Juhi Chawla, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> There are six stories in this picture. It's a new idea to fly over from Hollywood. So this is not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (Priyanka Chopra) is a dancer. She wants to get famous journalists and news reporters makes her a lover to let her be interested. But then Rahul appeared (Salman Khan) and he claimed to be his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he yells, I get bored. Salman Khan can not play comic role! But in his heaviest part, he is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> 2. Binoy (Anil Kapoor) has married Seema (Juhi Chawla) He falls into the medieval crisis and he is attracted to a very young woman, what he really forgot in life; His wife and children <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3 Shaivan (Akshaye Khanna) Gaya (Ayesha Takia) is going to marry, but she gets cold and closes the marriage. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Johar Abraham) got married in Tahajib (Vidyalaya). He gets an accident and suffered a memory loss. Now she did not know that she loved her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a cab driver. She met Stefhani (Shannon Acechovitz) who is a white woman who loves an Indian male but she is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju will have to bring a man to the person, but he will fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's movies. He is not very boring, funny. But in this movie I like him a lot, as last year has increased. <br /> <br /> 6. Yes! Sohel Khan! He played Ram Doval, who had married Phulwati (Isha Copika). He wants to take some serious steps with her, but every time her family comes. <br /> <br /> Sohel Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. The story is not interesting from the story of six interesting stories! The stories here and there touch each other, but are not important for the characters. <br /> <br /> my conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Hide the woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohel Khan should make more movies, this role was too short for him. Salman Khan is not able to play comic, but the real serious movie. That is written on his life as an actor. This movie is helpless, and a waste of actresses and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshay Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has the ability to make movies with the child, and you just let him sing a slap.
