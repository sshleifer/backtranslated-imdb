I saw this movie, why did I try to bother to make it. Although the main plot of the film is probably good, but there are all kinds of unnecessary / unnecessary subheads. People in Hollywood marketing must point out to many bad boys, a permanent dual cross and men and women are very close and sex. It is impossible that we have seen more sex than the President and his mistress. Many plots and subopts make the film even more elaborate and do not make a character better - I really do not think that I knew any character, everyone else is corrupt and evil. Finishing is incomplete - I've omitted more than what it might be, but what was supposed to be. Finally, anyone who acts as an angry character, does not have any explanation as to how many of them, some of whom have a double cross of somebody else. I am surprised that many established (and well) actors agree to do such a hollow movie. It looks like a movie made by college students who are working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Create a movie you want for example, do not waste your time and do not have time until your movie is in the class.
