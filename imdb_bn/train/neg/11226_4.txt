I bothered on the Dark Angel. The film shows "loving" respect for the greatest pin-up of all time - but the film itself is effective. I can not really see what the motivation or "point" of this film - the little biographical information is provided in the story - so those who do not know much about Betty will not know anything after seeing the dark. ANGEL is ... <br /> <br /> The film originally chronicles the past few years of Bettie's career in captive modeling. Almost the entire movie contains some of the more famous "famous" photo shoots and "re-laws" of the loops. These remakes literally take 75% of the film's run-time and do not give a sense of intimacy to a person like a person. The film touches briefly on its short-lived legal activities and decides to leave its "next" business and to become religious - but it is much more enlightened to display the scenes of long and drawn-out revisions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dark Angel is not a horror movie - it has no elements. The other problem is that the actress plays in Beti, which actually looks similar to many remote shots - it does not have any discount for the up-close. The other thing that burns me is that although Betty has done several helpless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the movie was a small segment of a zoo during the last credits. The film itself is very low budget, but it sets which it can set and its limitations are cost-based - so there is no firm determination from me. Beautiful wood and irrational from everyone involved in acting. Actually - the most memorable thing for me in the whole movie, during the last achievement, I thought that the actor who played the original name of Eving Clois, Ducci Flyover No joke - Check cast list. If you are not the true Bettiefile completist and I do not recommend it much unless there is anything related to it. And if you stop that bad-- then you will seek treatment ... 4/10
