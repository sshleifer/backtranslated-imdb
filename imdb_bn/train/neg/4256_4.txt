Ascension is really a step in the story of real movies and special effects. Jason Scott Lee is a vampire hunter to calculate himself as well. (If you believe him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason is as much as London's Luke, the baby that he loves, helping the girl to steal far away from Slack's Dracula's body. Diane Neal is as good as a woman who steals a dracula's body to find a remedy for her dead lover, and Stephen Billington is just as great as Dracula herself. Garner performed better than Gerard Butler, and was rated in the original film. Roy Skider finds out the rest of this movie and as a consultant to Jason Scott Lee's character, he is a well-known creator. This quarter's second sequel, and they are off to a good start. Whether it will end the series on a good note, whether it is in the air.
