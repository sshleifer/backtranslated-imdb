We bought this image from a shop named Poundland. We were looking for further inspiration because we had bought a revival in the movie Big Deal earlier. <br /> <br /> We hope this movie is very inspirational so that we can recreate it and put it on the tube. However, this was a shock. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. Bad effects and scripts are not enough for you to visit it. At the moment, the main female body is thrown out to give viewers an interest. However, it makes you wonder, did they surround the budget to stop her clothes? If so, I wanted to return! It looks like a naive movie, the shots do not interact with each other, and the camera work is so amateur, it feels our reinstatement of bad films as professional. I can not believe that it is being sold as a sellable product. <br /> <br /> It is only interested in keeping and watching. The actor is bad and has no degree in professionalism about it. It has no words on how terrible it is.
