I was excited to discover some of my favorite comedies late in this year - Maggie Smith, Bob Neighart, and of course, Peter Ustinov. Thus my frustration was compiled to discover the film, it did not work as a comedy or perfectest film. Ustinov plays a small time crook out of prison who sets up his site in a big American corporation based in London. Former CEO Karl Malden and Tech Guy pursued his way to Neighth, Ustinov surrendered himself as a computer expert and immediately planned the film's "Perfectest Hijst" part. To do this, he must pass a facade protection protection mechanism under the supervision of the mainframe corporation. And here's the problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is significantly believable and stupid. Her lame excuse is worth the face and this video will not be disturbed with the camera, it will be the only computer center anywhere. The second problem is the hijst (the truth of the fraud) hiding most of the dramatic excitement in the first 30 minutes of the film. Maggie Smith, sadly working as a nearby neighbor / secretary beside Osstinov, who can not only be employed. I love Maggie Smith but he seems to be very together here, too much has been composed, this part is more familiar to a fragile, physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have chemistry together, perhaps it's the difference in age, but the next romantic relationship, such as the lack of actual romance, still comes off a bit annoying. Ustinov script co-authors, and it is well thought out at times, but I found it a weird, mad and a great shield of a sad waste.
