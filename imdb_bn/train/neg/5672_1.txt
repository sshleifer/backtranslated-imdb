I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The shortest movie of the most redeeming factor bonus feature owned by the DVD My vote for this movie is a big fat zero. Do not get it wrong, I'm a terrible girl. But I want some meat behind the story, I do not like to make people feel bad, do not cheat to see, what ever seems like, the nails clip of animals Cruelty laws prevent chronic silence and poor performance. If I am compelled to compare with any other film, it seems that the only mind canal is the Holocaust. Bad, annoying, vain and a completely uncomfortable clock.
