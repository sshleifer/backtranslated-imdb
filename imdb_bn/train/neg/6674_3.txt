I must admit that the director of this movie, Eduardo SÃ¡nchez, who managed the very popular and successful Blair Witch project. Alongside, it's one of the most intriguing films and dreamer of Stephen King, one of those who hated the critics, but I enjoyed it. "Unfortunately, I feel that in most parts, there is a waste of time, so I will keep this review brief. The premises are always committed, and the changes are different, it is the story of a group that says Weirdly, weirdly in the early years, and naturally, others would accept you as a nurturing imaginable thing. The stories are always invisibly to deal with inquiries, so I can not find the details, but you are extremely uncomfortable and you want to forget what you are doing <br /> <br /> <br /> Are you given a chance for revenge? That is to say, you successfully manage to catch and keep alive. What will you do? For this group, it is a delightful payback time, or so they thought. The movie starts to develop a snyujapheste, worse, obsolete dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it is not low-budget, but many are not forgiving material, it is the power of stories, or simply their characters helps make an interesting dive. It's renovated the standard cardboard from a vanilla plain script, employing some cheap fear strategies. <br /> <br /> makeup is good though Several stuff has been created which I can not mention, because it will make some of the material looted of this movie. There is also a natural effect, blood and vital moments that you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> See it as the only last resort. Compared to other giant movies in the city - Feast, this one takes less fun, and very seriously. Bogged by an uninspiring direction, you have been warned.
