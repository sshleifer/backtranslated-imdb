First of all tell me that I had to think a lot to write a comment for this movie. The best review for this type of movie can be just silence. Address of movie housewives and grandmothers. The film tries to look "genuine" and the letters should be supposed to be "real people". An Italian could never think that the letters can be "real": they are simply "low profile" stereotype. Life in the Italian countryside gives a confusing look at what life does. Plots are weak (plots? What plots?) And comedians can not laugh at anyone over 12 years old.
