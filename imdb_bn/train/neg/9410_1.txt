As long as you can enjoy it! If you wake up, wake up, dress up, take a bath, prepare dinner, watch each other, watch sex in the dark, then go back to sleeping sleeping ... if you like flat flat, narrow bedroom and in the kitchen, long minutes Silence ... If you want to become bored for two hours, feel the thrill of "real intimate false art", then you'll like it. But if you do not, try to see a better movie, there are thousands. "As long as you are here", but what do we want to be? This German film received the Torino Gay Film Festival Award: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, because the festival presented many genius movies. Can be nice with Germany, why not often get rewards? Well, "the lives of others" ... but it's a nice but not gay. So maybe it's a question of fashion. Are the Germans "In" again? Anyway, why not? Or just a few directors for the look of the hustler?
