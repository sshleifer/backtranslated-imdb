Before I commented on this movie, I have seen YouTube, I must admit that I first met the TV commercial in 1980 because of the scrutiny of Barbara Bach's Clauses. And since the movie got a rating, I expected to see her nude. Well, there is no dash for him or any other superb actress present here: Stacey Nelkkin, who was supposed to be a young man, but actually he was 20 years old. Bra and Panti and later in a stomach dance group, Mrs. Bach saw her. They provide some of the isolated smile to provide this movie. In fact, I do not blame Ron Lehmann for the removal of credit, because his firm-skeptic license was shameful, although I like the "greed" scene with Mrs. Nelkin. This may be Ralph McKeev's debut, a unit of mofits sent to the academy school. Others are a black kid, who truly loves his grandfather and Miss Bach, a Arab who worshiped Arab oil, and a politician's son loves his girlfriend Candy (the character of Nelkin), he risks being soft in the middle of the night. Girls' academy Among the supporter Cast, Tom Poston starred as a character named Sisone, who I partially got fun. The director of Tom Pattet and J. Tarzes and Robert Downey's directive (whose son Robert Donny Jr. has a cameo at the beginning of a football scene), ups up the academy's politically incorrect humor, but unless you really get annoyed with graduation and sex, it's actually a The beautiful harmful comedy Mad-Magazine and its trademark cover boy-Alfred E. Newman-even if their name and character are closed, do not be ashamed .. .PS "Misfits" is another Harry TinoVittas who was born in my birth city in Chicago. He played Rodney Vigeragert. He also said one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
