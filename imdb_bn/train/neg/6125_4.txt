Derek couple is the best movie ever made and if you think this is a recommendation but you have not seen anyone else. There are natural elements: it works like bad for their other efforts, we can often see a separation or audition for wet T-shirt competitions, the story is simply ridiculous, and the film takes very seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa <br /> <br /> <br /> But there are some things to do. Bo looks great, production quality (set, costume, etc.) is quite good, and it greatly enhances its camp quality. It's actually quite funny in a strange way, because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
