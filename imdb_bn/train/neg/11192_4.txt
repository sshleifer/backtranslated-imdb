I was not completely influenced by this film. It was originally named Sineta Eater and was considered for the last half of the film. I am not sure whether I had any relationship with the rest of the first 20 minutes of the film. It was very slow and chose Robcop (Peter Weller) as the main actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, it would surely be a few days after the flow and find the words.
