Kat mostly tries to be like post-scam slash, which is a horrific explosion that tries to be clever by referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I'm not getting 'Scrum', it looks like 'Scram' is a very awesome movie that makes a great job of mixing horror and comedy. Cut mostly fails at the level. It's a moment but overall it does not just work as a "very bad it's good" film, only the average below is <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so is OK and set Kylei Minong really can not really work, and maliciously finds his tongue, the story is fairly good except for this image. Some time ahead and a group of movie students want to stop filming, which is apparently curse. And, perhaps you have predicted, casting one by one and the crew is slowly sorted by a masked crazy. <br /> <br /> There are several components to follow the role of Eurozone Plot, poor performance and an expected finish. There are so many referencing in the film, 'Scam' to 'Texas Chain So Massachusetts' everything. It's not smart, it seems like the director wanted to think smart and cool to mention other famous horror flicks ala screws. The short bears for a slasher and no nudity, which comes in a slasher, which is a huge negative when it does not get it for a whole lot, while a negative. Indeed, I'm supporting this movie because I'm Australian and we are not as good as the horrible (we have our gems), but the cut is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it has kept me for 90 minutes or more, so at least some good. I will not recommend it to anyone other than hardcore slash fans, who will be able to realize who is trying to target this movie, but if you are looking for a good movie then stay away from it. <br /> <br /> 2/5
