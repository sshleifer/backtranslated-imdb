First thing first: I'm not a conservative. And even though I do not refer to myself as a libertarian or a democrat, I protested against the Iraq war from the very first day. I think John Cusack is safe to say and I probably look into politics, in fact, I'm sure that we will drink alcohol to friends as soon as Adam Curtis's BBC DOCS speaks. My point is: Without disrespecting the idea, I'm thinking that I'm not part of the church, campaigning in Casac Wars, Inc. There is no question that WWII's politics has been made to appeal to my population, but the problem is that Sewy is poor and cuddle co-creates, produces and fits worse than a cheap case between stars. <br /> <br /> They say that "the road to hell is tied with good intentions." Cusack, along with his co-authors, director Joshua Sefilele and even actors, was unfortunately not intended to taunt Robert Altman's M * A * S * H ​​as an obsession, and to make every war against each other as fun. They ended up with Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon as inexperienced and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The current US state politics, foreign policy and war "attempts" are already irrational and, as a result, sad, unfortunate and sadly ridiculous - just look at the daily shows and see for yourself. The following line is: You can not write the Bush administration on a daily basis as fun, so why not try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem of the WII is that it was quick to get together. To accomplish this, Cusack basically did Ponet Blank (one of his best movies) in Gross, one of his favorite films, kept the setting down in a shopping list of ideas collected from Naomi Klein. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, most of these ideas have entered into your neck and make them so objectionable that the obvious references are not imaginable in the context of any joke or jug ​​or intentionally occupation of Halberton, Neo-Cons, and Iraq-US. Cute, or funny The authors have become so blinded by their own contradictions that they thought that the subject matter would only be fun and confusing by mentioning these things. The problem is ... it is not. So far, these ideas are yesterday's news and if you do not live under or are rocked or blinded by ignorance, denial and cruelty (read: right-wing Christian), this joke is insulting easily. <br /> <br /> Perhaps WI will work if it develops more humble, confusing, objectionable, and professional details / insights. Whereas, with all the surfaces of the jokes and sight of the mess and so bad, with very little fluster, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did a little more than bother me. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny" because it's true "and the daily show proves this every night; War, Inc is true even if it's true because it's not funny. The bottom line: when hyperbola is not needed in America / Neo-Conservative politics It is also a bigger pair. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
