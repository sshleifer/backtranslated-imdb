This image is a Pia Zadora special! While watching it, I was reminded of the classic cartoons showing a Hollywood Starlet; Other roles need urgent but fear of becoming a 'B' typestust for movies or soft porn roles! In his casting session, "Of course, I do not normally play a role that requires nudity, but if it is artistic for the film ... ...". In this flute, a very nasty picture of a similar cartoon depicting Piaa, "I certainly do not take any role that requires normal acting, but it gives me enough exposure to increase my sexual relationship ..." ........... ". This is probably fairly unfair, rather the fault of the sordid story Harold Robbins; Pia's exposure must not be undecided considering the nature of the story, and probably Pia (who once won the acting award at Butterfly) deliberately scoffs at his part instead of trying to play a vague role. Critics are generally the first issue of actors when a movie proves frustrating, but it is not fairly unfair; Authors and directors are often more guilty parties. The real problem of "The Lonely Lady" is that it looks more sensitious than the original textbook and does not help with it. <br /> <br /> The screen is infinite for this photo, but the story may have been better illustrated with the script better, tauter directions and really capable acting can be a personal decision matter. After it has been released, I will determine whether I am evaluating my ratings for my audience, or on how successful the movie is to achieve it. My personal rating for this would be two to ten; But in some cases this film probably provides what has been done for its sponsors, and on this basis, the quality rating of four will be reasonable for ten. To be in a charitable mood and to make it clear that I am not blaming Piya for frustration, I will give an IMDB rating four.
