I want to give this movie 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies so budget that they are good. An intelligent cricketer Nenja scarecrow who can implement such giant cobs as lethal surgery ... definitely fits this 'budget genius' system. The depth of the film certainly twists and twists and implementing it, the audience drives really vague to keep the edge of their seats ... Ni√±a ... puberty-stricken ...

I can really say that 'you can dig it' and recommend movies like Frankfish if you enjoy such ridiculous horror. <br /> <br /> (Did they smoke!
