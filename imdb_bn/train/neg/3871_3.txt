When I see a low budget movie, I try to be very motivated. I applied a big budget vs. independent and low budget productions to apply a low weight. I hope around big budget productions and flawlessness from their studio. So I applied the strict standards of major studio releases. But this movie was just an ugly. Duration The courtyard was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as high school senior, who had no ineligible intention to resolve. Her character or her performance dragged you into her world that did not have enough depth. Also, to make this movie more mysterious, some scenes did not set illumination mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Another disappointing film that I can only give three points.
