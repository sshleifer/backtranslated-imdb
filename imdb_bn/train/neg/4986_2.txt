Everyone who wants to be an editor will see this movie! It shows you every mistake about not allowing a movie to be edited! My grandma could do better than that! But this is not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's really bad that I can not write a sentence without a surprise!) If the first episode? Les Visiteurs' was a good family comedy with fun comedy and culture dialogue, but this sequence is the first one to dupe a poorly received. The fun part can be counted in one hand and possibly half. Clavier's role is playing more than ever at the beginning, trying to act like Robin Lemarizer (because he is replacing her) but is that remarkable? Lemarian Lemarizer, Robin Robin! Muriel Robin can be funny on stage, even in this movie because he is not acting to act. I know that anyone who was good at the role should be difficult to replace (Cesar's award for his role in Lemarasi's first film) but he made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, he played ?? Lemarasi played her role! For the story, it's much more! Of course, we knew at the end of the first movie that there would be a signal, but Poyer and Clovier should try to write more simple stories like the first episode. Gags are repetitive, pillow and deja-vi. No, really, there are 3 fun stuff in it. The only good thing can be the costume and some special effects. So there are only 2 reasons to look at this: 1) If you want to learn how to edit the movie wildly, 2) If you want to waste your time or if you really need one? 2/10
