Many agree, the Origin artist is a beautiful anime. The music, the graphics and the world are fantastic and it really stands above other modern animated works. However, if you are looking more than that, I recommend looking no where else. The beauty stops short of its appearance, and it really comes down to the plot and the characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and short and the people are flat, sometimes corny, and do not actually work. There is no mention of plot hole and plot hole ... So, briefly, O my merciful, I have never seen beautiful scenery like Anime; And oh my merciful, it's good ... -People-people do not do that. It has taken a giant step ahead of graphics and music animation, but it has slipped a few steps during bad characterization, and unfortunately, there are no such steps ...
