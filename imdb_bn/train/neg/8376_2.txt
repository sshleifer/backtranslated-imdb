"Little Man", now DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It is a story smaller than the midgut criminal directed by Marlon Wions, who hides a diamond in a lady after a respect. He and his companion Tracy cook Moroni Marlon as a child and a gifted plan to plant him in the house of the lady. Then she can get all the jewelry back and behave like a baby through "Home Alone" or "Child's Play". I was amazed at how much humor in this movie was. Curiosity has been done many times in other places, that they are not tricky or fun. I think that if the film is not used by CGI and Marlon's face is cut short, then the film can be more fun. This actor was fun like Mini-Mi, watching deleted scenes (minus CGI), but they chose a different route. Some kaymoos and Tracy Morgan create some funny scenes ... letting your rental rental rent fee let you have some real laughs in these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
