The comment of "Eliz7212-1" has been circulating "head nail" for Turkey for this program. But for William Shatner's "Covart" and "Dancing", it's hot (yes, the dancing symbol is necessary for the bill). This show will be a great sign on SNL or MAD TV - and it rates some stars to show the shotner, or it looks like a new height "camp" - whether it's role or self-like But the man is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls who are in the cube area with scrolling of the game information, they will be very lucky to cancel this turkey - as long as it is revitalized with the Whiskey-A-C-Go genre, the demand for the revival of high-cagely young women Once more with <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the first contestant, who was annoying and literally "post," still a fortune, through a fourth The division has gone away with million or so. The second competitor is a bit more intelligent, but who will be lucky to get 1000 dollars in Joopardi!, He has issued the necessary card to answer a special question - which he does not know, and as a result, goes away with the jilak. <br /> <br /> These game shows, which provide lengthy rewards for length, and sometimes awards, are a cheap effort overall to try to hide the audience. Even if the host gives good compensation and they give six figures on an average, I think income may be favorable on revenue - since you do not have any sectic cast where some of them have received six or seven statistics, with each episode, with some large residues <br /> <br /> But I suspect even good people wear thin before long. This one has already quite quite reached these points. I think his sacrifices, especially James Spadder and others of "Boston Legal", can provide us with the satisfaction amount of our Bill Setter offer. <br /> <br /> Again, the above described bits are suitable to look hoots and prains, probably one time; That should be enough.
