Well, what can I say? <br /> <br /> "We know how to wake sleep" almost impossible - "postman", "the dinghy master", "marilyn" ", and so fourth, this is the only bad movie in history that I I have seen it completely and that, ladies and ladies, is really impressive, because I have seen many bad films. <br /> <br /> This great composition in modern cinema has two discrete parts, which is very boring Between the feeling and the transformed plot, the photographer was forced to accept the anti-depression to be abandoned and survived, and to talk about how Quantum physics supports their new generation of pseudo-vision. The day began to focus on this and Kenyie's opinion, but this film is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who are funny and a large part of good weeds, then this film is for you, otherwise, stay away. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the first time, "what Sleeping You know, "My first hit is that it is edited and arranged together by similar people who shoot for cheap wedding. The camera, complete with pink heart effect, sparkles across the screen across the computer, and other mixed silliness. Who is a mystery to me somewhere near the theater release of a theater this theater I guess this is what you g too. The film was full of Chess GCI, the choices you can make on me or me through over-the-counter video editing software on your computer, but never because it is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The script _obviously_ was written by anyone with no writing experience. Not only did all the letters and conversations be understood and narrowed beyond belief, but the "writer" felt that they forced every relevant information or camouflage to throw information, which was the first thing in this movie that your throat was. Well, given the target audience, that might not have been an idea too bad. The main character, for example, spent half a movie popping up. Obviously, it was not considered credible enough, so there are at least a few dialogs that specifically mention its anti-anxiety spheres, only if the spectators can not connect to their infected pain and hardship when they feel when they take white white roses . Acting ... Well, I saw good acting in Ed Wood, or not, it's not a big deal. The hack, when I was small, was a small game when I was 12 much inspirational acting than this. It really did. <br /> <br /> The story here and there is a bunch or random teacher head, a strange combination of cookie scientists, dog doctors and self-propagated mysteries, how and how much physics involved in the experience of the life of the supposedly male or female "Explanation" for creating its own reality. Actually, you can see, the probable field of a bunch of different possibilities, and the observer is set to stone only once it is chosen to focus. What happens when multiple observers do not say it, but then again take care of it. Listen, meditate, observe, and you will be Allah, and no one contradicts this kind of rational and ancient issues, critical thinking, logic, etc. Everyone is immediately dismissed as people are stuck in their way and unable to achieve them. "Paradigm shift" and "Go down the rabbit hole". In addition, Heidelberg's uncertainty principle is a positive proof of alternative reality, parallel universe, and such evidence with permission. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit hole, the analogy enters the film. All these people keep talking about going down the rabbit hole. I'm not sure what they are saying or seeing what to do, but one thing I'm sure is that it involves sexual relations in some way. Indeed, the movie is _extremely_ anti sexual. Throughout life, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and illuminated. <br /> <br /> In any case, with the interaction, the main character draws a similarity with the magic symbol and acquires the similarity and knowledge. , And to move around with a stupid-looking look that is glowing on the eyes rather than starting with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'd like two hours back in my life. Here are some random quotes that I can remember: <br /> <br /> "I think it has become very real to me as untrue, and what I thought was real, often Much less real unreal. "- Talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take to build an erection for a man? It just thinks that there is no change outside, all the changes are in. There is still an eatery" - Some are self-aware mysteries, schools of their own knowledge Main <br /> <br /> [I look at you in the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you, you fat! You are ugly! I have you!" - The main character, the fat and the ugly photographer.
