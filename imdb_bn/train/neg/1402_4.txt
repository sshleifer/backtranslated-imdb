Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Completely clich√©s, highly anticipated, unreal and sometimes stupid. But if you are not good at anything, it offers 40 minutes of simple, neutral entertainment, endless beauty in men and women muscles and very good photography of spectacular Hawaiian scenes. On the other hand, if you are looking for something more than that, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and anyway, if you ever know something about a hotel or running, you have two options: 1. Perfect Feel the stupidity and show how the hotel business represents, and every 2 minutes you feel sick. 2. See it like science fiction comedy like me, come back, relax and smile it!
