I felt the renasid aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the players had some terrible dialogue and highly suspicious signs of the prestigious line up. The camera work was experimental in some places and although the director was trying to publish it, it simply became more difficult to see it. One of the most annoying aspects of Ranasid aluminum is the complete use of descriptions throughout the film, almost all the plot points to the viewers. There was nothing to do with the best performance acting. Probably most of all have come from Danny Bir's most credible performance, although the stereotypical office secretary plays in confession. Do not go under any circumstances and do not see this movie unless you find a reason to sleep in sleep, but there is a better way to spend your hard-working cash.
