I gave this completely a four in a historic context. It was thought to have been lost for many years until the exit of blue color in the showtime in early nineties. <br /> <br /> MARS works straight guy and Larry and Carlie both. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it was something to work on a farm. I'm not very sure because the plot was not so low that my memory really does not matter. I vaguely remember it's a western music comedy. Even Stooge seems to be going through the speed. There is nothing here to recommend here as a whole. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan in Stuttgart, do not bother. If you're a Stoug fan then stick to the shortcut.
