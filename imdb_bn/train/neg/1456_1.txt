Simply put, this is a simple and one dimensional film. Title, The Rise to Evil, you have to say that it will not try to do anything deeply with Hitler's character. Rather, from the first minute of the film, we are seeing bad boy playing the baby Hitler with background music, we have given a view of Hitler which presents him as Cartoni Superbowl, probably coming out of the TV show on Saturday morning. Whether Hitler really was bad or whether Hitler really wants to make this movie, but does anyone need any movie to think of Hitler as bad? Finally, making him such a horribly bad character is both annoying and confusing (one must definitely ask that the film is a cold, fascinating character inspired by a nation to follow him or named as the best person of the year). It was a great opportunity for the film to accept a person who did the most horrific work in the 20th century and tried to get into her mind. Instead, it is basically right, "Hey! Hitler was bad! Just thought you might want to know ..." Again over. The great satiricality is that this image was still attacked in order to present a sympathetic view of the character. Give me a break.
