Just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - if you do not have sleep problems, avoid all costs. It is filled with a film promotion - it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima Man Amor" and all the encouragement from it is here. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai Story Line - Smoky Robinson and Mircus '' The gain in the view in the east mirror '' stretched from 3 minutes to more than 2 hours, but filled with repetition. This film for butt pain pain ranks with benches at the Methodist Church when my parents drag me to a kid. I want 2+ hours back in my life. Julian Hernandez's promoter commented on the comment as "controversial" - it is only true for the effect of the drug addiction on the film.
