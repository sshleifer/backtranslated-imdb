If completely clear, responsive, self-motivated, anti-civilization, civilization is appealing to you but this is the ideal film.

The only escape from the horrors of civilization is the abundance of old screams (children) and children's repetition (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the wall, which makes Yupias a rave party - again wood (naturally ...). A first film displays all the weaknesses, and more without the addition.
