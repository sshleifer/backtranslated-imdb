This movie was terrible. Plot sucked, acting was bad, editing was inactive and this movie wants me to poke my eyes. I was in time while I was returning to this movie. The scene of the balloon was stupid, Mormon jokes were really old, soundtrack sucked, I did not see chemistry in two leads, it was stereotypes, stupid local "celebrity" camo's montage Most notable was Dell "I'm going to drive as soon as I want .." Computer stupid. The worst thing is that these actors forced themselves to play spiritually and even they even ruined it. This movie helps the mainstream LDS beliefs of Hollywood in creating long lines of unbelievable efforts. Ie rm, church ball, etc. etc. I would like to see this movie and instead play the head in a brick wall. You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show.
