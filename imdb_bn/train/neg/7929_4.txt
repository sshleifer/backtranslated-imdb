I think you might find it interesting in Sci-Fi and Awesome stuff. Acting was ok but not great. It seems that two pregnant girls are fifteen year old girls, but they are probably played by older actresses who made 26 people at that time. Plot is okay, but the story jumps closer, you have guessed whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed in between two. Catholic church has been portrayed as a secret group to investigate events that happen only with that belief. So what were the two girls protesters? Care for the Catholics? Therefore something contrived. Who knows, some days the Catholic Church teaches what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, you do not think anything is missing.
