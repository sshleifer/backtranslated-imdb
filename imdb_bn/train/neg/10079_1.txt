At the age of 11 Greece was like 2 crack. It was a classified, shameful, euphoric, and powerful addictive experience. My sister and I will look at it, look at it again, and do not meet again until we go out or get confused and unfavorable for standing one another. So, if you are an 11-year-old girl, and you review this film as "shining" or "fun" or "good in real greece", then your elite teenager blames hormones and you can be sure that this illogical <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />, its production, distribution, and / or cost. <br /> <br /> For criticism, why am I now honoring the film? <br /> <br /> 1. A well executed song, song narrative should move or character should develop. With Greece 2, with few controversial exceptions, the music is vulgar in vain. Most of the songs are displayed in an extra and common way about sex ("Today's Night," "Reproduction," "Make It For Our Country," and "Prowlin") seems to involve innuendo about sex film's characters or themes. Plus, all music shows unreasonably stupid and even the greatest talent of Caste's ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be bad and at least not quite a favorite, they are all boring wussy-dufus-loser. Finally, when Johnny Nogerely jackets off the holy birds and brings him into the gang, Michael tricks him into kissing on the ground, spitting on him and tearing any part of his body by touching any part of his body. But of course, he admits it as gold because they have a bigger honor than being one with T-birds despite a bunch of violent muscles. <br /> <br /> Since Michael is beautiful, intelligent, duplicate, rich and above all the average (despite his companion's nepotism), it is probable that Stephanie will finally embrace him when he reveals himself as a man behind a mask. On the other hand, Stefani is a slovenly, slack-jawed, smacking bubble gum, wearing dirty sweatshirt, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. Apart from so beautiful (I guess), he harbors no likable features, thus, the viewers are not allowed to justify any for Michael's drawings. <br /> <br /> I can go and go, but I I did not want to mention the total inferiority of its predecessors, because there are so many crankers who think it is unfair to compare this comparison. I'll say this though, you think that you want to restore the world for the old times: Greece 2 is your first kiss to revive the experience. Just 32 you now and a snot-nosed 13-year-old baby kiss with acne and slab braces. The magic has gone and you have left to feel dirty and bored. Trust me
