I saw 7.5 IMDb rating of this movie and on this basis I decided to watch this movie rental rent. He said that he saw it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried aloud loudly for the first time." Perhaps 7.5 out of 10 out of the other Bollywood movies, but I am not more than 3 in comparison to all other films in my life. Any movie where I can guess forever, what will be next to me is a good one. Characters are incredible, how the law is not realistic and how their motives are transformed. It's not dramatic and the songs are all great at all. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of neutrality. All emotions are very overdone and thus are not all realistic. Any emotions or ties between characters that are at least bits fine must be magnified with an unnecessary song. I think I understand that the relationship between father and son is more than friendship between parent and child, not by expressing the song for five minutes. The stupid comic relief done to the sunny track was not funny or necessary (we get it, Laxman is not a sharp tool in Shade). If a movie tries to discard tears with the most hackneydid, it does not make sense, it's just a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Too many plot holes to count. Initially the movie was fascinating and intelligent that Bollywood movies are with people who do not see them intensely but it is only tedious. It takes lots of skill to create a film that is fun and entertaining and the best way to do this is usually not all the fun part of the first half of the film, and finally it is not part of all the heartfelt part. <br /> <br /> ***** Spinner Over ***** Perhaps I have seen that it was far deeper than other Bollywood movies, but mostly it is not. I spent much more sunny days in the film's ignorance than that was supposed to be fun. I did not tear off a single tears and I did not like it, rather I was overwhelmed with a feeling of hatred at a dramatic ending effort. If you want to look good, I do not recommend this movie, if you want to see a Bollywood movie then I am sorry.
