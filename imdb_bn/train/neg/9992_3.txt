Ah yes, the sai-fi channel made the film as intense. I especially followed the crash and took the scene, where the survivors searched for matches, burned at least half a dozen fireworks? With no obvious reason ?? At the various points of the ruins. The fire started to be a major theme across the whole. They search for lighter and dead bodies for matches and finally find a box, burns fire for 12 every day, but no one gathers wood. Then when the body of the breed was damaged, did he use it for the skin? I mean these guys were frozen? Well maybe not Hey ate despite the seemingly low temperature. Perhaps this is mine, but even in a completely unbelievable story (even if none of the survivors were alive, or had finally heard of a disgusting snowman), if you care for little things, bigger deals will be more acceptable. Oh, what do you do with the rest of the movie in 1972? And revolver, it will not be enough hot, concrete and fire to hold in his hand. Gimme a break Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another bright Canadian grass. And, with little ridicule, as coach of Ed Marinero. <br /> <br /> I can add good, rabbits they can eat (despite showing it like chicken) is not a ray, but Lagomorph Now if it was a beef (or a rat) but it was a ray, but it still looked like chicken. And none of the authors miss a real opportunity "It just as a taste ..." a real opportunity
