I love the book Henry James and there was no exception in Washington Square. I was very excited to get a new movie based on the title book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and good enough to play a limited role in Ben Chaplin. Albert Finney is miscast and does not carry a good role. I wanted to impress Maggie Smith ... or rather his stupid, unclear role. The latest issue in this latest issue and what lacking it is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, stretched and seemingly annoying movie. There is a break in the dialogue more than the pinter play. In the book, I took a deep look at the Catherine Slipper and her life. The movie just had the opposite effect. I like to see his mother look at Maurice in sexual attraction. Eeeeeeeeeek YUK <br /> <br /> If you do not sleep then it is a special snooze. Do not see it if you are depressed. <br/> <br /> Of course, the role of the title "Hair" was exceptional with Olivia Haveland and Montgomery Clift. Actor who played his father, was unaware, worried as a cold father ... still hatred his dead wife and hated Catherine. The film was not loyal to the book, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. Why i have no doubt
