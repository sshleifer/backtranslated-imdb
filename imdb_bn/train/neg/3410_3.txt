Yes, this film is going on to the children's camp and it's fair enough to see the kids meet each other and learn the ropes. Then they introduced jeans, a robot that probably did not exist in 1986 because they have nothing to do with artificial intelligence now. The child became friendly with the robot and the robot shot him and provided a group of other kids in this camp with limited oxygen and places them outside the radio, which could not reach the signal. These camps are not very fun because these kids are provided with actual training and trainers can get all their failures or not to do the right things. It's a rest day, they have for fun, still do not become astronauts, just like their space flight experience camps are not military-like. However, you will see a fairly basic role in Joaquin Phoenix. So in the end, in some cases a movie to try realistic, but with the introduction of jeans and other things, the children played the role of the leading fight alliance in the battlefield aliens, in anything else, the movie is more enjoyable for me. Perhaps for some others, who wants to cut off Cape Keaspoce except for some strange super-alien creatures.
