It is virtually impossible to follow this piece of holes. The word gets worse, the quality of the picture gets worse from the bad to the worse! Things seem to be apparent because of the character and disappear. Was the director suffering from a huge brain injury during his generation? <br /> <br /> Keeping the bad movie aside, the story is simply sickness bad. * If you like rape, murder and spontaneity, this is your right lane. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough, you can enjoy real people's clips. I have seen almost all but some brain swelling have stopped seeing. I have never seen a movie that has made me feel embarrassed and dirty.
