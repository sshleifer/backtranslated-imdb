It was a good effort but it is very provocative and bothersome to rise above low budget trepping. The virtual set utilization works around but at some points it fails unfortunately. I guess the small budget has made good use. I just like the story and the acting was the best. There are a lot of places where you notice what they were watching and if they really hit those signs, it would be great but they would not do it. Confusing and incredible stories. Bad dvd transfer too. I do not need a lot for watching me sit and watch a movie. This was me close. It was very annoying. I can make slow movies. But just draw some attention to them. Apparently, story-based, acting, etc. It was lacking in all the sections, so it has never been associated with an exciting experience. Maybe the creator's next attempt will be better.
