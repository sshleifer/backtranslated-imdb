This is such a bad film because it is written very badly and it is the complete fault of Robert James Waller, a writer of the Madison County Bridges writers. Writing is bad because the plot is perfectly triangle and the conversation is wood and impossible. A failed couple? A black American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with whom she is ashamed? A powerful, self-managed criminal, and after some events (most horrific violent scenes) show the warm side of the murderers, leaving the cruel partner for the murderer, who is worse, before seeing him more clearly than before. This film can not help anybody succeed, even if Scott Glenn's killer is not a murderer, take offensive objectionable levity of Giovana Zakaria as Loose and lost Keitel's starwat performance, even CIA expert was not appointed to identify the killer. A serious waste of time.
