In this film, Josh reminds me of Cornwald's 'Act' to remind me of my new TV production class, where there was a chance to prove how strange it was! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I try to synopsize this wannabe comedy. The joke is sophomoric and telegramed. Delivery painfully bad. Sekie !!!!!!! The writing is easily dead. This is similar to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> This movie is painful to see, as seen on the Saturday Night Live skit one-half hour (Belusi's post). <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and want my money back !!!
