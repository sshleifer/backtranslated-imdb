I was reading this Thornton Wilder game last year. I was forced to sit through this weak translation on the screen. Tell me, this is not a horrible game, it can easily be overcome, but people deserve it a good shot. Acting was really lacking, visible - honest to God - it was designed outside a cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. Since it may not be worse, the quality of the word is frustrating ... whenever an actor speaks, this mind-narrow 'lightning' is there ... and I could not help but noticed that chemistry between George and Emily, good, non- Existing All of the actors seem to be very uncomfortable. There is no music. It is black and white, which will be fine, but it will remove more pinch. In any case, I think that if you are going to create a point to watch this movie, I do not really mention but do not keep your expectations high. The game, such as Stalwart, is probably better.
