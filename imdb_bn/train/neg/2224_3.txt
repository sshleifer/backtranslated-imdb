I saw it at about 7 years old. I think what I think was a vague outline of what happened. After 15 years, it seems now that I have kept everything in mind with the precision because it seems that the author can not create the outline of the story. There is no plot in this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no back story, no character arcs, nothing Good people do good because things get worse, when bad guys just do bad things. A strangely sunny part when you feel important that someone dies and nobody at least cares. They just shrug their shoulders and moved. There is no dialogue at all. You lose 70% of the film's scenes and running scenes. See it because you want to see some good animations and for some other reason. Or if you want to see harmful hot cartoon clad (or short dressed hot cartoon dudes) dressed up.
