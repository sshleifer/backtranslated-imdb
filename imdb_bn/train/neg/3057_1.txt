You have to think that those who made this movie think what they think; Perhaps they meant it as a metaphor of the third world about capitalist greed and explicit use. No . . They just were not very good. The same production company has created a more annoying version of "Little Red Riding Hood", which indicates the wolf's strangers with our hero, PedroFilia's strangers. (Perhaps it was the motivation of "freeway.") Returns to "Santa Claus": Instead of the North Pole, Jolie Old St. Nicholas Geosynchronous resides in a planet orbital ("shadow of MST3K"); Instead of the elves are made by selected children from his toy world; And she had sophisticated spy tools to check that the kids are naughty and beautiful. The result is like an Orwellian Outdoor Sweat Shop. It's enough for you to close christmas forever. These and other low-cost Mexican children's films were dubbed in English and were widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960's; In the history of America, the 60-year-old has not been in this inconsistent era. The children of the children who were forced to bear such "family" films like children, are all eager to be revolutionaries.
