And hire a good awful movie. The authors have never seen horror movies before, and what he has written is what he wrote that was not chiched and hackneyed, and he was meticulously met with movies like "Scrum" and "Vibrant Movie". <br/> <br/> Sometimes the most forest and boring dialogue is written in the scary bits. Fool "We're Going to Promotion" Junk I wanted to close my ears off. Frankly speaking, "The Hills" has good conversations. <br /> <br /> There is no need to create this movie. The top lady is reluctant and I "her?" Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really? <br /> <br /> All characters work stupidly with police. (Cover the place between two groups, front and back! A sleeping police was not sitting in his car, waiting for his throat to fall) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He at least killed everyone who wants to die without problems. No resistance to hunting (or door). Someone has no idea of ​​any protection or return to fight (or flip the security lock at the hotel's door door). People are like mentally disabled sheep. By <br /> <br />, if you're a cow's fan, you'll be disappointed. All killings are kept in offscreen and - ahem - tastefully done. (So, for you!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only cliche absence was the cats that always pop out of such movies. "Oh kitty, you're afraid of me, I thought you were a killer." <br /> <br /> And finally, when the killer is dead - all right, let's take this easy and most obvious choice. Graduate <br /> <br /> The audience was talking back to the tongue and throughout the screen. It was really fooling and believing enough to be quite frantic. Do not encourage to create such lazy film. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and whatever - there is no king or queen crown, no tear has no bucket of blood.) <BR /> <br /> So save your original papers and some Hire "Kerry" or "Friday 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scrum" or "Scary Movies" (of whom) to get along with the original twists.
