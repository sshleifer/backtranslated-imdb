I do not know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment I got bored. In all possible decisions, they can rise to the mountains, why they decide, which is the most dangerous? Why do criminals do stupid works, even though they get huge amount from a bank and stay away with them? Why is not the main criminal helicopter's land, Stallone fired, takes money and flies with a dog? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I want to give this film for 5 great works and great landscape scenes, but due to the unreasonable behavior of the characters, I can give 1 point to this movie ...
