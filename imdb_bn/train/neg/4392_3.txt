A young scientist is trying to continue his father's work on the resurrection of the body. His sympathetic mother believed that he killed his father and watched his progress for his evil deeds. When a young doctor uses a large creature using reptile DNA and his arm is conveniently closed after a few minutes, he injeces himself with his formula and raises a new killer hand ... It has been acknowledged that special effects on "torn bands" are very good and Awesome, but the rest of the film is awful. This stacked hand behaves like a snake and kills a few. Great deal Acting is not medium and final.
