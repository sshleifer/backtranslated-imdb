This is the great start of anime series: interesting stories, exciting events, interesting characters, render nicely and executed. Everything is not well explained, fitting a Orthodox carrot in front of the audience, tempting the viewer to see each subsequent episode. But imagine the frustration of finding the science-fi thriller / monster robot adventure that is simply a retreat for psychologists and Christian religious promotional exploitation. If you want to hear "you're okay. It's good for you." After engaging with negative slogans and negative emotions of the character, it's for you. If you want a good Sci-fi Flick which is just fun to watch, forget it. The original, and the alternate end both were extremely disappointing to me. All that, and this movie was very promotional.
