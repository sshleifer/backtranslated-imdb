Who is me No, I'm not kidding. What does this actually say for the video? <br /> <br /> Plot; Short version: Beautiful woman standing near sunny. Because of this, some people kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Find the Airlle ... Where is the Airlle ... Can not find the Airlle ..." She is your right behind, you are stupid. <br /> <br /> About this awesome little space opera What seems to be said mostly has already been told, it seems to be seen. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Then they turn off in a similar way. Each scene is broadcast approximately fifteen minutes in advance. Perhaps it was a drawing of the straw that most of the viewers were checking screen time and greater pay. Alien virus / Holoram / VR die / Glyt seems physically powerless and does nothing. Why can not she have a computer instead of her "Teleporting Vampire" routine? (In fact, if he is a vampire or if he is more attractive to stand in front of people, he would have been more attractive than he used to do. These people are enough to kill each other.) <br /> <br / > It is not really a space flick. The 1950s Easy Rider Trill, Film Nir's Night Club scene, even a fantasy-landed beach comedy, has many shots on the old Western path, which has no real depth or even an idea. Night club scene black and white, of course. Worked with "Wizard of Oz". Here, so does not work well. It's probably a good thing, that few shots do not show the place they are dull, stupid. You probably cry during that moment, especially that "floating ship", which shows about three inches long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to Billy de Williams, those who are really frustrated in this work and look at the loss ... <br /> <br /> When some of them are seen with friends, some very "loud" silence is created, Especially when there is a curiosity one-la Inner (French-kiss kiss kissing her about ...) All right? Probably not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls get "murdered", which means nothing, because they are not realistic to start. Well, the other "characters" are not, but beside that point. Haha <br /> <br /> <br /> What's so funny is that the video scene that this scene enjoys is crane-awful-alien looking things (Green filter has added more on it to add more to it .. .hoo ... green appearance), which does not have anything to do with Android and finally nothing else after the death. <br /> <br /> I noticed another outstanding deal. Whenever there is a blast (at least my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes very pixelated. I do not mean a little pixel, I mean big size block screens size 1 / 16th. How nice.
