In this very low budget (I have seen home movies made with good production value) Australian voice "The Burning" and "Friday 13th" are off of Rif Off, plans to create a music video in a band houseboat. They are burned before years of dalked by a serial killer. This movie has also been announced as the 'Greatest Australian Film of All Time' on its DVD promotional ingredients. It's just selling point! Complete and utter garbage in every significant. There are some chocolate here and there for bad movie lovers, but it still wants me to burn my Retinas. <br /> <br /> Candy: A quick flash of bitty titties immediately in a flax shower scene <br /> <br /> My grade: F
