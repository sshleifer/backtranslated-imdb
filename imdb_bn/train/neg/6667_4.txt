Until it was the subject of Ed Norton's face hair, it was worth enjoying. Without revealing any conspiracy information - he was playing a light beard in the afternoon, but the same evening went to the beard and it was very luxurious. It was a beard that went far enough than Moses. Later, on a dark night in the open, the torch went away and he became clean. It would not be an option to stop shave where it was on an occasion. This continuation of separation has completely confused me with the rest of the film and has destroyed any credibility in the past. Also, I saw Cuba's long standing solo in his bedroom reminded the taxi driver De Niro. Even if it is meant to be a tribute, it was too thick for this audience.
