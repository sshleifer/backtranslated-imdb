So long awaited movie .. But it has frustrated me and my friends who went to visit the movie the very first day .. From the trailer it saw an action movie, but it turned out to be an out-and-out comedy (a bad comedy). But these professional actors played a subject worthy of credit, they very well completed the part of their movie. Good acting, but I do not think that can save the movie. India shoots nicely. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) Were all associated with color, all right. Yet the intrinsic beauty shots of these places were shot, where I wanted to know where those places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> Action sequences were shot very carefully, no one was able to create stunt head And tail, they used Akki (Akshya Kumar) very well but could have done a lot better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best animation scene in the worst of 90 movies in recent movies (I think the car should be 'Flying flying flying lake'). <br /> <br /> and the movie name is mentioned from about 20 to 30. Minutes, just make sure to forget the names of the movie I think.
