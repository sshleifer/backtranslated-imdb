This movie is one of the most wildly depicted illustrations in history. Terribly wrong, this film has done nothing to pay tribute to thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous slaves, which caused the tragedy of Japan's death. This bridge, described by Japanese engineer, will be built on "the body of white man". Such unexpected horror by Japanese prisoners is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself is not right to the original bridge. The actual bridges were not made of wood, steel and concrete were built. What are the survivors living today? They hate the movie and all that is represented in it. Their friends are hungry, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. The movie is seriously hit in the light of this dark period of those who do not die due to frustration, hunger or disease.
