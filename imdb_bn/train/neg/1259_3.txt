Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic is completely destroyed by a cheap, shallow, impact-heavy and unnecessary remake. The original "Apps Planet" was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very intelligent message. This is a film that almost entirely focuses on conversations, which seems very slow but it was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has gone a long way with most of the conversations. Instead of a great movie we get incredibly stupid two hour charging movies. The dialog is merely minimized, the character's interaction and development do not exist, and it is extremely difficult to determine what is happening in most cases. Instead, we can get a bunch of uninterrupted action scenes, some harmful fun one-liners and some very pure quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing to mention about this movie is that it looks pretty fantastic. Apes's make-up is fantastic, and set and background is very nice. However, the "Apps Planet (2001)" is a very shallow and simple film, which is not confused with the paper's thin character, stupid dialogue and almost complete unrealistic plot. Please turn Hollywood into superb blockbusters and turn them into great movies. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, there is no sense in the end. <br /> <br /> * **** They, mainly for visuals <br /> <br />
