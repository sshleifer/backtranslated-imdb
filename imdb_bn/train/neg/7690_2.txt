Anyone who provides a good review of this movie must have something to do with his creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. Acting harsh, stock generic soundtrack ridiculous, the direction is silent and all the weird, the teacher is not really all interesting (all the more awkward progress of student's blatant progress). The creative minds created behind this trash, such as narrow frenzy should be isolated and spread to prevent further exposure. I'm sure some hungry kids in Africa can use meaningless money in this project. Hell, funds saw more enlightened motives for burning a crack-addiction; At least someone will get some entertainment out of it. For the only reason it did not give me terminal illness, I give the film two.
