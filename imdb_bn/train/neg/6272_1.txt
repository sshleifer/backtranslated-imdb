In front of a crowd of people, a biker punk with a cycler fruit on a pinball table, then tried to rape the virgin girl Jessica (Debra Hunter) who is in love with another disorder (from Date Midchef, Pitti Cemetery), Assistant Assistant Colleague! Returning home, rivalry is the sex with the men from bathing bath, shower, clothes changes and bars. A small silver ball (part of the test) flies in the face of the victim and turns them into drooling, killer zombies! <br /> <br /> If it's not enough for you to entertain, there's a ridiculous theme song ("Nightmare Imagination"), Roller Skating, some serious Daisy Duck and a mental hand doll (!?) which is just "dangerous!"
