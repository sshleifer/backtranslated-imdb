If I did not live with such a person, then I would have left the film through half. The film is based on actual facts, but it does not seem so real at the top. I have some mental backgrounds, quarreling with a lot of psychiatrists, and seriously insane people are known, so I do not think that such people exist. But in the film, the only character who consistently believed humans were Agusten's father (Alec Beldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kadine). (Even though Ivan Rachel Wood was an impressive wrapper - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). There were some fun moments, but the overall voice of the movie was fantastic, bizarre and nasty. An outstanding cast a waste! I saw to go through their turn, I felt like I was watching the classes played. This credit is brought home, while some people are not sitting there sitting, talking about. Those moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
