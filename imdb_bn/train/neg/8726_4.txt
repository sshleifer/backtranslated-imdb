First of all I want to say that this film is more suitable than four stars. I gave it four stars because this 86-minute movie for me seems like always 22 hours and is not busy enough to sit through it. However, "The Big Oliver River" (calling my DVD title) is better than reducing the movie of your average nature. <br /> <br /> A tourism center in southeast Asia is just open and trying to manipulate wildlife around the use of natives. The mother's nature came to take revenge as a huge demon god cruuna. But animals are not the only thing to think about tourists and main characters (a photographer and resort staff), and the netizens are misreading the wrong way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good musical score and well-done adventure / horror stories. But the collector itself, the main attraction of the film, is probably looking for the fake. Some ties in his jaw are good but this is what we will see. Many remote water underwater makes it painfully obvious that how we really deal with is a fiance toy that you might find at the Zoo souvenir shop. But residents are not trustworthy, if they are not reliable. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a movie that will not give you non-stop thrills, but if the creator gives a shot and a good reference. And like many animal films, it ends with a very high body count. It has a lot of good jungle scenery. Although acting below, but those who were expected to be good at it, Ah? <br /> <br /> is better than its latest American opponent "primitive", but it can not be compared with "Jaws". But remember it can not be engaging in a few points.
