Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a cliche-raided piece of junk. A high school comedy setup in a military training camp. I'm sorry these 1 stars did not give it what it was not worth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Especially if you do not have your wedding day, if the HEPO (military police) will not come to get you. The actor felt quite embarrassed during this scene, because the scene was not so easy as the scene did not work. You can understand it in their voices. Even if they were not such bad actors, they would not have been able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> The next person will have to exercise in his marriage case. No, she had no time to get her first uniform. Man, this great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are girls in camp - exciting - even a model, although it does not look great - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I suspect in Hollywood that they will call a single line in B movie. <br /> <br /> All right girls girls! Now this is having fun. Girls are kept on the same floor, so we can kiss them at night! In fact they will be placed in a different building a quarter-mile away, separated by two fences with flute cables. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of tanks that we can use for our spare time for fun, of which we have a lot of money. No, the tank is not locked, and the ignition key is inserted. No one will hear the engine, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are bouts of sex scenes and references and all the below the waste. We need those who need sexual harassment German movies as well. Switzerland is a market for any feature film very small. OK! <br /> <br /> One sex scene in the kitchen! Of course, those benefits are never locked. The rural Routines can be as much as they get, the villagers <br /> <br /> At the end of an idiot flickr, people try to kill the poor man by shooting the mafia! Because he has left his motherland! Sure I bought it, the Italianians are the way - a jealous group (not). <br /> <br /> Bad people try to do it in open air with two dozen eyewitnesses. Do not have a dark lane on the night. Again, the basis of military training (where shooting with live MMOs) is open to the public, anyone can drive freely or walk. There is no thing as guard or fencing. <br /> <br /> The good captain prevented this law when the Italianians launched the rocket in the car. The blasts knock fianc√©e madly off men and their feet hit. There is no distance to 40 feet when the car is pushed to push. It's a comedy, remembering <br /> <br /> All right. It's a comedy, I got, and I can live with that. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily get the way with this if it is sunny, side-splitting, fun, or entertaining, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately it is not anyone. It's just embarrassing. A rip off from an idiot American comedy. Subsequently, at least amateur artists were professionally done. <br /> <br /> This is quite annoying and predictable, the waste of time and energy, especially through the whole film, which I unfortunately did. to yawn.
