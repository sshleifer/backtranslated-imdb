With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this may have been a classic. Instead, it was a repetitive theory of all conspiracy theories, often in the case of JF murder, in 1979, which proceeded in a vaguely emerging plot about the murder of the fabled President Kegna in 1960. Many extraordinary characters have been lost because they are not paid enough - Sterling Hyden or Eli Wachch, for example, or asked to push them up loud - John Houston <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
