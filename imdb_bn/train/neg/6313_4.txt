From the perspective of the Caribbean community in the Well, we've made a movie in the UK's inner city, the last example I remember was the way to the included Babylon in 1980. So, when I heard that I had high expectations about Bullet Boy, a movie which has been touted as the British version of La Haine! Well la haine it's not! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment makes this film a reality which is delayed among other British films, but my concern is that this film is perhaps sadly over. <br /> <br /> The picture is cleverly dark in black in London, sadly black-and-black problems are increasing, but I'm worried that filmmakers now use type-casting in the plot, which is equally harmful against characters. Saul Dubbe was a great opportunity to create a film that can be entertaining and inspirational for all of us, but sadly misses and makes a movie that only strengthens the idea of ​​being a young black man in London, the only future violence and tragedy.
