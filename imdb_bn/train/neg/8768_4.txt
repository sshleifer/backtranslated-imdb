Now please do not start the names for me, such as "unwelcome", "weird" and more. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) There is no edit - I think J. P. Dutt fell in love with his project. Even the incision was 4 hours long - but it was amusement and gave a message. <br /> <br /> This is based on true facts and real people. It's nasty, but was the repetitive war scene really necessary? The focus on it shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep an eye on them all. <br /> <br /> There were songs about storm, loneliness, lover and related elements. There was a kiss conversation. Initially, it gave some relief from violence, but later became so neutral that someone could correctly predict the nature of future conversations. <br /> <br /> Why are the soldiers roaming like a lion in the jungle? The invisible enemy that was hidden somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, they expressed sympathy, but due to their insecurity, they felt so uncomfortable for their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was slow and the songs were animated but the movie did not match. Soundtracks are better than listening to them instead of movie. <br /> <br /> The actress was very happy: from seasoned veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn, everyone played to relative newcomers like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Khanna. Like a pro. Specifications of mood lightening when Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana are needed. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are bright ("from sweet to love .. !!") unreasonable / neutral ("Pakistan she is a Muslim, I am a poor man"). And all the MC, BCS, CS and F-words did not really need a wonderful spray made. <br /> <br /> Lock Kargil is trying to give the brave Indian soldiers a suitable creator, but it is very difficult and finally fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a good tribute.
