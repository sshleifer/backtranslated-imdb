Another movie based on madness, crazy scientist went worn-out clich√© madder The film focuses on a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring back the dead ... life is back. I know, I know ... you have never heard of it before! Of course, when all these movies go, the test becomes very, very wrong and creates a psychological, bloodthirsty creature. For this commitment setup, you would think it would be at least a bit suspenseful. Wrong Like many movies of this era, the concept is beautiful, but the death penalty and the script is in the middle. The worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes a cake) ... but not one gems, either.
