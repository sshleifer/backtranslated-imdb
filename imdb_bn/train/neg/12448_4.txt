Clint Eastwood is Bonco Billy, the leader of the Wild West Troop, among those six regular Misfits who also include a fight-to-break-even tour show. The seventh member of the group is Billy's assistant, but these women do not last long and the position is constantly open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Lock? Time at Eastwood's girlfriend). Miss Lily thinks that Doc (Skatman Crothers) has called him, he is a heir, who gets the property of his father's long death, if he gets married at the age of 30, so on the eve of that birthday, he is hit by cartoonism Geoffrey Lewis <br /> <br /> <br /> What is the plot of this photo? It's hard to tell There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lillia, but the problem is that he is so fierce and vulgar that he suddenly became 'one of the trumpets' for the first half of the movie, it is not only incredible, but visitors are careful about him past past. There is a long lasting deficit behind the Wild West show, but this issue is not really enough in the pair of combinations of the film. Because of Miss Lilly's famine, the rural is suffering from the west, she is spending her wealth on her luxurious life (she is wrongly considered dead by her family and the newspaper). But we really believe that he did not return to New York, and if he tries for something he is waiting for, <br /> <br /> <br /> This point of the film seems to be a leader of the family, the harmful one loving The bunch that hangs together becomes thick and thin. Is it a warm, vague film ?? Or try to be at least. <br /> <br /> On the way, Clint shows his skills with our guns, even if shooting a non-violent film, firing a bank robbery in a shooting. An old draft evasion charge in a gang is arrested; Billy Richard Local Sheriff The show's tent burned down; An orphan makes them a new one. But innumerable hypocrites do not make any plots. <br /> <br /> The contraction of the problem is acting, or its lack. As well as Scammon Crothers, supporting cast is quite amateur. Eastwood is not at the top of his game, although he simply sees it because he is surrounded by a helpless bunch. <br /> <br /> And for all this, the film is for 116 minutes. What the point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
