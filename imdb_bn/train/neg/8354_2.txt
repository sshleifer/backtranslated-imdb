Any film that works out Brooke Shield's outfit, is both a contradiction and a terrible one. Shield is really bad because she is not cooperative, inexperienced and clearly directed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is a bad reason, because he's bad. I like him in Olie's Gold, years later, but Lord on top, he's scary here. Nobody is good either. There is no single performance (out of Henry Finder's delightful Camio) that even passable. I have not seen a movie with this many bad performances. In the case of Luke Ascu, Chief Villain, it is clear that because of poor dialogue and direction, he did a good job in the past. But his partner Ted Marcland's player is an embarrassing Ham. The text is not only bloody horror, and the actors can not blame the terrible things they say. But they say they are so bad! Editing and direction worse than passers-by. Shots run a long way for any dramatic reason, or the effect of the scene is cut before it is realized. This picture was far worse than I imagined and completely forgot (but was never created) except for a few parts of the famous name. A brilliant spot: Cinematography is fine in the Grand Canyon, in such a way that the beauty of the area is assumed that even the big screen Imax Productions did not do very well. And finally: This is a bad version of Pepper Moon, with the tide of the father-daughter duo, or it's a bad version of a beautiful version, which is associated with a more exciting relationship between forty-something and 13-year. Old It's the next recommendation of the former, and thus quite annoying.
