Ratings: 4 of the 4 <br /> <br /> This mini series has been contacted, and for the last ad, we were aware of it for six months because the Sage FI channels churned them with BIG advertising, I acknowledge that I As I learned more I felt a growing unease. <br /> <br /> With some cinematic artwork which has stood for some time, different people go to see it in different things. In this case, when people think of Galilecta, they remember various things. For some it is a chromium fighter with oselt red light in their visor. For others, the love that it held for special effects was quite evolutionary for their time. In the late 70's, especially those who have special effects on television have forgotten many. Some memory stories solved around the stress. Others still remember the relationship that relationships have helped to overcome the challenges they face. <br /> <br /> Really, I'm from the next group. The original part of the Blaster Galactica was a person who gathered together to save the evil empire. Yes, bad. Silen had nothing to gain, but the human race was eliminated but they did it. The base star is roaming around, though men and women often come together to face an enemy with unlimited resources, and the way they are able to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology, or had more energy. They survived because they cared for each other and believed in going to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws and was sad sometimes, but they were the ones you could take care of. <BR /> <br /> The author of this current genre did not understand this. In some ways, he made at least significant portions of the main show, character name and story cycle, and made nothing less than the restoration of television science fiction. As it was their goal, they could be judged on how well they performed it: Failure. It was far from a reinvention. Actually it is one of the most derivitive efforts of science fiction in many ways. It is also generously borrowed from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even the Battlefield Earth. I find that unfortunate <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore contributed more than a decade to popular science fiction and has contributed to some popular television science fiction which you can expect. . It seems that there was a problem among them that there is no conflict in the Enterprise D & E bridge crew. It was inadequate rules of Rodenberre ST: TNG. Many have lived under the rules, who take every opportunity to break rules that are no longer under the authority, Ron Moore thinks that science has forgotten the teachings he taught under the science fiction professor Gene Rodden. Here, instead of writing the best possible stories, he created a vague casting, since I've seen how much I wanted to create Cast conflict. In addition to the defective, it was at least a bit believable. Anyone in the military knows that anyone who overwhelmed a senior officer overwhelmingly would not find "hay" for a few days, they could execute the execution, and they could not achieve it the next day. It happened, not the time, especially during the war. <br /> <br /> I remember the previous work of Ron Moore that he was Captain James Kirk's death. He killed Captain Kirk, and woe for me, he killed Blaster Galacticus.
