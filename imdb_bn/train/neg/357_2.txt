Why not only see his wife (little age difference) and Lawrence Fishnarn as the leading convert to racist South Police (!) And Ed Harris, as the Harted Law Professor Kate Capps (he's still working?). A fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Strange casting, but serious attention to movie viewers **. (If you do not want to see this movie seriously or sometimes you do not see this movie seriously because of corruption) Above all, I felt myself turning my eyes on Liberal stereotype repeatedly: Police are all unfortunate and there is no proof that it constitutes With black guy Colonel, witness and even prosecuted lawyer have cooperated against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because she is black <br /> <br /> Connie is a Harvard legal person who has weakened speech against black against blacks and barbarous executions. He has been convicted for his conviction and he has been released for trial again. <br /> <br /> Connection stone has been torn by small city officials and good Ils Club Club (but ...) the case against Blair, the killer, now in the death row, all were fabricated. The main proof was his confession, which beat him. <br /> <br /> The cat was operated by a black police (!) who even played the Russian Roulette for acceptance from him. Connery finds out that another detainee in the death has actually killed and after a tetes with a few serious tethes of tetees, Hannibal lectures like Ed Harris, find out where Harris murders killing the weapons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, it proves that Blair was a psychoanalytic psychologist and he used "white blame" for the recruitment of Conn. He awakened the story with Ed Harris to Blair for the killing of some murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair has been loosened again, thanks to Connie's confusing PC policy! Final 30 minutes A legal drama, Connie and Fishburn, a strange action movie that has fought with serial killers of a cigarette killer (yes, you've read correctly). <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie <br /> <br /> The whole system is corrupt and vulgar, police are only victims of Bulge and Abu Gribi, but the criminals are really psychologists and fricative. <br /> <br /> Truly depressed on each level! The system has completely gone bad and PC white blame types are those who challenge it too seriously. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery was probably to make a mortgage payment or something.
