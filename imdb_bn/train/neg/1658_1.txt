This is probably the most annoying movie in history. I was looking forward to seeing this movie given by actor / director Roman Polanski. I would like to see three Amigos I see again in this movie. It immediately went straight into the junk from the DVD player. I apologize to you, who apparently liked this movie, but perhaps you probably liked the new KOKA. If someone enjoys this movie then why I am frustrated, it is slowly and steadily no real plot. Wait for 105 minutes to start the movie. I understand it was made in 1976 but it was almost an era of all bad television. Thanks to Disco and Three Company's Stop Sine Glasses and Bay City Rollers as well. Oh well just my thoughts
