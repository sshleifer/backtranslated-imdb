I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Western Generator, and I usually prefer making it cheaper. Notorious director Demofilo Fandani, however, is the cheapest, cheapest, and well known about context, best known for the worst contributions. The fiction film plots were generally very weak, and his talent was limited, so he usually tried to sell movies by adding the famous spaghetti Western name like "Zhenko" of titles to titles in the titles. I took the title of "Gue La La Testa ... Hombre" in 1971, titled Sergio Leon's "Gewe La la Testa" (Uk. "Doc You Soccer") and added 'Hombar'. The film can be found under various titles ("Dying", "Western Story" ...), I personally bought it under the name "Adyas Companeroos", which shares this film with almost the same cast of another Fanny film, "Every Una Bar piano de dollarary ", which is also known as" Adiys Companeroos "in the German version. <br /> <br /> Plot is rather weak, it basically follows a man named Macho Kalagan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with the two rival outgoing gangs operated by Book Cassidy (Jack Bats) and Irenehead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron's leading performance is very convincing. I do not find Jack Betts 'Boych Cassidy' as very good. B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell is always valuable to always try, and although he was probably not a very good actor, I've always seen some of the funny and original performances of Spaghetti Westerns, and he actually saved some of the film's fiction (such as the worst "Jongo and Sartana ... Shadow in the West "). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing a priest! I could imagine Kinski in what role, but before watching this movie, I could never guess that someone would throw him as a priest. Kinski, again, great, although he only had a little screen time, and a scene, where he breaks a fight, perhaps this is just the best view. Another interesting thing about this movie is the legendary director and King Joe Di'Amato's King Cinematography. <br /> <br /> "Gewe La la Testa ... Ohm" is a cheap, vague movie, but still, it has some fun moments. Because of being a spaghetti with Western passion, I enjoyed it, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or just look at this to see Kinsky as a priest. 3/10
