I loved this movie as a child but, after 20+ years, I see again, it really sucks. Up Academy can be before it before 1980, but today's offer is almost nothing! Caddyshack and strip-like movies keep much better than this steaming dogpile today. No t We've all heard millions of times now than any other lanorious joke. <br /> <br /> I recently purchased the DVD hope it is the gem that I think it will be. Well, I left! There were only 2-3 massive-hit hits on the soundtrack (others were not a recalled swimming composition) and frequent voice-over was terrible. The only thing interesting to me was that they said what lines of character were before them. Yes, I saw this movie a lot later! <br /> <br /> The only reason I wrote this review is to forget why this movie should give me two cents, sorry. :(
