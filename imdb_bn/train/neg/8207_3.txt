Repeat: Radio signals sent by the Antarctic ice are mysteriously dense. The mysterious block was dug out and it was brought to a research center in Antarctica. Julian Rom, who is a former army worker, came to explain the message. The problem is that researchers have an old girlfriend, and the situation quickly becomes scarce, especially other female researchers actually throw him on himself. And ice blocks with objects inside are dissolved abnormally. Soon the objects are open. The object continues to run, though objects produce huge amounts of electricity. It has been decided to open the object, but the Julian signal is correct before it is done. "Open". But too late, and eventually burst objects as infringement, and two things unleashed on the earth. The first is an alien, which was inactivated in the object and the other is a virus that immediately killed the research workers. And Washington, this historic event has been updated suspiciously, deciding that these things can not be published on earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons was sent to Antarctica. <br /> <br /> Comment: There are a few surprises in the movie. One is Karl Lewis who puts a well-played performance amazingly and the other is that the special effects are pretty good, and works better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of its own wonder and this time is not well. In fact it is so much like the holes of the plot that sometimes the films seem to contain randomly-linked scenes. Washington knows so much why it is not really explained why Washington has brought Russian submarine to Undertaky and why it is awakened now. It is really confusing that the alien pod is transmitted in understandable English. Some might want to explain it that the alien was in the world and knew the language (and perhaps prefer English, why?). But it is very confusing why the nice aliens clearly want to save the world from the virus, send the encoded message "Do not open"! And finally the end can finally be opened. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Therefore, the total impression of the movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
