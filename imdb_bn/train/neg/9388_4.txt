Former personal surveillance-security guard closes his latest droning work and allows him to return to his former occupation immediately. Her appointment: A mysterious French lady in California to trail ... and apparently wanted suit-and-tie racquitars. Unsuccessful attempts to update the film Nir's style without enough sting or intelligence (or plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-artist Paul Maguud (who later claimed that the film was edited without his involvement) 40's films did not leave the impression of respect for the film born from his "Chandler"; Her nostalgia is rumpled appropriately, but is bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. Handling is curiously, commendably less, and Warren Oats has been well-adapted to the '70s' in the 'Personal Dick' Orchepse, but there is no snap in the film. Leslie Carna and Gloria seemed very happy to see Castme - though they do not have much to do, and because of its hot and cold running character is getting excited throughout life. Alyan Stenswold's excellent painter, excellent location shooting, but it fails to get any drops. * **** to 1/2
