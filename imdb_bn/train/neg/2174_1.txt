It is hard to believe that man is really like this drake! I think kids can enjoy it, but to me it's not the parents of the movie's parents can sit. Predictive plot, bushy boring, and perhaps the worst child actor of all time. I would give the director some of the child's responsibility, but he was really painful to see. I'm feeling embarrassed for her now, people knew that it was her. When he used to sing the star spanded banner, I had to stop the word - so I came here and found that they won Star Search because they did it. I've always felt ashamed of Jim Bellucci to be merciful to trade in the name of his wonderful, unfortunate brother, and why this crap shows up. Zero Stars
