I can not believe my waste of time watching this garbage! Leonard Multin has given it an "AA" rating, and for TV films it is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The role was correct, but anyone who wrote it must deny access to any media of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivation of complete absence of "bad boys", and different family interactions and shallow interaction. For example, the father revealed that BAD was a violent reaction to aggression, but he became an "appreciable" person because he was not good enough to "ignore idiots", but rather with his handfuls. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
