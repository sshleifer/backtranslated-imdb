I've ever known myself as the worst Steven Seagal movie to feel himself. I knew that when I opened Steven's mouth something was different and somebody came out of the voice. In the middle of the film my eyes started to hit and I was almost helplessly laughing out of my chair. <br /> <br /> Steven Steven (ever variable voice) and his role completely unbelievable (as usual). Unfortunately, cut the euphoria-hair hat with a weevil? He always writes himself to the love of incredible love with at least 20 year old women. Supporter actors all seem like they shot in the dark - BTV, did they just paint a movie with a pennylight torch to illuminate the movie? <br /> <br /> It is really hateful in every way possible. Invite all your friends and create a social event outside of it - it's really special.
