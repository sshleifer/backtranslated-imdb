This movie was so badly written. There was no depth in the letters. They were not supposed to make this a movie. My 11-year-old boy could write a better screenplay than Huang-Rai Sheem. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only actor who did not breastfeed was a zoo guard. <br /> <br /> I love the movie and try to give suspicion, but it was 2 numbers in my hair list. Number 1 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
