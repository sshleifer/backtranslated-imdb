This is a common low budget 1970s mess. It is supposed to be a documentary about Bigfoot hunting crew through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype from a Native American to a humorous cowboy. Acting and describing a complete joke. If you are expecting to see many large footage footage - Keep hope. There will not be much else, and what can you do in the backyard with cheap clothing and camcorders? It will be better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like the lower spines in the 1970's; I do. This is bad bad acting, bad character, violent stories and no romantic events that you can not enjoy it. It is not fit in the "Good of good" section and you can not laugh at how bad it is with the help of illegal elements. This is mostly the boring footage of people watching camping, hiking, horse horses and wildlife. A large sidewalk attack which is totally stupid; It seems that our friend Saskat has thrown stones on campers from the top when they returned their rifles to him. At this moment you are rooting a lot for big players to throw some rock on the makers' heads and stop the whole thing.
