*** SPOKHELLER *** Late Christopher Dean, John Caradine's family members and employees gathered together to hear about his last wish and the wishes of Dean's nearly $ 140 million dollars Money is divided into them but after successfully spending one week in the Dean Palace. There seems to be a mix in the story when we later see that it is not really a weekend for sleeping overnight, but for the guests, the death of the death of most of the family in the palace is enough for the guests to earn Dean's money. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with money and money from the Sheriff Dan Garcia, Christopher Dean, who has gone to Radfello Acosta Estate, near the first victim of Dean Curse. Acosta has cut off its head refrigerated and then a shocked group of guests served over a plate. After that cute little Chin found out of Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow and Mary Anders, floating in the little pet pond pond. <br /> <br /> All the people of the movie being kept close to Dean Mannan, one after the other, what the killer really is about to reveal. We then think of the bi-twist in that story where the original killer suddenly killed the two remaining guests together. The real killer eventually ends up without getting all the loot, 140 million dollars, but his associate does not divide him with him or her through a poisonous cookie, who killed him on the spot. <<br /> <br /> Nonsense, who did this, and the ghost house, movies with a story of such immoral and unlikely characters that even a mother, much less than the audience, would prefer the disadvantage. Doubtless S & M sadism and of course do not include double-dealing and back-stabbing counting even in what you can think of in the steps involved in possible guests. At the end of the film, hoping for all the hope of the guest system for the fate of Dean, is hopeful that you will not expect less from a person. None of them work. <br /> <br /> Not even big surprises at the end! "It's a wonderful event that really brings face-to-face to the forgotten filmmaker of the killer identity film, so you actually see who he is before releasing himself! Then we have a plot-twist that wipes the killer together with some guests so that the movie becomes even more confusing, but it's already there. The final plot-twist, which you can see from ten miles away, to show how intelligent the killer was, that was not enough to fool anyone by watching the movie.
