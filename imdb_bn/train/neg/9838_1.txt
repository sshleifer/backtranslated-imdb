This movie is awesome. Cruel war scenes or not, acting really bad, as you can tell they read their lines from a card. Custom delivery with painful line by everyone. Think of a high school play and cringing of the obvious nature of the actor's interactions (strange pauses between high-quality lines, coupled with instant line delivery by others). If the film is all work, it can be inaccessible, but in many movies, Plot Set Up and Family Guy style, Orange Cut Aves (Oh, Wow, they are badly done). I think they are trying to be fun with this, but to set off a fun YouTube clip as a bunch of high school / college entry pupils to spy it off again as it closes again. <br /> <br /> Now the scenes of war. They are not very bad, considering the level of quality seen throughout the photo elsewhere. There is nothing great, certainly not stated anywhere near the same level as another poster (nothing like drunk master). In this fight there are a large number of split feelings in different corners with different positions by the involved in the fight. <br /> <br /> Collectively, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were a friend of a person involved in this very, very cheap production. Can you ask a guy? Oh, the same guy who wrote, managed, produced and watched this Middle School masterpiece.
