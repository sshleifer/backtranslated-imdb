Last night I saw this picture (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my seat. I think I hope to finally have some values ​​in a picture with Gare, but the value has not come to the screen. The story of the heap on the shot after guns and torture shots is a silly fool. There is no such character in the film that does something like real life. Cutting "style" definitely depends on the mini flashback and overprinting, and the Surprize Leader is a executed killer "victim" to jump to give weight to this vapid setup to a gang of free-running sadists for the year. I do not see how a Buddhist group was involved in this violent, sexist trash.
