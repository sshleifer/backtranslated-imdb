Start with a good bit: Several times Schweiz discusses Julus with his friends or that language is heard in the tribe. Visitors in the United States and UK think that all people on this planet can speak English (only if you are one of them: do not they). <br /> <br /> But acting is 'TenenCurremand' as we said in the Netherlands (it's your toes-and not the best way). I liked Swayze but this is terrible he is. His jaw muscles create overtime and break down the whole movie - some people had told him that he saw it as a boy. No Patrick: It looks stupid and compensates for the lack of character. Alison Dodie (Elizabeth) has chosen a style of acting that does not fill the style of her colleagues. Its acting s√≥ relaxed that this movie may be set to the present day. And it's not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clear, warm and character, its joy to see a performance. <br /> <br />: It's a rainy day in the morning-entertainment. Mercy May be good. Director Md.
