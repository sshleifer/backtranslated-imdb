The crippled cat (patent), a very unlined bourgeoisie bedroom that sleeps through the words of the last underground train itself and wakes up to lock itself in the tube station. After meeting with the colleague anyway and after the line closes, the mysterious train runs, it will be raped, things become scary and they hide themselves under city roads. His story is associated with George (Blackwood), which is working on the Sier System; They meet in the final third of the film, trying to avoid the demons who follow them. <br /> <br /> This pair is progressively moving ahead with a set of impossible conditions; From the tube station, they finish the irrigation work before finding themselves in some abandoned underground surgery. Most tube stations do not have toilets, so how do I go through surgery? Naturally, the film explains that there is no running water in the operation. Have electricity yet? Trying to create an image is one of the many inconsistencies that work against the daily beliefs of credibility. <br /> <br /> The giant itself is a problem. There is a complete lack of logic for his actions, it is killing people for no apparent reason. And of course, it does not keep alive for any reason, perhaps that they finally get out and give the movie 15 minutes or more running time. I understand that natural evil is considered to be scary, but then still trying to interpret the image through a doctor and his son's film and through several branches of film and yes, it sounds just as tired and kind. It clearly fails to explain that the creature has become sufficiently underground to reduce the ability to talk, only the rapper gets into screams, but not enough for the loss of his shoes. Hmm <br /> <br /> This is a fairly good film effort to plant yourself in your memory, and when it is frustrating and uncomfortable to watch, it is not enough. The final third of the film relies on a mental relationship that is never existent and the letter breaks and does not recover or recover for a clear reason. George collapses, unable to deal with anything despite wanting to run away, then he can see his daughter again, and Kate becomes emotionally difficult to break into pieces after a hijacking for a travelcard. Yes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film "Anyone can be like this", it quickly gets separated because it presents ideas that make it even more unreal. Absence of emotional interest in characters and absence of suspense creates it to avoid it.
