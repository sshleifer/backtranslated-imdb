I've been using IMDB for a few years now, but I have not written a review earlier. However, this movie has made me so disappointed (even with a score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could no longer remain silent. <br /> <br /> New Yorker story (Tim Robbins) is so annoyed by the sound pollution that he adopts a lazy arrogant as "The Rectifier" and breaks the vehicle that car with the car-alarm. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie is something wrong. Although there is one or two examples of other sources of noise, but the only true focus on our hero car alarm Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other focus. When the film tries to connect other examples of noise pollution on the problem of car alarm, it seems to be thrown to meet the effectiveness of Robins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all bored with noise. None of the cars prefer alarm sounds Of course, all of us have the desire to take a baseball bat in a respected car, and this film uses this fact and really uses it to sell this film. I say 'much more' because there is a fascinating sexual relationship (with a totally unnecessary trio) that needs to be thrown for such movie-gear to enjoy the movie. True, it's rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> Robin's character, in the movie soon enough, becomes completely incomplete. It does not seem to be less that he no longer decides to insert the word, and with more attention he has started losing his affection. The first half of the film is basically the story of the little man's hero, a rage in the rectifier, and how it comes back from a car-mocking city. However ... it is not converted. He just named himself. <br /> <br /> I could go for a while. The annoying general social comment comes for now and later to incorporate the uglyness of the film and a self-satisfied reminder that Robins never leaves in the face. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think what this movie is trying to do is very clear, because it makes your neck much beautiful, but in my opinion it failed in a big way. Just one person's opinion, cheers.
