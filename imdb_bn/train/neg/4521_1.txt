The whole biker movie style should be made in the worst of films made. It is a battle of multiple wars, generous blood, warrior bikes with Indians, and a tranquil city that flies and breaks one shake at a time. Acting is overcome terrible. Has ever happened to Robert Walker, Junior? At one stage he was producing some big studio, and then he faded away. This movie is really dead but if you have not seen a biker movie in the long run then it is good to see it. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little annoying to see it!
