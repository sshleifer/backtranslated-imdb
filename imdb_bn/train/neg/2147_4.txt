The real is a memorable watch, with some really memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, CityVille, although there is no shortage of sparks among the worst sequels of DTV. <br /> <br /> The biggest letdown is the lack of a story. Like Bell's Magic World, characters are told through a series of series. The magical world, though slightly better, still managed to make the story a mess. Among the vintages, we can see the mouse working, and personally I think that Jacques and Gauss's antics have the capability to release this film. <br /> <br /> The best movie is being used for the first movie. Being a princess is going on. This is the best, because the mouse was their funniest here. When Jake turned into a man, the worst vignettes, sometimes tricky, but there is a lack of imagination. The last surprise, when Anastasia fell in love, was very tricky. The problem was, I could not believe Andstassia being friendly with Cinderella, because I wanted to convey to him from the rabbits. It was also fierce by Lucifer, a ridiculous theorem for love with Pampom. <br /> <br /> It was very pleasant to hear the instrumental song, but I hated the songs, they were really vague, and there was nothing like it, the beautiful source of Taiwojski inspired. <br /> <br /> The letters were the most powerful development here. Cinderella was still careful, lost her sincerity, and basically lost her many charm, though she was wearing some nice clothes. Duke had some really interesting moments, but they were not enough to save the film with Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mouse was entitled to the release of the movie, because they contributed to the creativity of this movie alone. I want to say that the animation is more colorful and more than average, and voice acting was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Everybody, beautiful, if inorganic continuity, is a story of songs and its lack. 4/10 for mouse, voice acting, animation and some beautiful dresses.
