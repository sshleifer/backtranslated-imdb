Yes, I'm sure it could really be a race. . . If four of them are standing in four corners of the earth and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times. Man, I really saw this rental rent instead of FEAR.net. I'm a big fan of George Romero films and I'm sure if he saw this movie he would have been laughing hard, but he probably laughed. I mean, what did the Rokon girls have been walking around like posing as a zombie and like Charlie's Devils? It really helped the music composers when they went to their killers, especially in the part where they went into the gear like furniture shops / police stations / apartments / flats / any room, decided to choose CRAFFY fashion show for them. With the background in Gong, and there was debate about the live-off furniture store. I could not even tell what the killer was nationality, and its expression helped some that are not directed to the nation. Oh well, I can expect from a movie where they are in a random war scene for a good reason for a good reason where they apparently put air boxes around the world. So, for those who love the mystery science theater 3000, or if you prefer renaming bad movies (c for c craptastic) but this is your movie for you. . . Or not
