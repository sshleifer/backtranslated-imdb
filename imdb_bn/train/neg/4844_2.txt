I'm definitely one of these minority opinions. "The Heart Locker" won more "Best Picture" awards from critics this year than any other movie. However, I do not like it, I got trouble sitting in it. <br /> <br /> there is a minimum plot and small character development. They disarm the bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. That's the whole movie <br /> <br /> The worst part is that the camera will never run and will continuously vibrate. This is a recent pad for film making and it is considered to be more realistic because it has a cheaper, documentary look. The camera is shaking so much that it annoyed me to see the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not take care of war movies and there was no exception to "The Heart Locker". But critics do not have to take my word for you to love it.
