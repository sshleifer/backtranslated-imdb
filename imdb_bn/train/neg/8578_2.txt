One of the most decorated movies of 1940, the helpless Hunted House comedy, which the singer played with the Kaiser. Kayak, Orchestra leader and radio star (and close of the eternal college fraternity), was the precursor of Spike Jones, who presented it for his guest and voluntarily backed up volunteers by his fun document. He is hired to play a birthday party in a dark palace, imported poison durts from Africa have been made and hanging on the wall. Syndicate brings scary judges, awful profesionists, an insulting husband, many gigabytes, and enough bad jokes to fill up three Bob Hope pictures. The songs (Jimmy MacHug and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to go outside of Brazil, and not a confident Keizer, raised it with the elbow-in-the-ribs that came back ten years ago in 1961. * ****
