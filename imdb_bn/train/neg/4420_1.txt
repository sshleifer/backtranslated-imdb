"Everything could be a great documentary" ?? Yes, if deaf, dumb, and blind Everything but money, intelligence, visual style, and interesting topics. Next to that . <br /> <br /> Seriously, Volyn. This is a movie which is completely inhuman. An adventure doc with no adventure, a warrior with no sense of war, sending a campus with intelligent curriculum It does not mean anything, nothing seems to be, and absolutely nothing that carries the underlying message. No wonder the IMDB fans! Of course, you are going to metropolitan Lippmann's culture, there is no intelligence, no intelligence (without a corrosive fighter), and there is no recognized human emotion? Just adrenaline "Darken" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! To avoid. Many documentaries and toilets build-up such as "Darken", it is a short time in waste life.
