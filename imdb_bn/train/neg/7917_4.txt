"Cement" Bad movie bad movie about a bad valve (Pen) and bad night bad concrete with bad attitude is bad movie bad movie in his bad guys. We are waiting for the cement drying and how to paint the image, we're occasionally jerked with rhythm or reason without time so that we can see leading phenomena up to the cement thing. Overall, a boring junk flick, the lack of a cement "story", a brutal execution, and the film's most all-round errors. There is no reason to care. A time killer for the required couch potatoes at the best time. (D +)
