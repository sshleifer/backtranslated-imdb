Again a movie has been remadely remade with classic uninterrupted disastrous results. As the title lies about everything about this film. The time does not render properly, and the leads seem very painful to be too young and even criminal. Arthur Pen's film was made by styles, comedies, perspectives, and gifted people. Even if the 1967 version does not exist, it will still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 edition is a disconnected version, a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and has some amazing performance that lets you take care of yourself. This 1992 remake is imagined from a truly real true true real movie, and in this version the actors are trick, unexpected and not least bit interesting. Avoid this one by all means and hopefully the 2010 edition will be good. Could it possibly be worse?
