It's the nature of business trying to capitalize on the success of others. Here we have an element of 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931), in which the rural leaders in the city of a Germanic city believe that the cause of the recent death in frogs is the cause. Bloody Hunting Although shot in Universal (and Brunson Cave!), It is a poverty line; It is not comparatively comparable compared to earlier, with more broadly produced and higher movies. <br /> <br /> The well-known sequence from the familiar and exciting, cool music (which should be made by Misfy Baklianikoff), but in the well-established sequence, we hope the arrival of Lionel Atuil, Fay Rai and Diete Frei, we have a good 30 Seconds give mystery movies. Unfortunately, it does not happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> We got a little more than the formulas of this type of film, but in slow motion, low budget, not enough diet frames, Moody Ebarne (Auntie Gussi) extra presence, and Lionel It has never been clarified by how he clarified how to control the mind about the need for the blood of humans or his slave Emil (Robert Frageer) for Atul (Dr. Fun Niemann)<br /> <br /> Do not see the technicolor '. X '(1932) - like Lionel Atoll and Pha Ray, but like a father and a daughter - I have seen this like this; Comparing it to an Oscar winner. So first watch this one. Structurally, the 'Vampire Bat' is still not good. It plods along with too much talking or unreasonable comic relief, without a firm focus on vampiric villainy. <br /> <br /> as well as' Dr. X 'and' Max of the Max Museum '(both 1932 and co-starring Fra Roy), Lionel Atul's most famous scenes are an armed guitarist of' Sun of Frankenstein '(1939) and' Sherlock Holmes and Secret 'Surgery (1943). In Daiyit Frey 'Dracula' (1931), he stole all his scenes. As 'young lovers', Melvin Douglas and Pha Ray have a beautiful kiss scene, but this is about it. He can be seen in 'The Dark Dark House' (1932), and Feye is dragged by Joel McRae at 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1930). Then its 1933 classic 'screamer.' The film did not receive much time, money and rewrite to showcase the talent and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Phay Roy and Daiet Frei. Sadly, then, this wildly disappointing movie gets only 4.
