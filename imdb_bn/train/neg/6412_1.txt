I just got back to the film and I am completely indifferent. This movie is a complete spider for mankind. There were four people in the theater I was in. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that any san man likes it. There was no plot in all the plots. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing This movie shows only why Hollywood shows such a snail. I can only look at the spirits of the "horror movie" industry. What a satirical incident for creating all the movies, it is true of all the new "Teen Blaze Flips", this crew, Boogman, Ring, Show series. It's all like the trash. Do not support such a Hogwash!
