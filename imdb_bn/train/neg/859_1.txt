This sting bomb bomb had been captured recently in a cable channel and it was so terrible that I felt in the first liberation war in 1980. Older critics do not have the age of remembering such a huge campaign surrounding this film of struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. In the most popular novels, fans' tails were interested in seeing the supposed "master" director, on the screen kept this multi-level supernatural story. "Selim's Lot" was already destroyed in the late 1970's as a TV mini-series operated by Hooper (in the name of "Texas Chess Genocide"), and the book's main villain "Chiller Theater" "thus destroying the entire premises without any real danger. Hupper, the director of the Kubrick's medal, had failed, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie looks great It's a great opening sequence but after all those achievements, it's all encouraging.Jack Nicholson can be nothing but Jack Nicholson, he's always crazy and does not bring his role here. I do not think that many critics think here that He's going to this clinker, "Johnny here!" Despite the bits ... he's just awful in this movie, so for everyone else, everyone is like Scatman Crothers. Dick Hollrons was essential for the plot of the book, yet Kubrick had killed him in one of the most shameful "shock" sequences ever put in the film. I think I saw the theater audience twelve times in 45 minutes of this harmful flicker, who remained here. Lot left King books do not really translate well in movies, because most of his descriptions occur internally inside his letters and often metaphorically. The grave creates tension in living between the living and the dead, and the resulting material has so far passed away from the original element that we do not eventually care about what can happen to anyone. <br /> <br /> This movie still stinks and why it seems so much it is beyond me an awesome masterpiece.
