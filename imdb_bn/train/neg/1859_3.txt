The boy made this movie fool me. I honestly thought it would be a campi horror movie that did not make any humor, the boy got me on the cold shoulder. This was the movie, and I honest, quite well. It was not all terrible except the campaign and this funny comedy is really interesting crazy. It was so painful to see some of the horrific acting and kill killings, I laugh at how bad I was, but I enjoyed it a bit. All killings are violently associated with ice sports and Christmas, which makes things even more stimulating. Pov camera angles were great. <br /> <br /> This film is like a sticky assassin, who dies in a collision with a chemical truck accident in the factory collision. He is later resurrected into the same chemical with spliced ​​ice. This perfect killer was the selected element to make snowman. He wanted to retaliate, as a gentle man punished the police. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was so bad, except for Christopher Alport, it was funny. I would say that I was very disappointed that this movie was not awful, but it was actually a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it was not executed right. First of all, I liked the movie, but now it's really annoying. But this movie is better than a siege and darker.
