Two houses, one street, a phone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of elements should be enough for a great horror movie. You need some blue light, surrounded music and ... done. Dutch director Van Rowarowera not in the hands of! <br /> <br /> I sometimes want to organize "Bad Movie Evening". The idea is simple: get some bottles, get some movie-loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst movie. Such an evening is one of the best of this messy peace. Laughter is sure! <br /> <br /> Wicked thing is that Van Roverwa is still protecting his film as it is a great achievement. To be its witness you will hear the DVD's commentary track. Again, unbelieving and laughing sure!
