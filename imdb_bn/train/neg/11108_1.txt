Where to begin The film started well, but after 30 minutes I saw myself watch. The horror was good at the beginning of the film but then the story kicked. Stupidas and Stupidas got the same time as it had survived. <br /> <br /> Although given the average performance of the actors of this movie, I got Vinnie Jones constant curiosity bit in the film. <br /> <br /> Taking the picture took my word for it, pulled it, it got much more. *** SPEAKER ALERT *** SPEAKER ALERT *** SPEAKER ALERT *** When I thought that the film could not be worse, looking at the skeleton and facing the giants at the last load, ate dead people. Which is in the sense of throwing in any sense. It turned out to be some kind of meat eating habits and good guys eventually died. In the end it's just how bad it smells at me Once the main role was settled by Winnie Jones, he became a new killer. <br /> <br /> This image looks like the best horror movie ever made in the cripple. I gave 1 star because the female lead did a great job but she could not even destroy this movie in a movie !!
