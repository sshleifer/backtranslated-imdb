If there was a ZERO rating, I would give this movie. Today I tried to see it again and I still could not start from the beginning. I can not believe multiple stars given by others and guess only they can know the actor or be a preacher in disguise! The actress is tortured around, the script is blasphemy, and Nicholl's child shows even zero emotions. Amber's mother acting actress is "ridiculous" accessory - I'm from Georgia and there are friends in Texas - believe me can not talk like that! No visual of any of his emotions seems real. The issues are very serious and deserve much better treatment.
