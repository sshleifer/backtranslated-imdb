This anxiety-era drama of Marie Desaila carries with a modest bank owner, which was recently broadcast on TCM in April Fools Comedy. If you come to laugh a large, courtesy of Dresler-Polly Morning Team, you'll be disappointed, because it's really a disappointing film. It seems to have been made very badly, surprisingly it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare-hay cinematography strictly 'set up the camera and does not remove it' at school, often towards cast loss, which provides the screen off line to themselves (it's like a pane and a scan before existence!) Or their head is being cut. The production capability of the film is also not a credit director involved in the bright upswing of Knight Nature. Overall, it is an unheard-of mess, Dresler's frequent over-emoting and only malicious, bathroom balancing for the final relay dash to set it apart.
