Apparently the authors / directors have already completed shorts; As a short, this is okay. But the lack of dialogue began to consume after twenty minutes.

But the story of the worst failures <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After an hour, I saw the diversity of the same scene again. I almost cried over the screen, "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It is surprising that after we left the theater we could run home, see part of the Daily Show and the Colbert Report, get ready for the bed and find out that the viewers were trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to indulge your eyes You must give enough audience to share your vision.
