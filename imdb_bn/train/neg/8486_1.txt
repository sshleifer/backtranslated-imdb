I could not believe anyone that had something original or interesting about this movie. I have the opinion of science fiction as well as the opinion of the next man, and I can even enjoy old films with the zombie premises until they are written to anyone other than the monkey. (For example, see my illuminated review of the changed states [1980]. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is the producers <br /> <br /> Now, to make disparate public disrespectful publications in the serious review box: <br /> <<br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> < br> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I'm next I enjoy reading E. Still, their movie credibility review has gone through the floor, but I know that I have ever made a movie with handheld cameras, a chessy plot and stupid effects, I will show it to the journalists and think about the things they are thinking about I will remind you of what happened.)
