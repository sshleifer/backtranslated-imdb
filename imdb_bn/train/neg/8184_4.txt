It's almost like two movies - one educated and engaging, other stupid and clich√©d. It's a shame that all the problems did not work with writing, but considering most of the B-movies were written and produced, it is not very unusual. It is a real shame, though, it can be a very good film. <br /> <br /> The first good. The movie includes original and WWII code-breakers. It's quite impressive and I like watching the main person (Lee Bowman) to go through his passes as a master code-breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now for the worse, the film has gone a long way and lost steam in about 50 minutes. In addition, Jean Rogers's role as "cookie girlfriend" must be considered the worst-written and misleading role in film history !! For every smart step made by Bowman, stupid Rogers then stepped up screw things up as something confusing "comedy relief". His role was cleverly written, the overall film has been greatly improved! Instead, seeing him, it is hard to understand that we actually won WWII !!
