This movie is bad. If you are thinking of watching it, then the film has only one visible scene and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carrow's troubled view). The rest of the movie is awesome. I think high school drama probably has better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The set was quite tall, and it was not even good to make fun. It was just lazy and very bad! So I saw this at Starz so I had to be at least decent. Mini description sounded like it'd be OK After watching you horror music video, girlfriend kills herself for some reason apparently at the beginning of the movie. The transitions between scenes are very casual and somebody like it just keeps a movie tone in a movie, even without worrying about how to convert them. Cut from just one scene to another, no polishing. Talking about how bad the movie is, like my random switching, why the plot sucks. The audio is less than a few points, where you can listen completely, then the grotesque screams of the film's shuffle puffs out loudly and loudly aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly Alonged aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly The loud loud loud loud fun. It's the same word every time. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effect: 1/10 Story Description: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lam-Meter : 1,000,000 / 10
