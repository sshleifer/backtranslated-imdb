All right, when I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it was really scary and I was quite excited to see the group I was in. Now in America, especially during this election, I can see some deceptive things but I have to look at the top of this preview list. I do not see so much people scared by this movie. I've only noticed two real jump scenes and only one jumped. The whole film was highly anticipated and perhaps some of my jumping scenes were visible for it. Sound effects were so scared that I thought they were curious. Oh and oh catboy came from where and why? The worst word of the whole film should have been a weird cry. How is anyone scared? I can easily sound that Now do not mistake me, you've just been smiling through all the bad films I've liked but I do not think it was bad going for it.
