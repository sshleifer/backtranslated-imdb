Growing up, Joe Stamma was my hero, but even I was cold in this movie. For good and bad, not written in the future, a straightforward "music back" style is not documentary. Rather it is full of chaques raised from a biographical art film, interview, performance footage, home movies, and mostly scrumptious animation sketches "animal farms". The film is coherent, but it is about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire format, while touching the thought, is quite annoying for its implementation. First off, without the title, it's hard to even know who half of this interview. Secondly, people like Bona, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack are really talking about people? They were not relevant to Stroom's life and their opinions added nothing to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when most people do not know by touching the life aspects of Stamara, taped interview and conversation. About: The suicide of his elder brother, the death of his parents, and the parents are happily talking to them. To me, these were the most up to date because it showed Joe Stormer that we all knew and liked the punk icon, but we all have to face to cope with the grief and sorrow of living as a regular human. <br /> <br> Stompers and collisions have become better, documentary easier. (Westway, VH1 legend, and the MTV documentary described by Cart Loader seems to be from the beginning of the 90's.) Joe Strammer: The future has just been left for death only.
