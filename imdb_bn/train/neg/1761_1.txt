First of all, I understand that the "1" rating should be reserved for the worst. This movie got from me because, as a critic, it is mentioned that it is not bad in self-conscious, high-end way, which may have some comic or culture value. It simply misses its mark on every countdown. ** Possible spoilers ** The dialog is completely innocent. Continuity is so deliberate it is painful. Daniel just finished his lost love, and started his Flamenco dancer with the final word. What's the name of her shocking shock (see, I do not remember the name of her character, give the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (Belldwin) first tells her that her friend is a bad guy. Car and motorcycle chase are all the right things. Plant carts have gone flying. Cars crash into each other. The motorcycle is going down the stairs. People are being hit almost, but notable, there is no one. Oh, well ... except the man who was hijacked several times, clearly bending with theft wounds, and an upcoming car apparently did not notice him there. Hmm <br /> <br /> It is becoming more unusual for me that such movies can be made. There is so much pressure on the film industry to make money, you think some of Hollywood's people will think of making good films. Now there is a novel idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this image. Do not rent the DVD Do not watch it on the wire. There are so many things you can do that will make you feel more satisfied.
