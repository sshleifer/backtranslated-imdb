Two mercenaries have struggled to evacuate their empty books, but in the empty apartment house They first helped each other, and then gradually the tension started growing among them. <br /> <br /> It is based on the novel of Bernard Malumud and, unfortunately, everyone says that the same as the novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, its purple and shadow shade. It wrote head English script such as an English English head with a perspective. It's awful and I've found myself immensely immensely in any film's film, which is shameful because of the great performance from top to bottom. Under the snake dog, there is a fine form, unfortunately none of them can come to the sound and proof of lies. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie. Although not really bad, if you want to walk away, its very promotional and persuasive. I was struggling to lose a third less interest on the way and get the end. If you are interested I will try it on, but I will not spend good money on seeing it.
