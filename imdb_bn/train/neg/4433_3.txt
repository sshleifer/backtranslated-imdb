I really wanted to make more choices than this movie. Because I love helpless foreign jokes - especially weird people who can surprise you completely. However, though this often caught me surprise, it was almost never surprising. It reminds me of the South Park that almost every social norm was violated until it was very sick to be only drunk. For example, the topic of adultery, drug misuse (pot, heroin, speed to glue snifting), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc is related to the subject (?) Of sexual exploitation. Mother encouraged one of his sons (looked 12 years old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at one stage of the film, he has changed the payment for the dentist to dental work. Ridiculous ?! You've got fun. The film goes too far and goes into "Comedy Blackhole". Should they be fun next, cancer or rectal tumor?
