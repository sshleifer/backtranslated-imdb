I am Sydney j I do not expect much from a film directed by Furry and to play Dolf Lundgren, but I definitely got more. A linear user comment - Second rate action movie - Looks like LundGren does not seem too unreal for me. On the other hand, I would not be too bothered to see this picture if its ratings were below 5.0 but this movie was 5.9% out of 10, which seemed quite acceptable to me for such a product. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of those who rated this movie were definitely a promotion stunt, because of the regular Nu image garbage you saw over over regularly. <br /> <br /> Lundgen is not as satisfied as a history teacher turned out to be from a rough school as a former military. His acting is just plain terrible, unhealthy and arising. The scene of the disqualification of the lawgrain with law enforcement forces has become visible. They seem to be great actors or great actors than Londragon - because they seem natural and trustworthy. Sadness is something that can be potentially attractive for this low budget movie - At a closed weekend high security high school, four teenagers are arrested with war criminals and trying to prevent a group of cruel criminals - but the story ( Some DJs like the BREAKFAST club get hard, or are it panic rooms?) Full of incredible situations, lots of clich√©s and stereotypical non Sara lots. And do not think Dolph Lundgren as the main actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Sam Rockwell's budget version and he wants to be a mela embroil. In a movie where everything fails, their craziness and style provide enough zero air to prevent my interests from zero to zero.
