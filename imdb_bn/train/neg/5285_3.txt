Somewhere, on this site, someone has written that to get the best version of Jane Austen's work, only read it. I agree with that. However, we like the adaptation of great literature and the current writers strike think that without good authors, it is difficult to bring their role in actors' lives. The personal version of Jane Austen shows us when you do not have a good basis in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to Aman Route and Sieran Hinds in comparison to the 1995 version, which played well and had the limitation of the essence of the letters and the exception of the great view of the bathroom and the characters. . The 2007 version shows a kitten Anne, who is scared. An offense in which other letters are not very advanced, may consider such a wonderful character with certain carefully selected understatesments in Austen. The sensational incidents in the novel were fully exposed and Mrs. Smith, staying in Anne's bedroom and poor schoolgirl walking around the bath - moving on Twitter, thinking of many characters. The character and intellectual power of Captain Normand, who loves to bring him to the first place, does not seem to be written in the Rupert Preni-Jones' Centaur. Sieran Hinds had more material and PJ was able to publish much more than being able to work in his post. After all, the 2007 version was frustrating. It reduced the handwriting novel to hand-wring, controversial costume mailedram. If they want to bring our modern mental abnormalities into the work of Austin, then what they did with Shakespeare's adaptations should be done: Fit it with the present. At least "Bride and Prejudice" was taken from historical and local settings and was fun to see as "clois". It was not private, but they did not know what they would say.
