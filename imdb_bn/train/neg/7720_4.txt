There are not enough gay-themed movies and there are not enough 'movies coming'. Everyone is a welcome addition to the section. Although production prices are high (the film looks good, but Matthews Freehoff (Philipp) looks good in pairing of jeans) it's a bad one. It is a period of time: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) is a life that seems to have been for 40 years in the West. One way we are seeing our own history; What it might look like in the 40's and mid-50s (it seems to me 'the last exit of Berlin': the book is not a film). However Ingmar Bergman has transmitted an old SCCTV that is totally frustrating and slow. So if the director did not hack just randomly, so sloppily edited I am surprised. Yes, it was a miracle that it was released and released before the wall fell down, and yes, life behind the 'cartoon' for homosexuals was difficult. A good director can show all that without stupefying the viewers. A good director marks me as one of these great upcoming movies and not one of the misses.
