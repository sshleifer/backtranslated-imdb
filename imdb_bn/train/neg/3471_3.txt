This movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was not trying to work seriously, in any way, shape, or form. She sucked straight. Nothing about the movie was believable. The first problem was in the article - where people give everything to the value of the Salvation Army Santa Claus, but it does not show why. And then the granny takes her head in the hair - really beautiful, and there is nothing to do with the movie - it's not the same voice as the movie. There is no explanation for the motivation to choose the house chosen by Ben Affilek; He had no credible reactions by the elected family; And people are moving here and there without any reason (for example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters are jumping under a severe slope - this incident suddenly fell in love with her. Riiiight ...) However, there was a fun moment or two - but They were an irrevocable movie. It requires another rewrite seriously (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
