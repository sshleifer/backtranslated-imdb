Wow! Now I'm talking about this! As far as bad / hungry go horror flicks this movie was really a class of its own. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the film was not originally English. OK because voice dubbing was really awesome! Here are my favorite quotes from the dialog (and there are lots of where it came from?)? "I feel a little better, I am only thirsty for your blood! <br /> <br /> Any play, here is a game by the interaction between the military and the scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 Scientists: "Can not you do it? It's a disaster! "- Military officer:" It's just science fiction "(He then comes forward for a complete disaster like the prediction of scientists) <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? scientist:" If you kill that many people Do not be !!! "- Military Officer:" You do not know what you are saying. "(He does this and many people die) <br /> <br /> Scene 3? Scientists:" Do not do it? It will kill everyone! "- Military officer:" It's nonsense "(Then he kills everyone) <br /> <br /> 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get the idea) <br /> <br / > If it is not enough, there was a few scenes that were really standing as an instant classic! At one point, the military literally points to the gun in the name of 10 unarmed people. The leader shouted, "Go!" And all 10 soldiers, one At one point, drop their gun and fist <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe that this review might contain some spoilers, but there are many things in this epic. I really scratched the surface only. The movie comes out! The experience of watching a true movie! An excellent composition! What a great!
