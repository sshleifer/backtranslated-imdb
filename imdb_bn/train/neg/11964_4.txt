Billy Crystal is a very safe and comfortable comedy-drama co-written, co-produced and co-authored about father and son, adult irresponsibility and growth. Billy operates a heart cardiac heart whose heart (O Hector) leads her to find her father (Alan King), a film-addition who thinks herself a big star. The script is Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family conflict ready, one-fishing boat, sub-nil Simon Nonsense with a flat, inexperienced guide. The Crystal and King tried their best, but King is more interested and often above-the-top. The other one of Jacobeth Williams's her grateful role, but managed to bring the character of its inherent, low-house class proverbial girlfriend. It's a comedy, I guess, but that tears blinks back ... shameful. ** **** to
