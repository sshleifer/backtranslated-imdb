I saw this film when I first released. Remembering how bad it was with me for about forty years. When I did not want to believe in my own feelings about the film, so I consulted with a movie review published in a major metro newspaper the next day - Confirming the feeling, the critic wrote that the film is inappropriate, unknown, and irrelevant. A little research reveals that producer star Leslie Carn's husband was, thus, the flag of Napestimism indicates the beginning of this horror film. Many film actors - Cause, Warren Oats, Schakman Crothers, Glory, and James Sexting have advised others that it promises some commitments. But the death of this movie is responsible for his horrific screenplay. The "mystery" involved is so obscure throughout the film and it is so much that the viewer's view is to refrain from the scene. The film seems to be broken into a detective mystery and a spying thriller, but does not settle on one or the other. Mystery feeling completely absent. The main characters set dry, passionate games in a fashion that does not inspire any sympathy. Cinematography is pedestrians. As a result, the unskilled spectators lost their interest in characters, plot and ultimately the film. There is no version of this kind of merry movie available for purchase. I hope if TCM finds a print of this film and is forced to keep it in the air that it is safely transferred to 4:00 slots.
