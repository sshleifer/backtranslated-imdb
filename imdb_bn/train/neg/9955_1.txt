Very nice to see the whole thing. European location shooting was a good idea. Leading actors are interesting. Scores are servicable. <br /> <br /> But then they spoke! And non-plots are developed! And it was all downhill from it. Passino is sleeping and Keller talks about how much annoying ... hello, dear, you are not alone. When he imitates a Mae Western, you might hide your face, it's that painful to see. <br /> <br /> I can not act how actors or director Sydney Pollack is involved with this, or a good question, why was it so bad? <br /> <br /> <br /> Because almost every scene of death is being represented in one way or another, it may be less enjoyable here. Probably supposed to be empty and cold like his death. But I still can not recommend it.
