One of the most scary movies I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American history class and at the end of the 1800s was watching the enthusiasm of the peasant life in the west. We saw pigs being shot and then killed, human birth, branding. Oh and finally the calf had a live birth and I can tell you that the birth was not very bad, but there are lots of fluids that bring most people to the bathroom in my class. The story itself was just fine. The main foundation of the story is a widow and her daughter and they are going to be the guardian of this cowboy's house in West Bengal. They live in hardship and in the late 1800s it is an interesting scenic scene in the west. But if you have any choice then do not see this movie.
