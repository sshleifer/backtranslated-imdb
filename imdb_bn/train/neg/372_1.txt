I have seen this movie long ago, and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> About Preston Waters, this is an unfortunate print, which is always ignored by her. The family and those who always seem to be cash short. When all this change, a bank robber runs across the Prince's bicycle and passes an empty check as compensation to him. Using a check with $ 1 million withdrawal check from Preston Bank (maliciously, who is related to money bank robbery who gives him a check). Preston then bought a palace and said that he is working as a mysterious and wealthy backing assistant to Mr McIntosh (named after his computer). After that, he just became crazy with money. <br /> <br /> On paper, it's like a great idea. However, on the screen, it is one of the perfect movies I have ever seen. One thing, it's very incredible. I know some parts of the movie were incredible, but I am drawing a line to a thirty-year-old boy with a 12-year-old son, and I'm in charge of the fantasy person's small fate. Also, it was a shallow movie with poorly played, less than a memorable less than a prospective plot line and characters. The letters were top, annoying, or resorted, both of which were chassis. But "juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to meet your family, then leave it.
