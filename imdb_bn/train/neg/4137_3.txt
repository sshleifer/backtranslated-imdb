I have a high tolerance level for shit, so I was looking forward to this. It's not frustrating. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carlisle, it follows a parent who hunts a female vampire and, fortunately, is traveling with them. Then our Santa Claus (or General, as he likes to say here) is running on random Jumbo. Did I mention a zombie prevalence? The dead are returning to life but nobody seems very anxious. We have zombies of construction workers zombies, soldier zombies and even centrine schoolgirl. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has become a vampire. Oh wait, no vampire, she is a crazy refuge and Carmella is her nurse, or she? Zombies are back and Santa's crazy Lesbian sex, I like the vampire and I like the body but I especially like lesbian sex. There is no such thing as some symmetrical vagranos to flow the juice. When are we going to watch the vampires fight zombies? Is he a vampire or he is crazy? Or both? Carmilla is a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can not have enough cunnilingus. Here come St. Trinity zombies. Time in chainsaw !! More lesbian sex then kill zombies and eat vampire. I have won the zombie, or do they guess? Plot? Do you need a plot when you have got the gay vampire and schoolgirl zombies? And kanelings?
