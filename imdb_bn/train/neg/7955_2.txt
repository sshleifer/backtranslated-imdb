Carey Fisher said on multiple occasions that he had made this film a heavy cocaine issue during his lifetime, and he did not remember much. Explain why he created this picture, but why is it not mentioned that someone else or someone else has done the crew? I can not believe that there was a problem of cocaine. It will be one of the worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. The "director" Tim Kinseed or "author" Body Geovinzeau's foot can not be blamed, because it is clear that this image is not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it was united spontaneously, because there is little evidence of solidarity, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. What was really amazing was some real professionals who involved this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done well in other films, and composer Jimmy Hessel and cinematographer Arthur Marx both artists, Marx was also a director and not a bad one. That's why they've got involved in this steaming pile of the apples. The alleged "director" team has bought several low-paid scientist and horror films, and most of them have seen, I can tell you that none of them is good. This one, though, is sometimes by the worst thing, and its part is a major achievement. Everything, absolutely everything, is about 12th rate of this movie - the best. Cinematography is a horror, funny, funny, "Special Effect" plan "Spider-Man" like "Plan 9 Out of Space", the story is triangle, derivative and fool. Do not waste your time while looking at the video box covers, let's rent it. A complete, utter, annoying, total mud.
