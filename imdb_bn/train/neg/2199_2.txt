At the New York Film and Video Festival I caught "Source Lost" and I guess I had some high hopes for this film. Sadly, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is quite hair. Bad lighting and camera work, great achievements and the least of the music, the film feels low quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really asking a lot that there are good stories of FX shorts and the rest will have the same technical output as FX! You will not go away with the cool FX in the shorts anymore, "405" after making a big splash, it's been 5 years. At least that was fast, cooler and even a little funny! Anyone can be told about "losing sorrows".
