Not a bad but so great hash film. Kirk Douglas has recently been released from the prison-safe-cracker, who decided to disassociate himself after refusing to offer his offer to Mobar. He recruited circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Maya ensues Douglas and Gemma soon follow their Mafia gun Romano Poppo and are involved in the really stubborn love triangle with Douglas's infinite patient's girlfriend (Fulllanda Balkan). Director Michael Loopo is running fast and at least one excellent and creative car, Chase Kruppa, and Pimpo and James are involved. Although most of the Italian production seems to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming in a Giallo quickie. Attractive Balkan gives a terrific performance. The song was Enino Morricone and the cinematography great Tony Doli Cole, who was able to work with everyone in Italy (Pottolini and Lyon from Wartm√ºller and Fellini).
