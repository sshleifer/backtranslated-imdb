Yes, Merry Dreser drinks the juice of drinks which he thinks poison and he's running. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Sometimes I do not want my cup, but he is a strong performer who holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I have seen this for polio, which I saw elsewhere. Here, die is okay - OK - as Dresler's impressive friend / foe. Too bad he has shrunk in almost total isolation. <br /> <br /> The plot is good heartfelt. Bad people try to loot the townspeople. Dresler wins and all good ends. <br /> <br /> I am surprised about the central plot process: bonds. It has come out of frustration so that everyone can get acquainted with bonds and if used well and how to use it wrongly. However, in that era I am not acquainted with them. They're just different to the stock, right? It seems weird to build a story about The Little Man near a little sophisticated financial entity.
