For the last 29 years I have seen the worst horror / thriller. None of them offer you these for free This movie makes you look intelligent by seeing this. The plot is not the worst part of this movie ... its acting, camera work, light and sound. There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Anyone who has made this film has paid a break now. I hope the director gets green light for another movie. In its defense, this film was quickly created to try to capitalize on the capture of BT assassin's capture capital, but I saw this week's movie which is similar to Oscar winners in comparison to this
