There are several things in this movie that are wrong- the role of Brenda songs is one of them. I do not believe that the girl is a violent actor - I'm not really. I believe he is given poor lines. She just said that "that meaningless, rich girl", and when she looks funny on a TV show, she does not dry up here from me. <br /> <br /> The way, I should really know what to do when I sit down to see this film. <br /> <br /> The movie was not that horrible ... initially. Shane's Vendi's reaction was completely natural. I mean, if a man claims to be a resurrected monk, how would you feel that you insisted on wearing a footprint and stressed that you had the need to fight the "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is completely fiction, but it still has an organization of Chinese culture. It seems that all the "fighters" women in Wendy's family line were women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt that the beggars are okay with that. Of course, perhaps they could have done it anyway, but they did not give any explanation. In this way, they contribute to many attempts at empowering women made up of Hollywood and media. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is more intolerable to go. Yes, he is a teenager, and it is near the house - that is, who wants to fight evil while coming home? The problem is, when "evil" starts to express itself, Vendee does not seem weird as it should be. He is extremely helpless- even for someone like him. He continues to care for his training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shane: "If you do not win this war, evil will end and everything will be well." Wendy: "Oh, talk about the pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, Wondi. Dance also go when you should be trained properly. Of course Shane gives him, but his character has an excuse. It is better that he cooperates with him, and he does not train everyone and kills them both. <br /> <br /> Oh, whose words Shane also said to the wind that he had to die for him in the fight, as for his own grandmother (I guess that part). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Wendy's homemaking and this "great war" is exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy? Even you have to guess? Yes, he is going to war, because he is trying to go home, beggars, (Shane was trapped between his coach and teacher's body because he "fought the weird war criminals"), said Shane had gone to war alone, so he saved him Goes. <br /> <br /> We first see half the decent war, which is really entertaining. Finally, great evil came out of Wendy's opponent-homeland and made himself a real figure from the broken pieces of the dead body of his old warriors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> do not ask. <br /> <br /> However, Wondi has got all "awesome." Then Shane went and saved him from this man - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and guide you to kill yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> She said, no, I do not let her forgive me because it was her "fate" and in her "strength "Was there. <br /> <br /> When did he learn healing? No, worst ... When can he resurrect man? So Shane was raised from the dead. Then, Wondey and he fought with the man. <br /> <br /> He easily lost his way. The worst part is, when they jump together and humiliate him at the same time, and he is exiled for eternity. Then beggar praises Wendy on her sturdy. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Script writer and director do not know war a little more "needed"? # 2: What Sacrifice? Did not he come home that actually? Because she did not break sweat, she did not even bleed. I mean, come now, this movie was TV PG, I want to hit anyone. <br /> <br /> Based on my opinion, maybe I should have given the film one. Although part of the criticism, you must definitely break a thing. You do not try to look bad on evil, but if you have it, then you pay attention to it. This movie is a lot worse, but a few interesting facts happen when you really do not expect anything to be too great at first. <br /> <br /> So, I think it was right. I was saying that it was not right that anyone would stop it from watching it.
