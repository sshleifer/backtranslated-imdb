I look forward to misusing people in God's name for a little tiredness, so that they can maintain their own strong perspective around the world. Well, I do not exclude Armenend's idea or the antichrist coming, I reject the idea that some people who live a true life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) go to heaven. The rest of us have to suffer through a million of hell on earth, because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think he will measure every level of righteousness. Give the Creator some credit.
