This video used in the Plaza from the Dinosaur Planet (except for the stolen footage) shows that this shot is concerned with a bunch of people playing the role of a dinosaur planet ... do not wait for it, really the world. This stretches a five-minute sketch 90 minutes. A little better than a chickboxer (one of the worst movies of the police series) - Keeping a nostalgic home movie, with good stolen effects, this movie seems to still be an impossible slogan. I wonder, the question is that we are becoming so unknown that we are not only planning for the old films but also for the footage? Definitely less budget producers are so frustrating they really will give us something to take our money
