I felt, I'm seeing Fast and Furious again, but with different actors and a little different plot. I would say, the pictures of the pictures are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, you probably find this movie to be hospitable. I like Nadia Bazreenlun because I saw him from the days of our life. He is a really good singer, but very bad he has given such lazy songs to sing in this movie. I mean the songs about cars; You do not have to do radio here. Since it's a Hollywood movie, so you have to give it a little light way, but in real life I do not think any average pair will come in such a hot girl, such as Nadia Bazerillin, who can run a race car, fix a car, And be a lead singer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the last minute, when the hopes were over, Michael leaked. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fine Wardikat: This film is for a freak. So, if you like fast cars, I would recommend it.
