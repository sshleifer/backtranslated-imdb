Even after 20+ years, Nija's mission stood as the worst movie directed by me. Scandanavian ninjas quietly entered into a scene, leaving their offensive crying sub-machine gun fire with wild abandoned, and then left silently. Wow, how do we find those silent invisible killers? Just follow the shell casing and smoke! Painfully the dialog (or is it brilliant and simply translated bad?), Atheistically not in Asia, and 3 Asian in the stunt crew. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is quite unattainable - then again, it can not work itself! Save yourself - to avoid watching all costs!
