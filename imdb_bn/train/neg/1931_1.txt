I went to see this one with much prospect. Quite unfortunate dialogue is completely stupid and the film is inspirational enough to scare away from or worry too much. Even a child can see the absurd reasoning of the character's behavior. Today's kids need creative stories that will inspire them, which will make their events 'day-by-day'. What exactly happened with movies like ET And Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children are becoming stubborn knights and imagined to shine their own illumination?) Do not waste your time and money seriously.
