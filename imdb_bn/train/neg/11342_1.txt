Why I explained why I ... "piece of art" potential 1 rating out of 10 stars 10. Because it is easy to become neutral, difficult or impossible to lose. Probably it is the same if I was 10/10 - whatever the explanations. <br /> <br /> I do not like these unpleasant movies like the hostel - so I think it's hateful and pretty terrible (all possible in relevant money), but I went out after watching this movie - in the name of "historical drama" There is a genre - and perhaps it was in the case of 10/10 because there was plenty of it and the tarantino was happier than it (and it is possible to show more rock on the screen The bill creates a bill for 3). But the "historical drama" genre is a sub-section of "Trash Movie" where John Romero is an end-giri-emperor-of-hut and so it can not be automatically rated as your default movie - these are movies that have been deliberately bad And you can not really say that the curiosity could be a bad moment or whether it was simply bad. This is for people who like to play bad acting, bad screenplay and everything else enjoys bad. And some of the beliefs - I am one of them. There are some days when I have an interest to watch a really bad movie and look for some trash and go here - the day is preserved! But it certainly does not match my opinion and anyone else. <br /> <br /> I want to say that if you want to watch some horrific movies - Fallannor Casanova certainly loves, but my advice is not to concentrate and rate it by default.
