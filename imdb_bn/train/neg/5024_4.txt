There is not much to say about this. The gamers are some of the breathtaking turtles of the fire. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He started to destroy the head and building and the tank and other junk for the land (oh yes, the power line. I almost forgot). At one time, at the beginning of the film, he made friends with a little boy, and instead of throwing him away or squash him, throw him on the ground. Safe From then on we see this strap a little twerp show up and face shirk, display and run, have to show away and have driven away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this baby from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, this plot is trying to get the gamara in the place where he can be kept in a rocket and shot to the place. Naturally, the giant is tall and incomplete (a man in a gamara case). Japanese Army (supported by the Americans), uses enough ammunition and fire power to solve national debt, and of course, it does not do any good work. They know this anyway. We've seen many monsters stomp in Tokyo. Do not put this down because they could have fun, but it's not really very good.
