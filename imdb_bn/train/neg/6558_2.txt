We've rented five movies for New Year's holidays and seen it first. I can say that there was no place after seeing it. It was vain and indecent. Harvey Kettel's scripts were easy to write - just make the words of two words of three words. Andy McDowell is surprisingly well in a character roll, but the movie has nothing else to recommend.
