Perhaps it is the worst effort of a Jabber movie that I have never seen. Terrible, terrible, terrible A review available on this site is definitely a filmmaker, filmmaker family, or a filmmaker's friend. How to suck this film? Let's count our ways <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot? Incomprehensible Dialogue Brutal I do not have the effect / gore slam, I realize that this low budget. But was there a zombie that was not fat? Come on! And for a movie on Rhode Island, why did that truck play a Massachusetts plate? Continuation, find out something. <br /> <br /> Dancing at the girl's dancing "draws attention". Please do not keep your ex-girlfriend or friend's sister naked. This was an ugly movie filled with ugly people, and there is no business even mentioning Romero over the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, do not.
