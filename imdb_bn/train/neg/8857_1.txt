This picture is really bad, so bad that Christopher Lee could not even save it. A bad story, even a poor script and just the simple bad direction, it really makes an awesome horror movie, the outstanding part is that it's the only horror movie I can do to really see what I'll never ever see. This garbage plan looks like Oscars material from nine outspeps.
