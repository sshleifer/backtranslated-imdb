... mainly because the ZooOn 2 carries a deadly Forty-minute material literally in the first sense from the first-on-jum - and when you consider that this sequence will last for only 76 minutes, it will release you with 36 minutes of basic minutes. Film price Ho-hum gun I found to be deeply irritating - visitors simply do not remember the same thing! <br /> <br /> All right, except for the complaint, the bailay for ZooOn 2 was that it was supposed to explain many inappropriate questions. For more than 36 minutes, the first movie is not enough to actually create any kind of feeling of a very strong story. <br /> <br /> But there are some nice new horror sequences that show how good the image can be, it was some time to develop; And some main questions raised questions - some, but not all - are answered. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion - if you like the first movie and want to see more of the story, go for it - but your remote control should be in the fast-forward button with your fingers for 40 minutes.
