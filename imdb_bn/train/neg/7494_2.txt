The word 'true' in the title of this movie is rolling my alarm bell. When a title card marked America's war as a "war between the United States" when they became superior (they were faked by the difficult south to die). Jesse James - The thief, the slayer and the murderer - is described as a cool, gentle farm boy. <br /> <br /> How dishonest is this movie? There is no mention of slavery, much less of the documented truth that JC James's poor educated mother owned slaves before the war, and Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to protect the slaves. According to this film, soldiers of these civil war are actually fighting to determine whether Missouri is a North State or a South State ... all of which (Missouri: It's a candy piece! It's a breathtaking!) Black Films is not entirely absent from this film, except for a pair of beggars, one of which uses the "The Help the Pore" mark, rather than the very easy typoset Writing. (Some shots of 19th-century newspapers with 20th-century type fonts are also wrong.) <br /> <br /> This image has a weird flashback structure. Riding some very impressive stunts (and some fine works by stunt horses), and have a nice montage. I enjoyed one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste the beans again.' The movie gets direct information: Jesse's mother Agnes Murehad, like Pinkerton's agent (here known as "Rimington"), hides her right hand after the attack, among which Jesse James's real life requires the separation of mother. Her lower hand Here are some errors forgiving: At the time of his bushing, the real Jessie James accidentally closed his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (here's the title role here) is not a stampfinger. I saw a picture of Jessie James's real wife; Hope Lange looked at this movie as if it was half as good as JC James could have more home. There is a lot of revisionism here and most of the male actors wear the hairstyles of the 1950's. But many errors in this movie can be avoided. JC James mentor William Quantrill is mentioned many times, but all actors mispronounce his name After we rented Jesse and his wife for $ 18, we saw an extended two-storey house (where he will soon be dead). In fact, Jessie James's last residence (1318 Lafayette Street, St. Joseph, Missouri) was a common one-storey cottage, rented for 14 dollars. There was no upper floor ... So, when Jesse James was killed, then Hope Lanz did not let his wife stay away from here. (He was actually in the kitchen.) <br /> <br /> One continuation error: Robert Wagner (no stunt double) does a fascinating job of taking a slug on the jaw and his hand is tied behind him. Back ... but when he gets up, his wrist rope disappears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scripts make strange and unnecessary joggling dates. Following Northfield robbery efforts, Jesse said that he wanted to go home on his birthday. Two days after the birthday of Jesse James, the genuine Northfield Bank attack by James Gang (7 September 1876) (Perhaps he meant to be the birthday of next year.) Later, we saw Jesse and his wife going to their St. Joseph's house on a beautiful summer day, when Jesse told him that when he arrived on Christmas the previous day ... what to do, but the real In life, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse James went to this house on December 24, 1881 ... so this scene will be * the day before Christmas! This error can completely avoid <br /> <br /> Here some imagery is not understood. According to this film, the attack of Northfield Bank failed because one of the legendary Heinchen Telegraph was delayed to spend the wire. In fact, if it happened, it would certainly hinder the departure of James Gang ... but it would not affect the robbery, which failed for other reasons. Here <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <font I was frustrated by Robert Wagner, usually a low-rating actor. Elsewhere, Wagner firmly illustrates his impressive range by portraying heroes, villains and morally flawed characters. Here, he can not decide whether to portray Jesse James as Gudi or BD ... so he is not very annoying. In his story John Carradine played a brief role as Jessica and his wife, a fictional Jacqueline preacher who had worked on the wedding ceremony. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in childhood by his uncle, the Methodist minister ... but perhaps this is a topping up of the second baptism. <br /> <br /> Jesse James was not a Robin Hood. (I think Robin Hood was Robin Hood, but this is another story.) JC James's only documented example never shared looting with anyone outside his own family. After some of his follow-up, he did not even jump to the rest of the gang. In this movie, he was shot dead after he promised to leave his bandit way for Jesse forever. In fact, on the night before his death, Jesse James and Ford brothers stole the horse, which Plati planned to plan Jesse the next day in City Bank robbery. For the preparation of most of his robberies, Jessie James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor people (probably the wrong legend) had the benefit of his hypothesis. I've crammed into a scene here, where the fantastic Jessie James was so refined by gull-dinner that she disliked an oil painting that nicely portrays Nues. <br /> <br /> 'The truth (not many!) Jesse's story is dishonest about James' deliberately a thief killer, and likewise dishonest about civil war. To work very impressive stunt, for a good montage and a few fine acting active, I'll rate 2 points out of 10 of this porn unfamiliar movie.
