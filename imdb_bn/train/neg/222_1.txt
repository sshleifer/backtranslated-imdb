As a single woman for 40 years, I consider this movie to be more humiliating and humiliating for more than 40 years of age, not all women of any age can be mentioned. It was a sad, merciful effort by a man to write a "chick flick" and to point out and it sadly failed. Andy McDowell was not the actress to start with her, but I did not have an existent "plot" (I even hate to mention it as a plot), she had no chance. There was no development of the character, there was no reason to feel sympathy / sympathy for any character, and there was no effort to make the film in realistic or credible way. And then there is an attractive straight lady compulsory male-imagination which is suddenly trying to try lesbianism - please <br /> <br /> <br /> I just do not want to get money back for my DVD rental, I too Those 112 minutes who want to return to my life. What a ripoff
