This is a movie that you think the creator will refuse to publish because it is very scary. Obviously they think that children are stupid and endless ads to be good to exploit and they think it's entertaining because it's fun. What's it with Wendy, McDonald's, M and M's, and Skylight's talking with buttons? There was no talking cartoon car. (Dr.) Clau is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. Why is Rupert's estate 'claw'? The author was on drugs when they wrote this scene? It seems that they (poorly) made Robo a cop cold, so that a person started Android thing in a criminal battle. I tried to return my money but there was a policy where I saw more than 30 minutes of movie then you will not be refunded. I'm sorry I saw that the whip was 30 minutes more. After informing the no-refund policy, I agreed to see the hazardous waste in the name of Inspector Gadget.
