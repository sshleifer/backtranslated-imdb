I warned everyone because the film should not be shown. It fails to meet an appropriate respect in such a great way that it is a humiliation of the memory of those brave men. The special effect was terrifying, I was not expected to praise military technology in the failure of the director's technology. How is a machine gun that can speed up the speed of 1 / 10th of every hour to 600 rupees per hour? How will the troops go forward when they have a grenade explosion? How can people survive when the artillery shells closed 20 feet away? How do artillery shells fall on either side of the road and the road itself is not? <br /> <br /> This inhumanity of the surgery not only insults me, it was the special situation and the inconsistency of the dialogues that I was shouting at the murder. I have a standard conversation with Yeh V Kisi, brother Hei, EC Lath Mata Morro and Hindustan from Pakistan She Jadad Majlum, and you are my command of the Loos Cross Mate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the director works without a script and it shows. There is no flow of movies. There is no growing progress from one war to another. There is no connection to the overall plan of war, later it is only a gun fight. Explanatory scenes are terrible. The army staff looks helpless. To make matters worse, the theater spent a four-hour long silent footage in order to fit the film within 3 hours.
