I foolishly bought this year's DVD cover almost a year ago and I said to myself, "Looks funny, plus Michael Clarke is Duncan, how can I lose!" I proceed to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for him. I took it at a friend's house and we both stood aghast at how bad it is written and played. Wooden performance is wide. Not all "delightful" and "outstanding" acting began to reach. After 90 minutes I was ashamed and covered my head, knowing that I never got 90 minutes or 15.99 dollars. I literally cried almost as well, because if that "comedy" could be considered I would rather not believe in the movie. My friend and I made a surprise to the horror of this film that he would have to look for it to understand just how bad it is. I saw him this year for the holiday season because he did not want to see it alone. This was a terrible mistake in my next, because I saw I became angry. I started crying in the movie, and I'm not talking about the movie time. Everyone knows that the movie has even fascinated them, even the ones they have seen have become the worst of them. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that can not save this movie. It is surprising that this image is not in the 100 list below in IMDB. Its rating (while writing this) 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
