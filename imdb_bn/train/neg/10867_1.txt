This is a movie that tells you two things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and direction) 2) It is so bad that I must leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It looks like my flip shot was shot with video. I very much believe that my friend who sees me is a rebellion against me. I noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; The crew must be left by members or something to do with this photo. One of the worst 3 movies I've seen. Hope the writer and director leave the business. Not even talented enough to advertise !!!!!
