How difficult is it to write a visual movie with Vince Von, Paul Jamait and Kevin Speacy? It is obviously very difficult for authors here. <br /> <br /> I still do not know how Santa is younger than Vince and looks 20 years old (who plays Big Brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in reality, it really is not a matter. Many scenes arise and arise from the scene; "Funny fantasy" scenes that are far beyond the drug, where no sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer had finally tried to go "Tiar Joker", which would have been suitable for anyone to move forward if it was appropriate. <br /> <br /> Wig, the main disappointment. I can see how some people can enjoy this address, since many will accept any garbage feeding them, but I would strongly encourage them to wait for the DVD in this regard. $ 23,978 worth it, it can get your family in the movie right now.
