I felt like I have been, the console is on, it does not fall for it. After reading the brilliant reviews (Sky was a film critic with Sky for years, having a favorable review for him should have a lot of companions in favor of the press) I have a strong acting, atmosphere, mystery, strong characterization, the development of curiosity, and poetic moments. Sadly, '16 year alcohol 'does not give a promise to critics, most often, instead of the special effects of sugar low-budget, these qualities are dedicated (for what was the closed sibaweb scene?), Unrealistic war dances and silly narrative of mind, clich√© Editing and camera angle. <br /> <br /> '16 Year Alcohol 'starts interesting with some beautiful location shots in Scotland, but it's straight from here to the bottom. Unfortunately, instead of spending building for some time, creating characters that we can take care of, or create suspense - the director begins to crave with the self-motivated heavy-body voice-over. The main characters are so disrespectful and very poorly played - the audience does not care about what's happening to them, great actors are disappointed ... like this movie! To make things even worse, 'respect' (directors are usually assigned to pay their debts to the former executives) is completely clean or uncomfortable. The soundtrack is the only thing that picked me up and kept me in the movie, even when it failed to connect with some other time in support of the dramatic story. <br /> <br /> For some reason the movies have been increasingly flawed and quite honestly annoying. <br /> <br /> I think I liked the attempt of radioactive reality in the film, but even when it was intertwined with strange and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes it was also destroyed. You do not need any big budget to create real-time movies, so much about how much money has been given to this movie, half a million is not a small amount ... so no exception! Sometimes I wonder the actor ... or their agents are thinking! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
