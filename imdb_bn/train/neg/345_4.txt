It can not be Mandy Shafar's last film. Someone, nothing! :-( <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, brother Worked very nicely, and she did not even enter the film until half of the time, and please keep Mandy in a few more movies! She is so beautiful to bury her career at this young age, hey .... <br /> <br /> If one thinks of two specific criticisms (apparently nobody likes this movie), firstly, the tragic tunes Seeing what you wanted to see, and looking back, was very annoying: Hollywood: Please stop giving your fans luck at the perfect time that climax comes right, it's a fool, write a better script so that Do not use the Lam Plot device that you do not have to do. If your script is not good enough to stand with it, then Do not make T. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen does not fall in Traci's nail for the trail hit trick that he had already tray. The film can trash more but mercy forbids it. Indeed, I do not hate what others seem like. It was not enough reason to create it until it was a car to showcase beautiful mandi. Oh, and nobody thinks she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how could you say she was not sexy?!? One or the other needs our glasses, and I do not think about it. <br /> <br /> More Mandy (Do not get confused with "Moore, Mandy" - though I want to see him again. -) <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <: - D:
