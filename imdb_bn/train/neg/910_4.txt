The story line was straightforward and easy to follow and it was a cute comedy in a point where it was just boring. The viewers felt a little fun but I like the more intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were several Swedish actors in the film and their performance was good considering script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this movie may be worth taking a look.
