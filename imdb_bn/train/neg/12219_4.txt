It was a weird movie. It's a pretty good start. Like our psychopaths, strong sound track behind Gore and Myam's flash images has worked. <br /> <br /> Her "Down Reduce" comes. Here, I used to say that I was really about Chess "B". Poor acting, I mean, how hard is it to put guns and work like yours? These guys can not. After the sight of our psychopath's death, we got the opening credit and the film started ... <br /> <br /> This bad performance at this time is big boobs, sometimes bucket of blood and poorly-sighted scenes. </ br> <br /> I said, I gave this movie four because in spite of its flaws, it kept such a cry that I could not make a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it in movies but I must admit it is worse.
