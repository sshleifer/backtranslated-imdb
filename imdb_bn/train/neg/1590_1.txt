Hah! So this movie got "Next Action Stars". I'm not glad that I did not participate and win ... <br /> <br /> It's not funny that anyone looks at the first 10 seconds! About a movie? Come on, come on! Just look at that title! I saw this movie (or the part of this "teleplay" when it was made for TV and we could not see the whole thing) One evening my military service and the audience with me had an average hajj-paj once that show was something like a las vegas for some girls Watch clock series. So the bar was not really high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and not because of a great script; D. But the originality of the movie, acting, scripting and everything else makes it a movie better, but it turns the channel to Las Vegas Makes it easy to do (or was it CSI? Do not remember) without any complaints from the rest of the team. And it is rare (! ) This film is not for heaven! If it is on TV, check it out and think about it. What is my outcome? Well, Joel Silver actually made the best movie there (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to say something) Can say that the producers do not give quality to the film, they pay for the directors, and the reason for selling this film is only because it goes to Joel Silver. Citrati it is obvious that a great effort to conceal errors. Really crew who made it.
