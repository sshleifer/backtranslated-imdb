This is one of the worst movies ever really made. I consider myself a fan of a huge zombie film, and generally bad acting, a stupid story of the hair "special effects" and the second-rate movies that you can face, as long as the film has a good environment / story / suspension or offer. . This one basically has no positive aspects and third or fourth rate, probably worse. On weekdays, my friends and some friends made a small film and certainly did a good job (no zombie films) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not a different thing, even fun. Really bad and unexpected special effects, clothes that look like ordinary people (except white white leather on their face), many fake blood (I like reality much, combination of reality and Jabby films are controversial, but presented only fools are stupid). The camera is quite long with feeding scenes, it becomes annoying and you will not be surprised, but do not be surprised why Jamie uses Weepons (!) To kill their victims. I will not go to dubbing details (others did so). Although I'm from Germany and at least a bit strange about the original version, I will not waste much time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it as far as possible.
