A young American woman visits her Irish roots and her possesses fends off a drudid wing. Looks confusing, but after an interesting start, I was lost and was amazed by the fact that most of the time is going. Looks like the movie is looking at both sides - do we see its Irish-American woman traveling to deal with the alcohol problem, or do we see a horrific glimpse of a bad witch coming back from the past? The director can not decide The two do not seem to be in jail and eventually you will not get anywhere. This could be done so well and looked tense towards the end of the story. It was the most annoying and frustrating.
