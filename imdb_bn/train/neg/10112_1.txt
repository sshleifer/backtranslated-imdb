Each year, I look at some low-budget amateur movies directly with hate-to-DVD hobbies, which none of their right mind wants to see. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, a lot of forgotten, a lot of forgotten. Will I ever remember forever as one of the most hopelessly ridiculous 'horror' movies I've ever seen? Actually I have not recovered from the experience of seeing it yet. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems like a little strange dream. I saw what I saw? Why Police Work Out A Warehouse? Did Voodoo priestesses really recommend eating 'zombies' cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a 'good' movie then I will not recommend the zombie nation and I will not recommend it as 'very bad'. However, if you are perhaps most likely to be entertained by the uncertainty chance of watching the abysmal film ?? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me that I've ever seen the worst movie, I would say Jabba race. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it's a big crime to make a boring movie worse than bad, and Wolfy Lomell is credited with creating a movie that could actually prevent you from being ineligible. He is actually a digital age Ed Wood Jr. and I can not wait to wait for another film to be made such a series of ridiculous.
