Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, the end of the world is an exquisitely cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Full story here: A scientist has received messages from the place (A La Indonesia Day). Messages are going to be like a huge disaster, and then the scientist has heard from the radio after a huge earthquake happened in China. He thinks that these messages have something to do with disasters around the world, so they are trying to determine messages (and who are sending messages in space). The picture that he and his wife finally come from a convent in the message. They look for it. Everything looks normal, played by a bored Christopher Lee with the priest. But the scientist is helpless and really believes that the messages are coming and going to that convention. So he and his wife secretly go back to the Convent, where they are surrounded by aliens in the disguise of priests and nuns. They are held against their will and alien aliens played by Lee forces them to get some of their needs for returning to their planet. When the aliens get a special element, the aliens get together on their home planet in any way by combining the transporter platform. Lee, the last left-handed, tells the couple that the world will be destroyed due to Alien's decision. Lee walked into the transporter and he was gone. Couple, looking at analysts to show stock footage of natural disasters around the world, decided to follow the aliens. Because the world has been destroyed, the couple does not see any point in staying behind so that they walk on the transit and disappear. The last shot of the film is a papaya mash planet in the explosion. The end <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a dirty movie in my life. It's the worst movie I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are the two worst heroes ever screened. They do not care about anything. They see the world disaster on observation and "what the hack, how the world needs?" They do not even try to stop them or do anything to make them better. This story might have worked if everything in the film was a destructive feeling, but the action and the atmosphere were irrational. The performers and the people following this low flicker are going to pay them, so much so that you can close their cards when they stop and feel almost as they come back to work. I did not expect too much with this movie because it produced a Charles Band, but I do not expect it to be bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And he mentions Starships Invitations. Well, I'm sorry Chris but the Starshit Investigation was really fun. Starship Investment is terrible but awesome entertainment. The end of the world, many, much worse: it is neutral and inactive, any entertainment value anyway.
