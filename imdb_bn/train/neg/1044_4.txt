"Victor Vargas Raising" is one of those light, family movies that you can see and at the same time N.Y. Times can also crossword puzzle. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a Taco and Corona, you do not have to "break" the DVD. Let's just roll it, 'you really do not want to be missing something important. No twists, turns, or tension. This is not actually a racial movie, it is a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that can be Latino. They could be any ethnic group. It made a very little difference. I've seen it all before a zillion times. Just plug a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family, or an Irish family. Only signs and names were different. If the Vargas family was called Bush or Clinton and was a Presbyterian, the film would have been a full graduate. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics do not get direct locos here. Some said the Spanish Harlem. Some bronze, and another Brooklyn. Life Long, like New York, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seems that the family did not meet anyone other than Latins. They lived in an intimate / detached little enclave. Some interactions with non-Latinoos may create some tension, interest or tension. Do you remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> and now for critical cinematography. I do not know what my TV or what was, but all the indoor shots looked very awkward. Suitable, furniture, and mouth were all ORANGE. What did that mean? And suitable. I did not look quite cramped. Here some people mention that there was a large room in old APT / tenement. Well, maybe 50 years ago. A landowner can break 2 or 3 small prototypes and shrink as soon as the immigrants can enter them. <br /> <br /> Another annoying thing .... In the second half of this week I have seen and criticized that a teenage boy is seen as a "zircon off". What does this private sex law require for us? Please leave me! What's up with these managers? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a beautiful little movie. The young Latino actors were nice to see a break in giving an opportunity to show a break and show their talent, which they did. But the authors provide them with a flat, unclear script to work with, given them below. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "fast forward" button.
