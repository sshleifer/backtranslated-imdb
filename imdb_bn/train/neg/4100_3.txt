A bit of a frustrating movie, I used to say: The act is readily, in any way. In most cases, I did not realize that the face expression in the face was related to the expression or the expression of the scene. The viewer must believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) in an angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> They do things and say something that does not come from anywhere: Character Andrew character complains of sending signals to each other at his parents' dinner. Then he rose up and out of the storm, saying to his dad "Do not touch me, you f ***!" Maybe, if we looked at the estimation, we would understand that all that comes from here, but there is no preview, so we have some reasons for the sea! <br /> <br /> A strange, wonderful thing that Andrew needs to go to old stone food, sitting at the bottom looking at the "still water" below; Then he reached his jeans pocket and drained one pack of cigarettes and lights. She did this same thing in film three times; I guess we can see it as a boring and angry thing to do? Maybe once, but three times? Even four times, I might have lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, he recently found out that he had accepted; This movie has taken place very quickly, so there is no idea about any such dramatic change that might be due to this discovery. <br /> <br /> I think the movie has a kind of feeling like Linchian, but for the first time the director is trying to run such a scale. His career so early in a mountain?
