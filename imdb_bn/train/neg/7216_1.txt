I love western I could see them all day long "The Good, the Bad and the Augle" is my favorite time. I saw "Silverado" probably just another day for the 8th because it was featured in CMT. However, this movie, without any doubt, is the worst western I've ever seen. The acting was terrible around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking things. The only good part I can remember is the handsome canteen girl. The very striking long break in the dialogue seemed deliberate to make time for the film to be made only acceptable. This movie was not even valuable for the new rental fees offered at our local movie rental store. I was robbed and if I had such things felt worthy of getting a refund. Finally I hate to see a movie in the end because I end it because. I turned half way off through it because it's so bad. Do the job better if you decide to make another decision. This type of movie that has the potential of making the people turn west.
