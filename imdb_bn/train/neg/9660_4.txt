When this film was first shown on television, I had high hopes that we would finally see a decent film like the experience of the American soldiers about World War I. Unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> It should have been a good movie about WWI. Although it was made for television, it is clear that a real effort was made to use proper equipment and props. However, the makers of this movie borrowed freely from a few well-crafted films, though the writings and directions were badly poor. The trial of war criminals is like an arrogant general who does not clearly show any risks to the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that although the Bad General has been abundant, most War Unit generals have seen their own lot of war and are not stupid about the experience of the average feeling? The first part of this movie seems to be "the path of glory" with American uniforms. Without that "great way" was emotively gripping. Thereafter, there was also a prisoner of American soldiers by Chamberlain's charge (from the climb) and even from the "thin red line" with a ring of enemy soldiers. But when the soldier was caught in "The Thin Red Line", he was alone. This movie created a ring around a new prisoner in the middle of a war. <br /> <br /> If they use the military advisor, they ignore him. Although the actors (and I never forget that they are acting, the actors) I have not seen military tactics much. German soldiers will attack and American soldiers will shoot. And appeared to use any tactics to attack the infamous storm Troopers, who were visually blind. Strategies in the real war made the violent soldiers so effective. But the silicon scene was the attack of German flamethrower. In this scenario the German Flamethroire operators were walking across the line towards Americans. If that was true, they would not have gotten closer enough to use their flamethrowers before they were all dropped by defender's bullets. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But it's still frustrating. But in fact, how I was stopped in this blaze was that the movie makers seem to think that the general anti-war anti-military angle is important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, though they stumble and tremble, believe in what they are doing and instead it can be over-crowded. My grandfather served in World War I and although he died four years before I was born, he has been told how proud he was to serve him.
