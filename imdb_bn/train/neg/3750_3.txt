After a long wait, I could take a little closer look at this experimental linch ... and unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for a hard hardy fan of a dead body, I thought it was really tiring .... <br /> <br /> There is nothing, long, long, long, painful break where there is nothing, long, monologue where nothing It is not said either and the whole thing ends with the viewer, do not know, care, what happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> The alliance of a Mohalland drive was - the blonde girl and girl were very Dian and Rita-Iski, and a lost highway moment that happened with conversations with some important events but could not be clearly spoken. Unfortunately, it's all very flexible and very dust, nothing is happening, it's very forgotten and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget that I saw it. Sorry David!
