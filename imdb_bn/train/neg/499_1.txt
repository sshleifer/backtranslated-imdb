Harry's channel is nothing but the boyfriend soft porn gothic flight from 10am to 4am per night, but the 'fear' factor in them is very limited, if anyone exists. Actually I am sure that this channel will win the more pensive pocket lot than anything else. <br /> <br /> Bloodsicker thinks Dans deserves special mention because it seems to me that the neutral lower channel is the full channel. I can not even start to tell you how bad this image is, but to fill the minimum 10 lines claimed by this site, I will at least let it go. <br /> <br /> Firstly the title is confusing and does not correspond any type of action on the screen. In fact, this film can also be known as 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper'. At least they used toothbrush ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no bloodshed for miles around and there is no worse dance, not one. I'm sure they made two different films by mistake. The more appropriate title would be, 'Horny Italian countdown takes five people to horrible sickle and fools us for 90 minutes.' Yes, it looks good. <br /> <br /> The actress is terrible and dubbling, and in the character of Semur, the man who was almost like a wooden man on his walk, was in his character ... unreal. <BR> <br /> The only saveable quality of this film is a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very attractive herteroxes sexual scenes, and the attraction that attracts every single female character closes her kit. Bonus <br /> <br /> Run away from this a massive birth. No vampire, no dance, no cruel or horrific nature scenes, and God will never see it in any way on earth. <br /> <br /> There is no word to lie, this picture can be set up, you can stop motion pictures for life.
