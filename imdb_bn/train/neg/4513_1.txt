Although the book was not accurate about the real situation, it still carries Japan's ideas. I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this movie was in Japan, because it does not seem to be the least Japanese. Almost everything was terrible. I admire the performers were good but the scope of saving it can not stand. Before the film began, I was surprised that just a few days after the movie was opened in Japan, there were only ten people on Friday night. In 30 minutes, I was surprised. So I have the right to criticize me. The entire film laughs with disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. All the people who saw walking outside the movie saw confusion and frustration in their face. <br /> <br /> To the makers of this movie, you give me two hours.
