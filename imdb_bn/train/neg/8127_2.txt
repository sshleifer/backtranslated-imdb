Currently, this movie has been listed as the 42nd worst film on the IMDB list - exactly why I hired it from Netflix. However, I regret to report that when the film is bad, then there are not enough bad enough to be listed as about 100 movies to be listed in almost 100 movies. I personally see this is worse than at least 100 films. Very rarely a brilliant approval, but did not meet the expected level of horrors included in this notorious list. <br /> <br /> The movie is played with Stuart Moss and Marianne Mac Andrew in their belted honeymoon (in the beginning), they are married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with the bat and they force to go near a cave. Once there, they behave very, very stupid (the Hallmark of the bad film) and biting the bat very soon. According to this movie, bats love to attack humans and there is a vampire bat in the US - both of which are not true. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, after biting, people are not even bothered to go to hospital !! The first thing in someone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but this is not boob. Soon, he is a hostage - yet he is still not interested in seeking help! Again you think that this movie must be a stupid couple in the history !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> However, then it was too late and its attack became more violent and he killed people by eating blood. When the man is absolutely clear that the man is a mad killer machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapes for her brain), she refuses to believe in dangerous - after stealing an ambulance even after attacking the man and running one off the road police Car !! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, Moses is going through this episode, his eyes come back and he feels like a normal person. Curious, however, he developed bat-like hands several times, and in the end, he used some great customists to see him bat-like. The fact that this was really Chess, the film would be a merit 1. Finally, a wrapper that turned hardly any sense, the wife turned out to be a crazed bat lady illogical and had a bat swarm to kill bad Sheriff. How these arrangements were made, Mus and Mc Andrew believed that the film would help their career in any way - even though they both played a bit of role in TV since 1974. <br /> <br /> Very stupid. The plot depends on people acting foolish and in no sense and acting in a very foolish way to be firmly realistic. Not a good movie, but it's not always the worst movie. Note: For some reasons, IMDB shows a graphic for three DVD sets for IT elites and it is a two-part bit webpage for the public. Though But the public was seen with the title "It's Alive", but the two films are not related. Problems are difficult to understand - especially both of them came in 1974, but the movie I played with Stuart Moss and Marianne Mc Andrew and other films John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
