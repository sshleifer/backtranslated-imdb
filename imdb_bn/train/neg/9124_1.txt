This may not be Peter's worst movie, but I think it's the most depressed. The vendors, especially the sun makeup as Nyland Smith, seem to have just gone under chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchura, he looks very well and spend most of the film (except for the exceptionally annoying scenes where he jumps with electric currents) at the end of the weight loss of all the makeups. Supporters became tired and Sid Caeser's presence was even "impressions" without his impressive references. (A brilliant spot: This will be a final motion photo, in which a big motion picture will insult Asia ... or, in that case, mark a non-Asian as one!). The picture looks surprisingly cheap, along with sophie photography and drubbing sets - even if the Wish-Bank Elvis number finally shows the cut rate. Only the amazing Helen Mirin and the tall, thin, nervous people who got their pants wet, this sad case adds no shock to life. After all, this film is an extraordinary humorous death, and even an unconcerned document of its death provides an eerie premonition.
