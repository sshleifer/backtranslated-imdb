I really wanted to like this movie. It's a nice jail setting, conspiracy theories, bloodbathing zombie, a totally terrifying 80-touch and it's actor John Saxon, who played bad (you've guessed it) a manager of a bad guy's efforts. It reminds me of some (favorite) Italian horror flicks to me. But the side is very wood and there is no night / night scary. It just goes on and on and on, and then it has ended (logically). More mysteries and more brave visual and a godly classical has been sealed as his fate.
