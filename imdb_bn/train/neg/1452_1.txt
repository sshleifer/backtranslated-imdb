From 1919 to 1933, Germany appears to double the WWII check capitol. Oh sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's 2003, how funny. <br /> <br /> It is one of the most horrific history films in the earliest past. Roham is more heady than Adolf and looks very good, Gering looks at age 40, when she is only 23 years old and "Fuhrer" always seems to be 56. And buildings, people and even houses were sometimes young people. Especially in 1919, many of the houses in Germany were almost new (WWI did not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then Reichstagsbuilding. Sometimes this building has not been near urban canyon. And it may sound as a miracle to you: In 1933, the Greater Berlin Fire Brigade was the owner of many vehicles with engines, some even with a turn table stairs, but someone with a hand pump <br /> <br /> <br /> Things: What was the Pellemobile fort at the final order? For me this is "Adolf's Adventure in Wonderland"
