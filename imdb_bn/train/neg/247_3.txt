Yesterday 9am my friend was in the camping trailer and we were so excited to see South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, the South Park was sitting in the air at 10:30 and we now decided to spend time showing show, Father of the Pride. Not saying that I saw episodes. For the first time I saw it, I found something unreasonable and strange for it, so I thought, 'Holy sh * t, I have a football game tomorrow, so I have to stop showing stupid cartoons.' But yesterday, I tried to give the proud father a second chance. I find it out of a full rip of Simpsons, only instead of replacing yellow human characters by lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing is I wonder why it's getting the TV-14 rating. I see Simpsons too much porn, and this show is just sexually obscene (obscure) jokes. Simpsons is much more violent (Halloween special) and crude. I heard that the maker of the series ordered Shakek 2, I got the news for him: Shake 2 was even better and I think he is very much about family matters. However, I must admit that the proud father laughs at me (laughing three times once). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think everyone's proud. I do not hate it, but I do not like it. I saw better than 'Simpsons'. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
