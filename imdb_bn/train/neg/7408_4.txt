I'm not sure why I clicked "Explosive", because in most truths there is not enough explanation in the film which is enough to know what it is supposed to spoil. Apparently it's mostly distributed. Well, some 80s trapped without rubber-mask monsters. I will say now that I have never seen the band Lord before watching this, nor did I know about the times that they won Eurovision. Apparently these monster band members, quite a lot of people at their level. Anyway. However, I do not know this while watching. I was just mostly passable / monster / passive. Just <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm sure there is a semi-coherent interpretation behind the on-screen which I see, but it may not really be good. It has probably come to mind it has been incredibly lame. This action keeps the audience fairly well enough to entertain, although half the entertainment factor is good for voting right in this movie. <br /> <br /> I explain it a lot, especially since it's four mainly because I got a good smile on it. It must be that the mood I had, but I think Hellla is funny for some reason. Then I saw the movie on the Internet and knew that there was no reason to know what it was supposed to be. That made me even more happy, and my score raised an additional half point on 4/10. <br /> <br /> This is not terrible, not particularly coherent, but it is visually and intelligently beautiful. Above all, away from the necessary, but watchable. Do not expect too much and do not expect to make any sense and if you are in the right mood it can give you relaxation.
