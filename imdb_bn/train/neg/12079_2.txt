The poor will will be rolling over his grave if he could adapt to this awesome German-TV adaptation of his classic game. It is clear that very little money is spent on it. Passed off as a stage riser, set a catwalk and some randomly set column. English voice actors occasionally dumb in English, with English mumbling their lines. The whole production it had an incredibly dark and dreary feeling. And where was the film in the film? MST 3 receives fair treatment of this tragic product. <br /> <br /> should you? I do not want this movie was in the first place.
