The video of "piano teacher" was hired which did not know anything other than what was written in the video box. I did this with some horrific reason because the earrings that the awards won the movies are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls into the next section. Almost a quarter of the way I said myself loudly, "This movie is boring." Almost half the way I was speaking to myself, "Where did I look before?" I found it in three quarters of the mark. Despite its literary sources, this film was originally restored by Robert Olman (1969), and better, "That Cold Day Park." Although the story was obviously different and Altman's work was more intriguing. There were fewer-known and characteristic research, but the two films were thematic identical. There will be no "new" seen in this production. Each of its aspects has already been done: The character of character outside the control of increasing self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" 1992). A contrasting and destructive 'love' culminating in an operative (near) death scene (David Kreinberg's "M. Butterfly" 1993); Unusual cruel sex scene (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" 1986); And so Therefore, I have considered this picture "disgusting," "disconnected," etc. that the film is a very disappointing movie that has made the audience feel uncomfortable and with the sole purpose of being clearly successful. . However, I basically lack the experience of watching the film, this type of feedback feature. See enough movies and you'll actually see it eventually. And when I actually saw the 'R-rate' version, I suspect that extra scenes will change the overall opinion of my "piano teacher". <br /> <br /> Technically, the film does not have any merit. Some very good cameras work and the lighting is excellent. Isabella Hupert's credible performance helps save it from time to time. I have seen this film in Hanayke's movie and if I want to see more then there will be the same opinion that I have to return: a funny director but almost no other can be different. . Ratings: 4/10.
