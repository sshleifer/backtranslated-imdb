This latest admin-movieman tries to deal with his first (advertising) initiative, often a cultural theme - the old topic of discussion by deliberate romance (deliberately). However, for normal mixing of bis / g scores, dialogs, dances, dramas, etc., the usual trends (and the absorption of indigenous odds) in the 'pepper, spice and sugar' drop very little. There are not many inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repeat movie thru out (after all the lead character's a cooking) followed. But there is a problem - no story! Yes, surprise! Some people forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh played extra characters in extra gambling (extra). When does this guy really stop ?? How much 60-somethings feel almost even when teased by a nubile 30-something ??? The painful mind is yes, but surely the strangers? And only? Sorry, soul ?! The only inductive role played by Paramesh Rawal in the film A new new concept of the director lacks any sense of realityism in his new fangled discovery all caught up. Wherever we do not present with any real-life problems or problems, a pair may face it, except that it is only a primary barrier to marry. The sub-plot of the child with cancer (the son's first love of Bachelor) does not go anywhere and unless there is a bit of satire, otherwise this inspiration presentation quickly closes with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, nice try but still not quite so.
