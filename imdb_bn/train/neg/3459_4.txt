"Cuts" is a film by the filmmakers of filmmaking. It is much more in the "Scream" mold, a satirical, self-referential horror flick, which falls on me to the least ridicule, because it is still a horror movie, which refers to movies. <</ br> <br /> But it was not without his skin. Well, whatever a charm. Molly Rinwald as a hateful, evil American actress was fantastic every minute to work with amateur Australian film crew. He was so convinced that it was not a tempting task to believe, even though everyone associated with "Kat" said that he was beautiful to work. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene in her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. <br /> <br /> However, some cuts of "cut", some beef beef (surprisingly surprisingly), and finally .. okay. Another bad horror picture
