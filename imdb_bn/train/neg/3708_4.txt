Lens Burton below the earth, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and he gets to another body. Lance is a white man, Charles Wellington gets the body. So Lance Charles has some things in the body. The movie has a few smiles, but it's not something special. This is a good movie if you are a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, 2005 animated comedy, good. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock did something better than that. This will give you a smile almost four times in the movie. And it's not really funny funny funny You can laugh at yourself and you can be frustrated, but you will not be laughing to laughing clearly.
