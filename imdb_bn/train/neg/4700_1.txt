I totally hate the movie It was so annoying. They will get some acting texts ... No, wait, that will not help because the wolf brothers are a retards band of people. You know why I'm here though I'm a good brother band? They want to warn people before watching a movie on mobile phones so that NBB does not get any money from them, so they can not make an amateur fool-song that any old person could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the music songs retarded, they are sung badly. Okay, I'm closing the movie here ... Anyway, it was boring and they played terribly. Although it became really difficult, it was not funny. I think they deserve some credit for it ... well, movies do not value your time. Just look at his rating. The film (and series) is very distressing that has half the brain for anyone. Seriously, if you like it, you should go to watch movies where the actors actually work, not splitting their lines into a monitor. I'm at the play club in my school and some people are actually better than nets and Alex. Hurry up early too late! I seriously thought that Harbi is very good compared to this part of the Fully Loaded Poppy. I do not even know why I went through half of that picture. I do not think it's a movie too ...
