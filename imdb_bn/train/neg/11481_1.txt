If they can get Ed Asner, why do not they get any other actor who goes to the same church as the producer? And why he was not in danger when the drama is the wise to throw the character of the elderly Rishi The old man was forced to hit out of pride and so the young man would feel guilty for leaving him with a long time disability. I guess why the main character denies money and why he works like a dog in old age, even when he is volunteer for extra work. D-bag lover is a bad guy because he is a long distance boyfriend but why a soldier is good The reason for him to be jealous, he is good reason to keep him in control of his own city and protective, manipulate father. All the characters that are meant to be loved are not and everyone else is 'bad' boyfriend. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a saw mill worker?
