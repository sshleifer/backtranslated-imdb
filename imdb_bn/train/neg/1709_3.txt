I myself think a copy of this movie is considered as the alternative title of 'Junkle Bloodbath' with the 1964 film. On the contrary, this movie actually has a better rating than the previous headline; Which might mean the other is really bad! This film is very bad; Obviously, you will not go to a movie that calls itself 'Zombie Bloodbath' and hopes to see a nice composition and is perfectly placed with the holes displayed above the headline ... but it all seems too old and tired, which acts abusive and The stupid plot is not helped by the line. It's just your average nuclear expansion that makes people zombie etc. This image closes with a sequence that shows people melt and tells you a lot about what it says; Low quality junk rubbish. There is a lot of gossip in the film, and it's really good work, otherwise the film was really annoying. Zombie Zombie looks very cheap in Bloodbath, and has definitely been combined by inexperienced filmmakers! The main effect seems to be the Romero Doder of the Dead, although it is actually only something that actually features the characteristics of Jamie and Gore. It boils all over a usually predictable and dull end and overall I can say it was not affected by it!
