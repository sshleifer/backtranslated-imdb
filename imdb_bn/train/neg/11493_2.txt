Storebaker is probably the worst TV mini series on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is intolerable and the historical background is mostly meaningless: only two examples: VISB has three houses. Instead, it was a major city at this time, it is already the best day passed by. Second, Hambert could never be a city of pirate care in the Baltic Sea. There was no access to the Baltic Sea of ​​Hamburg, then the capital of that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than: Directions! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to point to a movie like this? Impossible, there was no one trustworthy scene, fights were ridiculous and I could not laugh at the most harsh scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how a major television station could be so incapable.
