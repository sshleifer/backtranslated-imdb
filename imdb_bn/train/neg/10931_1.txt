I went to see this film with quite a few expectations, figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff. Sadly, even that was not there. If I wanted to walk fast, I could sit through the film. I went with my two kids (10 and 13 years old) and even they asked, "How much?" After finally lasting, I am surprised that this script will be approved. Even reliable Fred Wild could not save the conversation, state joke, and inactive plot. I would suggest that anyone who wrote and directed this movie (I used this word) would have to drop their local community college for an online screen writing class or a local movie. At least, there are many books for instruction, screenwriting and film production that teach them about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.
