The standard "paint-by-number" monster rental is full of a bunch of routine plot devices from large animal movies. It seems that some people have somebody else, some of whom have been written to anyone. The agreement contained any plot lines and letters that were scripts in the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are so clich√©-ridden, that you can play a game of "lasting like monster food" after less than ten minutes, and possibly every single right - so that they will be destroyed so that . Many of the characters are illusory, you root the animals to stop them. Some of the main characters include: A Billy Idol Clone, who surfs with sharks, a loud loudouth brat who flashing bankrolls, a Captain Ahab guy with a coupon, and Ahab's girlfriend who sleazy dance on a bar. Oh, and anger management therapy requires a big, big animal. <br /> <br /> With the way, people have many arguments, beautiful girls roam with wet T-shirts, couples come out of foreign beaches, explosions occur, a temple remains visible, and sticky faces drop by pirates. <br /> <br /> In most cases entertainment, but one thing bothered me: when the others died, the character's arrogance. After a violent posthumous, they made a one-fishing joke. I could hear the rim shot almost. <br /> <br /> Overall, okay, if you waste 90 minutes, and you want to smile in so-good-movies. Otherwise, you want to skip this one.
