To avoid the US version. It is with the US footage associated and perhaps the worst dubbing you possibly have done by New York amateur. Sinking is so bad that it sounds like the mystery science theater 3000. I think a black man from Bronx spoke with Chibo. I did not see the whole picture, it was bad. Instead of this version of America, look like the other The Streitfighter or Karate Warriors of Chiba.
