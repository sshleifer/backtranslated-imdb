<br /> <br /> I thought "Walker" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong. Painful, painful and unreasonably slowly, after 40 minutes of the film, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour may be contracted in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's almost amazing that even the arguments Scenes are so easy and emotional. Maybe it is because of the upper lip of the higher social classes? <br /> <br /> It is so tragic that "Waqar" became so annoying mess in spite of being so tough boring. Poor plot and even worse pacing blame it.
