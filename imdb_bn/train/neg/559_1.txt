I have seen this picture in the London premiere, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I hope to have something which was humblely entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Institute" was not a great movie and is still a "smiling classic" but it was entertaining.

No She clearly has plastic surgery on her face, and this movie is somewhat unexpected to cut her hair. He did not come as soft or genuine as he did the original - which is an evil temptation and the whole point of everything. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performance is terrible to the horror - and Michael Katon-Jones (usually a safe director - who does not always work great but handles the proper films) officially provided his first true turkey; <br /> <br /> I heard that the film has gone through a number of editing sessions, and it is very clear from the beginning.

I saw "Gogli", "I saw a son of a mask" - and even though I do not want to "smith" this movie, I can speak with my authority (which you do not do on these crushing failures <br /> <br /> Five minutes before the movie began, the stone went away and the theater started throwing things. A bellahla In particular humiliating and insulting not only inside the nightclub-type screen when the scene. <br /> <br /> "The Institute of Basic 2" - basically, it was very bad.
