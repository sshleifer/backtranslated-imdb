I guess I'm only "the gateway to the Virgin" which blames the giant confusion. You do not expect to have a nice movie just like a movie when you see a juicy and proudly titled title like this, and the first impression is only sure to be extra sure when showing a mid-80s movie from Japan. Now, many submerged and sick filmmakers are working in Japan, but Kazuo Komizu surpasses all of them and their full abusive and trilogy of sickness, along with aggressive gender and sad abuses of young girls, surpasses them. Even without trying to tell a story, "A Virgin's Antilles" simply portrays the UN's amazing semi-pornographic sexuality and real poor pregnancy influences, which do not even like the absence of the deadly foe of Chasey 80. A bunch of photographers and their fashion models are intensely involved with the scene of a dirty perverted scene because of the absurd sexuality with the strangely young girl. She dumps him even after climaxing (usually) one minute and she even divides her with other women, even if she begs to stay I do not get it. Is this supposed to be a common male representation fantasy? Because it's really clich√©d and wrong. However, return to bunch of horny photographers and docile models. Surprised by the fog on the way home, the group lives in a deserted country where they are more sexually and ultimately they are victims of a ridiculous sex-monster who kill them all. Performed performance amateur, the dialogue is inactive and the direction of primitive and comizhou is weak and uninspired. I can tolerate all of the woman's illicit sexual images, but I am close to closing the film as per the uncertainly encouraged wrestling sequence. In a man, he brutally hits, kicks and throws them around the girls and makes him panic until he gives up his pants until he cries and screams with pain. This sequence, my submissive views, the absolute lowest points of Asian absorption movie. One even avoided and even boycotted.
