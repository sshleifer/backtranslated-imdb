From what I read about the film, I was excited to support a movie with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie is done abnormally. Especially writing! There is not a chance in a movie without good writing. The author / director said in an interview that the title does not want to give up how it relates to the story. Believe it was a big surprise. I was waiting for the release of teenage / young adult back-story, but it never happened. Anyone who has gone through divorce, I was very disappointed. This film did not have any consolation for me when I first went through an emotional anxiety that the divorce could bring you life as a Christian!
