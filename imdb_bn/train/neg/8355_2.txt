Wanda Nevada is a Pubescent Fantasy film using 1979 concepts with the idea of ​​illegal romance for the 13 year old girls. The scripts, pacing, and sides of the direction are horrible. Action order defy trust. Characters generally speak to simplified fiction among the movies that move below 10, but there are several sexual references associated with Shield's character and graphic death. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy in some level, but never funny, an adventurous picture but the plot and action are vague, and a child film, but the real possibility of pedophilia and child rape. It wants to be a friendly picture, an age photo, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a itinerary, and a western. The overall effect is the massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time, if you do not want to see a great many awesome shots in the Grand Canyon. It just handles fine work.
