What horrible writing and acting is. There is no personality. What, can not you make a good movie with a single character? Hmmm, it was made in Castaway with conversations. <br /> <br /> So this child travels to meet his father. The child, Jason, takes a plane and pilot's heart attack and the mid-flight die. So the child crashed into a lake and survived. Then he wanders around, until he is rescued and lives in the desert. <br /> <br /> He had to bear beer twice. For the first time, he jumped into the lake. The second time he makes a bear and bear spears out of a branch. With two shots of fake blood coming out of beer chest, I reminded Monty Python of "The Hello Grail". <br /> <br /> The child also decides to kill a porcupine with predictive results. <br /> <br /> <br /> joke.
