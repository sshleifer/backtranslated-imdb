It is one of the violent movies found on Lifetime TV, it portrays the disgusting woman's hateful behavior in a touching manner. Along with such unexpected movies as "burning bid", "enough," or "slow," this film is trying to show a scandalous criminal and the viewer why he is not such a bad man. Give us a break! My questions to the filmmakers are here: Laytono was a man and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, did you create a photo of a sympathetic and compassionate picture of this picture? Answer: Hell no. Imagine the switching of genes in this movie, and then you can see yourself why it and others consider it an ineffective garbage here. Gender is switched, there will be no effort to empathize with the perpetrator. Instead, we would probably depict a young woman portraying a terrible and terrible human being, her playful behavior, her imprisonment for her and her victim of breastwash, Stockholm syndrome. The only reason that Late√±o did not take the same treatment in the film because of his sexuality. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Very easy No IFS, ands or buts He is a criminal who is in prison, and deserves our ridicule and humiliation, but certainly not our sympathy or sympathy.
