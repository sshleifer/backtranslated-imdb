Cheap and manipulute There is no heart in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary dialogue, vague character and an enormous, or non-existent, story. It's just a proud and unengaging hysterion-afest to cure some kind of emotion wrench from a bad cynical attempt to bad church <br /> <br /> How many cheap shots can a film take? Hezag, however, gave the most believable and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon. <br /> <br /> If you are considering viewing this image, do not. I'm sorry but I can not find a single rental property in this movie. It's a big, fat ZERO score with me. For the sub-dogma knicker-wetters strictly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
