I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and they only saw a boxing fight (and "Halloween" or "thirty-thirty" on Friday) - but I can appreciate the terrible horror film due to scary fears. And I'm sure that it's not scary. <br /> <br /> What is so disturbing about a small plastic skull that pops up everywhere? Shots are placed far away in all its scenes, so this photo has no real surprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Peggy Weber, who gave a gift of the worst performance of all times) who started looking at the forehead and She started listening to the mysterious screams of a group of peacock in her husband's palace. Did I mention her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious sinking incident? Ooooh !!!! Who did it !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see a well-educated version of this stuff, try "Reverse Fortune". And BTW, Jeremy Iron is more than 100 times meritorious than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MST was OK but there was nothing special; Connected with "Gambi", but it is made to look good. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Screaming School"; Eight stars for the MST3 version <br /> <br /> And now, to present Mr. Von Boleo to himself: "How bad is this picture?" "You have no idea!"
