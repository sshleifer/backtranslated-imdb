Anywhoo, people laugh, joke etc. This doctor tells them this wonderful story of this woman and some kids. They are afraid, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, see a girl's ghosts. After talking, this huge ghost comes and etc .. This girl can know that this ghost has killed little kids and she must free their souls, yes yeah, Allah bless them. He but he did, oh no, as he died. And when these evil spirits go to hell, they go to heaven. Two people have survived and turn to the house.
