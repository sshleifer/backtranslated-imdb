Tired Ingrid became the victim of treatment for summer glamor treatment in Italy. First of all, it was suffering from a firearm island in Stromoli, an array failure that killed less stable actresses. And now it's Europe 51, another tedious exercise in the sense of feeling. <br /> <br /> The story of Alexander Conoches plays a very tragic role, trying to comfort him after his death, his younger son as his last-minute husband. There is at least one such good production price and more coherent scripts than StormiIi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite a friend-friend's efforts, he may not be harmed by his son suddenly. "Sometimes I think I'm going out of my mind," she tells her husband An embarrassing statement of a film entirely without humor or grace, but it gives us ideas about where the story is going on. <br /> <br /> Bergman is soon inspired to help the poor in Rome in the war, but due to being a social worker with the poor children, his mental health does not improve and the plot becomes even worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is not enough interesting for a project. For a big star like Bergman, Bergman becomes more confused and her husband suspects that she gave him twice. He flew from there after nursing a street-walker through his terminal illness. The ultimate thread of the plot needs her to monitor her husband for mental asylum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ticket Note: If New Yorker wants mental illness, then it is suggested that when Snake PIT was better than taking leadership, Anatol Litvak was to him! Irropa 51 will have to do more for his career. <br /> <br /> Forward: Another silent conscience of Romelini and Bergman.
