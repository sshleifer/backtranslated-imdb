I'm really surprised that a great director like Chuck Jones has started to create incredibly annoying cartoons that I've ever seen. I did not smile once this brief covers, and it's a bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ! Bug Forest Cartoon is not always funny, annoying! Well, along with Bags Bunny, this little good night can be Elmer (another incredibly annoying Jones short). <br /> <br /> The first warning mark of a dull cartoon is not always a quiz. Good night Elmer was boring because it pulled on the same two gags forever with the same expected payoff. On the other hand, this cartoon brings the second warning signal of a dull cartoon: there is too much dialogue. At least the cartoon is two times more than its gigabytes, but most of them think more than the extraordinary padding of the conversation. At one point, Elm finished eating dinner and commented, "It was a very bad thing," perhaps in a cartoon that I have heard that the most overwhelming dialogue (the later characters in the Woody Woodpecker cartoon are not counted as my books). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, thanks to this 20 inconsistent conversations. <br /> <br /> Elmer's pet rabbit was not a funny cartoon for me, but if you sell your soul to the wheel, Jones and he can not accept it for the sake of managing some clunkers during his career, you can enjoy it.
