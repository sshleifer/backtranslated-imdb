How was my main comment on this movie how Javu was able to help a faithful actor to work on this movie? Impressive cast ?? Even for supporter characters, none of these films really help. Although I have to admit, how much did Tom Hank's Camio do? What about Tom? Do you lose a bet? Although the best movie of the movie Joe Ijuuju - even a classic! Compound good The character of the Beijinger is fighting with existence as a Pink Lady, making his way to pitch the glorious Pyramid of the brain in the brain of the brain. On the way to Carbeat's character, it happened to inspire his ex-wife to send her Alice's case to her soon? What else Extortion Both of them make their way, they have many run-ins with Elvis's reflections that lead to an Elvis Concept in Vegas. Soon, the FBI is involved and they think that they believe that Alvis's incognito serial killer Unfortunately, firmness meant that the movie was not good. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, imagine you returned to the first grade? When the storyline and continuation of the story is not really important. Bisinger is more enjoyable than seeing her beautiful appearance in Pinky Lady's props, rather it is not really understood why she thinks she is doing. The movie tries hard, but eventually the way is short way. Finally, it is theoretically filled with ideas that might be fun, but the practice was not funny. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst, but you see it when you feel like leaving the building yourself ???? Do not tell me I did not warn you!
