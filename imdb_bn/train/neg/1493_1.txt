I do not understand how people actually created this movie, and the things they put in it were valuable. Even more confusing those who have seen this movie feel cheated in 88 minutes to do something valuable to read cheating or levitics. <br /> <br /> First, they found two real Irish people, and some handsome women who could supply their lines better than washed, the camouflaged porn stars were knocked out in these films. It is supposed to work, but weirdly, it does not seem to be a problem that looks like pornographic bigger (former) tight bodies can see junky organs from left and right sides. Perhaps they have to do something after their horrific inhuman act that is going to die in their pain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually, everyone sucked. I've never seen this before. Everyone sucked. <br /> <br /> (Some crappy scary movies are on remotely linear, or very less amazing. The authors definitely did not make sense as long as you're not in the trash). <br /> <br /> - The theme (There is nothing to learn from this picture. There is nothing to be afraid of in bed at night, do not think or understand or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (music as normal and dull as scrap, shit, crap. <br /> <br /> - Scenery (This movie may be a blessing to save, but not ... there is nothing to be happy about, even the stones are fake). <br /> <br /> So yes. If you are not worried about it and you are just a horny misery with music and bad taste of "women", this movie is for you. Positive Commentary: Sometimes catchy cinematography, waste on other elements. Very realistic; Again, wasted. But the intimate scene is classic. I solved the duplicate access problem with mutant-dependency.
