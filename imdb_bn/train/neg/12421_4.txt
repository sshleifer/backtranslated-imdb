Mark Perry's 1987 "Death games" is a black comedy which is very pimple in most parts, but sometimes very funny. The film was certainly a lot better, the act was terrible, and some of the more chic scenes make it hard to see occasionally, but the idea is fun, and it has some fun moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (year 1991), the game show has changed. Chuck Toyden (John McCafert) hosted a show show called "Live or Die", of which there is a chance to play for life in the execution jailed, and for money. Failure candidates, various types of methods such as guillotine, electric chairs, and others execute execution in air using more bizarre devices of execution. The show is certainly more than controversial, and Chuck has created many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Death games" are incredibly fatty and vague from many aspects, and acting is terrible, but it is fun without doubt in many areas, Especially if you are a fan of dark humor. If you have not seen it, then you have not missed anything, but it is certainly fun and a good time waster. 4/10
