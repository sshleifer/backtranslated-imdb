I just want to clean one thing - I love Michael Verton! But this film really gives him down. Her performance is still pretty, she is still as charming as the previous, and she still looks great. But the film itself is a load of garbage! Natasha Henstritz, I'm sorry to say it, to become a little man ... you are always waiting to flee with her best friend, who is a little weird in her sub-story Myself and my family (who was sitting and watched in a movie with me) also stopped the film's soundtrack; Sometimes the music scene did not fit with what's happening. However, even I did not have the worst side of it found in a very frustrating film. I could have excused the leading lady, I could forgive the strange characters thrown in the mix and I can forgive the poor choice of musical music, but her choice was to cut the entire middle part of the film and straight to the end ??? The ending was clearly planned from the beginning, but how it is available remains incomplete. If you skip this movie from a Michael Vertan fan, instead of buying one of your own posters.
