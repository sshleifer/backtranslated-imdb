Although some of the training scenarios were realistic, many of them portrayed military trainers as ex-Nazi. Obviously, those who wrote about the screen play were writing anti-military type or a movie for those audiences. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnam vet and I was also a military trainer who worked in this time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, talk and exercise with cigarette and captain as if he was his friend. Such things have never happened in training or formal situations, as was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> Finally I asked myself, "What was this picture?" As it turned around the whole place without any focus, except "I do not hate all authority". Thank you, I got and did not rent from the library.
