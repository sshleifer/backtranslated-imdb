Beautiful women are walking around, playing police and robbery, the middle film is the most joyful guilty pleasure to enjoy me. The House of Carroll Street was not wasted all the time, although the story has been compiled and the script is unclear and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of talk in different hitcos, at least Kelly does not like the acting role McGillis She is dressed as Grace Kelly, and she is not far away from the mark. definitely no. But its character is not believable. The manner in which he is presented to the audience should be a political determination and a purpose in life. All movies have a clearly defined period, true facts and police with a specific problem. But in the first minutes of the story, the incredible trick, high prediction and a sorry run with a set of two dimensional characters fall into a criminal off-the-mill criminal story. This is most tragic because performance of actors like photography and set design is good. <br /> <br /> The last time at the Central Station in New York is to breathe. It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the ceiling. The film can be appreciated for the best use of architecture.
