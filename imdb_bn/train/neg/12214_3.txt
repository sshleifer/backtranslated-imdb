What I can say about this movie is very good to see many faces in Asia. The way I like about this picture was not that it is an ideal ethnic character that plays their role. Asian girl will have to play someone else to move forward without confidence, the white man is inspired with Asian culture and for the yellow land behind her white earth and she likes to leave for the "keep it real" black car driver. Plus all coke, shanghai tong and dunkin donotes were a bit clear on the placement of the product. The story was fun of the plot itself but I was so much beautiful about how the story was broken. Then again you can not expect much while watching romantic comedy but again I wanted to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of Flickr.
