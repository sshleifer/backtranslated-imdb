When I was a kid, I liked this show, but now ... Black! This show is sad, badly written, and rarely funny. The three lead were all good actors and funny men (Saget's stand was far better than the stuff featured on this show, the Coulier had a good stand up, and Stams was a better than the average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to stop the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Cut out 'and' have mercy 'in the 24-hour period? <br /> <br /> Kimie Gibler - the most annoying character written for television. <br /> <br /> 3 Text-wrapped and cliched as an Oreo cookie. There are good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. The flower house was bad pale writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco - enough said <br /> 5 Unreal stuff - a lot to recall. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy kids - All of the girls had all the latest malicious fashion and you can watch the poster of the recording artist of the yearly. <br /> <br /> Now this event is Nick @ Night. I would rarely call it a classic. Since I have nothing bad to say about the people involved, I think many of them are gifted their own right. But this show was so sweet sweet, I could not stand still after a while.
