This game (D) is the first game of honor that I stopped playing in the middle and felt bitten in the bits and then felt like burning. Congratulations The first and the last grave Ryder I'll ever let you play and I assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: I just smiled by typing that word. There is no one. There is no development of both characters. We are finally a girl heroine, who can take care of herself, who * is not a * beating * Marie-Mama, but unfortunately she is very big like a whore and her breasts like dresses. They were attracted to sexist boy gamers to see you. She goes as well as whatever goes on the tomb after the samadhi shooting thing goes as well. That's why I have no idea about this. I had subtitles and T.V. As soon as they started kissing well enough. Development for her (or lacking there), her two friends and * villain * was ridiculous. There will also be levels on what you want to do, which does not give you any indication of what to do next, and you will literally be the most annoying as hell for the horse which you are supposed to be doing. A motorbike (especially it's not funny) is a course of belief (between two) that you can turn it on for a HOUR with a reserve point. This means that you were shot by another motorcycle driver and boys shot you or you hit a tree that you started traveling for hours long. Boss F * ck: You know the levels are very long, basically there are no preservation points, no stories, no character development, no play features in the game, maximum music is at the highest level of ear-bloodedness And does not give any indication to the player so that they can stay longer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the character development, plot, or unwanted game-play Yojana. <br /> <br /> Todd: Sorry, sir, but these ideas seem to stop the player. <br /> <br /> Boss Fool F * Sync: Toad Off. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Playing: She shoots all. Of course, he can jump at the time of the flickering, jumping or jumping back. But due to flipping, jumping and kicking, he is not erasing what he is doing at the end. Annoying !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Introduction Music is very beautiful. I love to hear it. In music music it is tolerable to want to spend off your ears. <br /> <br /> This game was considered in 2006, I was hoping to blow me away from the visual. I have been blown up, but definitely not a good way. <br /> <br /> The following line: This game is a plot-less, no shortage of developmental abnormal (instant) young women, which has a development deficit for some character, Unprecedented shooting game is annoying with the gameplay (I could not tell you what that might be). Stay away from this BS !!!!!!!! For getting a woman worried she gets two stars (no matter how hard she is working) and music is beautiful.
