This movie sucks at the end (especially) from the beginning. You probably will not get any bad, acting, storyline, photography, camera work, etc. It's all bad, very bad. <br /> <br /> But this is a 'great' look, it's good enough to give you a smile. Bad, good! <br /> <br /> I have no doubt about the idea of ​​making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is laughable, it's like a comedy in disguise, like the Mafia, also in vain but extraordinary fun. Look at the very end of the movie <br /> <br /> ... Um.
