This is a definite late Universal Flick: it is technically mandatory, if there are numbers with a cookie cutter plot and some serious acnection. The most striking part of this movie is the stunt casting of Rondo Hatton, a bone patient whose image is "Giant". This man is sad to be exploited, but perhaps he made good use of the money he gave him. I often felt pained on fear or even hate because Hunton Studio is less awesome than expected. Martin Kossack is on the board as a movie crazy artist, and he is very interesting in this part. I just enjoy watching Koslack about anything; For some reason the man amuses me. The only part of the film that makes me entertain is the illogical of the world. Here we revel in their ability to break artists who exhibit the evil art critics; As well as the film's male "hero" who paints "artist" pictures, as well ... Get it ... Pin girls. Somehow our hero's work is reviewed alongside Villan's absurdist sculptures as well. The main negative critic of the film, who at one point claimed the hero's pin-up art disappointing because "there is no such thing as a woman" that our heroine answers with assurances that critics do not find enough. Finally, the heroine (who is an industrial critic who himself himself) has taken a subplot about a child born by a leading man .... completely ridiculous to feminist and complete testimony. Overall, this film is a mediocre picture with some interesting elements.
