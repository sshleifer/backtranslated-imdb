For Daniel O'Toole, 'Queen Margit' was a lot better. Nastasz Kinski, 'Paris, Texas' was a lot better. For this movie, Chris Menezes ('Cross Cross' and 'A World Appart' can not be compared with the same song version) and the biggest frustrations of Garne Brevovic were the end of the film to use the same music theme from 'Quinn Margot'. It was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; But for a European film, with more independent actors and directors, the same general procedure about child abuse is very simple and psychological without any key insights. People who have kidnapped and sold bad people have to sell. Wait for those poor children who hate to sell them and save them by anyone. And finally, the big hero who kills all bad people and protects these poor children from bad guys. Each letter is shown in simple black and white terms: good versus bad. Plus, from the very beginning, I realized how the story would end. Does this child end up with the history of sexual abuse? I believe that the problem of child repression and pedophilia is much more complicated than how it is portrayed in the original film. I think this movie was not boring, but seems too frustrating.
