I did not know much about this before the movie, but I heard that it was something to do with quantum physics so I was interested. It is not a story that I do not know, but a bunch of New Age boyfriends who like the sound of their voice, how much they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it's more in the documentary section than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His portrayals of the film are very scary and are meant to show the speaker's thinking so that we will not die due to frustration. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, reverse the new age hippie that crashes on his couch. We get to hear the quantum physics of unknown people ramble about all the "meanings" of them. There was a bright spot in this movie in India (I guess), but I think she showed up for a wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden really let her go and she goes and how Quantum science has some of her crazy new age beliefs. It seems that less cash is going on from the cover of DS 9 and he has also shown short films in the film. There is a lot of CGI CGI we are supposed to be impressed with; The body cells are shown as a dance mold, because the filmmakers have clearly seen the flubber multiple times. People of this movie say that the Arakkas of San Salvador have recognized Columbus's ship as Pinta invisible because the natives never saw cleaver ships before, as if people have the potential to know in some way today. Of course they left that information and only "Columbus's ship was invisible to Indians in America." The film takes a lot of such arrogant leaps. Thomas Young conducted a double-slit test near 1805 and found that the light could look like some particle and some waves. Of course you can not find this * from seeing this stupid movie because its only mention is "can be atoms of particles and waves." And that means people can go through the wall, walk in the water, and if they want to grow up, they will not be old !! Then I'm sure Marley Matlene may have been deaf if he is * trustworthy enough. I'm scary, but this film is skeptical of hope and belief, believing that they do not hide. <br /> <br /> This new age cocks, which have been acquired in quantum theory, should reinforce their beliefs about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If they believed that these snake oil sellers really were selling they could not just express their desire to exist behind them instead of appearing in this lust. A movie? We can hear any other anonymous person, who we do not know, with a certificate, how he will create his own life, talk about his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen). Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to enter inside and throw a pie in his mouth. These people take themselves very seriously. Some other balding guy in a case saying that anyone * never really * touched * is because of a magnetic power to prevent it at the quantum level. If only someone walking on the screen and walking in the stomach, shouted, "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you!" The film's moral relativity claims that there really is "no good or bad thing." So it is obviously that Hitler gave death to millions of Jews? Another person says that "there is no such thing as love." It's just a chemical and we really do not love humans, we're just jokingly when we're close to them. I suspect this guy is working as a community service for adding heroin to this hero for years. <br /> <br /> We are a really sad story-witness witness, where two young adults are surrounded by reception of marriage, Robocop sees everything. They evaluate if cows, dogs, or foxes, and a sex position pops onto onto the scree. Marley Matl√≠n became drunk talking about her film and decided to love herself and take a bath the next day because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> When I liked the picture that often found evidence for people, their preconception idea. Perhaps in this review I just want to see what I want to see, but I have really seen this person face to face, and it has never happened. In the ideas presented earlier in the film, you can think of them as interesting but there are better sources for all ideas here. If you want to see a good movie that discusses Heinzberg's uncertainty policy, see the person who goes there. If you want to read a good book about quantum field theory, read the hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a movie that discusses different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see Walking Life (though it can be annoying, self-important and occasionally excited). After all, instead of spoiling your time in this movie, you must read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson. <br /> <br /> I usually have a hard time giving a film from 1 to 10. , But this was very easy for me: 1/10 Star. <br /> <br /> The movie title is true. People in this movie do not know #dollars! Hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen
