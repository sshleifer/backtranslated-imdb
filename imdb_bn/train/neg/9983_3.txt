This image is a massive yawn proof that Americans do not get leaked to the French. Even when it has already been written for them! The original movie "Hood over over the web" is a strange humorous error that I will take in 8/10. This is not only a linguistic translation, but some illogical disciplines of events have been completely excluded, hiding its original tricky quadruple film and making it a cheap "Oops and Trousers Styles of Strauss".
