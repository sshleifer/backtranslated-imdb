Regarding other Columbo movies, it can only be rated a 1 (terrible). I do not understand the critics of a movie accident-trash what other critics have seen. It was only through the enchanting mood that I continued to see it - to see what a strange or inactive decision the director would make next. Another critic suggested that this was the reason for the sole directive of Folk because it was his acting role. Actually, I think the real reason is that the studio is lying with the monkeys, who were scared to see what they had done with their money. It's a wonderful thing that they did not kill him.
