I think this is probably one of the worst movies in most cases. <br /> <br /> Trying to get 'same letter' with different people * such a bad idea. If they do not get Sir Michelle G. and Ryan P, then their losses should be reduced and they should be hacked. Instead they get new actors which they are terrible. I thought that I was in high school or (bad) college, this guy worked with lever to act. <br /> <br /> Where do they get these people? Was this their first movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just saw the first and popped the # 2 . I was excited to see the second and finally saw the worst show. I never ever stopped a movie, but after about 30-40 minutes this definitely did not go off.
