It is a bit of a saying that most of the great reviews for the IMDB movie come from people who have just reviewed a movie in their entire IMDB career, and yes you have guessed that this film is "Parasominaia". I've often doubted the suspiciously good reviews in IMDB, which is a bit better marketed as well as marketing films, but it seems fairly transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> It is not said that parasomania is terrible, but it is very good to be good or a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great badge in Platyp Kilpatrick, who works great and bad, I can easily see what it takes to listen to Hanib Lacar in a memorable memory. In the sequence of dreams, there are some beautiful scenes, in fact, if the film decides to explore the terrain, it can be a better thing. <br /> <br /> I understand that suspension suspicion is essential for immersion in a good story, but it is a good story mark that will make it successful for you to do it. If you think you are irrational or simply foolish, then losing your story and what's happening to me with this movie. Other critics have mentioned it here and I do not want to go into the hijacking zone, but I was finally lucky and disappointed with the set-up, it does not even mention the mental age of a character which is considered to be experienced only a few years of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
