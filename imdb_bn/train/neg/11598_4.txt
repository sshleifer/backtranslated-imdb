When you look back at another bad nightmare like Freddie Revenge, you have to try at least something new. And although the Dream Child is more enjoyable but it's nothing new for the series. Yes, there is a natural death like normal, such as a virgin is becoming part of a comic book and "Super Freddy" is facing, but such scenes are also not used for their full potential and parts apart from Frederick. <br /> <br /> This series marks the toxic official deaths. Freddie now seems to be the Comedic Relief ... but what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
