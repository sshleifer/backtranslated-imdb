The first half of this movie is a pure joy. Novel Ridiculous Wonderful performance. Manhattan resident, a close brother and sister fall for the same woman! Adults. Bright Wonders. You can ask for more information. This is a refreshing start as a romantic comedy. It's head in the unexplored region. And then it becomes apart. <br /> <br /> This is coming out to be a universal adult comedy, which is an out-of-the-mill dating story that has long been in the past. What a disappointment As a human film it starts with such commitment. Why would such a pedestrian become a movie "Who am I am"? Heer Graham's fridge framed final shot shows the untouchability of the last part of the film to celebrate "his happiness to find himself." <br /> <br /> This could be different. It might be witch. It ends up being the same old old.
