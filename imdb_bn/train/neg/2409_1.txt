It was a painful experience, the whole story was really there so I would not go there but the act was awesome. Initially, this part was when the scientist was going to work, he really was wearing a white coat at home before leaving. To work, I think working with the biojagrid material means that you wear inactive clothes in the controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab, where the monitor is on a file cabinet which has nothing to do with the whole scene. To show the place as technical and scientist, there is actually a breakfast in the lab and a biojjard layered beside him and his boss walks over him and even saying nothing about him ... not to mention bad acting very bad to get something worse than not to see my advice And I think it can not be anything worse than the house of the dead. Apparently, UV Bolle's movies have been shot Shakespeare striya like that!
