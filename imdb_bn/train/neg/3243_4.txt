According to the most important need for any film for self-confident, at least occasionally they are able to drag us on one side, as well as their idiots, police, crowd and (ideal) each other. But this film never pulls off this. Every scam is seen coming off a mile (especially biggen!) They are very attractive, complex or sophisticated. Perhaps Mamate hoped to compensate for Spanish conversations and complex psychological relations. If so, he failed. The lines are okay, but they have been distributed in such a shameless, irrelevant, stylized way, which I think is probably all of us are being played ... but it was not. For psychological complications, the main character puts a little over and laughs a little about the lady about her father that she is a whore, but she falls on him. I really liked the street view though. Just looked like an Edward Hopper painting.
