The worst piece of this shit I saw recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is an intelligent fool, the dialogues do not give any sense, ridiculous scenes have not heard anything about the real humor. Actors just do not play, bad they do not even try. The script itself is somewhat similar to Ed Wood and Uwe Bowl in the same league. The only good thing in this flick is to fight. Hong Kong people will wait because they are good dancers and the only reason to see the sun prince. Although I believe that the war is supposed to fill only empty space so that the screen writer does not have to worry about the story. However, this weak and illogical plot can prevent you from seeing it at the end. Avoid it until you are the fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
