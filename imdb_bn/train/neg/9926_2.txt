I just saw one of my all time favorite, Blazing Saddles 30th Anniversary Edition !! Black pilot stunk for bert The plot was in existence and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to profit from the success of Blessing Saddell and TV shows that have succeeded in accepting big movies but it will never work. For the television industry that has been broadcasting television over the years, the TV is not even playing even playing words, they think they can throw a "n" on the TV and show a show. On the other hand, I'm happy to see many familiar faces !!! Several actresses / actresses I have been recognized from other shows for years. I have to write all the names and do a few searches. That was fun. If Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash I was debating my mother. I won! :)
