History given to the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that it was sitting in a painful film. I was in the European premiere last night and was one of the executive producers. He still did not see the movie, boy, he was surprised. I did not read the book I read on this book, or if it is too much ratings or praise, I do not know, but I read "Captain Correlli Mandolin" and how it was adapted for the screen and how bad the movie was. . Just assume something similar happened here. There are couple-very-many eyebrows to Farrell though acting was not bad. Actually, I can not believe how much I cared for any character in this movie. Uncertainty is an empty empty screen game. Donald Sutherland part has a few views where a door is opened, say something and turn it off again. I am not crying in the dialogue of the screen, I look at my watch. I have never been able to play in the movie, but I was tempted to start this time. I gave this movie a '2' score because it seems horribly shallow to me, but what I can say about this movie is that this is the best. First of all, I really enjoyed very small earthquake scenes and the second was Salma Haye's naked and beautiful. I can say a little positive about this movie. Do not ask the dust, I can not speak!
