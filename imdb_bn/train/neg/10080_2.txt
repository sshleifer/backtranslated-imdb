I had to search actresses to find out the film because the title is now unexpected love. It's not really valuable but I was unfamiliar with both the unknown and wondered why they had a lesbian flick title in Lifetime. Everything is pretty annoying and you really will not get any idea about these ideas, as a spectator, I'm not able to invest emotionally in the story. I'm the target audience for this but I'm not sure who. Everything is silent and soft focus and earth tone ... nothing is very interesting. I had a sincere interest to find two women but I was so disappointed that I was so frustrated. Instead of personal best rental.
