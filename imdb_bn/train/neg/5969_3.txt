*** SPIRIR *** If you think about watching this movie do not read it, though it will be wasted time. (The way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if it does not read) <br /> <br /> <br /> If you think that "Quiet fire" or not: No! It is not worth the money for tickets or VHS / DVDs. A common "chic-well-good flick", someone could say. The plot itself is as ridiculous and unwelcome as America's Dream is shallow. Young handsome girl from a small town in New York has achieved great success. Some frustrating attempts to give the film failed, such as the father's "tragic" accident, "problems" of Violet's relationship with his boyfriend, etc. McCalli (director) is trying to stimulate sadness and depression to the audience, due to bad audience and shallow acting, there is no scope for this effort to succeed. In particular, the Piper Parabo failed to firmly believe in the fear of the "jersey" of the girls in front of the audience. The only good (and quite interesting thing) about "Quiet Agnie" is John Goodman, who represents the smallest representation of the film's hopes. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that Jerry Br√ºhaimer made this film. The first "gone in 60 seconds" and now this ... what happened to the great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and self-malicious) instead of this flick. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (10 out of 3).
