Of course the most annoying movie I've ever spent my money. This is a wrong choice for all these big stars to make their reputation wrong. Boring! Boring! Boring! Each character is illustrated in less inspirational ways. Any acting talent shown-a part of reading is OK. Alike can play generally realistic characters, Gwinneth is ugly for his overwhelming part, needs advice on how to choose which movies Antenna chooses to choose, all these big stars who have disappointed me all the genius likes in entertainment A feature that leaves many to be smothered. "Running with scissors" leads the public to act in a movie that feels excitement and deep emotions. Cast was not able to present any picture on the screen for an explanation. Maybe it was the fault of the director ---- whatever.
