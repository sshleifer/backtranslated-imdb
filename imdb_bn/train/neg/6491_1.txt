This movie is completely lost in time. I have seen this movie with a group of movie enthusiasts, who have received different taste in the movies but have always kept an eye on a work of "genius" (like a colleague commentators on this site were gallsted by this steaming pile label ??); None of them found a single redeeming quality. We've finished the film with the enthusiastic enthusiast Koras I will not be restored here. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that Sir Anthony Hopkins himself wrote positive reviews given here. Finally, a reviewer will tell you, did he make the film money? Since Hollywood or anyone else in the world, due to this, will not risk a single coin or their good name with this film. Do not let the semi-famous actor present in the film hide his whip ?? Christian Slaughter has signed special scripts "Reading the script" or signing script in addition to reading the script (a folly I'm sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, a person written, guided, produced, and paying someone who is too famous to admit to himself that does not make himself a spontaneous spontaneous person who is a beautiful composition (and if you Do not believe me but please "Anthony Hopkins" and the industry at Google)
