Hello This is my first review for this I see in any movie. I went through the difficulties of doing this to literally tell everyone, the most horrific movie I've ever seen. I think the film was made very rarely, which I would understand because of budget constraints to create it. I saw the movie I saw a very bad remix. Which I agree, I also saw a very graphic, but, I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The hottest thing I saw was the hammer on the head of the victim, which was the most annoying scene. The scene lasted almost forever, well actually, probably about 5 minutes but still. I like some horror movies and if they are good I would like to give credit. This director Uwe bowed, and his team wanted to use this movie, it should be considered before creating another such thing. Haha a final note !! For all those people who die, women and children die well and one of them is smiling with a five-minute hammer, then you will enjoy this movie, if not and you like terrible, for example, a high budget Go with the film. I do not believe people actually make movies like these. Anyway, anyone who loves you and accepts them in the heart, so sorry, that's just my opinion in movies
