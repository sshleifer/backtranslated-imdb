The cover is a draw that just like the old B-movies you have to warn about the quality of this movie. This is not a B-movie, however. This is a movie! <br /> <br /> There are no famous actors and creatures - WOW - This is the worst data-animation created for the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You will never see the SCAAARY subroutine shown in front cover. You just scream people, listen to bloodshed and die and you occasionally see a tooth or tiger-foot. It is so amateur! Maybe it feels good because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say: "I have ever seen these best movies, and wait for their response," he said. <br /> <br /> This movie is weak to give a spyar alert! It's a speaker
