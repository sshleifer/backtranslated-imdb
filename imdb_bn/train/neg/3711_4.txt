I did not see the film trailer of the film trailer, instead I put my friend on the basis of my opinion on the basis of my opinion. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just flattens on his face. <br /> <br /> During the film, there are some fun jokes during the rock, but unfortunately, this film lacks the lack of comedies. The film seems to want to combine both laugh and love, and it does not fail. The story of love in the movie is directly (fortunately) ahead, but it is much more damaged than the rock and fatal film. Finally, the film is first and foremost scheduled as a comedy, where smile should be the primary concern. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some parts were completely isolated. Supports are meant to be custom fun, they certainly do not do a good job. Angel's couple from heaven tried to make some jokes, which were dry and dull. Rock's first incarnation couple had pendants. If there is one thing, they work properly, but they compare the rock as fun.
