I really hope Concord / New Horizons are not trying to create a serious blow or even action movie when creating a carousos. The film is stupid starting from the beginning Even the C3's humor is funny because it's bad. Of course, a high water mark in the 'Swad It Goods' style. You enjoy the worst worst, this is for you.
