This movie was different that I did not see the common gay stereotypes that I saw. But it does not completely change the truth that lacks a storyline. I'm sure many gay men who are happy to portray themselves on the screen, because black gay characters are rarely seen and when they do not fully improve the characters However, how difficult it will be for writers to start writing stories at the beginning, the middle and the end. Or how about a story that was focused. Actually this movie does not seem to be a point and it is a low budget movie, but it is not an excuse for the lack of stories or the plot.
