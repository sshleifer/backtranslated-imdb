I can not believe that last more than 25 years ago I saw this again ... <br /> <br /> <br /> I just watched 6fu movies all day ... Boris Karloff And all 5 stars It was disgusting to Jesse Franko (and I rarely use this word) to indicate the last two lace. At that time, I gave up this one, I thought, in some ways, it was also work. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it. Never Do you know what a bad movie is bad? A really well made piece ***. And that's what FINDISH PLOT is. This is a very nice look movie. Great production design, set, dress, music, photography, editing, most well cast, some decent acting ... <br /> ... And absolutely, positive, one of the best scripts in film history !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the film is so misleading ... it may be wrong for a decent movie. And then they started singing "Happy Birthday of Fu" ... and it is encouraging. Bert Kwouk (whom his master said, "your face - familiar."), Being accidentally poured elixir vitae of fire extinguisher FU, causing him to be tortured, buried and cut off his ear, they were the funest things to do. Some people seem to want to do the "campi" movie - so ridiculous it will be fun. Shameful, it's ... fun ... it's not. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's sad because in the first few minutes it is clear that most of its "Freedom" in Fu Manchu series has done a lot of research. With a different script - really really a great, or a deadly deadly one, they might have - might have - they had a classic in their hands. A movie that one might forget about the horrors of the abuse of Joseph Francis ... compared to trying to excavate someone as one of the best fame. <br /> <br /> At the end of the 70's, a complete animated film of classic 30 characters was revived in a universal horror film. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, and Doc Savage. I'm not sure it can be very bad. It did not take complete self-control, it was not a quick move on the whole sections, especially in view of Sid Caesar (who was the cousin of Al Capone, see what you see?). Not only is the idea of ​​filming funny, they often do not create any senses. When they prefer the police officers "listeners" to impersonate the king and queen, and we show people's "audition" dance-hall routines for singing, dancing, and running a uniform. How much narrative the authors of this article have to explain to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, shame ... and the real waste of all those things, Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nelly Smith), Bart Coke (who was his time in Chris Lee Fu's film), Helen Mirren (Police woman who had fallen in love with Villain suddenly and stole the last half an hour of the near photo!). I started to think that would anyone ever make the "right" Fu Manchu film, or should the fans have to live permanently for Karlop?
