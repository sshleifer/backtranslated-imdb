I think that people involved in "Christmas survival" do not think much in this movie. Characters are so incompatible and the plot has so little idea that the film plays like a draft of roughly a draft of a script, but lets a Christmas family spend Christmas together with a rich man. /> <br /> Ben Affleck portrayed Drew Latham, the wealthy, proud advertising executive executive executive executive officer who bought his way through life. His girlfriend, Miss, had left him a few days before Christmas because he was disturbed that Drry wanted to take him to Fiji for Christmas, which he called "Family Vacation" and is true that Drake never introduced her to her family. We later came to know that when Dr Daddy's father was away at the age of 4 and her mother had died, due to her mysteries, she did not say that she has no girlfriend but she does not allow her girlfriend to believe that she is not <br /> <br Due to fear of being alone on Christmas, Drummis follows Mississippi's narrowness (why I do not know), who feels that she asks for forgiveness in her childhood. When he meets family living in his childhood home, Wallkos, Dru, gives him $ 250,000 to demand his family, so he can revive his boyish childhood memories. She gets angry when she later sees that she has an adult girl Alicia (Christina Applegate), because she has "no sister", and even to write a script to follow the family can even go so far so that they are more like her "real" family Work <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> along with her imagination. But for some good reason, she suddenly started to like the drum, and within a few minutes she loves to play her girlfriend. Drew is a complete shock throughout the film that does not even sympathize with his tragic story about the only Christmas of his childhood; I have often ended up saying, "Just kidding! I do not see my family because they all keep order against me!" (2/10)
