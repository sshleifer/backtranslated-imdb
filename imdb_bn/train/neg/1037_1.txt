This poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was encouraged at Sundance that this day is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers. <br /> <br /> First, there are such things as the cinematography industry. It is not made for the real movie just by picking a 16 mm camera and pointing to the line with which it is in line. <br /> <br /> I think we should be lucky to find a director who does not choose a camcorder ... <br /> Second, indie movies are supposed to be about real people. There is nothing real in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this is not a good writing, or a good guide. <br /> <br /> Touching a bad movie is in some way going to the Sun's path. It is difficult to believe that it was one of the best movies ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
