Yet another colorful excuse for men in wrestling rubber cases with each other. Often, travelers from the future came in 1992 and appointed some to return with them in 1944 and prevented the creation of Godzilla, which in the future protected Japan from destruction. But when completing this task, travelers have been shown as a bunch of double crossings, whose own animals fall on anger and to stop it from breaking any gadijila ?? Eek! It's all very foolish words, and probably, but the plot looks wonderful, surprisingly decent and ultimate combat. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are exclusively rubbish except garbage, and the film is as dull as the previous predecessors. Look for the joke in the joke Spielberg.
