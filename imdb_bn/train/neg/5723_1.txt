Anyone who has said better than the hostel is utter pain, believe I'm not a host of hostess but it's just ridiculous. This is another shot from Camcoder, direct DVD, the concept of your time is low, I can not believe how many of these movies are there and I still can not see a decent one. At 80's video, Gore and Awesome movies were not made with any budget, but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director had something to say. Now they seem to be trying to hire a copy to browse in Blockbuster, I think these movies will be displayed as long as people stop this work. This film is very few on the idea, how it was created is amazing, acting is also terrible, the location is completely unclear and the soundtrack begging is so annoying. This waste of time does absolutely nothing, until you are in search of compiling a list of the worst movies of all time. The best / worst part of the movie is when a female character points to a gun to someone and if they do not stop, they are threatening to shoot them, then you can see that he is not only covering the trigger with his fingers, grip An absolute joke.
