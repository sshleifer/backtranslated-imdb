The classification is a solid film. I did not give it 110% density and as a result the plot was as simple as I could not say for sure what the American FBI was doing in the letters and what their role was. As the character of the film, I could not take Irin seriously, when his lines and scenes were all in the style of his shoe, not being played. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than the glorious episode of TV. Shown, a small sub plot which is going on, which is going right on the way. But since any irin show is always for the watch price, this movie is a good look, but not on Christmas Day. Which is not saying, I have more work here than ever. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
