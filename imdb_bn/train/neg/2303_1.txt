In addition to the man apparently buy into this garbage! Shows like "Moral Orel" have been shown, even if you try to create the most horrible, the highest parody of the Gospel promotion, but you probably will not come near the joy of the show. It is difficult to know what is happening when you are watching it. Is this a news show? A talk show? Who knows !? They started reporting on various international news stories, but in seemingly random points, this scurrilous, curious man, who is a little older than his full face, affection and laughing, and usually becomes obscure, is disrupting the news. <Br /> <br /> Pat Robertson does not feel so bad at first glance. She just feels like a senile, yet ruthless old coot stuck in her ancient belief (like most of our grandparents). But it is a man who called for the killing, who has been friendly and cooperated with friendship, but two murderers dictators who used illegally money to run the mine for mine, who supported compulsive abortion in China and those who regularly refer to the Caucasians (especially the direct American Male caucasians) are better than all other nations. However, it will be fun, but apparently he has a small enough fan base, 40 years later, the plane (which, or some TV official, has enough money to bribe). The image of the ceremony falls frustrating when you realize that some people, anywhere, must see it and hang on each word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I do not know it funny or scary. I guess both a healthy mix.
