Series I love Diera silently. His talent is trivial in "Walters" ur "moving". Well, many boys are splitting the convention into the most foolish and irrational way; Many people find such behavior as fun. This is an annoying, unmatched exercise plan designed. I smile on Blair's face, face behind the camera, annoying. The series was a valid expression of silent personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the very first moment when we see Patrick Dairy's prancing in the abandoned locket, we get the idea of ​​a wonderful beautiful anti-hero, we'll spend time for the next few hours. When we see his friend Depardieu pursuing helpless middle-aged women in "moved", there is a clear warning that we have spent two hours with this justification. I have even a "3" eking problem for this annoying distraction.
