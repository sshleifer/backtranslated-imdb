I feel embarrassed to write this review. I say because you will find out the reason for reading that I am holding the whole thing and even embarrassed to confess to strangers. But I only had to warn them that they did not see the movie before reading the audience's comments on IMDB. It's at least I can do This is a bad movie! Trust me The plot is stupid. The acting is amateurish. And all the second rate of instruction, camera work, set, dress, etc. Let it go.
