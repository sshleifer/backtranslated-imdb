If Fasibindor has made a bad movie, I am not sure to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are very interactive and clustrophobic, should be forced to learn to praise more extensively for excellent movies such as "The Better Years of Petra Fan Cunt". This movie seems to be so parody of "art-film", so it is composed of many symbolic, visible-emblematic images. The slaughterhouse and the scene where the prostitute friend of the Believer, who looks like a ten-minute friend of the Believer, is the real test of the patience of viewers who actually investigates this film. But I really have some interesting scenes about this that only Elvira and his former wife and / or daughter's daughter. This is the only moment that shows any real human emotions, and proves that the main part of this horror film was an excellent film to rid himself of. What a waste
