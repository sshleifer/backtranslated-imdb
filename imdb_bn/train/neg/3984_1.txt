I saw this movie in BBC a few years ago I was sitting beside it. How? I do not know, it's on the "bad so good" chart, how it can be seen when Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman now have to see it. I think Woody has done wonderful work with Alan Ols Plot and Bedouin. The part may be played with gusto by Leslie Nelson. It was again at night again I tried to try it again but the life is very short. I saw a few minutes for the beautiful Nicole, he was so hot near 93, did Bellwood ever make a good movie? Paulman played the character of his business "nice but slow", when F-word was coming out of his mouth while removing his word from "Fasier", when he was accused of being a detective, he was charged with murder. Stay away.
