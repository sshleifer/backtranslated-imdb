Lash, clherhed superhero action movie drivel. I had high expectations of this film, and the style of H-Friend Kup Acakara is not that I am disrespectful, but very rarely I see stories as story and ridiculous. It could be forgiving, because it is always in such movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not happen. This activity carries on the richness of trademark enrichment and HK action, but it is not very involved, is indecently lazy, and in fact it is often not completely inconsistent (possibly due to its re-edit for American release it shows many patchwork places). I was very frustrated.
