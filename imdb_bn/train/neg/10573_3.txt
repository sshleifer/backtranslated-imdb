I was overwhelmed by this movie for a relationship class at my school. As it figured it was nothing new to captivating. Although parents try to look at their parents with regard to their parents' problems instead of their parents. This was an interesting aspect for this, but it did not really depend on its originality because there was nothing else in this film. We have such a major character that has a younger sister, like all other movies like her, there is something like her, who has a mother in our house, who is much more hopeful and when she gives more, she feels annoyed and throws him into dust, then we Have always gone parents. Then our parents want everything along with girls and want to be perfect to what they want. Like the story, I said it was interesting but lacking good writing and no good writing or lack of stories from the whole cast. Everything about this has been covered in the clichés. Younger children start studying with girls, they stay together, have sex, and then we have a small child. Probably better than this writing and the performance improved. I have got more emotion outside the Leatherface and its Censão outside of any actor in this film and it looks bad like a leatherfish. Movies are crap and horridly played. The only interesting pregnancy movie I saw was Juno. While still giving the same message, the ridiculous aspect of this critical situation has proved to be more entertaining. I said that the idea is that most of these films mainly keep an eye on the mother's head but instead it does not monitor the drama of the father, but the originality does not protect the film from mediation. I really hope that anyone decides to recreate this film with a better cast and a better writer or make another similar movie because it is a potentially devastating.
