When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Ludosi as co-stars, you expect to find a great movie that is a good work, but it was actually different, which I expressed what I say, which I would describe as the primary attempt of science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both scientists (Rookie and Bennett respectively) - The contest is, Rukh won a Bennet by proving his great theory through his sonnet. Here the science was - at least - on the other hand, some rough around (thus emphasizing science fiction, fiction) but in some ways Rukh used some rays from Andromeda to allow him to see the world "several thousand million years ago." During that former historical period, a huge meteorite hit Africa, which physicists abandoned deposits of "radium-x" substances which can be cured and destroyed. A large part of the film is rather tediously set in Africa, for the search of metro deposits, which eventually finds Ruhao and adds to create a great weapon, unfortunately accidentally infectes itself with some diseases that make him a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Both Karloff and Lugosi were pretty good here. Logosi plays a good role, in which the good guy is quite good, though I genuinely feel uncomfortable - especially in Africa during the set scene. The story went to a little bed, and when I paid attention to it, it did not make me fun. Since it was a science-fiction rather than a horror flickr and it was in its early stage of science fiction, I think the film will have to be lightweight. It was right - nothing, but nothing less than that. 4/10
