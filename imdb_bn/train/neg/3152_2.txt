Poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue. A single view does not shines. The actors struggled with a painful neutral scene that leads to a distressing, plot twist or conflict. You know from the first ten minutes where it's going. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense for the city for a movie set in New York. Other indie movies in a dozen budgets think it is a small budget magic. It seems that it was shot in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you tear apart Natasha Henstriz, why do she dress her in sweater? Why bustling look boring and thrust? Where's the attraction? I felt I saw the sub-Persian Christian movie of the week, it was so incomplete and morality. <br /> <br /> Steven Federer's biggest success is that he believed in people to create this blend movie.
