Yet another initiative in the state of teenage-cum-out-comedy shows the feature of the search for coolness in the college campus, and how he decides to make three blackmails of popular jokes to popularize him. It has been done all before, and it has been done in a much more satisfactory manner. "American pie" and "dude! Where's my car?"

The film has been written badly and the actor will never be able to tolerate it a little bit. I will not be proud of this terrible image, because it's my time and you're lost.

Please avoid avoiding it. Save your money.
