I saw brigade on TV last night (12 September 2009). I am 61 years old and I can remember until I see movies. I can honestly say that Brigadon has never seen the worst movie I've ever seen. The signs were embarrassing. The local children's club will produce a good set. Characters were so wooden that they probably narrowed down the tears of those patrons, who were unhappy to see them. It is hoped that they were hiding enough to watch this movie to protect them from their embarrassment. These trip owners should perform a great service for mankind and destroy all copies of this photo.
