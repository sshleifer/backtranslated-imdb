Today I found "they all got laughed" on VHS in a rental. It was an old and very used VHS, I did not have any information about this movie, but the references mentioned in my cover were liked: Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and especially the name of Dorothy Straaten attracted me, the price was too low And I decided to risk it and buy it. I searched the IMDB, and there was a nice reference to the user rating of 6.0. I saw "Mick Martin and Marshaar Porter Video and DVD Guide 2003" and ?? How nice ?? Four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste time and see it immediately. In fact, I've just finished seeing "they all smile" and I found it a very annoying overrated movie. Characters have developed poorly, and I've spent many minutes understanding their role in the story. This plot is considered funny (fall in love for those who follow personal eyes), but I did not laugh with the whole story. The story is ridiculous in a big city like New York. Ben Gajarra is attractive and very seductive, it is ridiculous for her fallen women like Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, as well. Finally, after the release of this film, most of the attention was appearing on the playboy centerfold and the calendar of the year's calendar Dorothy Straaten, and his life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death's Death". Centerfold: Dorothy Stratane Story "; The amazing beauty of sexy Potty Hansen, future Mrs. Keith Richards; always wonderful, even fifty years old, Audrey Hepburn, and Roberto Carlos's song" Amigo. "Although I do not like him, but the end of Roberto Carlos 60 Was the most popular Brazilian singer and his fans were called "The King" Rubbing (myanali Dorothy stratena), because this movie will be in my collection. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "riso e muita ayalagriya muito" ( "a lot of smiles and lots of joy")
