Slow and beautiful images for the first 75% of movies have changed with each other, sometimes boring music (you know Bazoor). If you do not have enough sleep, this is a good time. However, the last 20% of the movie's film director has decided to come back with the SRM photo again, with a resurrection or any other idea: "spiritual lovers" are spending each other with a knife. It was very annoying for me and actually changed the general impression of abstract art mix and images of modern Japanese mysteries. <br /> <br /> The operator and director are great, but weird. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy it.
