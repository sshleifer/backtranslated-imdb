The story of a photographer of the 1980 television movie and TV series guest star (Misti Row, Pamela Hemesley, Calvin Little, Simmur Castle), who dreamed of killing his models. Of course, models and other people start stopping the dead due to all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> There is not enough nudity and violence for the thriller to get R rating but there is not enough good material for any real purpose. It has been described as the best film, which gave the option to the label for the schemax of the cable channel cinemax. I can not really see these viewing points until you need to see each sleazy thriller there. (I have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, which becomes ludicrous if anyone enlightens)
