Probably not my style, but the plot was horrific, such as Nancy Allen and Linda Fertino. C. Thomas also feels uncomfortable in the role of persuasion (marijuana? Why it needs to be included? This weak plot is enough). Also Farentino's charac He had more respect for a relationship than was good. Will not you try to say movies? not so more.
