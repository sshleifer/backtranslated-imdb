I'm not sure whether Andy Sidriss can repeat the success of the movie "Malibu Express" with its success. With his film Fit-to-Kill he proved that Sidriss is a serious film maker and not just a shot director. The plot written by Sidiris, an ingeniously organized academy, is a complex screenplay that involves many invisible twists and rotations. Compose work for a sexual oriented radio station known as the main character KSXY. Shiny, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fight to Kill" they face Kenyan for a long time, who is trying to steal Russian's most precious diamond. Not all of a well-written playback, the nice acting played by Caste helps ensure this film as a classic classic. To be panned by critics and box office, this film will be appreciated in the coming years. It is now enjoying the same fate as Clockwork Orange and taxi driver, but will definitely be recognized in the future. I am not disappointed to know any criticism of Andy Sidri's trademark film making. The costume, special effects, helps to appreciate these beautiful pieces of film making. It lets you ignore this movie's 3 neutral images and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10 The drama is thick as the Blockbuster Runway Bride, and the film is better than or equal to the line action hero Cinematical Masterpiece. Andy, keep up the good work.
