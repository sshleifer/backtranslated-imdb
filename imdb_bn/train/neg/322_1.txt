I saw this movie almost 5 years ago, and its memories still threaten me this day. I was totally aware of how badly it should have been entered, so I blamed myself. But most of all, I did not have all the negative beliefs. Being a Sandler fan, it could just be worse that his movie might seem unbelievable one. I figured it was just Sandler haters I could not have been more wrong <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not contain anything interesting and even 1 second. That's actually quite a accomplish. You might think in the 90-minute comedy, perhaps they might have been somewhat frustrated. But no, it's just horrible. It's not too good to "it's bad", it's just bad. You can not just laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry You patiently wait for a joke that will make you at least chocolate, but they will never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie ring? Where do people watch the video tape and die after 7 days? If this film is on the video tapes, people will die instantly with their own hands, and they will smile on their faces because they understand that their pain is over, and since they are the first smile on the pressure of the game. <Br /> <br /> You may be too bad to see how bad it is, unable to reduce your curiosity. No Please do not Believe me, I'm gonna give you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world who think that the worst movie to go to the overboard, and those who have not seen it yet.
