All of David's films are terrible in counting: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the lead of the man). But because of their unfamiliar laughs, they all have incredible entertainment value. Almost every DAVID prairie "film" (as I want to mention them) is basically the same. All American commando teams fly up to Baddies manually communism. But other Cold War-era tricks such as Red Dawn, Asur's premier premises and performances have made Priya's movies really interesting. The best part of the jungle attack is called Baker (or another father?) By General Mitchell for the top secret mission of South America. The most fun line of the movie is then distributed, "It's my roommate, I have trained him by this", something of the impact. What Have you trained your roommate? And obviously this is going to be the solution to avoid their deportation. <br /> <br /> If you find these gems anywhere you can find on video used, buy them. They are all fun and even funnier after a few beers. See them with a group of your friends for the true MST 3K-style experience. So far, my friends and I have been able to catch Night Wars and Aerobicis Ukraki's "Killer Workout". But most I recommend them all, final approval with final-ranking Robert Zadar.
