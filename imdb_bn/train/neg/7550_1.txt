All right, so I'm a real Wicker Man fan and I do not usually like the re-selection of British movies by Americans, so why did I keep myself through the most painful movie experiences? I'm not a Nicholas cage fan and probably had some time like crazy? The picture was scary! The bits started in the beginning of the crash were not relevance in the film, and the female police knew where Edward was going, so the two girls did not have the bits as soon as they went to the mainland, so the whole thing would be investigated. History behind Wicker's humanity was not really discovered - and I'm guessing that set in America does not really help a totally pagan theme. This picture was slow and there was no atmosphere or mystery. I must say that the best bit was finally up to the end, when the fire of Nicholas cage burned! To clean my depressed soul, I now feel the need to look at the original again. I do not really want to stress on the frustration of this movie, please do not see it: <br /> A) British films do not want to recreate the b. Actual fan c) Hate Nicholas Cage
