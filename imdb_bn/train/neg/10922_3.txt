It's worse than the rating given. It is nowadays an ordinary cipher movie: Bad to acting terrible, a script that is badly written, and straight direction. From the opening scene where Demil will finally give her set, this movie is terrible. Early scenes, in this movie, Moses (Charlton Hesson of the Demil film), Faroh (Eulen Brenner) and Nefertari (Anne Baxter) saw a boy showering a box in the sand. The three mentioned icons were similar to the ones that were horrifying and that they were "supposed" to represent. It is delighted to hit anyone in a deserted desert, and they are all shouting for ambulance. Apparently the authors know that there is no ambulance in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Bakerin decided to make such a low quality film.
