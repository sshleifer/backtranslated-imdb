The film is driven by the fashion of the world for some strange reason. Some people make a film about the killer shark, then suddenly the ocean is awful with huge squids, killer octopus and everyone's sea monsters. When a man is confined to hell from the hell, then the character of each film is taken from a firearm or a flatmate from hell or a culprit from hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company created a big budget FX Laden Blockbuster about Tornado, other filmmakers jumped on the bandwagon, which could not stop them from dragging them to the budget. Twister Night Point is a case. What hit me about this made for the television movie is to try to hide the lack of budget by spending an advertisement break. Each time a tornado actor displays the camera lock in the awful expression, the screen shocks the producers' needs when they shout as "Oh my Goud is heading this way" and "Run for your life". Special effects budget. Unfortunately the quarter should include good actors in the budget of the night. Throws are not bad at all, but they lack disrespect and lack of skill to carry a film that drives the character. Where do you need Josh Hartnette and Elias Wood? <br /> <br /> And this last word is a twister clone ... ............ The yes note was released a couple of months ago on Twitter, but the twist was as a summer blockbuster in 1996 for a few months It was a great feeling for the publicity and note that the note was made and that it was made to circulate around Twitter.
