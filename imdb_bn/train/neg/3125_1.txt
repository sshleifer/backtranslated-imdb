Boris Karloff Matthias Mortwal, Morhne Montevall, lives with some servants of Marhane Manshen and tells his doctor's friend, "Do not try me doctor, doctor, I'm very hateful!" He invited his brother and nephew to his home and warned them that they could inherit a genetic disease that "brain constipation" (?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> *** *** *** SPILILERS *** <br /> <br /> Mortgages / Carlough are going to die, and the killer "toys" (designed by his dead brother) began to kill relatives. A small cannon is a boys face, real bullet fire in a shadow group stabs of people with a life-size drama and a knife of armor attack with real an aged. A guy is strangled making some lovely face. Finally, Julissa and her boyfriend found out that Carleoff is still alive and the staff gates are hiding secretly outside the house. He started talking about the repetitive organ theme (a type of rattle of death used for killing), the brother's spirit ("The whole house will go with me!") And the movement goes into the fire. <br /> <br /> This cute mess does not match very dark, annoying and stupid lip lips.
