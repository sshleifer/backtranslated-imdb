Bride is dying on the altar and their bodies are invisible. Why no one knows who, but an investigator reporter (Luen Walters) thinks that each bride wears a strange orchid and she is its creator. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) goes to the interview. Now do Lorenz is a wicked scientist, sleeping on the coffin and his older wife (Elizabeth Russell), along with some strange habits, fluids containing liquids to keep young young people crazy scientist. <br /> <br /> is a short enough run time that proves interesting and should not be able to get it boring. Unfortunately, when it starts well, it starts dragging half a point and becomes annoying with its clich√©s and predictable plots. <br /> <br /> There are some good things - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and brilliant; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, cultured, lazy and very terrific countess; And I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please keep me interested in the whole picture, and for that, I have to rate it badly.
