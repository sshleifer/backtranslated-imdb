This movie was not programmed in Italian movies, I saw it in a publication named "Fantafistest". I find it a terrible cause, because in some scenes, music videos seem offensive and dark, fluorescent colors can be laughing and there is no doubt that the movie. The song is completely out of the story and there is no sound to describe visual effects to me. If you look in the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but it gets busy after a few minutes. The story is interesting but requires a complete review of development.
