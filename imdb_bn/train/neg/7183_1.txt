This is the worst adaption of a classic story I've ever seen. They unknowingly modernize it and some points are really sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely go with the story. They seem to throw at random. The flying scene with Marlie is stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is not just one of the worst movies, but it's definitely my worst music. <br /> <br /> This is probably considered as a classic because "a Christmas carol" is such a classic story. The original story was not only classic but also some of the cheap adaptations.
