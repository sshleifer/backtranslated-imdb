Whatever this title is, <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo integrates gun, explosives, and stupid killing to create a flow of movie "Action". Let me give my point in a series of questions: Answer type agreement. <br /> <br /> What is a movie? People die <br /> <br /> What is this? Yes <br /> <br /> What's the plot? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br killer is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? They are very defective to their own personality and contradiction. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes I'm sure they used some nice pannivation cameras to draw pictures. <br /> <br /> If you like constant kill and greed, watch the movie. If you would expect this kind of "entertainment", then "Made May" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To add to this, the platoon has decreased, the characters are not worth their worth, the story is completely resilient, and nothing fits together. It proves one thing: actors, directors, and anyone who helped to create this film must not be "made".
