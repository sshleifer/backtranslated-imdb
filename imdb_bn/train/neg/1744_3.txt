I saw the Malayalam film "Boing Boing" (which is probably inspired by an English movie of the same name) created in 1985. The basic story of the hot spice is the same - but it is astonishingly said that the best jokes were replaced by routine jokes in the Hindi film (probably the director used to do this for the Hindi audience taste) ... <br /> <br /> I am in English Not real But really enjoyed the film of Malayalam (Proyonsan himself created), which was later a side-split comedy. Mohanlal's acting, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of a dog) were so natural and spontaneous. Perhaps, I feel the Malayalam film too seriously that I can not even bear even small flaws in its Hindi remake. But I still think there is pressure on Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. Paresh Rawal did a good job - but he did not reach anywhere near Sukumariya. <br /> <br /> But all is well, if it compares with other recent Hindi comedy movies.
