George Brent sent a reporter to a successor interview. She is probably the successor of a face cream fate. She interviewed her yacht. They fall for each other on the bath. <br /> <br /> It becomes (very soon) that it is not a heir. She is part of an advertising campaign for cold cream. <br /> <br /> The image follows up and down their romance. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is not something to blame it. Davis and Brent carry photos. Although it is fairly predictable, it is fairly entertaining. It's far from its best. But, especially considering his ill-health in his heart, this is not his worst.
