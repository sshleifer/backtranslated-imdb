Well, the director has to give credit to what was ridiculous to one. Gutsy should be the right word. He did not use the total cast of only five people (no extra in all), but he decided to use sub-differences special effects with a confusing and annoying plot, he too, and I'm not kidding, be careful that you can return to the beginning of the film. !!! However, they promised a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFIFIIIIINNNNN. A vague limping soil is always a good step. Yaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you see the mystery science theater 3000 you have seen it. They just like to show you awesome movies to show you. <br /> <br /> A good gift for what you hate.
