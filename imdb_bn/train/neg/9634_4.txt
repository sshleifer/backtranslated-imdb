Whatever I give to BOOM, the rating is only due to photography of the fantastic location of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, it's only for hardcore addictts of Elizabeth Taylor (her downward stages), and Richard Burton (her miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The Milk Train Does Stop Heimer" and is very happy about this adaptation of his play - but apparently, he was the only one. Taylor eventually hates it and Burton needs money. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is blowing with the beating of the beans with the poster of the teal and its sharpness, bursting among the servants and talking to the little child. Noyle is a visitor of any other photo than Coward, when he finally appeared. <br /> <br /> It would be so much to learn that among Taylor fans it is probably the kind of thing "must be seen". But if you can sit like this without getting your hands, then you will go ahead of me. Sadly, this movie has been taken seriously as two film actresses, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally crushing and critics called it a BOMB. If you dare to judge yourself
