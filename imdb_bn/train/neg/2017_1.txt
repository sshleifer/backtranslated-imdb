The plot is disturbed but the beautiful and neglected wife of the wild, that is, rich and powerful, is blurred with a psychological shock, then it tries to cover it as a stalk and blackmail. But, from which developments are absurd, irrational. In spite of being available to the normal couple who have the meaning and effect of the normal couple, our special rights hero and heroine are only a domestic, their attorney and local police (who say they can not do anything) are in doubt when they are involved. Terrorists. They do not have any personal security personnel (only such an immune system that they are confused), family or ground staff, Chauffeber etc. Even, apparently, private round-up nurses do not have time to take care of the nurse for personal retirement, life-threatening injuries, leaving both men and women alone and risking their palace. Our heroine is portrayed as having a dorknob and our hero, a tycoon's brain, behaves in the most probable and irrational way. The production is insulting to the audience, who spent time with this drill and for depriving the talent of the veteran actor Oliva Lisa and Don Murray (what they thought?). And shame on Lifetime TV to insult the intelligence of the audience for this inspiration proposal.
