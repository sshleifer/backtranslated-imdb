Walking the other day, see another picture. Finally, in the cold and foggy afternoon, after finishing my Christmas shopping, I had no other place to avoid "Land Lost the Time". Or rather, I had nothing to look like. <br /> <br /> Daggle McCall, in 1916, brought some friends-friendly sailors who were beaten by the U-boat somewhere in the Atlantic. U-boats (in a scene denying signs and causes), they eventually find themselves on a strange island, which is apparently obsolete by human hands. Together, they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and blasphemous! Have they forgot the time that they could flee before being permanent permanent resident? <br /> <br /> Years before "Star Wars", these films have different years of special effects. Model shots are a little better than animals you expect to see in Gary Anderson's "Sting" episode, and animals are not so good. When T-Rex (I think what it was) died, kicked in the same way when you killed them - the middle of the walking and collapsing, the arms and legs were pushed on the horse like a horse. Unbelievable, the sets are not bad, but shy acting and endless blast sounds (which all make the same sound) are faithful and do everything possible to fully enjoy your picture. Characters are not trustworthy or are not worthy of your sympathy because they burn their guns in anything they are running. In the end, I did not care when they did not leave the island, and until finally I got more freedom than entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is all round leather bikinis and line clothes. And even though it was fairly clear from their actions, but you did not know that some letters were from their pronunciation of German. Because of confusion among the viewers and unauthorized by others, the whole thing has some Polish and unity. Overall, this movie registers sensational radioactivity these days, even though you are trying to work in Colin Farrell to get some small amusement. I saw his name in the credit and half a child appears with Irish pronunciation and suspected of facial hair. Well good There is nothing great here to see here, but if you are eating your lunch and the weather is preventing more activity then it is okay.
