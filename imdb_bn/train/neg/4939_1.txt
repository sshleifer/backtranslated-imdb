These stinks peeew! Everyone knows it is based on some Geoco insurance advertising; Nobody knows why? The first to see those ads was first amusing; Very rarely the sheets for a series (Talking Geo Geo - it's another story, now it will create an interesting series!) And why the ABC - Report on the World in the world - actually Gioco is willing to buy the rights of the cave character? Finally, the ideas of the caves of the modern world are unique on TV only. Phil Hartman's debut role was on Saturday night as a lawyer for Anfrojen Kevin, a decade ago. And this is an idea that works best - sometimes as a installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (The 1960 series "It's for Time" used the cave of modern world concepts, it was going on in a season.) <br /> <br /> One of the show's directors was also responsible for the GeoCo advertising. Recently quoted as quoted: "We were very excited when we were shooting our ads because we felt that we had something that was very unique and had a big story to tell us." Wrong <br /> <br /> In the history of Bad TV, along with "May and Chips" of 1972 it will be considered as the greatest ever. The embarrassing Chip Fiasco's main actor was abducted after the sudden disappearance. No doubt our cave friend will follow the suit.
