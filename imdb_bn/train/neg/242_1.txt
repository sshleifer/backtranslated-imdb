There is no idea of ​​any intelligent ideas and disconnected scenes with bad dialogue, bad acting (even Peter Fok can not find his way) "John Christmas Finding" has gone well. Noah's interest in love for his co-star, William Ras Bhan, Hank and David Kabit, without the depth or passion of Miss Bertinelli. Jennifer Pissana, like singer Noho's daughter Sokro, is helpless to sing alone. But who can blame them with stuff like this. Michael J. Murray's script is the best child. <br /> <br /> I look for TV guides at this time every year and really wait for some classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to be present on the small screen. Films "Michelin on 34th Street", Arnest Lübeşt's delightful "shop around the corner" and, of course, the 1951 edition of "Scrooge". Frank Capra's classic "It's a wonderful life" and "John John Dock". Hey, classic forget. What is "Home Alone" or "Home for Holidays" with Holly Hunter and Robert Danny Jr. a great performance? <br /> <br /> My presence advice to you. It would be better to spend your time searching for these movies rather than finding "John Christmas Finding". Happy Christmas!
