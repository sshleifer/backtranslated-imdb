I love the killer insects movie They are very funny to watch, I had to show this movie because it was a hobby of my favorite books. <br /> <br /> I saw him and I heard that the movie was as terrible as he said that I still said that I'm still dead to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: People are going to die mysteriously and gently, and no one has the power to reason. <br /> <br /> There is a possible solution to health practitioner Mike Brady, but his theory of killer slogers laughs at the authorities. <br /> <br /> Just after the counting of the body begins to rise and started snooping around a dirty expert from England it started right after all like Mike had started. <br /> <br /> This movie you see in a movie as most fascinating as ever! These movie slogs are fast (then normal) and they seem to move quickly to the scene! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like a book, the book was ten times scared, ten times poor and had many more stories! <br /> <br /> I did not like all this movie! I like the big fan of the slogs and the second book, Broading Ground! Read the book two great <br /> <br />, then watch the movie, you can like more but I have given this 2 out of 10
