This animated inspector gadget is a long film. The story is very weak, and there are very few steps. Most letters are not given a little bit to do anything. This film is the best for gently entertaining, but not really in any place, and pointless.it's watchable, but only about 80 and animated TV shows that do not appear to be close to the stability of the TV show, which at least does not seem to repeat in my mind. It's about 74 minutes long with credit, so I guess it's a good thing. Unable to watch TV, rooting for letters here here. Is not worth it, you wanted to save the Inspector Gadget on that day, but there, who really thinks? Anyway, it's my opinion. The last case of Inspector Gadget for me is a frustrating 3/10
