God! The only reason I give this movie 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hendes is interesting as Elvis-In-the-Box. In addition, how to film a lam in this semi-known terrorist movie? Perhaps it seems to be a good idea ... there is no smile to mention, stereotypes are unfortunate, the cast is broken, the side is amateur. Now I think about it, most of the blame is probably with the director, Joel Zewec. He finds nothing apart from all the flat performances involved. I do not waste your time like this; But then, I enjoy a good train debris. Geez, now the system tells me I need more lines - go here: this movie should be asked to return to the sender. All right, now the movie was more fun than anything ...
