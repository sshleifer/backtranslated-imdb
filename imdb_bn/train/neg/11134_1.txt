It's a very cheaply made warewolf flick. The video is dark and weak. The audio is uneven and weak record and mixed. This script is clutched with ordinary characters like Clive Raid Junk! [Fill of course with silver bullets] The acting characters are as wooden as. FX does not exist, Vertigo jaws and lots of extreme close ups of bites. It is shown that the only soft core and lots of it. Rather than dropping $ 30 for this trip, check out a really cool new WeArWolf image: "Dog Soldier" with Shane Partaway.
