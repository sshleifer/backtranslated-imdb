Alfred Hittkouk is not my favorite director in any way but imagine what he can do! The plot holds many possibilities for Susense. John Garfield was almost always nice and Raymond Messi fiercely against the type. Nancy Coleman is not a very prominent female leading, but supporter cast is big and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes it starts to start quite well. There are many more coincidences. And an important thing is to make it a little more than a love story, to the end. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch for Garfield, Massey, and Character actors. But it's not very good.
