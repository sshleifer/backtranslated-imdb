At the end of this thriller, the post of Alley Shady's Gout was creatively used to create more violent evil images. He believes that if a bad bet Davis-type role came to him, he could carry it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see this. If shady looks like a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why somebody?) Then your answer is here. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sexually-hungry crazy ladies are really tiring, and if you like this type of thing more than I have to admit you have to put it down badly in this scene. Savage's drunk brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. Among the leading actors, Nicholas Walker did not express any sympathy for Paul Keller's plight and his performance in wood Dara is like Tamanovich and she gets a little bit of time during her scene with Shady. Sheedy's impressive, understated performance (although she often seems to be an automatic pilot) is pretty much commendable but with the rest left out in the context. Poke set, camera work is undistinguished.
