I have never seen this movie as terrible for quite some time as well. The movie was boring, long long and horrific plot. Special effects sucks like hell - it looks like a movie back in 1999. It is a total waste of my hour and a half. Matthew Settle's performance was quite bad. I take him I saw Brothers brand to play Cyprus, he was not bad. Not really bad at all. But in this film, his performance was not credible enough, it was quite bad and there was no chemistry among the rest of the crews. Plus, his eyes seem to be empty so he does not feel it. It made me wonder, because she was good at the band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> However, do not be bothered to see this movie. It's a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill within one or two hours, watch this movie as well as get something else. Trust me, you regret it!
