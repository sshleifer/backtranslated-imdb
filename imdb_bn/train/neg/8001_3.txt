Monitor - he was great; I like the special giant, which made this demon, which seemed to be an updated version of "animals created from black lazoon". With this animal, the world is roaming inside the land and keeps people safe from jam-dropping. <br /> <br /> Social comments: Most of the stories are in the state of Quantin area (according to government orders) as SARS-like diseases are out of state. In short, we get the government cover-up story known. You know, I hope this Liberal paranoid mentality with Hollywood movies always portray our government as corruption, but it seems that the Koreans are copying this format and it is very tedious. Here, it takes away the tension and mystery of the "monster". It just drags down the film In the film, the main family has to be seen from a distance, when a young girl in her family can hold the dead alive. <br /> <br /> MARL: A simple "do not pollute the water." The message may be because of this - a terrible variable monster. It was used as anti-nuclear bomb messages since the 1950s when radiation is the giant ants, spiders, fish or whatever schlky sci-fi film. Now focus on its "environmental problems" that are <br /> <br /> The threat it was mostly stupid. I usually smile at slapstick but this was not funny. I do not know whether the Korean idea is frustrating, or the film is trying to be deliberately exaggerated by taking the film into the old "Godzilla" movie. Hope this is next. <br /> <br /> transfer - video transfer was good. It was decent with a sharp look picture and the sound of many rear speaker crowd in the word. I saw it with English subtitles in Korea. It may be a mistake due to the sound of the Qur'an's ghostler becoming annoying half an hour after the sound. <br /> <br /> Overall - it was a promise but it became a big fall and even annoying in many spots, which is ineligible for a modern day giant film. Two hours was a very long way for this story. I do not know how to draw the picture of this picture recorded in Korea. They can not live much more in the way of film to enjoy and support.
