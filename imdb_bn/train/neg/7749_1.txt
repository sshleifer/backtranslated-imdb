This movie should never have been. From the badly done animation, from bad acting. I'm not sure what people said about this movie, "OK, look good!" I was really scared about how horrid really this movie is. At one moment, maybe it might be a good point, a computer is made, Sobor Sobor tooth tears off the stupid creator of cats from the ceiling ... Oh, Ouukkake. The film's villain was a paralyzed subretoot that killed her first appearance within a few minutes. The other two managed to burn and kill a boxer before shooting down the gun. Then, a random wild animal is waiting for the victims ... which I fear for the only reason. Will be a part two? God, I do not expect people everywhere ... <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was pure garbage. The slide show from the power point to the credit credits.
