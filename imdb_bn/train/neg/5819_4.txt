This is a story of a Jewish vicious family. The parents are divorced and the former residues return to the mother's house. Dad, Murray Abromovitz, with his children, went to California and moved around Beverly Hills so that his children could get the right maker. <br /> <br /> Maryam's maternal grandfather, Merissa Tomi, lives with the group. <br /> <br /> This image is related to the events of complex families of the surroundings with the surrounding neighboring drug view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They play Moore's brother and sister respectively; They are your father. In front of children, Rayner reminds me that he is paying the bill for him. <br /> <br /> This picture ends arbitrarily because the embarrassing family comes out of their fancy pitch and takes their car riding around the Beverly Hills. I think the film is promoting freedom and some good old self respect.
