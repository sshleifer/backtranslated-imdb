I started to see some of this film's barely tolerable Hammer horror film wannabe ... and I was not far away. There is a lot of glamorous gore, and they have thrown a lot of nudity, but the last half of the film presents a few harmful twists. Sacred cows, they actually think of the story, and do not fall completely into expected anticipation at the beginning. And I dare say it, because some "gratuitous" nudity was not void after all, because it fit with the story and setting. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, it's still a bad movie overall, but it's even more intelligent than the really awesome Tripe, like bad movies such as Lost Women and Robot Monster.
