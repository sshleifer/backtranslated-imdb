There was something about this perfect life of female leadership that he wanted most of the worst life after all, a child started prostitution and was roaming with Eric Roberts. But his background makes it impossible for him to believe Dean Kaiin and he ends it in the end. It sounds weird, but I loved the location of Dan Kain and she was liked to prefer. She does not love her because she loves her and she thinks of her child's mother (I think it is not time for her child and her brother), but in the same way she can not forgive her for what she did. Sleeping with his brother (which he feels that the love and the obligation he felt was quite a way) and then he became part of his death. It's a good movie in the best hands, but some I catch on the wire at late night, it's not bad.
