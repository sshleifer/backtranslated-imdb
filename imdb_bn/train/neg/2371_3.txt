I'm not the big fan of Freddie Kruger, but that does not mean that I do not like his other nightmares in movies in Robert England and Elm Street. I think Robert is very good actor. Nobody is better than Freddie Kr√ºger. He However, Robert did no crime, this movie sucked. Acting is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddie Kruger is the only part of throwing that observers valuable. Sometimes the sequels may be better than the first, as the 13th franchise on Friday (I think the rebuild was the best in the series.) But it's not one of those movies. The original was good, in my opinion the second was good, the third was OK but I'm here, I saw others. Whatever you do, I did the same mistake, I saw this fragment.
