I was very disappointed by this movie. I thought that "horror movie" though a great movie was not very good and funny. On the other hand, "Scary Movie 2" was rather annoying, not funny, and sometimes it was a fool. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / MTV Spuff was probably the best part of the film. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I have some difficulty because I have not seen some of these films that these parodies are like the first ones, where I saw them all in the basics. But bad comedy still bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hit this movie was time, which could be a good joke. The scene and the jokes dragged along the long path. For example, talking birds. OK it was funny and even second time. But keep getting it repetitive to the annoying point. The routine between Wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun, but it was repeated and fooled and even lost. <br /> <br /> Some jokes even repeat from the first movie. For example, 'creaming' I guess that you call Cindy (Anna Faris) "horror movie" was so funny because Syndi was going out to give sex to her boyfriend so long, then she got the blue force from the blue ball and when she 'creamed 'It was fun. But this time it was almost everywhere and not funny. <br /> <br /> In general the first time the bathroom and sex humor was more fun and better time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Wayans) in my opinion was the most fun character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot plant was my darling from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, I love the Wayan family and their humor. Why is this picture so frustrating? . . They have a lot more comic powers than endless scat joke.
