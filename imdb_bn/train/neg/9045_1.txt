The film started with a bit of a conspiracy, then abandoned it for abandonment to do anything with an endless series of random characters and stories going forward. It was impossible to engage with this photo. This movie is a very ironic pile of rubbish made by some people with animation skills, but there is a complete lack of creativity or story telling. It's a shockingly bad effort coming from a big studio. Clearly there is no mention of lack of motivation and motivation problems in Disney, lack of full control of supervision and quality. The arrangement allows the viewing of the film in the light of the day, as the volume of their disability and frustration. This movie joins my very short "worst movie of all time" list.
