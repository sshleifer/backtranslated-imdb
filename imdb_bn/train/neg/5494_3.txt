<br /> <br /> Cheap look and ugly, this movie does not seem to entertain the children in the audience, except for the funny fun of the toilet. Christopher Lloyd is past his chief and indeed very tedious in this role, although the writers do not help to excuse a joke. Elizabeth Hurley is an emotive comic roles embarrassing amateurish. Jeff Danielle and Darley Hanna to avoid humiliation. There is no reason to create this movie, especially it is essential that it is often compared with Robin Williams with the great progress of Mark and Mindy. <br /> <br />
