I have never posted a review before, but I had to do this for the film! This film is so bad, I tried to prove myself as bad as trying to think of a worm or parody. But it's not. It really, non-self-aware BAD. It's a serious effort that flops seriously Other critics have highlighted many errors in the picture, so I will try not to repeat this, but I request you to watch this movie. I was silent all the time, was literally molten with mistrust, or I was roaming in the floor with violence. I was not so much fun watching a film for years. Actually, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's such a movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - Arthur auditioning - the boy (his dance incredible) - unwanted nudity (the director / main actor just got to get a nude shot) - the presentation of his cardboard and crayon in the preacher's office - of course , Famous Wedding Trees and Hidden Scene Scenes (How does this story work?)? - Ex-wife wrestling match to get possession of gun with Ben - A detailed order that kills Arthur's preacher; He apparently burned him with this incredibly refined match - yes, with his bloody hair and Weiho Fashion - and the soundtrack close to my favorite, the soundtrack opening of the song "The Entertainer" of Juplin and the "Patchbell Canon D Major" with the gay saint's brother! - Goes to the list - one must definitely see !!!
