Those who really like the problem children (1990) need to check their heads. Who will adopt the idea of ​​destroying the insulting little boy on others and it will be funny? The movie is not funny, sometimes, it starts at the end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the authors do not realize that it is not frustrating when people are attacked by beer or injured by a baseball bat. It may be fun for cartoons, but not in a motion picture. <br /> <br /> The young hero junior of the movie (Michael Oliver) who was a child, was taken in front of his parents' parents in front of the door. The family refused him, because junior had to give them tough times. <br /> <br /> She is thrown into an orphanage, where she is subjected to nuns terrorism and wrote a pen letter to the convicted b-typed murderer (Michael Richards). He is soon received by Ben and Flow Healy (late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasebak), who may be like their parents, like their parents. Jr. became a member of Hilly family, and "Little" Ben expressed interest in him, although he sprayed a beer site onto the campus trip, or left his father's "Big" Ben Cat. Jack Warden), an intelligent politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of our junior so that we can make a route for him while taking revenge on people. His new mother, Flow, a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl - who despises the adopted children - such a broken brat. <br /> <br /> But junior wants to get the end? Laughter is not funny - it means cruel, and sometimes life threatens. What is <br /> <br /> and photo message? Should that problem be resolved with children's violence and atrocities? Should they seek friendship by writing to the convicted killers? They definitely do not want it to be a bad kid. Junior is not one - he's just a sadistic, little twerp. It was a time when the kids were bad to beat others. Now, everyone's smile when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat <br /> <br /> This is a shame that this movie has been sold as a "family comedy." What is worse is the problem that the child is rated PG. They saw what MPA was thinking? There are many immoral and meaningful jokes here, anyone can be surprised by the division between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy it, but parents will be frustrated over what is featured on the screen. And in the case of most people, the child will be considered as a "guilty pleasure" classic; Any film will admire to choose shamefully, although conventional opinions are expressed by more serious audiences, that is the film crap.
