The unidentified plot, a large number of guided / super-chessy scenes (sniper / world famous sharp enemies who can not hit their target a few feet away? Plus ends in the end? ---> Shooting gallery of the carnival vaulting a group of law enforcement forces ? WTH?), Technical error (How many bullets can you fit in any gloss magazine? 100+? Load these loads Ojana fire their guns without permits). The film is so bad that Michael Beer (aliens, terminator) and even senior Hollywood actors can not save this junket. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I feel like I've ruined some good 100 minutes), this is a precious life). Hope the director can stop making cinemas, or learn more for his next movie.
