This movie is so awesome, it makes the angels lose their wings. Shake tried more for Anse with his work in Shake-Fu and his helpless rap albums and then attempted other crossover efforts to serve the epic of steel making terrible film. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not a good thing to say about this movie. When I was very young, I saw a bunch of it, but I was a fool, because these movies are enjoyable for films and they make it different. It's fun fun I have seen it in the Disney Channel a few days ago and spent a few minutes. Although it's an exciting adventure of fun once, you are still frustrated by its horrors. <br /> <br /> Try it if you watch it on TV: When viewing your movie, remove it from the scene which Shake uses its magical gene capability. If you do this, it is pushing a child behind your back and slapping it to persuade him. It's very funny, and boring. <br /> <br /> An awesome example of the picture. No, watch this movie, until it gets scoffed.
