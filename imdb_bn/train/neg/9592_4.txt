I recently saw this movie, though it was published in 2001. I have hoped to watch an entertainment movie, but I'm not saying that the princess blade is nothing compared to Azumir. "Princess" is not very fictional, as you've noticed ... He reminded me of Gene Cloud Van Dam, who only saw his point of view, then awakened from the opponents. During the whole movie, I had at least one confession about what she liked, why she was fighting, she loved and believed to be waiting to see it. I waited in vain Nasty movie Nasty dialog. Do not see it until you get annoyed with your mind! That's a bad thing, until finally I was wondering how I did not want to scream for half an hour in frustration. Guess I give a 4/10.
