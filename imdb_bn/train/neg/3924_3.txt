Really terrible, provocative, endless film. Director Belokio is inspired by his actress Ditmars's fantastic face and image - and who can blame him? But perhaps, perhaps, he should be a little focused on making a good, compelling film. When I poses as a "film of art" in a sex film I hate it just more "respectful". Frequently, sometimes hot sex scenes are the only reason for the existence of this movie. It is a matter of taste whether they are valuable for sitting in the rest of the picture. (*)
