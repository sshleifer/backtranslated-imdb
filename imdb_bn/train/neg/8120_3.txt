Between at least 100 votes or more movies. Nominated for the best screenplay written straight for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for Best Actress for a Leading Role ?? Nominated for best photo ?? I do not always agree with many on Oscars, but this film can be the worst movie ever to honor the academy. Both writing and acting were horrible. Specifically the performance of Blathine which I saw is the worst, and perhaps the highest performance rating performance performance. The horror movie is not suitable for big screen and is not worthy of a cable or television channel that it never played, including HBO (where I saw it). I am grateful that I did not really see one of the highest rated movies.
