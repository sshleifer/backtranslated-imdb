Tooth fairy is about an old deformed magician who gives reward to his children to give teeth to their children and then they take their lives. In the first few minutes, you start switching tooth fairy tales at the beginning of 1949 and then today. The wearing of the terrible plot is much preserved by playing hard. They could work without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall Gore's scenes were bloody, but quickly had a tiny effect. Eye candy is quite good for both genders. Camera work is good. The dialog is fair but delicious I hope the film will have a bare bone, low budget, slasher with very little redemption reasons. I was surprised to see the picture's qualities.
