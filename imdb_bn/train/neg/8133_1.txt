The movie is as interesting as looking at the sun. Sheriff Pattaki, who is sitting behind his fat, does not like to do anything better than to make a smoking ring from his lung cigar, and when the doctor acts like a zombie version, Nicholas Cigarette has spilled everything "blood", which is actually fruit punch Seems like it was. <br /> <br /> Most of the plot seems so horrible that this piece of the movie is called a movie. The rest of the character wasted time in this movie, the end was horrific, the outline was Chess, and the scenes were terrible. What do I say to the audience? If you have already seen the movie, then my suggestions will be to get your Robi shots. If you have not got your up to date shot, then this movie can give you a face foam.
