So ... it's really sexist, and classified, and I thought it might not be at the first stage of the movie, as Stella tells Steven that she wants to change herself and starts talking properly and she does not change her. Well, he has changed his tune, and it seems like other critics have followed. What seems to be a love story at the beginning is really as social placement and women's sacrificial mother. The end of the film does not make him a hero, it saddens the whole thing. And her grief is that people think it makes him a hero. Perhaps the comment that the person has to take. Positive reception reflects the continuous patriarchal flow of social conscience. Yuck
