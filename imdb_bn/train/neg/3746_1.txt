It's hard for me to believe, in the last few years, this horrifying reality shows, it will take the leading place for the worst. I'm still wondering if this was really an explosion by a SCTV gang. If Andy Coffman is still alive, I was sure that she was behind. Since a rock band can do a less stoop than INXS to make such a shameful thing? The courtyard is simple and moronic. Karaoke has refused to be the new chief of the INXS to take place for Michael McHuckens (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years later and after no hits, the band has done the ultimate act of painting herself by bandwidth a group audition, which could be its new lead singer of the band's 20th year earlier. So they do not have fantastic renditions of classic (and anticipated) rock songs just imaginary to all those terrible singers who pull all the tension (I was sharing American Idol's doozies). And then they cut off INXS band members who are seriously discussing the eligibility of these candidates. You see better (and more original) rock performance in any night of any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has normal irregularities in all other reality shows. Lam reality participants, lam interview, lam host / emcee, trial of "performance" and a participant lame boot at the end of each show. Can any of these shows be published? This is clearly a promotion stunt in the band part; Finally, the last hope for the hope of reviving their lost StarDome before being buried in astonishing burial If Michael Huttcens, if there is any discipline in the status of living, then he will have to enter his graveyard. INXS was never a great band, but I was not unhappy about this. If there is any rock and roll representative of the INXS, this program will be the final proof that rock and roll are dead once and for all.
