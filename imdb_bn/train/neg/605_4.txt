I will not be able to get a full review like this one full movie. <br /> <br /> Setting the setting, this movie can be really special. It can be "28 days later" or even "Blair Witch Project". <br /> <br /> I was really excited for the first 20 minute movie, Director did a good job with cinematography and mystery, although I do not think he could achieve the real solitude of an empty London Underground. <br /> <br /> The letters are bigger. Our "heroine" in this movie is a froth piece, and if you do not really die, she does not care. Many people said before, I was transformed into homeless people and black people, who led me to give chocolate or two (writers deliberately or not). <br /> <br /> Chief villain, kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when I was revealed I was really frustrated. I will not loot it but tell me that my 10-year-old sister might possibly hit him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> All these are just another medieval horror film that is trapped to follow. Simple Hollywood Formula. There was a lot of potential in this film, but in reality it failed to hit. <br /> <br /> To show how tall this film was, there were at least five times to complete the character of this movie and the main villain was killed. They run away from fear.
