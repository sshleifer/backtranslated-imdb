*** SPEAKER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Team Roth, I really do, and she works her best with an incredible role. I can see that this is a movie that looks as good as a script, but it is slowly, impossible and ultimately silly. I saw the last fake fake death approaching a mile. Ren Z. tries hard with an underwritten part, and so does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can not remember (that is not Chris Pen) is a big sweaty on the actor. You are not efficient enough to make a difference in the film, if it is so clever, you can not follow it and you can not understand it confusing. See if it makes you sticky camera work that makes you seasick. If you love Team Roth to work with unnecessary scripts, check it out. See when it comes late for free for the night. Otherwise, the general suspect fares.
