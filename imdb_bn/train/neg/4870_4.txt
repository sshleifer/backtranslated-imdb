The movie is bad. Nothing special - it's a "kid" movie with a serious thing. There is a reason to look at it: animal talk. Some of them are very funny, you just can not laugh. So if you want to listen to dogs in dog pounds, say "what do I mean?", Or other animals say, "you're walking a dead cat", or a very interesting fishing boat. Because there is no other good movie to visit it. Voted: 10 out of 4
