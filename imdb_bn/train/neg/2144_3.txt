I always thought that Cinderella was the second worst movie I ever saw, (after Peter Pan 2 and Lynn King 2 and Hanbak of Notre Dame 2, like some other series). All these movies are made with the same idea; Because there is no plot in the movie, they try to fill it with jokes for it. I'm not saying that Jokes are bad, but they mostly make movies. The first time I watch the movie, I'll give it 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not think the original movie is best, they only care about the movie. I still think the movie was a bad series, but that does not mean it's terrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
