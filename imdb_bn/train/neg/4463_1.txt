This is a movie that you have seen again when you see it, and then for a while, you have misunderstood it while spending time, video store, etc. <br /> <br /> First stop, look: it velocity, it is less Budget. Now that's not for a bad film on itself. But the manner in which it was depicted shows an incompatible form, so it is confusing. <br /> <br /> then the story. 3 gals guys go away on a gal's weekend. Of course, everyone is doing the camping trip, they close the road to get earrings. While reaching the area where they are going to be, they Ranger pulls from the sire, who push them to throw fire in the cigarette fire season and then run them wherever they are going. (A remote cabin). Of course, 2 "cute boys" roam around them, and Bamby (yes, Bambi) and Oberoi were beaten immediately, but Bambi apparently suffered any kind of injuries. Madi was rather disappointed because of this development because she was waiting for her former forgotten weekend - face-to-face with her daughters and threw stones. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have forgotten about it, there is such an old old Hermit that lives like this, probably it does not conflict with anyone, and there is a "fame" of the area and cabin they live in. <br /> <br /> Of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, after a lot of time) our weekend began to die of wood viewers and found various stupid traps (although some of them actually actually have a little less) and of course the remaining campers Do not understand Which cell phone reception course (will miss the chance to check their cell phones to receive a movie reception?) Mr. Rangar is popping on a strange time and his behavior seems a little different but he says he'll get help. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic package that you will not miss even if you are still awake. Pray for you to wake up on a blank screen. <br /> <br /> It's terrible to play, production costs are terrible, and the whole initiative is just lingle and I also got rid of it. This is great. To avoid all costs, 10 out of 1.
