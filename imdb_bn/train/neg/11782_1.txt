The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst movie seen on this date. I was not able to top the list of bad bad movies, but it was worth getting gold. It's not funny. It's bad acting, it's bad shooting and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that there are three girls in it. I really believe this flicker has threatened one of David's film "Stranger Wooden Hagener", which is the worst movie movie! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
