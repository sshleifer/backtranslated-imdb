All right, I recently got the opportunity to rent it and saw the Santa Claus win Martin. Although the children were very sad at the SCCTM, but I have to say that Santa Claus was a very bad movie. We all had to see it as a Spanish assignment in Spanish. I'll tell you, when we look at a movie we all just talk and eat, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept Jao open, thinking, what Mr. Mr. Peach was going to do. Marlon Santa Claus will help! Or will his robot come to Rainier and save the day? I suggest renting it because it's a big trunk I've ever seen and I like it for. : D
