Most of the use of digital technology has been made to 'fill' the background. Sometimes it works well, where Grace and her maid are particularly attractive to witness the King's execution. Other times it gives the film a wonderful amateur look, which is similar to a home video. However, the main failure, the inferior artistry of the MySN scene, has an isolated effect in viewers. We know that what we see is not real, so how can we feel for the characters? I do not care what happened to Frank, Lady or Duke. <br /> <br /> As another major failure, I mean, Lucy Russell's performance in the main role. He almost rests his performance and film success or otherwise his performance. OK she speaks a foreign language but she is unable to express real passion. He sees his friend Mame de Mileer (the first actor Helena Dubeel's extraordinary performance) to feel that he made some embarrassed smiles in the audience by seeing the head on a pole. Also, when he expresses emotions, look at his hand! <br /> <br /> All very frustrating movies, especially given positive reviews on this site.
