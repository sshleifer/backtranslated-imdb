I have seen this movie in my international film class and are going to go. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While speaking, she met a woman named Christine and decided to stay with her when her boyfriend discovered how interesting it was. To make it plainer, Reve likes Dutch sausage. So Reve Christine's boyfriend concocts a plan to seduce so that she can eventually have sex with her. But later it was discovered that Christine had 3 previous husbands, she killed them all. Now may Reve and Christine's boyfriend "4th man." Storyline makes sense with no intrigue holes. Technically executing this film and everything else is totally fine. The film is fairly rough and I felt the need to vomit in some areas. Basically, this is not my cup tea. <br /> <br /> The movie comes out of bed only in a T-shirt. So very soon, you'll see Flappy flipping around Reve's lovely pecker as a Hangover state walks around its cramped apartment. She has a dream later, where her little scales are cut by a pair and they show it along with the bloodstream. Jesus fondles an idol and has gay sex in a grave. Plus there are many bloods. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie revolves around shock quality. <br /> <br /> Check out this movie if you have any cup of tea. Otherwise, stay away from this one far away. My mind is still scarred.
