Generally I'm not motivating to write reviews. But I think that this movie was so painful painful. I cringed at the unexpectedly intriguing plot, Liam was supposed to act and be in tune, which laugh at the moment. In fact, most of the viewers were quite annoying and uncomfortable at the "most imagined" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood as the only performance of any qualification in the oppressed production. Even the end was not "fat". I heard it that the movie did not take it seriously. But I get some evidence of the movie. <br /> <br /> The cut room should have been cut in the floor. Make yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
