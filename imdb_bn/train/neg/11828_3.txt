A few months ago, I was involved in controversy about another film about IMDB poster (Hey, Kemmedne). The poster emphasized that if I gave 'Flush Away' a chance, I would like to. Partially based on this argument, I agreed to watch the film. <br /> <br /> 'Flush Away' was intended (at least in Armman's part), but there is no power to unite all. His best asset was the Sueyar Rat / Boat Captain, Rita (played by Kate Winslitt), who should be the main character of the movie instead of IMO, Roddy (Hugh Jackman). The style is cool, solid, and attractive when Roddie spent most of his screen time snipping. <br /> <br /> The things that disturbed me most about 'FAA', with the repetition of non-depressant pairs. When Roddie was suddenly hit, the film ensured that she was immediately hit five more times. One of Rita's brothers said, "My name is Shaki," who then ate three times electrocoron Rudy at least three times. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, but I would say I'm disappointed with Arman. They could (and be done) so much better. Next time, try hard,
