I do not know what Shield's producers were trying to do, but the results themselves say: the shield is virtually unwanted. Looks like Shield's performance is awesome ... <br /> <br /> In reality, the show has so badly been combined that you can not really see the performance. For example, edits will move away from the response shots before they are fully impacted. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the intellectual reasoning for him, but it listens to all psychological effects. <br /> <br /> I'll give Shield a point for the ambition of his content, but it is much more than what I can give. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> actors waste their gifts so curiously portrayed something badly.
