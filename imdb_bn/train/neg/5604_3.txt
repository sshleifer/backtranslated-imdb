I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally got the chance to watch it. Cheerleading camps were closed in late 1963 and 1969 due to the mass killing of Chinese cheerleaders. In early 1982, and Bamby's alumni, with new recruits, it opens with Can Candy (Carroll Why), Glen (Judge Reynold), and Sandy (Deborrey Scott). One by one, they are murdered by the killer, only one remains. <br /> <br /> In this picture, Tom Smith is making a terrible accusation like the Canadian Mountains and Paul Rubes is doing his Pee-Wee Herman skiing. The overall plot does not develop very well, and is quite long, but some funny scenes, such as Bad Pies House and Strip Poker Scenes can happen. The last thing seems to be thrown together, which is shameful. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's fairly good for about ten to fifteen minutes, the rest can only proceed. Maybe caught on TV, but it is not worth buying.
