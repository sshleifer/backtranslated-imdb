Not a bad start to the program - but to face the real law enforcement sooner or later. The worst part of the series is that it tries to deliver itself as a fare for reality - and anything else. Law enforcementers are better off than men and women who sacrifice their life. Next, what is a medical school in a minute? Charo lipo doing? Charles Grodin Helps Replace A Hip? Come on ... show some respect. Even Munshi citizens are holding programs as programs. Police Academy = High school gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use the Taco Bell car-shot shot in the background?), Chess Sareen effects (the same loop adds the call to the 'call' rolling code or not) but at least not - the officer's security problems are more than you Takes it. <br /> <br /> If I want to see police working and knowing fake feline police, I'll see the Reno 911.
