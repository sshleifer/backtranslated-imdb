I still can not believe this movie. They got so incredible things, anyone who wants to do it is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but it means to be funny, but not like any story. How do you mix a slopstick comedy with train robbery, a prison movie, city fantasy, rage and an FBI-agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> The most awesome thing is awesome, as well as the actor. I saw this picture and thought: 'Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) this Charlie Shin? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is very bad for all of them. (At the end) No, no, no, it can not be Martin Shin! Such a movie is not for 10 seconds. 'Then it was up with my nerves and I was down. So much better, oscar-winning, usually actors such as stupid, stupid, awful actors in horror movies. I rarely wanted to know how they came to do this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
