I do not know what they thought. They, I connect anyone with this disaster remotely. I saw so bad movies, I saw so bad movies, and then it's there. But I wrote the article. Anyone who has written the script, can write the most crazy dialogue in writing. There is no good about this movie, either from a technical perspective or from a different perspective. Should anyone allow it to be created and then released immediately should be fired. There are some fairly well-known names in this movie. Actually I do not hesitate to use the film. It is like collection of more unused scenes, which are not related to others and less than 0 in the sense. , I see why such a thing will be seen in such a way. I got it really cheap and I still got leaked. Even if I can get this movie free, I will still be leaked. 0/10
