It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but the hostel certainly is worse. This movie is more fun and ridiculous than scary. I saw when laughing most of the time. Low effects (when you go to see it, understand what I'm saying and how low quality), bad actors (I hear them for the first time), and it seems to be shot by an amateur camcorder (so it's a movie Than looks more like a TV show). But at least I was patient to see it at the end. Like a comedy? See it Want to be horrified? See Zeo-on: The Grze or any other horrible movie. <br /> <br /> If I talk about Diablo's legend, I do not even know if I can classify it in the style of Horror. Just a few low budget budgets. <br /> <br /> I rated 3 out of 10
