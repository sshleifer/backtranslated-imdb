I could not believe how this link was pointless. Basically there is nothing to smile in the movie, in the rest of the scenes you see very few scenes to be interested. This movie has been shot in a big way but they are lost in my opinion. I think before watching the Matrix, Kevin Reve will send some of the film some years later. Uma Thurman looked very easy and humble. Thankfully, I found this movie for very low price because it is certainly not a movie remembered for a good reason. I will not write anything about the story of the movie, but you should know that he is known throughout America as one of the most famous hits. I will give this movie to be 10/10. Before this movie I saw why this movie got 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very frustrating movie. Even if you see it under $ 5 do not buy it.
