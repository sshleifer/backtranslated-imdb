When I first saw this movie, it was a train's title in the train and it was half part of a double feature. Glenn Ford, a surgical specialist, was asked to disperse a bomb hidden on a train loaded with high explosives. The tension is slow and permanent; And this black and white film only runs one hour and twelve minutes. After all these years on TV; The tension and drama lost most of its impact. It's a good movie up to 50 degree standard. <br /> <br /> alongside Ford, along with Anne Vernon and Morris Denham. Villain / Sabotur is played by Victor Madner.
