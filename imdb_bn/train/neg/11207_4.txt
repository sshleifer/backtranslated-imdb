As the bright fan of the flashman of George McDonald Fraser, I look forward to seeing the big screen flashy during this film's first liberation war. Sadly, this was a big disappointment - so I left it for 20 years before going back to see it again, but it was not good for the second time. Mr. Fraser is a great writer, but I'm not fond of his film screenwriter with Richard Lester. 'The Three Musketeers' for slopstick looted me and the same applies here. To me, the full voice and feeling of the film is wrong. Flashman books are mostly funny at most, but they are adventurous novels. There is a lot of seriousness in Flashman's courage - finally, he is involved in dangerous situations. It has been published in novels, but it has not been released due to its comedy style. It's a great shame because it's a great movie, it can be a more lucrative adaptation of the book's style. When I first read the book, the article said that the film had to play Oliver Reid. I'm glad, I had Reid Flashman's identity. I would love to see how the role plays. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the flashman's visual image of the book (looking very glamorous, Flashman is considered to be a big strapping fellow). Yet Reid Bismarck was as nice. What the image kills is made as a comedy. The book is the only real-life creator that killed Flashman The Gateet (Tom Bell). The production price, costumes, sets, etc. are a great shame, fantastic and casting is generally extraordinary - apart from Malcolm McDowell, everyone is different in this film. Perhaps the latest radio adaptation of Mr. Fraser adapted 'Flash for Freedom' was responsible for the management of Richard Letster. Perhaps one day we can see justice on the flamesman screen.
