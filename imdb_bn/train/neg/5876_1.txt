My Shakespeare class had to compare two versions of Hamlet, and unfortunately I liked this version. In the camera shots (all media or closed shots ... a very low back ground in a scenic shot and shots) (acting actors direct their lines straight to the camera) is terrible. I saw it on my spring break and it seems safe to me that I was gypped out of my holiday 114 minutes. Imagination is not recommended by any stretch.
