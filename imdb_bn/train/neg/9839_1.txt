This movie was good at the beginning. When he said he wanted to kill himself, he started to get really stupid. I think if I come from a small town then I would be shocked to see this movie. They make many people look stupid and crazy. What can these people do so long ago that they follow him throughout the day? Many people were saying this man the way to kill him, as they called him to do so. How many people can have little respect for others? I think they could finish this movie better. There were some good parts in this movie. Some people may like it, but I will not recommend this to anyone.
