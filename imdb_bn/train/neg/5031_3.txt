The original film "Gamera" in 1965, http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was originally updated for the bold, low-cost children of Goji (Godzilla) for the sensitivity of the 1960s. Gamma must be a giant, flying, flame-cinder turtle which literally eats energy - not as big as some version of Gadijila, but usually it is similar in most cases. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film was edited and repeated by the notorious Sandy Frank. And like the American version of Godzilla ("King of the Monsters"), "Gamma the Engineer" is more than just spelling mistakes. American scenes are often not ridiculous and ridiculous to join glory, but do not pay much attention to the story because it has little to follow. <br /> <br /> The film begins to be committed, has some scenes of character development and has enough personality to create some excitement outside the main plot. Once Gammar appeared, the film came down to a fairly run-of-mill-Kaizu film. <br /> <br /> The acting is good enough - even the American add-ons are all right. The guidelines are quite good for this period and style, and special effects are not bad for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrop are actually very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is that there is nothing original about this movie. However, Gamma has developed a more unique personality in his subsequent films - most of them if you are a Qayyuju fan, it is worth watching.
