I could not wait to see this movie! So I finally got it and I was quite frustrated. Initially, the movie has so little say in New York that confusing shots of buildings, roads, bridges and cafes. It really does not focus on magic in New York. The other thing that changed my mind was the French film set inside the movie. I know it's a remix, but it's not a French style remix! However, here you will notice elements that remind you of French movies, such as tall and dirty scenes, little or no words, and of course everyone is smoking the French style! The story follows many lives (many for my taste) and they seem to be finally connected. I think there were no such sacrifices as stories in the stories. The film was all too small to satisfy a single fate. So we can see about 30 people for about 30 minutes. And there you have 120 minutes! If you like active scene dialogue and stuff, this is not a movie for you! Because I give it 4 just because I love New York and I like to throw!
