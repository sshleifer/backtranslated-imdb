I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredible. First shot feeds a camera from a robot traveling on a bomb and, naturally, is shaky. But then the rest of the film is in Shakayakam mode, even in a quiet conversation moment, to ridicule. Have Trips And Steadicams Run Rent Rooms? It does not help the fact that 16 mm is shot, as the whole movie grainy as well as shaky. <br /> <br /> In order to make all efforts, the Bigelos have entered the appropriate vehicles and equipment, there are considerable flaws and inconsistencies that they reduce the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - After a single shot a car will not burn in the fire, and once melted once will not be submerged by a small hand held exterminator. <br /> <br /> - The only hamburger will not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but other vehicles will support him for breakout or attack. - It is unlikely to hit the rebel in the long range, where the bullet clearly takes more than second seconds to reach. <br /> <br /> - I believe that the bombs were brought to the settlement area near or near the base, there is no random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil tanker attack is thought to have happened in Green Zone, it is a very safe area that has faced very few attacks. The region is mostly portrayed as a dangerous warren and hidden rebels in the dark alleys, but with few residents and offices in the palace. Surprisingly, James never started to try to put an end to the humorous technique of ordering his two companions to take a lane by themselves. <br /> <br /> - To talk, 3-Man team always clearly illustrates building buildings, followers of rebels, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not know that the EOD team did not report any other letter. These things know the characters, so we should also. <br /> <br /> Many "wonderful" scenes and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is clear that the psychiatrist may be having problems with the colonel trying to run with the Iraqis, the ones that are waiting for the return of the cereals will be returned, and the car that was kidnapped will not wait to leave your vehicle. <<br /> Finally there was a complete lack of character development. Since the beginning, Renner's character is hateful in the house, it is unknown and addicted to adrenaline. She is exactly the same at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Based on half an hour I saw it, I would instead recommend the genation kills on HBO.
