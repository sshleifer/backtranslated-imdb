John Pressman (Michael 'I Kinda Ditke' Learned as Learner) works as a guide for a doctor's office. His mother (Gelda Poltestist 'Rubenstein) saw him as if he felt that he was treated unfairly. But it turned into a movie as a movie, but the line soon blur the line as soon as John goes to kill a movie theater. Request a person watching a movie to do the same. La erner is appropriate at the top of this, but Jelda repeatedly repeats the dialogue line. That gets boring quickly. But the two girls who are watching movies in the movie are not boring. Like this horror movie it fails, it tries to be tricky, tries to give a message and thinks that a slasher is needed to understand the film, or at least one jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slash: an art house. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
