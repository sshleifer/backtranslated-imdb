There is a surprisingly high number of 8-10 STAR reviews from such people, who have not written an IMDB review earlier or later. Giving a very low rating to the movie by other people, I think you can draw your own decisions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I would admit it, I thought it was nice, and I was very happy to see Angels performing acting actors Eve and Harmony, but it did not take long for the film's horror. <br /> Acting: Lead is fair enough , But everyone else? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People really Do you think laughing? Oh boy <br /> <br /> Candy: OK. There were some really beautiful women in this movie. Just three main female characters, but the right across the board. As the producers hoped that the scenes would distract the male audience so much that they would not see any other terrible fear. If so, they have failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hand it can be nice but boldly fun camp classic. It was not even close.
