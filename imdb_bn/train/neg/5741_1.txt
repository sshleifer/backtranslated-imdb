<br /> <br /> I have a big horror / science-fan fan regardless of the budget, but after watching countless horror movies of the late night on the cable and video, it is the worst of all movies. Bloody special effects (a roast or ketchup covered in fake blood, which are being repeatedly seen) and people walking on the left side, then returning to the right. It should be with the initial convenience store scene and stop there and it's been 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged too long. It's very, very low budget in the X5. The way many views, the way is too long. The singer was very amateur sound like a random person out of very young height. The only film to reduce my views compared to Manas, Red Zune Cuba, Benzie and Godzilla v. Megaln is less, despite their high budget. Try to wake up 10 snoozes, one setting or better condition through the whole movie, let it avoid it so that you become a non-eating person of the brain.
