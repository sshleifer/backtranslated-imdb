The unexpected comedy story about Paul, a little child's nice man (Jason Lee), who wakes up in bed with Beckie (Julia Styles) after the night of his Bachelor party, an attractive blonde who had met him earlier on the night. After lying to her drunken Karen (Selma Blair), she was forced to tell her more lies to cover her tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed this story at least once before ... on film or on TV. The film is formatted and highly predictable, as you finish a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least Cast provides some interest and keeps it to watch. Lee is just leadership, and Styles is a very interesting role in a light-hearted comedic role that he usually distinguishes from a very important role. Bakey is a free spirit who seems to change work because other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, it's not written properly. At least one question was not answered: What exactly, Ray (Lochlin Munro), Baker's brutal ex-boyfriend, is being investigated by the IA? <br /> <br /> And I do not like the character of Buck (David Cochlear), Paul's father-grandfather; He got so rapidly in my nerves that he got very fast in his nerves. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: Comedy / actor Larry Miller's unwanted, unwanted camio, again mess (in this case, it is a little supportive - his character is a super-conservative minister). <br /> <br /> Not all good, but as usual for me, I try to throw it ten to three alone.
