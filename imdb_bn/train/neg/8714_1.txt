I just could not laugh !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But do not remember, it is very entertaining! You do not have to pay attention to this picture! The same acting - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - Roberts (Oh, I could see T-Rex head holding stick for a moment). Ratters are similar to Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is the same, but ... some scenes show kinda stuff in its head and it's kindergarten Looks like some of the project failures. Action fast, sometimes very fast, I talk about quick editing, they make it so fast, so that we do not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! Late, they are rubber! Well, here's just interesting things to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent ... Watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
