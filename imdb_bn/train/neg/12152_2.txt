Despite the government controlling the media, some news reporter and their military escorts tried to tell the truth about zuma epidemic. The producers of the film do not realize that Jimmy Romero zombie films only work because he kept his politics in the background in most of his films (in line with "Land Dead"). This satire is more apropos for this scenario as nearly as fine as a brick or head bullet in front of the eyes. What is a military man destroying and destroying masturbating about what is subversive or fine? Saying something about the least commercial advertising with the movie? No In addition to acting uniformly horrible, the characters are thoroughly unlikely, and the plot is inane. Add all this and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie movie, behind the scary head of "CHD2." <br /> <br /> My grade: D
