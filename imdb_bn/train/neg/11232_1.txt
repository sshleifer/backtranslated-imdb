It is very sad. Although this image was shot, I think it's a bit worse than Flicks like Blood Lake, there is nothing. The song they played is the funest thing I've heard. I love brothers and sisters in this movie. They do not try to hear both strikes sound very difficult when they "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, with the murderer wearing his mask only at the beginning? Thats! I virtually disregard this second half. My favorite part of this movie is using the word effect when using the killer cell. The exact same word for each chop!
