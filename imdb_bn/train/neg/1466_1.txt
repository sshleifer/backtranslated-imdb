<br /> <br /> In the normal course, I was looking forward to a new TV / film on my favorite content - making a nice change to the documentary * Kruzk or Stalingrad on the history channel. <<br /> <br /> I started looking at Pearl Harbor and enemies in the Gates - but with the perception of the brutal, fool-ability power of Hollywood, I got cruelly down to the earth - and the ability to spend his entire fate. <br /> <br / > <br /> I was excited about 'The Rise of Evil' again, especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, I enjoyed his book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is quite dry. We need more events. " <br /> <br /> event? Are they full nuts? Hitler's life can not be said to be out of the 'event' - Yes, the volume of the two Kirosha volumes was long and detailed in Hitler, but they were also supposed to. <br /> <br /> Thesis seems to be behind the 'Rise of Evil': <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad person - he was a very bad man, who disappointed the Jews, and if you missed it But we are going to strengthen this issue in every scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try and explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler accepted his views and strategies. It is impossible to say - In contrast to the typical 'Nazi - history warnings' - the film acknowledged that all the growing leaders of the Munich Communist were Jews and their views on this could be described. - And his spontaneous linking to the Jews with Bolshevism - Most of the understanding of the Nazi era is a very important aspect. <br /> <br /> But there was nothing to understand - the filmmakers were not going there, so we got all the things we knew in any way. We certainly did not find the impressive event that Cursor showed, which Hitler was temporarily considered to be socialist / communist after WW1. It will certainly be very complicated to handle the film and it may also reduce it from the unknown 'very bad' mantra. <br /> <br /> We know he is a bad man However, we also know that he was a touching figure both in a speaker and in more personal circumstances. He may be humble and even sympathetic, and of course some opinions such as vegetarianism, alcohol and anti-smoking which many agree with the Guardian readers. He was also a favorite of the famous creatures, so why was the dog-blurred discovery that was completely fool-proof. <br /> <br /> All the accounts he saw were WW1's brave soldier. Although we saw him on his iron cross, we never won it (brave things were not in the script, do not need to say). Sasson, Owen, Brooke, Remark, and many others have found this so annoying experience, we do not even understand why he was expelled because of his experience of war. And again, the point to raise above the Jewish / Bolshevik link, it is important for anyone to understand about the subject. Why did he love so much war? Why does he think that it was always a good idea, despite the contrary in the sweeping evidence? Why does he care about his colleagues? Or maybe he did - but still made the wrong decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> Days, the movie 'create history related to current' and fit content with innovation or unknown information 'current' One of the best examples - which is to always fill the lowest universal majority, where you do not believe your audience is an inch, so you push them deeper, intelligent (sadly correct) that you always take it There are many in the world will ure stupid. <br /> <br /> History has made us relevant in the past and it shows us the current color for better and worse. This rubbish was again a great opportunity. They spent millions of dollars, and the position and the big scenes were impressive, but we did not say anything that we did not know before and preached any understanding of this dark period of human history. <br /> <br />
