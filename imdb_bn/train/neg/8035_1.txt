It's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and I'm T.V. If not made for, then no horror movie will be rented. Seeing the box says that it's been rated R and R for some languages ​​... where was Gore? Did you actually see gore them a good death scene? I could have overlooked if some have short nudity or some good dialogue This lunatic movie was not even a remotely malicious or funny line. Sometimes horror movies are terrible because they are very stupid, but this was just sad.
