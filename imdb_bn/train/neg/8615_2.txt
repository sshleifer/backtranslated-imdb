It was rough time for me to see this movie that was so bad, old and stupid. I saw this Rodney man from the Natural Motherland killers and I thought he was funny like hell, but this movie was shit. The "joke" was not funny, the actors were not funny, anything about it was not even remote fun. Do not waste your time for this! The positive thing about this was the beautiful wife :) And Molly Shannon, I'm sure she tried her best, but the script was very awful. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
