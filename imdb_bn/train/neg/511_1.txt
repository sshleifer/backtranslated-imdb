I had several additions to this big bomb. I was working at the safe place for the AIR Race Race scene. Since it knew as before. Say goodbye to my scene within the first few minutes of the film and I will not have to sit in my whole thing. It was a big party than a movie set but hey, the salary was good. It was not a strong point for details, but who knows. The funny thing was that the cars were actually watching at the slow speed and then the motion of the film was near normal speed. Many scenes have changed as they were illustrated, I think spend and time shave. But everyone had a good time to care for!
