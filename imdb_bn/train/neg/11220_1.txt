It is frustrating for a movie with many promises, thinly portrayed and incredible in acting and terrible. This plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and I have seen it for a while in a movie. The final scene would be reflected in my heart, if the whole film was not so painful at the beginning. I was silent! From the first scene - one wondered if the sister tried to reach his young man for help, or only feared him of death, which was better for the audience and saved us from two hours of bad work. I've seen the date. It was a horror in the true sense of words.
