The only reason I saw "Shackdown" was that it was Erica Elinich. He is always as sexy, but he plays the leading man Wolff Larson's second feather. This is a sadness because he has more performance without permission to show it here. The film is largely in endless shootouts that quickly get bored - especially when you see most of the armed bad guys with machine guns, Larson is lost and only armed with a revolver (those who do not go out of the bullet) carry them all. Rather easily. Earthquake effects are also suitable, but many of the motion of the bloom and the poor CGI explosion. As a psychological "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious Mumba-Jambo, he has to vibrate is simply annoying. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has no) completists this one would give a look, for others it is rarely a rental price. (* 1/2)
