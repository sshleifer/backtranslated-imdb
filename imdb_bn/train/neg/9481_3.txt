James Bishop (Matt Stacy) Go to a 'mental illness facility' to appoint a medical stay with MacCourt (Bruce Penn). There, he realized that many drugs are being killed by 'The Ripper', who take their souls to Satan in a religion propagated by Dr. McClos. This story is so stupid and incomplete that it is impossible to write summaries. The dialogues are very ridiculous, especially when Helen's character, James Bishop's blonde drunk, came to the shelter, it's an incredible thing to have the courage to include a writer in a script. And James returned to the hospital to get the dead patients for treatment? And cast, ham actor and actress made? Actually, I do not know what is the worst in this movie: Screenplay, Director or Cast. The correct answer is obviously all of them. I just saw this glimpse on television, and I am surprised that a producer can spend money in such garbage. This awful movie plot becomes very funny considering the abseless. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Demonio' ​​('Devil')
