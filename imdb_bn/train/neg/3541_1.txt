A movie about how money and revenge can corrupt your soul here ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, known for his re-use of the Gangster genre, he bites more than chewing on this person. <br /> <br /> The silent use of modern films to liberate the theme of a man is his use of silence. Swallow his pride, love his enemy and pay all his money flat on his face. When Jason Statham's character is not afraid of Ray Lit, then apparently pushing Leota Paagal to the final scene. Why? Basically, you can not set up a mafiasity like the Leota character, who probably got his station in life by showing ruthless behavior throughout the film, only when he has driven more suicide than sorrow. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I I'm okay it Do not dislike the pursuit of wealth and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Your enemy will be good and this suicide will confuse him. It seems to be the main theme of the movie and it is not a bad idea for a story, though it is basically the original. The problem is that Richie does not easily acquire skills as a movie maker. At this moment, when Guy Ritchi realized, he got bored with the story and started pouring red deer: When Statham was knocked by the scene - why? Shooting in some scenes like Marvel Comic Animation ... again, why? <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie there are so many loose threads and inappropriate questions left that you can get it in 2001- and try to find them, or simply have no answer, and each audience will explain things in their own way. Yourself? I was so indifferent that the poppy tone of this photo that I just did not take care of. Actually, I did not come to the end soon enough, so that I do not have to sit down from this very psychologically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two hours of my life.
