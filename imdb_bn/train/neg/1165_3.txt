I'll keep this short, because I know I do not have to say a lot. <br /> <br /> "Alivai" is a weird little film that probably appeals to some, but I find it surprising that almost too much start. The film was too short to make a character preferable and sometimes the story became so slowly that I lost interest. As I said, I know others have enjoyed it, but I have found something other than Kittamura's "living" - conceived as a furry, very annoying drama, as an enthusiastic action science-fichic hidden. I think I was impressive to see this picture, based on its interesting initial and uber-exciting cover art. <br /> <br /> my advice? Pass for this more enjoyable new effort for Kitamura "Versace" or its 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... and do not make me wrong, I always think of the good film people, but this was certainly not the case. There was a moment at this moment that I was concerned about the incident of singles, dialogue-heavy films. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk boring.
