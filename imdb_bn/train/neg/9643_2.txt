The average movie with poor music considering a movie based on the song ??? Direction with full of incorrect scripts and blunders. Salman Khan played his natural role. As Ajay's performance of deterioration with his appearance, his style of Rock Star in particular was unfortunate. Seated was just a sloppy. Overall, I felt like spoiling my money in movies. Aamir Khan compared to Salman Khan 10 years ago! There were many songs in the movie "Man Ko It" except all boring. The most important song to influence the UK Music Sponsors was the most obscure. "Khandabash" is easily understood by English music sponsors. The other film that I saw last week is "Wake up Sid" which is a simple slow-love story with good instruction and acting despite normal music
