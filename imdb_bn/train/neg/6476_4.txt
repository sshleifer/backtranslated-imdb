I had such high hopes for this movie because I love the original. It seems, though Disney is trying to perfect the art of direct CD-DVD movies. They deserve a razzie. Many, in fact, actually. I thought the idea was worthwhile, but the music was absolutely terrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the great musician designed in their movies. Mary Poppies, Alladin, Beauty and Seed, Lion King ... even Hercules and Hotbacks of Notre Dame. They have produced such a great movie for so many years that it is really sad that they are looking at creating sequels which are not good enough to keep in the theater. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not an indication of things coming for Walt Disney Corporation.
