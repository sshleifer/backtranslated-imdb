<br /> <br /> The attacker's killer, Tomatoes, is a "parody" of bad giant movies that ends up being worse than the movie. Tomato (very small) story that revolves against those who are against them. Basically, they are spin and roar (yes, they roar) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered in the ketchup. There are no names of actors who do not make such films, so there is no reason to name them. There is a person who has been hired by the government to try and stop the dangers of tomatoes. She is a black guy who is accompanied by a guy who disguises the master and a girl and dives. However, the first person's spy is another woman who works for the government. If this is not you much knowledge, you understand This movie was not very good at first place, but even fun was not fun to smile at the scene. The movie is horribly impressive, although the whole point is, what really hurts a truly reasonable (reasonable) movie. At one stage, a giant wax tomato "Slide" a vague plaque of wood with wheels on it! Maybe I would recommend the movie if it gets the enjoyable camp value, but it is also lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10
