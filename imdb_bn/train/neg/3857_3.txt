I hope this movie is going to be humble like other types of style. However, it was a hair and I could not find myself a lot of laughter. Check it out on HBO, maybe, or if you get free rent for your destruction and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it can be fun, perhaps, if the script is even better. Jason Lee may be laughing, and he gets a few smiles here and there, but the movie is flat. Do not just go see this one. Instruction is unthinkable, but for this, guidance is not important. I guess its main flaw is not it very funny. Look at something else, do not waste your time here.
