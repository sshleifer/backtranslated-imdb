Director Sidney J. A post-modern, odd artist created by Fury Hole Point, which challenges the audience and the audience. <br /> <br /> Sydney J. Furry dares to ask about the tiredness of the 'plots' and 'characterization' of what would be the traditional traditions of the traditional enemies when they move the craters of 'motivation' and 'cause'. <br /> <br /> As a result, I think that my opinion about him probably can not be higher. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anything in this movie gives no idea, unlike law enforcement agents, and organized criminals are insane.
