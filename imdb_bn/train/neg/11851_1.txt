It was a disappointment - there was no real decency. Brights seem to be able to make a truly uncertain film with only the top leading American version of the American version. The main series combined both performance stories and performance subtlety with great attention to lighting and lighting settings. I saw the series many times and am still amhralled. <br /> <br /> Another bad orientation along with just the "cracker" horrible adaptation line. Stumble with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such happiness as the dead, spooks, silent witness and judge John the Dead. Check out the original Touch Evil, then look for "Wire in Blood" about Robertson Green's truly unique, elegant performance. Hollywood needs to have a look at this actor!
