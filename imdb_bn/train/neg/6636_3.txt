The worst I've ever seen, at least some of the performance of natural acting. Which is probably not surprising given a note letter given clunky, lame dialogue. Add that cheap production value and you do not see it that you've got a movie even belong to television. One does not expect much from a lifetime movie, especially this is an old one, but it is almost unreasonably bad. <br /> <br /> Plot-intelligent, it is a kind of horrible, claude romance, even even Harlequin will consider them. It is possible to estimate how the remnant of the film will work by watching the remaining parts of the film apparently. Surprisingly, the only female character that gets the focus and the fall to mysterious newborn is to the end.
