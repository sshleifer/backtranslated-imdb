I saw this movie on the other night and I must tell the truth that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting is fair, but the plot is completely ridiculous. A murderer was born "all the power used to make films" and if the film is burned, will the killer be killed? How unbelievable that? Characters have been adopted for saying least ... For example, suddenly the person mentions "Are you not trying to complete the film because your mother can not?" So are we supposed to go with this? Until half of the film we were not his daughter. The film did not really spelllight, we did not know anything about the main character of the ringwald who survived except the Hui Chin Actress, people were dead and Rafi wanted to be a director like his mother. . Those diving really did not know they The murdered things were caught for killing. The whole plot was completely too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of punk, will definitely learn one or two things about making the film. I would not believe anyone in this movie star or even agree to work. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was Clive through the whole film. I have been predicting what will happen before each scene, which believes that you were not hard at all. It's a disgrace and I'm deeply sorry I wasteted watching an hour and dirty. 1/10
