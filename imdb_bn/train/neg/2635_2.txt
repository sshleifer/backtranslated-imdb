I was ready to do a lot of things from the late-spring / summer action fluff movies, but generally due to this, their most reasonable payments (ie cool special effects, attractive plot twists, comic values, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie does not have any of this. What we've got is the exciting thrill of Eva Longiory Clavez for several minutes (a maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is a shameful lack of plots, suspensions, back stories, character development, continuity, etc. I can get the clarity, but obviously I have already forgotten the movie voluntarily. <br /> <br /> I was in the theater all the time, I was kicking myself for not monitoring the 24 seasons in DVD. This one, save your money. If you really really liked the quavage of Eve Eve Longoria.
