This film was very difficult to watch and I was fairly neutral and motivated because I was a big fan of the original movie of 1944. That, me and many more, is one of the best film noirs ever made. This is just a small film created to make sense, and most of it trashed it, I did not expect much, but you can not compare it to '44 film. After watching the scene, I compared myself to what I saw and Fred McMurre, Barbara Stanwick, Edward G. I remembered how it played with Robinson and others. Now I am the famous actor Richard Krena, Samantha Igar and Lee J. They are playing their famous role by replacing Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I found out that it was as bad, but it was no match for the original 1944. The two main fields created for this movie were not good (1) There was a lack of electricity in two leads and (2) there was only 90 minutes, the story ran for a short time with the story for development, which leads to letters and chemistry. Crane and Igar were flat, and there was no similarity to "Walter Knife" and "Phyllis Detroiten" respectively for McMur and Stenwie. <br /> <br /> This rebuilding was in other letters where "Burton Kiss" and "Edward Norton". Robert Weber, as head of the company and insurance company Norton, was terrible. The time frame was somewhat interesting by changing, so the house, car, telephone, indicator, etc. were in the middle of 40 rather than at the beginning of the 70's. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just ran. However, one was enough to watch and I would gladly return to the original version of this classic story and the rest of the film scene.
