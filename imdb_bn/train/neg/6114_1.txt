Since she works through this whole movie, she is nude for some good reason. When Tarzan bites with a snake, he suddenly removes his clothes. Since the boa compressor is poisonous? How Tarzan becomes poisonous? This whole movie has been damaged. They could not own the species of animals for this movie. Which ankangutung hanging around the chimpanzee? He had set off a better film set. Why is the cousins ​​of the cannabal group? Why and Boe and his father began to paint pictures, if they were going to eat later? Perhaps there was only one hair excuse to show his breasts and bends. During his father's hunt, he slowly and bullly works idiotic around the elephant. Any real African bull bull that came from the circus threw the body's butt. If a smart hunter saw it, he could start shooting in minutes. And I would not be surprised if the camera is in LSD, because it does not show slow-moving scenes, for no good reason. This is not a good idea. Boaz collectors in water in Tarzan water, one of them is a local Spencer gift you can buy 12 feet rubber snake. Tarzan is stupid in this strange spell, probably shining much of herself. I'm sorry, but it's a classic black-and-white version of Tarzan film, it's a similar but good story. Plotting not mentioned. There is a scene in it that I have seen that everyone forgot to mention. * (Spirir Alert) * The scene where he is trying to rescue Jane and his father, he is standing very close to the running spots of a running water. It looks like urinating someone on the bottom. Oh! Also, he and Jane have fooled the beach, the deformed monkeys are jumping and clippings. Surely his father is dead. * (The end of the speakers) * The surgeon general should have the warning for this movie. Seeing this movie very nude, make you blind.
