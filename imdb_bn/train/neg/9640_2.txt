I was always curious about this movie because it was hard to find, so when I put it on eBay, I bought for $ 10 over fork, now I understand why it is so rare! The movie is so bad, the worst of those horribly written and frustrating low-budget budgets, which shows all the scenes of destroying their lines, they literally highlights the movie. This film is a spiritual (petiole, cast for a clear reason, its worst scene), who uses his power with an experimental machine to draw objects from another level in this power. When he pulls in a box, the army unknowingly puts a truck behind the open and guards a soldier and you know what? Surprise! A foam-rubber giant costume popped out of a child, immediately killed the soldier with a scratch across his face, then fled to a nearby city. But instead of hiring half of the Armed Forces to find it and protect the public, leave it for petjojan and judgment for their own sake, but it does not matter, this movie has maintained its faithfulness before it. This is only because of my unintentional laughter, I got the 1st vote, someone could warn the producer of "Science Science Theater 3000" but they do not know about it already! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
