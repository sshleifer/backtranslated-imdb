It was really a bad film. The character played by Michael Moriarty "Cole" was one of the biggest reasons for this flopped, the actors think that conjuring up incredibly weird South Drill will make this character worse, it does not. About 20 minutes later I wanted to see a speech therapist, it added some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) Played badly - 2) Unreasonable characters - 3) Razor thin plot line <br /> <br /> Yak! <br /> <br />
