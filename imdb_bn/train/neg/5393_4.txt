I'm a fan of Shakespeare, and I can understand who Branhaig has brought the audience back to Shakespeare for a new generation. However, this movie is short of conveying the overall purpose of playing with the ridiculous musical order. Add it to Stalबिलींग on Alicia Silverstone's conversations (some of the Kuan Reeves's Kanunu Reeves memorable) and other poorly customized roles, it's all about an exciting patience to watch.
