It could be a movie where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie. I first saw the trials in 1991, it looks fantastic. Then I always wanted to see it but I can not find it ... ..Today, yes, 14 years later <br /> <br /> <br /> Tell me, I was frustrated with her, right I knew it would not be an Oscar winner but still hoped that it would be fun to have a brains film on bloodsport. Unfortunately it was not, it is pure <br /> <br /> All the American rock and roll music was so bad that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> War scenes were junk and appearance was fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD has cost me Â£ 5 and I believe I was charged more than 7 pounds. <br /> Now I'm sorry, I know I can never get it and half back.
