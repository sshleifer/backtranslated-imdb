If you've seen Mel Gibson in the Million Dollar Hotel, then you may find it too bad to see Bart Reynolds in another movie that it can never be delivered. I can only verify the DVD version so that the VHS version is even better, but the movie night and the dark scenery are so badly done that everything seems red. I was first messed up my DVD player. It was not. If you insist on viewing it, I suggest you adjust the color on your TV until black and white. If you do not you will not be able to get through the film. If you do this, it will only remind a poor movie student who tries to revitalize the classic fiction style.
