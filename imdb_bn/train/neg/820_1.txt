Producer / Director Stanley Kramer See the very annoying screenplay of Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy? Is there a few pieces left to aim? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Wymark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mikey Rooney? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parallax View or Manchurian candidates miss the mark by the same rank and very wide margin. A major misfire by Stanley Crumar.
