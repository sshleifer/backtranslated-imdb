The absence of an intriguing summary of IMDB's first point of "always for Mozart's" attention. It is easy to explain which stories, plaplays, plots or whatever may seem to be the lowest structure of the movie. Jean-Luk Gardy is one of the most captivating and inspired directors of the film industry, and this timeless shit is among his most harmatic movies. I do not believe that nobody understands this story; But intellectuals are intelligent enough to justify this dirty film or interpretation and it is interesting to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Paras Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
