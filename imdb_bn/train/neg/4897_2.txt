This movie comes to me as the final disappointment of Sis Ming-liang. It oozes laziness from its each frame. So I'm not going to analyze it thoroughly. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If there is a drought famine, then why will we see the City Landscape with the flashing green plants? I wonder if something is understood in the context of the film's metaphor (in which the thirsty intimacy is thirsty, and watermelon is a poor alternative, sex). Or is it not just about creating fierce movies, it's not annoying to be synchronized. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what a porn actress is, why she is unconscious or perhaps dead. Unless the message of supreme separatism is successfully delivered (= bomb blast), it does not seem to be a serious question, but its neutral body in retreat is proved in a context, a cheap dramatic mockery ?? It is exploitative as free and engaged activity. <br /> <br /> 3 40 years ago did Antonioi have published well that this movie is not published ?? And innocent without humiliating his actor. <br /> <br /> 4. Musical numbers (recycled from 'holes') seemed like a secondary-schooling artistic reflection, that executed execution on the basis of very high-level skills. That was the point, the point sucked.
