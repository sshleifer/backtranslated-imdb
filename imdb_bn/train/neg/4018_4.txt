This film is very skeleton. This is a fairly low budget movie (I hope!) Which makes some excuses, but it is very painful due to the lack of a decent cast and shallow plot. Phillips plays herself herself as an isolated son in isolated families in her family, who is seeking herself (though her family ... er ... well, a little more white ...), but the rest is grasping at throwing straws. Potentially every moment is destroyed by excessive melodrama and * ways * many sub-plots (which is a clear sign of platitude, they need fillers ...) I do not recommend this film to anyone, a hard core phillips fan, or Those are absolutely * nothing *. 4/10.
