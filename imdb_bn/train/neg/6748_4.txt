Seeing me, I saw the video I saw and after Blid, I have seen the greatest horror of all time, though I think it was fairly good. Bleed is quite bad. The best part is to see the female cast nude. The cow is looking very fake and works over. It's its fun part but its extremely predictable and I do not want to stay watching the horrible end. If I could, I would ban this actor and actress, the only reason that Debbie Rocon (Maddy) is in more than one video and I also saw two cast castes in the same or bad motion picture. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
