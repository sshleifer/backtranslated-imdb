FISHBORN'S PERFORMANCE (Anyway looks strangely funny) and (short featured) Ed Harris is extraordinary, unlike Connery who does not understand his role and 80yr old people have finished motorcycle behavior. Actually the playplay does not make sense; A 60 minutes of imagination. Happy end-plots plus spin-off without any reasonable framework for the letter of appendix. This may be better for examining more than a script and screen-rights school. The more you get this impression reminds the powerful story. The death penalty is not an issue here, though it is a matter from the beginning; It sort of fades away without further comment. The issues and the environment may have been better.
