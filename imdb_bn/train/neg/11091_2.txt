Denzel is the only thing that is right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Once maybe it was a good movie at the initial stage. Some decided to spend some time and plot points at the beginning of the film, gave up most of the story in about 5 minutes. Anything that is built in motion and rhythm may ruining the film before. <br /> <br /> So first it confused you and then it keeps you off. The drama crosses the suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is a feeling of great feeling and anger that this kind of movie could bring to viewers. Please, if you search for it, then it is like this ... Damage yourself.
