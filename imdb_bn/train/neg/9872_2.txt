It is difficult to believe that this book can be successful in overcoming its horror! The plot is so entrenched and incredible. . . In order to give up his pain, he started a small child conviction of one ton! Then we are involved in the crime of at least six and more people (including clergy). Later we have a wife, who is directly kicking on the trace very happy shortly after the length of the waterways. A very unpleasant and playful mother, supported, enthusiastic and friendly support for the friendly political party! Removing the setting from an island on the coast of South Carolina does not help the story, though it helps in filmmakers' budgets. Very beautiful buildings do not feel well enough for a small island that serves golf shelters and small vessels. I really like Kim Basinghe's film is painfully thin and his hair is certainly in another decade. There is also no chemistry between male males. I thoroughly dislike what was written with this book but read it all. The movie I was surfing earlier and later, whenever the music of that concert got so much, it was just going away. If you do not like the incredible story, wooden mixing, a mixed mix of religious / mythological / metaphor, my advice is to avoid this one. Oh and probably a small carping criticism, but a caring father would not be a life jacket for a small baby in a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery
