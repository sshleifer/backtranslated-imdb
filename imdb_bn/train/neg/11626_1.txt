This may be the worst show I've ever seen. In addition to being selfish about Hitler, it's not fun or entertaining. It is relatively in its underground humor and protected circumstances in the 1950's Seatikom, but it can be done well as I love Lucie, it is not funny here. I think this show was based on innovation, "look, it's like an explosive sitcom image of Hitler" but it flattens in every field. The man who plays Hitler, is so hammy that he can sit alone alone. I would probably have wondered how this network could create it, it was a good idea. I had some tasteless shows in America, but Brights had to beat us at this time. America has never been able to make a sitcoma against Hitler, although it was a demonstration of Lincoln's slave, Desmond Pfiffer's secret diary. The chances are that you will not see this show, because it is only an episode broadcast and probably will not be released on DVD.
