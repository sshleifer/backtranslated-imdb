Without dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise was difficult to get through in strangers. It's got a common mess that you can expect in a zombie movie, but it does not need any environments for it. <br /> <br /> This is an amateur German video and version which is weird Saw the English dabbed! Doublers seem to be American fans (German penpals?!) Who can determine whether they want to play it directly or turn it into a comedy. One character (of course a white German) is apparently dubbed by a black guy, who talks with thick ebonics! 'Noah Waham Cheyen', comrade?
