Literally, the fiction of this science is that every aspect of low budget flick is classified for its predecessors, contemporaries and followers. Bad special effects, a weak story, bloody amount and bloody amount, annoying and dull characters, which you can expect. The "Attack of the Siberarth" is a new vacation resort where the owners are genetically engineered for an attraction of the Smiledon cats. The cats escape and start killing people, the man who conducts the event wants to preserve them and does not want to warn the unexpected audience about them, and plans to bands of the cats and band some workers. <br /> <br /> Special influential, the film is about an average achievement given its budget. Subretotes are portrayed through poor CGI. Surprisingly, cats feel more realistic, until the CGIIT is hidden, the more remote, the more remote shots Their attack is unintentionally bloody and distasteful. Just as you expect, they attack, tear off some arms and legs, and move far behind. This part of the film is why poor sculptes are portrayed. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are very awesome. We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunting. And take it very seriously too. Even violating personal property, clashing with security measures, and stolen. Why are they so easy to take a simple game? Did I leave something? Was the money involved? Or did they send it? I do not know, I could just follow the film. But they seem to be doing it to make fun of it. Even, they went too far for normal. <br /> <br /> "The attack of Subertoth" is a very poor movie. Even for a low-budget science-flickr, it's a very poor and cheap example. This will be the tears of most visitors, it may be attractive for some people, and you will shine and mock at all the ways. And remember, it's not a comedy, it's a cheap horror flick, so it does not seem ridiculous.
