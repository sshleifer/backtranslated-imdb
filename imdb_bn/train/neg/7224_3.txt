The film is very slowly grayed out. The film gets very little explanation as it progresses, which results in many strange sequences of deep meaning, but by the way of the story they simply do not understand how to become weird. It's the power of sorting for you to watch movies again but in any way I'm going to do that. I saw this movie in the morning, I am sure that in the evening I saw this movie, I used to fall asleep. To me, the film was like a poor "blade runner". <br /> <br /> This image has left many questions and vandalism. This leaves the movie a pointless and temporary impression. <br /> <br /> The strange look of the movie also does not help much. The movie has been captured by CGI / Helve Real Life, but it has not been well-liked, impressive, spectacular and entertaining, for example, in case of next movie like "Sina City" and "300" will be the case. They have even made the mood of computer film characters, which looks like a very stupid and weird choice, considering that the character animation is not very impressive. Of course the future environment still looks good and the film is probably not cheap, its style on the substance and in this case it really is not a positive thing. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also absolutely awesome and uncertain. The main deity of the movie says continuing line; 'I'm going to do this, but why do not you want to worry about me' Just saying something to Mr. Horus! If you do not want to explain anything about the plot, it's annoying and a really easy thing to keep in film. The film's deepest questions and money also fall into the loss of the movie and its script. <br /> <br /> Actors still do their best work. They thought that they believed in the project and they made sure that what they were making would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie are far from the original. It is mostly rip-off from classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />
