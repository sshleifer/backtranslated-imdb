This film is still the most deadly Mormon film produced. It looks like a movie like Ram and Sons Provo! It was supposed to be fun since it's called me. Filmfare Best of Abahard Best Actor - if he was not in the film, perhaps it would not have been made! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. It was beat 8. It was Thural Big Te Bailey, whose character was not created in any sense. It was made in Prove 6. It was not fun at the brokerbach. It was Larry H Miller 4. It was not the first movie Clint Howard was fun. Gary Coleman has returned 4 of the best films. 2. They acted in exaggerated life auditions. It was made by hormone entertainment !!
