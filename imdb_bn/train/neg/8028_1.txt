Please! Do not waste any money in this movie. It's really nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I could not finish watching it, and generally I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How could they find a distributor for the Earth? !!! Interesting however: see Wikipedia for "dark areas". The person who wrote the entry must be out of his mind. Maybe he got the money load from the producer. The money that should be spent on the actor, camera and editing Even this picture does not have any idea behind it, since it also will not help. Unfortunately the "dark area" has already gained much attention. Please, stop making movies like director, producer and the author of this movie ... you are not doing any harm to yourself. The world will be a good place without this picture.
