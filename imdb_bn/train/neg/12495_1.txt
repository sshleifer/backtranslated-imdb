All right, I love the worst horror. I love doing bad awful enough to be particularly fun. Demonicus, or the house of the dead - they were bad enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> "This sucks" style and has both comments in the state of actual criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot (sort) - There is a guy in this town (which is probably Seattle, see comments below) and is cutting around head. He's been doing this for more than a year (I'm not going back to get the exact number - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. One week one head. And the police are just calling the "experts" (who once thought to be emotional), but never again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! What to take after Feds, three combined homicides? After almost a breakthrough, we violate martial law !!!!! However, this "expert" welcomes Puddu's dog, who ignores the full time police, and two of them can be concluded that it is Baron Sambadi, who is likely to take the body around the world (and perhaps worldwide - or perhaps Go to Disneyland) Cutting heads to get enough energy. <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Setting - where is this? Well, if you are not from Seattle, then you might not realize that Bar / Reve (ten employees of film workers and their family members) has a poster for the local radio station and it is highly-entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" SQL dialogue (Eg IF) among two police (yes, those who head their head in about 15 minutes), they will take the "new stadium" Locana which could still be a problem with this film was made. <br /> <br /> From Seattle, I apologize for the film and hanging my head <br /> <br /> All right, here it gets really critical - a horror movie is authors (not published, my name in IMDB Not looking), I did research. A lot of research And in contrast to the authors of this film, I know that Baron Sommy - when a wrist loy (soul) is involved in the preservation of graveyard and traditionally "devil" by various Christian oppressors - actually a "Loki" god. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, he does not cut his head. In addition, a major part of the physical nature of Bhound religion is that the body of the baron community can be whenever he wants. Their religious programs hold many members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Baron gets a body of a semblance, he is head Do not go near the cut, he will get some good room and cigar and par-tay !!! <br /> <br /> Essentially, they only drink (surprisingly) read correctly unreasonable torch cards (it can be used to show that the Voodoo chick "Wonderful") does not explain the interpretation of cards like most movies. Again, I did research. (Anyone who remembers old late night advertisements for sending readings - "Lovers - you will soon get mad in love ..." and those fools?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. If you feel you need to watch the movie because of me, I'll be more sorry, so please do not.
