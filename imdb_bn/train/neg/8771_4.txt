OK, I was annoyed and decided to watch this movie. But I think the main thing to bring this movie is to have an hour of footage, then it will be repeated repeatedly four times a day. These include 1. Combining the soldiers and discussing the plans of the attack, 2. Flashbacks to the men's wives 3. The direction of the army in the long lines 4. Men's mountains and shooting are in progress, usually the first head shoots. Then 3 other men rescued him. 5. To defeat the enemy and talk about success 6. The men thronged to the wives and singing for 10 minutes. It was the original movie, and the same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. And flashbacks to women every time, then she will show her wife and his wife. There were about 10 men or more flashbacks so that it took tons of time. More than that, humans can not kill their enemies without bayonet or grenade. I loved music and had a lot of actions, though the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably did not see it again, but it was not very awesome.
