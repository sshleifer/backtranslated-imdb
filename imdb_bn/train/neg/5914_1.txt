This movie is really annoying. It was forbidden Chinese movies and I can see why. It is not because it is a critical cause of communist rule but the film is such a low quality factor. I do not want to pay for this visit. I like movies from Chen Kyz and Zhang Imu, and I'm disappointed that such a poor film can come out of China. It seems to completely ignore the viewers and make the movie for the director himself. The shots of a person who have nothing to do for a minute are ridiculous and they have lots of them. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I saw this image on the net and it seems like people like this movie. The only explanation for me is that some film buff thinks that if a movie is not in English then it is automatically good. I do not see any reason for this. This is not an art film of celluloid waste. (Actually they actually shot the movie in it, which they did not)
