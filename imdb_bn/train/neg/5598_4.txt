It has been seen in the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my good decision, I like it, but I think that the acting was a little ... weak (in most cases I've seen it from the little boy's family). I mean, this script does not start from the beginning, but the actor does not trust me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nonshelm, I like it. Character is preferred, and the plot is not challenging or disastrous. It's sweet, the characters care each other, and I'm not judged to spend it fifty minutes sick. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
