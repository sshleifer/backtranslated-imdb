What a horrible, horror film? I've seen long time cliches the worst collection. I did not see much After 40 minutes of harsh drinks search to calm my nerves, I cried out to the theater. Merrill Strip was awful as usual. How many people can have 1 person in the name of injury and abuse? Eden Quinn's talent was - often - completely wasted. Who said Gloria Estafan? Trying to correct this movie poli is still used in ethnic tactics. (Brave inexperienced singing lonely teachers teach underprivileged kids violin in poor neighborhood schools). The kids were not even cute! Just writing it in scary script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. This is a real horror!
