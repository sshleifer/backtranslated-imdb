Of course I noticed in this movie the first, there was unnecessary amount of nudity. It is not oozing nudity or something, but did not need much. Anic Boral plays a boring woman who believed in his family as a ghost story, that his ancestor, who was similar to him, was a Veruveal and believed that his fate was the same. Which is actually I found quite attractive. The original Wolf Man was considered as a complete psychological movie, but Universal threw the real Wolf man, which you did not want to look for for extra money or for two. I really find this idea of ​​someone interesting to look attractive in a verb. Unfortunately I was not looking for this picture. Instead, we know that we do not have variations since the beginning, so there is no romance or turn in it, they are also trying to think of the film as if it really happened. Scenario They also fail to mention this fact in one or two parts of the film. At first I was excited to read the details of the film. But I slowly realized that it was a cover so that they could reveal the main character breasts as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The psychological role. Since the character Daniel does not have any brain and it only snaps a brown, crazy and sparkling snapper and wolf, it takes a little skill to play. He had to break through for a wonderful moments of his performance at the moment but was quickly destroyed by poor camera work and light. The idea is great, but ultimately executed throughout the film. 3/10
