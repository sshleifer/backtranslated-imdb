All right, I got a terrible acting pass. I have exploded some canons of Lil Kim and his hand or hand is not running, I passed my chest, I passed color contact. <br /> <br /> It killed me: four squares sitting on the table and quarreling in the scene. Lisa-Rai and Monica Calhoun stood up and then Lil Kim said, "Hua, ho, ho, hold up. Come here for hot seconds." I am a fan of Western film and I have never said such a thing in a movie in Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that this film deserves more than 1 rating, please tell me another movie, it's worse than the gang of rosages. <br /> <br /> I am through it.
