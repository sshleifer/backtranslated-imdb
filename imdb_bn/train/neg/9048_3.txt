Originally a week's ABC movie released It involved two young innocent female college students, who set up camp in a small southern city. They are not allowed to make phone calls and no one knows they are there. Rape, torture, assassination, humiliation and deterioration have led to a very annoying conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version (for its time) was deadly. No nudity and fights were pretty joke but wore down one of the overall feelings of sleaziness. The obsolete version is even worse - there is plenty of nudity, violence is extreme and one particularly hateful sequence, we forced a crying woman prisoner while a "lesbian" guard used her. Isha! There is nothing wrong with the exploitation films but it only goes on fork. You've got the feeling that filmmakers have been experiencing the oppression and frustration of these poor women - it's like your enjoyment, propagated in your mouth. Undoubtedly the downbeat does not help ending. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 3 because the role is good - but actually it makes the movie hard to see. A sick, sleazy film. Not recommended.
