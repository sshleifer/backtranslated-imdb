It is without any doubt, sometimes if not, I saw most offensive "chick flick". Characters and characters have been spread in such a way that the film applies to parodies. Before walking through the hour of the disaster and five minutes before the theater, we were relying on the following themes: Having a baby, all your problems will be solved, "acting types" sad messages and musicians can not be a good mother, they are a more popular Took their dreams for lifestyle. Cast a gifted and set some great looks and what is a waste of costume. When Natasha Richard told Tony Colette that he would not win the mainstream life, he would eventually jump - "Alone!", I felt curly. I can not believe the dramatic release of this movie made it. This is one kind of rental from the "women" cable channels that I always pass during the channel surfing. I am female and over 35, so I should be a part of the audience of this movie, but boy, "evening" misses his goal.
