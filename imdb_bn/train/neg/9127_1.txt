Okay so here's the basic plot. In 1933, Peter Sellars is a Fuf Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who had lived for a long time. This film opens with his birthday, where he drinks a special elixer (even without mentioning the film) to prolong his life. On this occasion, Iliasir is suddenly dropped by an assistant (Kato, if you remember Pink Panther films) and ordered to order 6 small items to make Elixer's smallest commands in its smallest order. It creates a worldwide human hunt, in which his genius loots the diamond museum and suffers from London, Dr. To meet Phu's nimacy, vendors also sell them to meet Scotland Yar's detective Neilland Smith, who thinks they try to stop him. To be a diverse ridiculous adventure <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Terrible tragedy that he was. This gifted comedian has played a remarkable 'funny' role in the vendors and Panther films, and there is a voice in the film 'The Party', but there is something in this film. This picture was tortured very hard and I could not even finish it. When he was fully dying and watching the vendor's performance I kept cringing. A year ago 'After being there' great work, I mean how he can create it and how to make this thing ??? For example, a person mentioned the first 10.15 minutes, but it is all dowasty ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
