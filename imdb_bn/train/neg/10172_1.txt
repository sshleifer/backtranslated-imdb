When I saw that Noah Wile and Ricky Scrder were in the same movie, then I was, score! I admit, I was interested in watching movies. And I would say, the first fifteen minutes or so was a way nostalgic. Then it all went down the hill. I hope it will not politically dump the Right Citizen Right Mango Jumbo. They took every potentially controversial subject and thrown in a stupid story. I was surprised that Noah was involved in some of this kind, especially his role. Nobody with a fully functioning brain will take any shit about the Vietnam war. If someone really wants to know how communist was, sit down and read a book on it. And it does not praise or is not against it, just cold difficult facts <br /> <br /> I just saw here a few scenes there because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was my interest. . This movie is disturbed by everything else about the movie.
