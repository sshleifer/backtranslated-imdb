<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After being set up to mix with several floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White)! Not saying, their tyrannical wife (Vivienne Ockland and Buzz Flowers) is not happy ... <br /> <br /> Leo McCain has set up a descriptive framework for the comedian William Setter's Masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) The situation of the L & H situation is very fierce predator, forced to tell a demon that lies backfires in spectacular fashion. Most of it is fun, especially in the scene where Stan is inspired by Descl√©es, who comes with a violent game of push and shovel. However, some are covered by fun, Auckland and Flowers, their role is playing perfectly straight, which adds elements of the dislike of the 'chicken husbands' scenario. We were originally released in the UK.
