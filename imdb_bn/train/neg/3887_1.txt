I saw it with the help of MST3 and hey boy, even the film was frustrating. Imagine imagining someone's camera skills can be done by a monkey. <br /> <br /> Highlights from the special effects were "OK". The most part was played for "OK"; Although not something special, it was of higher quality than other previous B-movies. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is poorly damaged, camera work often seems like they fixed the camera guy rolling on the roller scale and pushing him along. The story (if it can be said) is almost full of fun in that hole, it does not really explain why he lived in the first place, or the need for human flesh to survive. The script is badly written and compromises verges on dialogue only fools. The last episode of the movie (if there) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the version of MSST 3, then avoid all costs.
