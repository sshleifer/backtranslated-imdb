Well ... I have only 3 words - Chess, Chess and Chase! The only freedom fighter Dean Cain of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "the kingdom of fire" ... has some great possibilities, but they just do not follow .... special effects are appropriate - even though you know that the dragon CGI but it does not look terribly CGI. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Dina Kain (though she was a producer), I used to blame the director and writer Philippe Roth more. It's his job to create this image .... And unfortunately, he failed.
