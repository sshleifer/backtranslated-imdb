I think Philip read the Calypse note version of Kaufman Kund's novel and then set the film to be made. Okay, of course it will not be the original punch. Because of his manipulation of stereotypes of narrative novels, his story and the ability to leave his story out. Do not even try this film! Teraaj's dream sequence, vital for the book's atmosphere, has been revised and no idea. Also, and perhaps it's a low point, Daniel Day-Lewis has seen a lot like Ben Stiller in this matter (I know this is not actually a valid complaint, but hey). Otherwise Hollywood is a perfect example of Hollywood-izing.
