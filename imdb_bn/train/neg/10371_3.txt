Or "Marlow in the sea". Yet another movie overrated with the ridiculous bogie. Very talk, too. Bobby plays the same role in Marlow's film; Always under control of a situation, sometimes nervous - how dangerous a situation is, the woman is called "thin" and "demos" and other meaningless, in this film the man is the only "genuine man", ie the alpha male (only another alpha male) is the master of gestapo - but He is only a fat albatross male male) and naturally - every attractive young woman does not come to her and her primary He wants her sex within tea hours. There are all the clich√©s in the characters here. "Casablanca" is considered to be related to the same type of crisis-change-reform, and naturally he refuses money or other valuable things while paying - but how can it be fitted with strict punishment? It does not, so he could not be a cynic; Haq wanted it in both ways: a character who is "cool singles" and still a well-manned human. I do not think so ... For the first time, her non-scholar "cool babe" routines, and is overwhelmed with a lot of exaggeration, "not inexperienced", which is not very funny with her, is not exchanged between her and bogie; This dialogue is stupid words by today's standard. "Just purse your lips and whistle ...". A load of fork ... It was made when it was 19 years, but looks very old, and the day women are far less interesting than stars. With her sharp features, her sister-in-face is no closer to distorting the beauty of a woman in Heiligand, Mirna Loye's elegance, like the only Irin Doon. The child was more suitable to play the vampire, nor the girls deadly. (In real life she is much like her face: a Hollywood bunch.) There is a scene where Bacall tears break; Very inappropriate for its character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biography" of bogurt, baked, Houston and other Hollywood personalities, please contact me by email.
