This movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks I've seen. The length was not nearly long enough to include a good storyline. Also, the way the father died was just ridiculous. After suddenly jumping on a workshop, the mother died from the shower, and the father shot the father to the father? Some fundamentalities may be seen where they were going, but it could have been better. Also, its impressiveness is to stop me before the end. After all the hearings called Lucy and to find it 'Lucifer', I wanted to hijack. Yes, it was interesting that Lucifer had a woman, but see the name. This is a man's name. It should be given a male character. After all, the film was a bore, and could use a good plot.
