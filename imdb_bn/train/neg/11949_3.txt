This stupid comedy really does a good job to spoil the comedic genius. In particular, Dan Ackroyd and Howard Hessman are used badly here. I could have scaled this movie once or twice, but in general, it was a boring movie, thrown into a low stigma for good measurement. Although the premises were routine, it was not bad yet, but once the plot was set up, the film did not go anywhere. Do not waste your time with this misfire.
