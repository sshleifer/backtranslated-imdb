Whoever wrote the script of this movie, is not eligible to work in Hollywood (even if not there), and those actors have to find another job. The most horrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just wanted to see if it would be better, unfortunately it was not for me. <br /> <br /> I ended up giving credit to the concerns I have. I think there are not many people behind the film, so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slow. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great "How To Make a Movie" guide. Very bad I could not give 0.
