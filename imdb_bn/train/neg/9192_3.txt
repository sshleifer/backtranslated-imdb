I found this video in the 'Awful' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place. Romero '28 days later' from the 'dead' trilogy. 'But after watching this, you can quickly see how you can watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This is actually a music video that gets faster and gets more and more glory. There is no horror in the people here. Steps appear firmly in just a few half ways which soon get tired because they last ... and last ... and the end ... and soon you feel that the DVD player accidentally lagged behind for 3 minutes, but no, they are actually Made the movie. This is a pity. I think that the movie is no more than $ 7 million dollars in the industry! Although some of the effects of 360 were cold, but again, they were more used and tired because it was the same with the same string every time. <br /> <br /> What is also splicing on footage from ROYALLY boring arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. So why did they keep it here? Oh well, it's not a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one. 3/10 <br /> <br />: Many violence / thunder, and prejudice
