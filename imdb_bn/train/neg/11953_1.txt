Do you know that the movie is stuck to you? You're stuck on the best seat in the room, you are swimming three times before getting the right seat at the center of your own special sweet place - and after 13 hours you feel trapped there, uncomfortable and irritable, thinking "when F *** Film going END ever ??? " (You know the feelings - think of AI and Village). <br/> <br/> Well, the visitor question provides the strange form of that feeling. I was surprised to sit there for the first 30 minutes when the story started *** ***! It's introvert! So "Arty" it hurts. This is the first Mishik Takasi film I saw. Apparently he created the movie by dozens and, if they are all pretentious w @ nk of this kind, I doubt it will end. <br /> <br /> I'm not against the winners' w @ nk. David Lynch has been among the top 10 directors for me, but the visitor question cuts rate, cheap, and nasty inducements w @ nk. <br /> <br /> You have done so far - I hated it.
