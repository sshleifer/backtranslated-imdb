Natural Forest Killers (1994) <br /> <br /> Movie Cut: And <br /> <br /> Director: Cutting: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is a weird Oliver Stone picture, but when I He had medicines during filming, I needed no further explanation. 'Natural Bourne Killers' is a risky, crazy, complete film that we do not often get; Strange, psychological, artistic pictures. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Motherland Killers' basically the story of the popularity and glorious story of mass media of two mass murderers; A great scene where an interviewer asks some teenage boys about Mickey and Malri and the teenager says, 'Murder is wrong ... but if I was a killer I would be Mickey and Malri'. Mickey describes this description as' Frankenstein 'and' Dr. Frankenstein has described it with a situation - Dr. Frankenstein's media that turned these demon killers <br /> <br /> Check out the errors of most Oliver Stone films. America, the director loves and appreciates the country. I think the 'Natural Motherland killers' are embarrassing as mass media, technology and nation, Americans (and most of the world) on topics like genocide and malicious situations. <br /> <br /> The killers, led by Woody Harrison (Mickey) and Juliet Lewis (Mallory), are two interesting actors, who have been living the lives of two funny brutal killers, surprisingly executed. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps the cruel theory of social Darwinism (the most suitable living) - Mickey told in his prison interview that while killing other species, we destroy humans to other species and abuse the environment; This script is interesting, but how much we look at this scene is like thinking about society and man's behavior, we have seen more than 2 hours of intense bloodshed. <br /> <br /> The final hour of the film takes place in the maximum security prison; We see the harsh reality of prison life; Warden's views etc; Junk extra leak - maybe Stone is asking for the future, moving towards the way the society is running. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First of all, a journalist who has conducted a show about American values ​​and is involved in the increase in ratings, he goes any length to keep Mickey and Mallory's story. Another police officer, Skagneati, a madman, probably suspected of having love for Maleria - also earned some strange tenderness with the killers, because his mother Charles White was killed during the Weeke massacre of Texas. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic; Different colors, shadows, style make a sense of protest; Everyone's green color is green, similar to murderers' illness (at drugstore, when they are looking for Ratnacet antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, takes some determination to get it used and accept it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Although the above review was quite positive, I dislike the film. Quintin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for this movie, was not satisfied with the changed playlist and requested that he move his name. Why can i see Although occasionally gently appealing, natural hometown killers have a picture mess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
