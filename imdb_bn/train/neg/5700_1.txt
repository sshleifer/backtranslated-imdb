How this film exceeds the belief of a 6.7 rating. It is not worth anything better than 2.0 and it is obvious that the IMDB should rank among the worst 100 movies. National Treasure is an insult made on American audiences by National Intelligence and another attacker Hollywood. Critics said about plot holes that you can run 16 wheels. <br /> <br /> I like the suitability for this movie ... "Nicholas Cage is beautiful." Come to the people, it's no wonder that people around the world think Americans are fools. This will be the most stupid, insulting movie I've ever seen. If you really want to see a suitable movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately the National Treasury has received much more publicity than those horror films. I'm asking you to read most about this, even I did not hear about them, because nobody was still widely released. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movie. I saw Cage on his horrible genius repeatedly in horrified mind-flexing films such as Kan Air, The Rock and Face of Off. When Charlie Kaufman adapted his talent as well as Adaptation, he was an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> The line below - rather than being victim of this visual torture, I eat my hand in a wooden chip.
