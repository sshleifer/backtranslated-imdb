There are so many comments in this movie, but I have shown them wrong. This is a corner cut, a heavily used scenario where a normal person can be a partner in the opposite sex of a person for any objection. The boy met the girl. The girl holds up the boy at gunpoint for some ridiculous. The boy is plotting. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: The rival turns into a wild, free spirit rather than a socialism. Knowledge from Alice Drummer, a few words, and have a recipe for your love. Sheedy's 'he crazy or does he need a hug?' The role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character. And a movie that's left is a really terrible Turkey.
