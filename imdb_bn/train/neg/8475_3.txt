(Note: I thought I'd write down what I wrote below, but I agree with others here I guess it was quite clear - it was doing bit-cat bits too much. However, here I wrote :) <br /> < Owners have stayed for two weeks - a tour of California - the cat (seleveler) is all locked in the house alone. That means there is no milk, but the cat finds a bunch of canine tuner in its relief. However, for his frustration, he could not find the opener. <br /> <br /> It puts out a small mouse sitting in the house ... and bit the cat. This is an average farmer who is teasing with Sylvester tips opener and then junking it in the last second. Sylvester tries to do everything that can open the Tune Can but can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a story of disappointment, and why they make the evil mouse "good man" crosses me. It's something like Tom and Jerry's cartoon where the poor Tom always gets the worst, although the little mouse starts the conflict!
