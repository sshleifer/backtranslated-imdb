After reading several good reviews and listening to the nice things about it with the words of mouth, I decided to rent. I was obviously rather frustrated to say that. It was difficult to follow the story because this movie is set as a series of flashbacks in the current and recent past, which is implemented very badly. Despite the best efforts of the actor the character is flat and uninteresting. Sex and nudity are more clear than they need to be. I never saw a movie where they thought it was unnecessary for the plot. The finishing is very anti-climatic and leaves a lot unfavorable questions from a story line which did not explain well to start with. In my opinion, the time wasted
