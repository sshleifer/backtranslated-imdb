I wait for this movie to play great prospect. Based on Richard Paul Evans' book, "The Christmas Box" is believed to be more accurately portrayed as a movie. I've sent many emails to friends and family to see this show, hopefully they can understand a small amount of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was very disappointed. In November 2003, while learning about the missing child of her only child and actually pain, I hope that the film will be spread to the parents lightly, who understand the grief of a parent who has lost a child's child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and Diane Keiton was facing a fascinating parent's father who buried a baby. It was very unreal since it started off. After the film, I had a few calls, everyone said the same thing, "It was such a mark and it was shown that in a short time you will come back to the streets and listen to music on the radio and return to life" calves! It is clear that Director and Katon never lost a child because the film never could keep the mark so far. I guess that's Hollywood.
