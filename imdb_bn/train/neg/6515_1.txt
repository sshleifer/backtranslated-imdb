This is not a boring movie, the audience is fascinated by this filmmaker and actor, Miles Barkovitt, this selfish character. The story is simple: After a divorce and a Holivian non-career for ten years, the author plays for the camera in front of love. How the first question is true: What is written, what is the opportunity? Both answers, "yes" or "no" M. Berkowitz portrayed as low average human bees. If you are looking for self-imagination about this love, then I recommend you to read some free comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with my country, against France a lot . I can say generally American Americans that the French may be hysterical (it can be true), and, of course, the French (and the whole world) have great sorrow against America, but why so much hatred? I do not think that because I could not like this movie for any reason.
