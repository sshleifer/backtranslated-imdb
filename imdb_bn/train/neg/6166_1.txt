I do not recommend this movie because it was a mistake and confusing, this story was supposed to be in Algeria's barbarous region, it was shot in the Southern Tunisian desert (a completely different culture, I know that I am from Tunisia and Algeria), the other courageous element is his companion aunt The character was, he was very impressive French, university level academic French The movie spoke in the movie, when the character that he played was considered frustrating, the mountain's personality was never abandoned, Bedouin is impossible to me with such education, especially the most disrespectful scenes for the people of this region and the disrespectful "women barrier" "Segment which is a pure discovery from a writer / director, such things will not happen in an Algerian society Khanao !!!
