There are many people who have to tell me that we have to get the movie "Dukes" for some time as a modernized version. Please. If you consider modernization, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people in the MSN site say that (and I'm quoting) "without the old fogies you need to get it and without it." Well, I say to you, I'm 24 years old, so I'm a long way to old and old, and I will not keep an eye on it, it was an inconsistency in Hager County. The only thing in the movie title was "Hogwarts". All was filth, smoking, and really necessary drinks. The shield was terrible. Jessica is going to talk about the show in several mornings and to tell the truth that it has gone to her head. He daisy duke in any way, no frustration, but certainly no Duke. I love Shane Williams Scott, but not as a bone. They should have included the original cast as at least comes, but even Hollywood knew that they would not approve the script. I mean, even today, even actresses and actresses are giving negative feedback, so why are you making some positive comments?
