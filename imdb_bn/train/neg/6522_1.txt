This is not a commentary on genre, but in North American Rusiko DVD release. I do not know whether there are various releases and updates, but the discs we hired were 2000 copies of it, if it meant anything. However, combining the sound on this DVD was absolutely awesome. The layers often up Yo-Yo-Ed; When the scene was cut into a battleground panorama, the orchestral tracks soaked aloud with a loud shout and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly quarreled loudly. When it was time for the dialogue, the volume generally listens to hear something. Occasionally, orchestras and folios were louder in the upper layers of higher interaction. My wife and I see that this DVD was the only way we could see this movie if some of us hold hands on a remote so that they continually amend the volume. And, like other users have already commented, when we select English audio, the dialog switches back between Russian and English; And occasionally when the characters spoke French on the native track in taste, Dubbing was done in Russian language, so if you do not understand then you're SOL. Finally, we leave the observer after the first disc. Before stalking $ 50 + for this movie on your own library, I sincerely recommend you to get a copy of your rent that you can see if you can enjoy this epic flickr, especially if you do not read books and really Want to understand the story.
