It's a genre, which means that you like the musical instrument of 1950 or not. If you, you'll love this Personally, I liked the 1930s and the Asturias and Rogers dance geniuses and 40th musical instruments, Allan Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keller, James Cagney, Sherly Temple and more, but the songs of the 50's, slowly dancing numbers and The soap millendram of the decade stopped me all. <br /> <br /> This image is a case-in-point. The first song was right but the next three did nothing for me. Then, the story did not have much appeal. Another subtraction of the presence of Deborah Care. I do not think I saw the image I liked, in which I liked it, where in these two shoes English teacher's film, he threatened to leave six movies fast. (I was what she was!). However, divorcing itself from likes and dislikes, this Rogers and Hammerstein production has appealed to many people, especially those who liked "The Sound of Music" a decade later. There is no endorsement on the end and end of the musical instrument. So, if you like Julie Andrews Flick, you also have to like it. <br /> <br /> This is an unexpected production, yes, a capital "L." A big production song that you rarely see after this generation You will also get a dubbed vocal for today, where the actress can not really sing, so Mary Nixon comes for the rescue of care, as she did with Audrey Hepburn at Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and "My Fair Lady". "<br /> <br /> Yule Brenner is" King Munkut "and it is stereotypical traditionalist, such filmmakers are always negative. He is not" progressive ", as the left wings say, but teacher teacher (Care," Anna Ano Leonivens ") He will set him straight. Today's secular progress is always trying to cure cancer, higher than a teacher than human! However, in this introduction Yul is good and even His fork works with his more-bark-bite character, well, he was the star of this film, the magnificence of Brenner, and even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yule was an audience who made the audience gentle. <br /> <br /> Summary, this is a great movie for it and millions of people enjoyed it.
