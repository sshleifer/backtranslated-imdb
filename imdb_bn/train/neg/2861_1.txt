I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. When I started it it was a porn flick and it was found no good. Acting, actor drowning music out Horrible Save yourself money! You have to read the movie all the way. \ C They knew that the lyrics will be sinking in the spoken lines. I never knew anything about the need to continue showing the slaughterhouse or cows and pigs. What does that have to do with "real" BT killer? I understand why there was no famous actress in this movie. The script could have removed me from the first page of the reading. You will be good off paint dry watching.
