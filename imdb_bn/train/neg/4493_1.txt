I try to remove something that might have been considered a spoiler. I think that you know the first movie or at least know the general gesture, so if you do not have anything then do not understand it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> We have repeatedly bombed the purpose, fate, and choice, and have to bear them in the long, oppressive Pacific session. <br /> <br /> The Awakening from the dream in the last picture, now the beginning of the time of its own existence. There are many publications in this movie, which I will be obscure, so they do not feel like fools. <br /> <br /> * If you are still worried that the vague reference will ruin the movie, don 'read the following paragraph. * <br /> <br /> The strengths and weaknesses of faith are expressed. Strength and weakness, and its temporary nature, is also expressed. Dependence on human and technology, and our belief in technology, is also expressed. The importance of choice and experience is expressed. More details will be explained by explaining more details, so I will abstain (as a guide to writing a comment). BTU, through "Publish" I was pounded by the eyes like our ears and nails. <br /> <br /> So, the end of the last movie is neo and how does the gang come to the next beginning? In a nutshell, they hold beliefs and use it and misuse them and use style and bullet-time. (And after this exhibition, I hope the movie-gears and the makers hope to learn something similar to the importance and fundamentalism). After that more. To loot anything, I will not say anything more than the preprinted elements: Neo is still trying to find the matrix, and while trying to save the man, he is looking for answers, and when Zion is running bad and his classmates <br /> <br /> Action: At the same time, in the same part of the martial arts action and the songple, peep pee on his ancestor, the film gets more attention in martial arts than the gun battle, adding the sword, mixing sais, etc. Special effects are often used and enter into the mouth of the audience that it is really tired. I discussed this movie with friends and colleagues in the same way, and almost everyone has found some of their action sequences - especially the "Smith War" we all heard in the movie - to be very long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because when you end a verb sequence, you want to leave a little more, or just leave the content of that content together. <br /> <br /> These fights are not scenes. They are top-style, top-style that are wooden and uninspired. In the first film, there was a realization of frustration for some actions, a sensation that was meant to survive, does not look good only in black and in the skin (which I think does not handle ribaldoids). After this movie, look for drunk drunk or iron monkeys to remind you of a good fight sequence - you will not be sorry. In addition, "matrices power" is not compatible with people's reloaded, and in fact they are not consistent. The first film was its inconsistency here, but they were not very tedious - unlike reloadloads. <br /> <br /> Special effects and launches. Someone makes a little short, it just poses, jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just poses, <br /> <br /> accentuated more by slow motion, bullet time, or destruction of some kind. To throw the film, W. Broes had tons of money, and he threw the boy without any original restraint. The intense editor could really help this, but the first movie was a hit that has given the free regime clearly, which brings us. . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: The dialogue is tired and I am already saying that the philosophical platoon is full. When the script and the aspect are increasingly rising to the face of the growing audience of characters, or ignore them one by one, the actors can not bring much depth to their character. They can recognize their character so audiences are not given time and substance. <br /> <br /> Kenyor's performance performance is the best. Keanu is well-versed in acting, and that he is all about this film. He created the right creator to show emotions between Neo and Trinity, but it became flat. <br /> <br /> From Lawrence Moses to Henry V to try to make everything morpheus and to be cool like a cat everywhere. He is provided with the script, he makes a great effort, but it falls flat. <br /> <br /> Mash is not very credible. Concerns are not always the same, Keanu's look, and chemistry in his appearance, although in their very physical scene they fake it enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo is again an agent program to bring his strange sense, but he also suffered from the script's hand. I actually consider him as one of the most striking characters in the cluster, but instead of development, they make him an excuse for a huge, drawn battle scene. <br /> <br /> Everyone, if you had good expectations outside of the film, and on his own, alone in the film (which is not supposed to be guessed), it is still awful. I do not see the Matrix deep, but at least it can be seen as an enjoyable Sissy Romp which is good enough to pay attention to some interesting ideas, good work, some fun lines, and a lot of restraint and temptation. These reloaded numbers fail and I hope W. Bros will give us a better third-party experience. Imagine, I do not have much hope left after this photo.
