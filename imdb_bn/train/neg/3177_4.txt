I was not as bad as it was really bad on his dead body, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I just go ahead and look awful before my eyes, but in fact this was not too bad. I just hope for this horror movie, but there seems to be no harm to the authors, but Casting of Eva Longriy (Parker, sorry), he seems to be a little set for the movie. I think I could have been better without him, only he bothered me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film a bit of a favorite. But you have to admit, there was no direction in this movie, it was one of the fastest checklists for the kind of actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But when her sister took her to mentality, Ashley, Henry fell for her, but Kate was expelled from her grave. Kate is jealous and Henry does not want to go so fast, and she will make sure that Ashley does not catch her with ramble in her day and night and will not catch her, I believe, Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Over the dead body is a perfect film, not sure whether it is worth the money, but if you want to see it or are weird then I will pay it for you. Eva Langriya does not have enough star power to do the film work, there is no crime for those who love her, she is only on a small screen on silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, he feels that he is still not very interested in what he is dragging, or his "gay" friend, Dan, is not again favorite. With just writing and with proper attention, this movie could have been better, but instead we got an average guessable romantic comedy that would leave an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
