Destruction of title animals in a peaceful little desert town. This is basically the entire plot for this movie, and the scenes employed on the dancers are somewhat fun (down to dust), the rest are just admission and bad fillers in it. The "hero", the painful Woody Allen Wannabe, very cruel city police, it is difficult to choose the most annoying character in the film. There was some time when almost everyone was on the screen and I was thinking, "OK, at least the girlfriend is intelligent, but why should we do this with everyone else?" This image is filled with pop references (from Oge Osborn to Linda Blair), which has been created in the early 90's. (* 1/2)
