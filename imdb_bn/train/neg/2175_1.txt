Carlos Mensia constantly, violently screams "B ** f!" Women are shouting "N ** Jar!" Black people, without it's bad. Remember, the word B is the only insulting word against the word N, which is still involved with violence on a daily basis. "B ** CH!" Before women rape, beat or kill, women can hear the last word. This man makes the violence enduring violence by using the language of violence. It seems he might be a gay man trying to cover the men and women, so that he would sound like a hit. And how all the Nazis of his audiences are giving fascist salute to the white boys, when their cute little Bimbo white women were walking on their side, clearly scared of the tide of hatred of women. Hey o Beta Mencia does not believe in free lecture or support for them! Come on, Carlos ?? Do you want to give women free speech? ** As you do, chap-up loudly and violently and with great silence, or do you think that "free speech" is just nervous for women ???
