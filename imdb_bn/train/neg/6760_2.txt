Renowned writer Mark Redfield (like Adger Allen Poe), trying to start a new life for himself by winning the old addiction as Murrland's magazine publisher Baltimore. However, blackouts, shiny, and rejection threaten to try their failure. She wants to revive romance with an old sweetheart, a significant flawed prospect, things turn out. Mr Redfield adored the mysterious last-minute drama of Edgar Allen Poe. Many black and white, color, and technique photography are used to create redfield mood. Kevin G. Shinik (Dr. John Moran) played well, says relatively. It's not enough.
