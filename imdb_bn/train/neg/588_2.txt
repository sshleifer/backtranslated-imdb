I am compelled to review this IMAX feature as a way to alert others for saving your money. Desmond Morris's "Human Anime" or David Suzuki's "Things of Nature" was almost the best choice for an element presented. The director does not just fail to use IMAX's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and giant presentation screens, everything on the screen gives accessibility to the previously mentioned accessibility. The viewers were introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband, Buster, and their nephew and nephew. We follow them for an intimate forty minutes of eating, sweating, listening to music, etc. Although we have access to the scene inside the human chef track and learn about the natural diving response of children, do we really graduate to the highest grade school? Are we entertained remotely by Trans Atlantic Heather? What do we care about? Avoid this film at all costs. If you want to see an IMX feature, then I would offer a beautiful "India: Tiger State" or technically thriller "Space station 3D" photo. Trust me
