I'm really one of the two films - half of it Lenna's sexual experimental part and half of his political / socialism with his curiosity. Whatever the director's intention, the two really do not fake together. The director should only keep Lenaar romantic and create a separate film for politics. Political / war rally King, there is a diverse mix of serious political interviews, breast rupture and muscle hair. The film seems more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Without interesting sexual scenes, you will see this image dry bored. Unlike many other critics, I think nude / sexual scenes are extra for it. If you want to see real porn, I sure have good choices. Broad nudity is a major distraction from whatever plots are. I think cast though is a fine work though. They faithfully played their part. During this time I have used a lot to see in American movies.
