I'm the guy who usually holds his own opinion, but I come back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinion. I'm not saying that I'm a huge horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I'd like to see a good script and a small bit of character development. I know they often miss a lot of horror movies, but Pramos Knight looks like they did not make any effort in that section. Next, we all love mystery. That's on the edge of my seat with unpredictable shock. Yes, there was nothing in Pramos night! Of course, we liked an awesome killer. What is the entertainment night? No, it's a nice boy with a nice lil 'knife. And when all else fails ... At least awful is his delightful blissful joy like Gore Gore and occasionally joyous as a nude scene! Well, when you've rated PG-13 like a horror movie Promotion Night, they also release that stuff. So with all these elements missing, I ask .... Is this still counting as a horror movie? No I'd call it a comedy more. In my theater, people began laughing to laugh like this, when they saw "Semi-Pro", which actually seemed to be a comedy (which was tossed, but another story!). I think I just have to leave on the new horror. Well ol 'all the good horror movies of the day have been rebuilt in the trash, so the movie studio can earn money. Those I went to visit do not even know it was a remix! That made me crazy! No wonder when there is no movie to remake ??? Where's the horror ???
