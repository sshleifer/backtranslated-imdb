Winning Vargas is just a bad film. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollet did not have the money for the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way. Creates a bad movie that honestly mocks the significance of "making the current movie". Maybe he just does not know well. It's hard to tell <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. Some visitors who try to do pseudo-reality will make their intellectualization intellectually sound, they will enjoy some of them. <br /> <br /> I do not know I <br /> <br /> <br /> Pass yourself a favor and this film.
