Almost time they released this movie to DVD. I know that due to the movie DobgerGloss, the film was released by W.B. But, how you can get rid of the movie in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special features, 5.1 ddd words. Come to the WB, you can do this much better then. This movie requires some critical support for audio and image quality. <br /> <br /> As long as the time and attention was not given to this movie, it is a black film and I have just been selling. They could keep the CD, which did not have all the songs in the original CD. <br /> <br /> Do I recommend buying this DVD? Yes, because it is a classic film. But WB needs to add some more special features. Take notes from other group movies, the Panch Hitbits, or Temptation, you can only see the performance and both have more words than this word.
