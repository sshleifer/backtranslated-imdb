After the film was released in 1997, such as 'special effects', they were poor. They even date in the 1980s and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Of course, anyone involved in the production of this film was not looking for the Oscars. It is the wildest departure from Fred O'Neill Ryan, the most common of which is the word "Bikini" (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls etc from the Lost Planet) and more than T & A Flix. Here we are clearly seen with a movie rated "U" and at kiddies. You must give him credit for diversity !! It hit a short straight-to-video content that later appeared in several series - Invisible mother 2 and invisible parents. Dale Wallace-Stone (after her 1982 film "ET", her career went on a high speed) played 'Invisible Mom' on the title of the movie and will be back for a siege. Ras Tamblin (his career has deteriorated more since 1961. The story ") plays the famous Dr. Warter. Perhaps most of the cast during their career, where they seem to be ready to do almost anything to pay bills in that month - perhaps young Trenton Like Josh without a knight, although he had worked before this movie, the child actor again after "Invisible mom 2" Perhaps this movie was cursed, for a child actor, he is quite good - no better or worse than his more experienced experience. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the effect of "invisibility" The direction is poor, poor for writing, and nothing to write about home. There are plenty of rss films, and for somebody under the age of ten, this movie is no There ndeha. Although most adults are most likely to want to work in an invisible, but it is on them, and I do not blame one particular one of them!
