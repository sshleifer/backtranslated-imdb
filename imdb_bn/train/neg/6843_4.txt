David F. Friedman's writings include black and white rough absorption. The lead actress Stacy Walker is well-cast and weird attractive. She is similar to a deranged Rene Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick made only two films and then moved to Texas. The music is terrible. One of his lovers, Sam Melville (from the TV show The Rukise), played a different name. <br /> <br /> Best line in Tony's picture - "Are you keeping me dolls? None of my daughters keep on me". Good B / D Symmetry from Lasalov Kovacs (Easy Radar and Targets and many others) Good locks (cooler swimming pool, also used defiler). Weird finishes but also suitable. Of the 10 best performance Stasi Walker
