1 being quite generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, although it is not really a DVDGE cover and we all know! It trembles me. But this picture, it's something else. It seems to be shot in a 10-year-old VHS camcorder, for a long time to be operated by so many people and to run many movies! Story and acting miser! David Hess, you've given me down too. After a game of the most dangerous villain in the history of the film, have you enjoyed it? Stories and acting may be able to forgive, however, it takes some time to show the video a bit professional. There is a shot in video films that it does not see, or at least it is not so clear that it draws attention from your movie. I can never say this is the worst movie, because I could not make it through the whole movie, but it must be closed.
