Can I Get My $ 13.00 Back? I've seen "Hydro-electric power comes to North America". Again It's a movie with a voice. The same voice which comes out of each character of the face regardless of age or gender. I need at least $ 150 hours to listen to that voice again. And I do not take insurance. It was eerie watching Farrell morph in the well. But I do not think the fantastic cast is enough. Before filming, they should wait until they have a story. He's not doing it for just the money. And if that's why, "Watts up Tiger Lily?" Why not revise an all-rp version?
