When I saw this movie on TV, I'm really waiting for it. I grew up in the 1980s and like everyone who grew up in that era, we saw 80 children and adolescents of the summer camp. So I could not wait to see this movie which completely spread the continuity of that movie. What a disappointment !! The film was adultery and there was nothing wrong with any substance and there was nothing in over over Google. And filmmakers have completely failed in the dark smile-this so-called joke has not come as a cruel cruel and objectionable. The only good thing about this movie was clothing, music and acting. It was all beautiful to go to a Nostalgia trip and look up to 80's summer clothing styles, and goes for the same song. And the performance was top of all: almost all Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they were not good material to work with.
