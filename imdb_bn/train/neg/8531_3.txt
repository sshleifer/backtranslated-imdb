In this forgotten tribute, 40-Ishma Narma has played a barbaric, girls' society in Monte Carlo, in Seyher, which is caught in the conflict between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It will be tempting to blame the failure of this movie, the playful script or director George Cooker's failure, who does not ever want to dominate the film's popular comatose state. In most cases, Shiite's own fault, who strongly wanted to play "young" parts until she could go with her. Curiously, this "her cardboard lover" makes a bizarre memory of an old-fashioned woman terrible.
