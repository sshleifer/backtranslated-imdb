Another boring and annoying film about AIDS and tragedy It started very unknowingly and expected and continued throughout the movie. I keep waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it does not. Acting is fair, but the script requires a lot of work. And if you are looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these hot artists. Due to poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen five gay films, or have recently come to terms of homosexuality, then you can think of this movie as interesting, otherwise it's your run-off-match-less budget movie. It's regarded as one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
