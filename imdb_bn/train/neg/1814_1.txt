These are the critics spot. I have seen many bad films for many years, believe me, and it's a lot frustrating! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shear A ** E-Clear Disbelieve! Threadbar set! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "European co-productions". No wonder we have many wars. I swear, some people participating in 'Wisdom of the Lost Kingdom' are not actually aware that they are appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> <br />! I originally saw this movie on HTC Wales that suffered late and sleep deprivation one night. It was to make a copy track after several weeks to make sure it was really terrible. It's about Worse than Narsman's Li Mazar, John is more ridiculous than Derek's movie, why is it really a trash citizen?
