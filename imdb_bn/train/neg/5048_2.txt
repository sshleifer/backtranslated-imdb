I tried. I really did. I thought, maybe if I gave Joao Pedro Rodriguez another chance, then I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing the fantasy I was sick and almost annoyed, but most reviews were very good and favorably, so I was good, "What the hell, at least you did not pay $ 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not always be good to go back to my childhood and my former bullies really demanded me to do it Not surprising if not. Other occasions I often think that the world is really flat and if I move far enough, I will not just move away from it, but it will fall clearly and some evil, boyfriend embrace my 9000 joke and life - and since 1995 some French Fry has still entered my inside. <br /> <br /> Do I have any reason? I do not want to say ... only his Creator thought that his madness (which is Alex) Forrest looks like a strawberry shortcut) It's not just strange to write his story, but he is sick of bone. He has decided to give up his current boyfriend (Hunstars Screeking) because he wants a child and he believes that they are very small. Later, he crashed the funeral of a gay man and - to get it - to draw closer to him, he emphasized the life of the deceased's mother and herself as a lover in a sick way. Oh, of course, he shrieks like a banshee and throws himself one, but his grave is a good thrice. And this ridiculous business is that he has become a "Pedro" who explains a poor-bad-tea interpretation that love does not know any gender. Or something <br /> <br /> I would say that cough is like a nuts like cancer. But then again, the director is so. And I, for taking this one opportunity. At least men look good. That's another ... there's nothing else to look at here.
