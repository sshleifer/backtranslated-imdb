I remember Kim Basing was nothing but a beautiful look, who was fascinated by the simple letters of mobile phone, romantic interest or virgin girls. However, when the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role won everything changed. Awesome movie LA is confidential and I think I'm surprised by its only acting that's not the only one. However, after that moment, his career did not follow the ideal path. To participate in moderately dignified movies (like John I know or on the floor), but we have never seen him in a remarkable character. When the movie was out, the situation did not keep him; And this is not only her character very flavorful, but the film is really vague. The screenplay of this movie can not be more deceit and basic. However, Basing came to some firm belief in his character and it won the movie a few points from this poor. This movie is complete with Clich√©s and Generic Villains. The director Susan Montford's work is really crushing for many reasons, but mainly because the film does not get any good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is very sunny I did not recommend when I was out of it. This movie is the capital to be annoying.
