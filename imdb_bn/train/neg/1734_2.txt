I'm a big fan of old Westerns, and do not believe that Hollywood is able to hold its old glory. However, Randa Flaming and Stuart Granger could not help in the 1957 film, which has made virtually all the characteristics of the reformer gunfighter in the West. Fallen but righteous woman, quoted by the people who would return to the gunman for salvation. Etc. I can not help but the writer's last name and young "actor" who plays Grenzar's son. There is no nepotism? I saw good acting in high school drama. Chil Wills characterizes a cartoon by Chill Wills. I still reached 1000 words?
