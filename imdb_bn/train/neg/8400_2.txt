Even the most enthusiastic Stoug Fan might not even like the movie, (I'm one of them) no material is given to work with stogues. It's really embarrassing because it's the only feature-length movie that studied with the kolie, and by them the painful absurdity of this effort, when it was possible, it was possible. Horrible musical numbers do not help any. They have more smiles with smaller headgear with the same title.
