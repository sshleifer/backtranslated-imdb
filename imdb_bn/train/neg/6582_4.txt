Geez is another life movie, but it is not again the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it is quite obvious, which is responsible for it and it is generally fairly predictable. Even worse, some flashbacks have become confusing, and the audience is surprised, "OK, how much do I care?" One thing I love is that the film does not make it easy for you to show that "good people are good and bad guys bad" and sometimes it's bad versus evil versus evil. He did not do what he had done from the idea of ​​justice, because he considered himself to be a family member and asked to eliminate the competition. As Alicia, it only proves that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them were really "coming to it", even if "it" was a painful, terrible death. "The Burning Bid" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the cruel person of "burning bid" gets its right. But, what is "coming" Alicia? Some will say that he did, but others do not agree, and the law is not usually. <br /> <br /> This is a mixed bag for acting. Some do a good job like Mia, but others came across as just lacking in their roles. They were mostly wooden or not easily trusted. Although the music was quite calm and some scenes are beautiful and steamy, especially if you love girl / girl action. The movie does not shoot badly, but gives its clearing weaknesses, unfortunately the forces remain in the background. <br /> <br /> I've heard a signal rumor, but for a few years, I suspect it 'will' but I will not be surprised if suddenly a signal appears. If Alicea is like Evil, it's fascinating and awesome to tell people, I do not think she thinks, "Yes, I woke up from a coma! Oh, what was Headley responsible? Oh! Okay! I totally forgave her and charged Want to drop! "However, he must be in jail anytime, if he is not killed at any time. <br /> <br /> However, worth checking out at least once!
