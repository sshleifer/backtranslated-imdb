I just saw this movie and I would say that this turkey with such a great proof and great talent just keeps there !!! A friend gave me this movie and I basically saw an open mind because he praised so much for the story. <br /> <br /> All right, this movie with Kevin Coster as a freedom fighter pilot ... Why? Why did they make him a warrior pilot? He is probably going to rent Anthony Quinn's character to be a new pilot ... well, we never went to a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costar sells a horse in a sustainable (James Gamon) and travels to a large Mexican businessman and buyer's tag. After learning what happened, Gammon got a bit closer to death and Castner took him to the meeting, which could be Queen's partner! But, nothing comes ... Nada, Zilla! Why did they get the character of gammon? Why did not somebody sell horses with queen associates? Also, after leaving Costaire for death, they make Madeline Stowe a prostitute, then she attacks one of the queen's men who pays to escape ... she spins her with her own knife, And the next thing she has removed from a convent! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just saw it because a friend owned And allow me to see it ... I'm going to throw him for me for two hours, I was wasting my life exploded!
