I am very happy and amazed that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was created by me and distributed by A-Peak Entertainment in movies, and without exception, everything related to this company is pure shit! First, and this is very important, sometimes watch this movie impressive! Why would you be Unlike many other entertaining bad films, I think it was deliberately bad. I just can not keep an eye on the counterfeit copy of ice, it has always been shown only briefly, the way it's running is the best! This film is better than a fragmented piece by Michael Keaton, which is also a good film, and its version is so bad.
