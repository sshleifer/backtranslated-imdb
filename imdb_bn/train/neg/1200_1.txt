Featuring a Doberman with red eyes of very lazy, obvious, tedious Exorcist Rip - this made the special effects amount in TV cheap for the sake of this. About Richard Krenna as a Choo Kid as the Spirit. Very add to 70's clothing and music only torture. Should be almost asleep as fast as "body vanishes" or "blue hand". Effectively worthless. Mahoko said, a dog dog! : = 8P
