God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably tested or wanted something (see here terrible use of music and pictures here) but what really? The whole thing behind the "natural-born killers" seems to be a "tricky" appearance of how the media can become a complete trash, but unfortunately the movie becomes trash. Please do not do the same with your movie, please Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize fascism of TV shows using violence to get high rates! Michael Hannek is quite categorical about the film that it denies media fascism by fascist cinematographic means. How really ... He just forgot about the huge headache you got after sitting on this huge pressure!
