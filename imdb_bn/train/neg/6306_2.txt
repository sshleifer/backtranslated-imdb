A number of movies are seen in a video store and I do not try to watch some big movies on the occasion. Proud happened to be one of them. Initially, during the Second World War, the initial idea to tell the story of the black crew was a bit worthwhile. But in less than 10 minutes to watch the film, you discover that the primary point of the movie was to tell about ethnic tensions in WWII. The underlying stories about ships, crew and war exploit them. This initial point hit you at a very high point throughout the film. I appreciate those people who worked hard at the USS Meson for facing the adversity and the difficulties they faced. This film should have focused on the achievement for them, the navy and their country, and a movie of apartheid described in WWII was not created.
