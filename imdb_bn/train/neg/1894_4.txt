Although flying guillotines are part of the title of this film, it does not have any connection with the original Flying Geelotines (1975) and its Signal Flying Giltoons II (1978). The two are largely superior to Kung-Fu's film and still stand as classic. It is a poor copy of the original and even regular Kung Fu film as it is less than the average. <br /> <br /> First, this movie does not have much acting. It can not play another stupid war scene after another, and flying gilotine even a major part of them. The story follows some of the Shaolin monks, who have left a holy book, and are part of this plot, and an evil princess, the partner of this book. Plans to foster the same evil prince fans and use the flying guillotine on them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ ref> My opinion is at least this quality. The design of Flying Giltoine in this movie is different from the other three, indicating that the film was produced by another company from another three. <br /> <br /> No chemical chemistry of this film has been given to be strange. Poor production. Avoid the best and see two original ones.
