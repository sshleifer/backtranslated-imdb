The main theme of this movie is a political cartoon. I think those who do not know about the reality of the military, perhaps it is a "sentimental" film about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator says: "It can tell women that they can do what they want to do." What a clip! No one, men or women can do what they want to do, and unfortunately, in some local sessions in the local gym, Seymour Demy Moore "buffing" for weeks and weeks of seal alone is not going to seal her desire simply. Controversial nearly 80% dropout rate - in the controversial military training program - who can not drop out, can not compete at the physical level, often during physical training, or can not manage mentally harassment harassment I did not cross the brutality of this film's controversial, authenticated message. In the real world, demi will not end in the first 24 hours of this harsh and permanent physical training. Do not want to do it alone. Avoid this movie as deliberate thinking and spend time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Coach (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of how well your training time is running. Ring ring, Demi! <br /> <br />
