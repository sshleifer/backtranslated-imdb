Reasons to stop this threat ... Wrong ... Respect for a great movie called Se7en: - It's running on your channel while surfing and there's nothing else to do. - Someone pays you to see it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and pop on Seven DVDs for yourself, rent it, download it at iTunes, or keep it on your netflex couch and skip the flick completely. Flock the same story with few changes Further editing ends with Se7en's only wreaks and actually end up taking up the story from many times. The worst one probably flies on desert helicopter shots, with the sound of sticky man on the radio people, without any police helicopter flying overhead in this one. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I hit it off a blatant call. If you want to be beautiful, you can call it as a tribute film, go ahead, but go to Se7en anyway.
