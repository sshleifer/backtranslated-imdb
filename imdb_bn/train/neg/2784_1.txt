My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same city as the film's painter. We are very upset that JCC is bringing the film to Jewish film festival, as mentally portrayed character Franki has been portrayed. When we came to see the movie in the local theater, I came to see. We seek back the money. We j C. Encourage the screenlitter to donate a portion of the funds to its program. <br /> <br /> We were scared as part of Frankie - mentally challenged and probably did not like to see an autistic teenager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, challenges like Frankie are a serious matter. The family like mine is really hard to find. <br /> <br /> The screenplay itself has to be explained. Does he know the family with disabled children? Does he see the family with disabled children in weeks after week?
