I wonder, and how important is the decision to call Richard Attenborough to point out the most single sensation to hit Broadway for many years? He is the Academy Award winning director. Yes, he won for the horse! Jeremy Irons Academy Award winning actor, do you want to see him Rocky Belbo? She has experience with musical instruments. Really? "Oh what a beautiful war" you forgot? Answer your question, yes! The film is a frustration, clean and easy. Did not maintain an ounce of the living energy and the balance of the proceedings. Each character was beautifully beautiful dance they had but their projection theater was. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on the stage, I felt everything. The film should have been big, unknown, and should be thrown with the newcomers, but with the most invisible and impossible unforgettable faces in the group, The great actors who can act beautifully Well it was Michael Douglas. The truth is I forgot I am totally wrong and you are absolutely right. There is nothing like Richard Attenborough's Michael Douglas musical.
