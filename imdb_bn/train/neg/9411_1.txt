It's interesting that not everyone (so far) looks like this movie - I guess this is the strategy. In contrast to them, I had hoped optimism, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how the camera was always close to the face, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director - that's always a clear sign of them, they think the camera is about two inches away from the arty or effective or intense actors. The actors of this film had only one face-to-face face. <br /> <br /> If the discontinued camera is not enough, then the lack of light in the film kills it. The film seems to be fully pictured in the dark. So now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. "Oh, oh, we're going to a set light with a flashlight! It will all feel intimate!" No, it seems all invisible. <br /> <br /> On serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond a clear indication of the concept that has never been developed and there is nothing new about such a relationship. Was enlightened. (Perhaps this is a new type of movie for Germany, but forget it in Los Angeles.) <br /> <br /> This movie does not indicate that this movie has won several movie festival awards, but this special festival-style mustache. I can assure you that the festival where I saw the festival will not win. Indeed, the movie time seems twice that it has finally ended and the people started leaving (this was one of the side effects of the "total darkness" technique of cinematographer). But when the movie got hit, instead, the audience was crying. And when the film was finally over, it was clear that it was not in the standard until it was actually finished in two previous points. A previous finishing viewer has saved viewers from more density scenery (folding sheet, cut vegetables, bread honey). Yes, we got it, life of lonely old people was annoying - but we figured out one of it very soon. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the audience miss this, offer it absolutely nothing to covet movie-traveler
