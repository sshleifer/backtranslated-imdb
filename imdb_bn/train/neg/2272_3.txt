I'm not a regular visitor of Springer, but I've seen his shining shine and it seems that the show is a bland and a good way to kill something. So naturally, I'm hoping to see the movie "Jerry Springer Uncensor". Above all, Jerry appears to be around twenty minutes of the film's running time. Trail-trash, jealousy, brutality and deception are spent for another hour and twenty minutes to build this pseudo-style. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash whore who sleeps with his parents (very unusual appearance, discipline-smoking, drunk Dickikoff) who eventually ends his action hero's personality). Finds the mom's case, they come in a fight, they want to take it to the "Jerry" show (that's right, no springgirl). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it at the "Jerry" show. Characters Collide Bla, Bla, Freakin 'Bla! The trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why Springer has millions of fans, yet none of them have tested their film. Well, now it's pretty obvious !! If you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? This is the total mess of a motion picture (if you call it). It has been edited very badly, the scenes that are not only connected, and after some time the plot almost disappears and it is only on the map! Imagine converting into the soap opera fantasy. Sometime with laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets. If you compare the overall film compared to the content of the spinner's program, do not make me wrong, the scene is quite beautiful, but this dangerous wound seems very sensitive. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (10 out)
