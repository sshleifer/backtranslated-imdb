Bad movie, terrible movie even annoying movie ... I can see most of the time and can not be put to the end, this time. Plugging, annoying music, terrible editing, no comedy, it's more than a novelty mugger ... My mistress wanted to see this idea as it is legally a golden element or some kind of surveillance, but not better than average, chick flick. For the first time he was begging me to push the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, they were not great to start (Dennis Starships Trupers and Wild things are okay) but you have been drowning Fork. I think it's 30 minutes to spend a lot of time ... Pamela Anderson is very unknown about her face after many activities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ranting at that authentic mince on your screen.
