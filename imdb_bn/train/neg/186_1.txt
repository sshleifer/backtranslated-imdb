I do not know whether this misconception in Canadian history, especially whether Yunan's mounted police should be crying or crying to the helplessness associated with history. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it Pierre Burton. Historian born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the history of Clondic Gold Storm, Clayny: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my excitement with this stupid film. <br /> <br /> <br /> American concept of an unexpected border run by different heroes run by armed people with six guns, a character in The Fire Country Another story about this, Wyiming at this time - beef meat in the gold country. The picture is a nightmare of geography incomplete, but the real contradiction is the main idea that turns the plot ?? Canadian Yunok was the only police force during the Golden Round and he could not deal with lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Braunen reached their cows on the Yukon border, the customs shack was empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the console?" Brennan asks. <br /> <br /> "Pele River above." Problems with Chilkats, "someone is answering. He got a hard job, that constable. He made gates of ten to twenty thousand square square miles. Sometimes he does not get home for two or three months at a time. "<br /> <br /> The Yukon Territory was one of the closest thing in British North America to any state state during the Golden Rule, in many areas before the shutdown of the Nostest Mounted Police Clone. The area was located in. They control every route in Yukon and they do not fool anymore. They are the new arrival birds Customs collect the duty, make clear arbitrary laws regarding river navigation, and if they do not have enough supplies or they just feel bad, they return to men, true Canadian fashion, they set down moral laws for community. The Day Act is strictly observed; It was a penalty punishable on cutting your wood on Sunday; and face face-to-face Isake "Russia's performance in the theater," called the young woman had been arrested, usually in general, is nothing more than dancing on the edge of the stage in tights. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, a gunbelt was unimaginable. One of Tumbasson's notorious bad person who tried to pack weapons on his hip, he was personally disarmed by a young constable, who was expelled from Salon for his serious offense. The bad man left like a lamb, but when the police was carrying a gun in protest, he asked him to hand him over. America says, "So far no one is taking a gun from me". "Well, I'm taking this", said the constable gently and did so without further resistance. Dosan was confiscated so many revolvers that the police took him for auction for a few dollars and bought as a reminder to keep Montellis. <br /> <br /> In 1898, was there a serious crime in the big year of stamped ?? Let alone to kill ?? Dawson In. Unlike Skagwey, America was a lawless city run by Daveyar's confident Shipper Smith. But in a remote country, Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which is the character of Soci Smith from Skagway ?? She is called the photo ganone ?? Can easily control. (In real life, a man in Smith who was trying to cross the limited border was seized all his equipment and was again leaked by a mounted police sergeant). <br /> <br /> {The only movie in the movie called} "Yes, I am the law, I represent the law of Yukon Territory, it is almost fifty thousand square miles." <br /> <br /> "So why do not you have more?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday it was a desert, we hope you will not be able to enter thousands." Now you are here, we will protect you. <br /> <br /> "When? "<br /> <br /> Here, a daughter of Dawson will start at the beginning of May. <br /> <br /> "What's going on between girls now? Are you going to stay here? <br /> <br /> "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What did she do to him as a Marcel <br /> <br /> The movie leaves Mounty and is not seen again in the film.His wonderful advice? An American city, Marshall, completed with a tin star, a group of dancers residing under the British Judiciary? Naturally, they want Jimmy Stewart to be martial, he definitely fits the part. The person who plays the role of Ubert Loner sees the first number and is therefore selected to shoot another person, and he shoots others, even Walter Brennan also got a shot, and Stuart finally concludes that he must finish shooting with his shooting. He pinped the tin station and he and the bandit gangun, unexpectedly in the western climax <br /> <br /> Anyone with the knowledge of the answer to the Canadian answer passes the logic of the story of this slogan. <br /> <br /> 1915 by Pierre Burton quotes from Hollywood in Canada .
