This thing is really awfull. There are no charachters with weight, they are all floating around in BG. Motion capture is a fine toy, but this movie requires people who make you aware of animations for animated movies. The machine itself can not do anything good. If you look at it as a bizarre movie, you will find it hard to find consistency ... in a 3D movie !!! It's fun to walk around with some things like the Fisheries traveling in the princess dress. You need Animation and 3D Animation, know those 3D programs who do not have data-entry. Observe the shoulders like shoulders, how they lost the volume and got distorted. The person who created Chachar's design (very good one) requested to ensure that when he looks at them, you can not say that they have come to life.
