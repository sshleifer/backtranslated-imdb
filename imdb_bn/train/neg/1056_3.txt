Diana Guzman is an angry young girl. Continuing the continuous series of frustration and panic, he got out of his anger at the earliest targets. <br /> <br /> When he saw violence and concentrated on Randon Boxing discipline, he knew that he found his house. <br /> <br /> The movie progresses from here, Diana can learn the skills required for successful boxing as well as natural arrival lessons. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the introduction, especially when pushing a young girl to the opponent and engaging in sexism rather than not only in personal circumstances. <br /> <br /> The picture could use some happiness. All the young actors pale in comparison to their direction, those older, more experienced cast. There are many breaks in the script, which are stuck in dramatic tensions. Drain the overall quietness of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a good picture to watch once, if only one young woman is fully aware that her power is too complex to include her power. Its restrictions prevent it from being placed in the "see again and again" category.
