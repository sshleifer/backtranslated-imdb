I am a fan of Shakespeare and MSST3, so I have waited anxiously to watch this episode. I will first comment on the movie, then the episode of MST3 Recipe for this movie: Talented actor, rich and beautiful Shakespeare ingredient and accept $ 1.25 budget. Well, then drain all life and movements, shameless and secluded. Serve cold in a big, plain stone trick. Films, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors deserve at least the credit. Okay, now MST3 is the episode. I will admit that for the first time I saw it, I fell asleep through half. I realized that the response of other other veiwers was. However, when I saw it a second time, I realized that I had missed the first time with intelligent reference and good lines. The strategy with this episode is: Listen carefully! It takes a couple of views to catch every line. Give it a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. 1/2 of MST3 in episode 10.
