SPEAKER: I wonder how many people have always given a good review of this game. It was a strange thing. Scripts and voice played alone to destroy it. Unlike the most unlikely characters in the game of Gabriel and Grace. You almost pray for their death. And worst of all, at least in this game there are at least vampires than vampires. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly frustrating. If you're expecting some Queen Style vampire stories, forget it. The stories of this game have very little with vampires. You can not even see even till the end and you still can not fight with them. <br /> <br /> The story is radical and most reprehensible, Christian views. I was surprised to get off drawing board. I'm not even Christians and I found it objectionable. Often, the story is located around the search for pure grill and graveyard. The abduction of a royal child, which should be focused, really pushed apart. There is no sense of urgency to find Gabriel's baby. In fact, he did not ask almost anyone about the baby after blocking the first several times. <br /> <br /> The graphics are quite bad. The letters even moved about a snap speed on the best system. They are chunky and old. And it's hard to get to Bist FMV in this terrible game engine for the blood of terrorism. <br /> <br /> The relationships between Gabriel and Grace also changed drastically. I do not know why ran so horribly, but they could sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spent most of the time playing his best friend Moussley, telling him how he regards Grace as a sister and does not think he is a person for him. And he seems to really grossed that out of sleeping together. But he is so impossible across the whole, that you do not care about that at that time. Her conversation was the worst game. And she was constantly making the girls full game stupid sexual innuendos. At the end of the game, Grace considers him the favorite John Letter. I think he was upset with her because most of the players were there. <br /> <br /> I think the story is annoying and annoying. I was hoping to play a story about a royal child abducted by the vampire. And I was hoping to see and fight the Vampire, perhaps Gabriel or Grace turned one. But not Instead, the story focused on the scattered focus of the author of Christianity. What a shame Here they had the element for a great adventure, and instead we got this. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting part of the game was at the very end. We do not get some action style puzzles at the end. But they do not have the whole game to reach them. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this game. When I came out a few years ago, I got it back and I hated the game engine so much that I kept it for a few years. I was recently missing what I was missing in it. And now, I'm sorry that I did. My favorite characters are destroyed. I hope the series will be the fourth game to be released. And I hope they will be correct next time. It will be a terrible shame to finish the series with this installment.
