Although I gave a 2 rating to this movie, to show the complete lack of a quality horror film effort, it was 10 unexpected fun scales. I did not understand what was going on in the movie or the man but I did not see any difference because I knew that every scene could cry me crying. Although the dialog covers the whole film, I believe because it started filming without a script. The movie that does not have a plotline is highly versatile. If you start to sit down and watch the movie from start to finish or if you see it again, it will be confused with the enjoyment. I especially like the scene where the prisoners roam around and stick with each other. I treat this as a doctor's treatment. Genius!
