I have seen some pretty poor films in the past, but what they thought when they made this movie. When they come up with the idea of ​​making the production, the production becomes a crew, because you have to be dead in the brain to find some enjoyment in it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And the acting was weak. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I must say, I was more disturbed than the video shop, who gave it a finger, which is amak Rent. Thank you, and I believe some of my films to restore a second film to watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
