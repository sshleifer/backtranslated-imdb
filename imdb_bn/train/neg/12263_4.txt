Watching this movie, as I did for the first time in Turner Classic (which is listed as "Dangerous Female"), only 1941 can boost your gratitude for Bogart-Esto version. Ricardo Cortez has been paid by Smith. I hope he remembers his Brylcreem salesman in his Dentist and his will; They made him an actor. Women are all good, but better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who provide most personal ticks, but in the roles there is almost nothing in the set-variable atmosphere of their successors, Peter Lor and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bougert and Mary Astor had somehow crossed the essential seed of their character in the rimik; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Overallie (!) Are not able to. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's like a big slice of ham lying there. Today's original price is reminiscent of the fact that '41 'does not just make great films like Falcon. On the scale of 1 to 10 I rate it 4, mainly for camera work and helpful players.
