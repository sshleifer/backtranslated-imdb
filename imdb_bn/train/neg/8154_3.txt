On this Flickr, the long list of "big" names (including Public Mills) did not talk to me so much that I could not judge the film with his true worthiness. It is full of stereotype, character and standard, set scenes from low-air protagonist to high-moody yank flair. The music track was such that at one stage, almost an hour before the end, I thought the movie was over: loud, rising crossroads, grand flowing and finally silence, but then the movie continued! I found no real storyline, embellished writing, but smartly pressed uniforms and gorgeous gene simmons (pre-nose work) with an enthusiastic little ditty. I can not say that there is an element in this film that makes a movie awesome. I found it maudlin, shocking and minor.
