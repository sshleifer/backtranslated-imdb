A plastic white mask and a black overcoat killer is killing a friend of Hollywood producer Shaun Banning (Danny Wolks) who inherited his position when someone opened his former employer from the crotch to the chest. Perhaps Sycopath is a newly recruited mercenary Maddy (Debbie Rokon), an attractive, beauty of the cow's head, with a sad family past, nightmares. Sean and his friends play a useful joke on Madrid, starting with a Marade Club, where each member is found to be killed free. Because of this person entering the car, Madi accidentally kills a woman in a parking garage, seeing that Shaun's companion is shaking his chain. However, Shaun and his colleagues are worried about being admitted to Madrid's assassination and paying attention to proper authorities. When deciding to wait for a specific decision, each member hunts a white-masked psycho with Madrid, who suspects that he has already died. Or, anyone behind this murder? Four budget slashers, executed by Charles Band, failed to convince that assassination of Gore. A lot of the display and the Allen Nabers stupid character can entertain Chris with low expectations. In the murder, a stomach opened with a gut, a throat cut, an electric cord was thrown into a pond, which ran around the house to surround a female predator, buried behind the back of an ax male, and on top of it, a couple During their sexual climax the time is strangled by a rope. (For the associated effect, the killer uses a socket wrench break times Ray wrapping the rope snapping their neck as much as possible additional leverage for turning the rope). There are enough plots to run a truck, such as the mad nightmare of the nightmare due to which he did not do anything, he can kill so seriously (with blood on it) waking up in his bed without any thing, the crime scene can easily illustrate him and how He could go so long, despite what he had said about the assassination, he allowed the company to continue , And continual desire to join the supposed club. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, how did I say, what did I do? The film has made the entire madness as a possible psychology due to the past. His family ignored him for an abortion. He has black-out and is always properly visible in the visible winds of the scene after the crime. Most slashhers seem to probably most likely killer, perhaps most likely to be the red deer, but this film goes from the way to point finger at Maddy. When the twist happens, we have left the rooting for Maddy, yet we know he's not right in the head. It's a tough sale to care for this chick. Although he looks great on a man's army shirt. And, Rokon is not afraid to breathe his dogs. Low budget horror fans pretend to be a rookie fan favorite Brink Stevens, like a religious curiosity mother who pretends against what Moody's has done, a murderer considered to be a favorite tromma producer, Lloyd Cauffman, who did not get a word, wise to protect her daughter Careful of him. Cult siren Julie Stryn is a small cameo, showing her tits (of course) the murdered male girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer. Oh, check out the office that works in Shawon, you can see the whole moon poster and art work, across the wall.
