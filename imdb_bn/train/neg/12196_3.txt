The actors have done a really good job of keeping their role - especially the mom. However, after the progress of the movie, I have seen that I do not see more because of their performance and because I'm taking care of at least for the people. And, occasionally, I feel overwhelmed by parenting unnecessary and hands-off methods shown repeatedly. She is a 17-year-old shallow scank, whose main goal is to make the bed being famous men and dancers (complete with lots of "looting"). The boy is self-surrendering, which seems very frustrating for the relationship and friends - he has now thrown a drug party late in the film. Both husband and wife are indifferent, but instead of establishing power in their previous relationships, new partners should be searched (though the wife chooses to be poorly, just as a male "throws" to be gay, Oops!). I felt that all the characters became bigger and had such a difficult time in the care of shallow blurred. I think the author's efforts were to show the stupidity and atrocities of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are not typical of the average western family, it seems ugly.
