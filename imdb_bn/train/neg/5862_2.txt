One person should answer the question "Why does not anyone remember this movie?" This is really because in 1978 many people did not see it and it was not shown much on TV. (If it is news to me in the video then!) In the era of sometimes stupid comedies in the 70's, there was a reminder of the movie-goers to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Krystal, Paul Linde or Joan River "that"! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun than "Behavior" or "Hollywood Square" here. During this period, the Juan rivers were making a brutal joke about the lack of weight of singer Karen Kerner. Rate-rate youth! It seems like since the era is cast from each "somewhat" famous name. (Most surprising is "Avarbeed Remand Loves" after Doris Roberts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> A male friend is set up with Hooker with the help of the Crystal, eventually losing his virginity, but he was "at the top" instead, so she became pregnant! (A comment on women about power position from women <br /> <br /> Crystal stomach increases, all women Velocity and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now misunderstood socially! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can make a hole (God knows only that it can get out!)! It turns out to be a girl (no shock here)! <br /> <br /> There is nothing other disgusting about this movie and forget A, humor high school level or less. <br /> <br /> 2 good ideas and some for better touch and contextual moments. / Billy Crystal Ignore the rest of the Robot Test, it's a big time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe Roddy McDowell signed in!
