It is obvious that the good reviews posted for this film are so intuitive that those who were involved in this film or anyone else was aware of it and thus they saw more than one shot. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I saw the final cut, and it's pure garbage. What's going on for this is ambition from horror legends and multiple kiosks (there is no one on screen for a long time). It seems that filmmakers made the film a weekend during the convention on a weekend and acted in film scenes during their coffee breaks, such as Tony Todd, Tom Sawney, David Hesse and Michael Breathman. It plays with an extremely cheaper, shot-on-video wannabe X-files, with actors acting, which is not acceptable over the 21st century. There is little or no action; It is a fairly explanatory conversation that tries to explain an unmatched convoluted plot. Your computer FX is a joke, but it is not enough and there is not enough action to make this movie enjoyable by MSST 3K. After speaking about 8 straight scenes, you will quickly reach the Fast-forward button and do not let go. Absolutely worthless
