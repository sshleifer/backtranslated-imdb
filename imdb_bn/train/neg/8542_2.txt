I'm working on my way through the collection of Chilling Classics 50 movie packs and some of the 17th film in the Witch's Mountain (El Monte de Las Bruce) set. <br /> <br /> There was nothing near this movie but all my attention. The plot was inconsistent. The conversation seemed improvised. The acting was poor. The characters were disrespectful. <br /> <br /> The best view is to start, an unpleasant woman who is driven to burn her bright girl. However, the only connection to this scene is the rest of the movie, the lead character Mario, who is the most difficult player ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was not effective at any stage. The music was very insensitive. The light was very dark, so that some scenes are almost completely black. It really is truly guardable - what else can I say?
