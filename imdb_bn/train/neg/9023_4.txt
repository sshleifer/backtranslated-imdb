I saw an anime but I'm not a die hard fan; And I do not read Monga. I say this because most of the critics of the film think about the background. I saw "St. John's Wart" and although it is not a stretch of imagination but it makes me choose "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, I saw this in the afternoon, and keep watching obsessive fighting. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow-watering scenes, autumn leaves in trees, and even the SGI eyes - royal. I like winds, clothes, even some scenes of war, but overall it was dust as dirt. It seems that somebody has accepted "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentioned that they star star lovers - and cast them into some "x men" for good measurements. Two characters divided Wolverine's power - a bear costume was his bird and the gray-haired man had the ability to heal himself. Then you have a girl who has a poisonous garment - toxic Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give this kind of fool? The poisonous girl shows you kisses on her legs. Man, it's some great power for you. And the other girl, this yellow dust could create a bug that she kept holding her hand. Another woman, beyond the stars one lover, has a hypnotic stare power. Wow, <br /> <br /> <br /> I've made it to the end of the film, it's fast moving, and I saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compared it to "Housing of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make that mistake. They can share the same conclusions, but there are similar matches. "Shanwi" is made by an amateur - other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie until it is 12 to 18 years old.
