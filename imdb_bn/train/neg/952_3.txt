Happy C is a waste of time and talent for everyone, including the celebrity viewers. Old-hat mistakes and wrong skandal plot lines are very forgiving. Very few people saw this movie for their plot. However, they were usually involved in some interesting miniature subplots here - not here. They were usually striking dance songs and exciting dance and interesting songs. Happy do not go boyfriend. And the female-led sheep-allen played the whole film as the second art, for which they wanted to play very early stars - and instead he was invited to carry the film, and could not do it. The Scottish local was destroyed. Usually missing the universal droll Scottish whimsy. Photography was pedestrians. Musical numbers were pedestrians. Caesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, apparently giving the chin because someone else was not part of it, the type of regular producer role by Walter Hubble and Adolf Manzu. David Niven is just fine, and David Niven can not make anyone like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you respect Nivens like me, then there is enough reason to waste 90 minutes in Happy C Lovely. If not, skip it.
