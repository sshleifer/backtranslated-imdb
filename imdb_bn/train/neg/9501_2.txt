This is the page of the "House of Exxcise", but most of the people have misled the movie with "Lisa and the Devil", which is ridiculously high interpretation of the movie, "Outside house". When "Lisa and the Devil" were shown in the movie festivals in the early '70s, it was an important success. The audience responds well to that gorgeous, gothic horror movie. Unfortunately it was a bit ahead of time, and it was considered very unusual and is not commercial for the widespread use. Any distributor will buy it. So the producer Alfredo Leon decided to edit 'Lisa' with Chainov, adding nearly half of the original film, perhaps two years after the original words; It is important that this new, harmful additions did not have a slight relation to Bawaab, so technically the "Oxygen house" is not Bava film. The main product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. For a few minutes in the movie, visitors have come out of this dream world, suddenly we can see Lisa, (two years old, and with very different hair), starting writing on the ground, creating guttural words and trembling thoughts "with me" Etc. fine, huh? And this film continues, a beautiful, visual film and a grade Z "Exorcist" jumps behind in the rip-off. Lyon is trying to include these shock scenes, although the story has a bit similarity. He sadly failed. When it was primarily chosen to destroy "Lisa and Satan", then Bawa himself denied that his film cut was very nice. He was right, and it was certainly sad to destroy this artist for all his work and to pour the toilet. Many years before the original "Lisa and the Devil" came again, late night television was re-sponsored. I've seen this new version long ago "Lisa", and one of my favorite films was "annoyed" and it was annoying to be boring. Curiosity sector is only worth seeing. Otherwise avoid this disguised disaster like the plague.
