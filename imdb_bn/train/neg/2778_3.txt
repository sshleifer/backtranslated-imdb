This movie seems to be going well with it's camera, sound, movie, set, music, clothing ... but drum-roll, Gary Strachch spoke! I do not know whether it was his poor performance or just a bad script, but both of them say so. Considering its casting in this introduction, I find it hard to root even for so long. I got killed in battle or by snatching a knife / knife. <br /> <br /> There was a king at the gate of the plot to kill Raja, because the king did not have food with him. Queen? Beautiful lam. And with the utmost efforts to kill his own son? And then pushed his boyfriend as the king pushed? I could see a thread or two in the historical byte here and there, but the way it was presented was very rogue. <br /> <br /> I could not recognize Gary Strech from anything else, but she was terrible. I read another user's comments about audio dubbed, but I do not think he has been dubbed ... after all, he speaks in English, is not he? It was really awful. Lines read on the right side of the corner table ... flat-line. It just does not have the voice to carry tone reduction. In addition to <br /> <br />, I saw it at the end, so the movie had at least one "interest." It may be more if the script / line and casting has been given more work. Scenery and filming crew have made this film as well as everything else in addition to very good quality films. Cast and stories were all secondary. I give the film crew a 10.
