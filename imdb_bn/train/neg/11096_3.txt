I had high expectations for this movie, because I thought that Chaven (the first feature of Karingun) was absolutely horrible, I definitely saw the movie of low budget movie. <br /> <br /> But most clay lending is completely vain and flat. The scene seems to be randomly mixed after the scene, without much thought for the story or the character. <br /> <br /> Is Clare trying to flee from prostitution? It is difficult to say. Why does he want to escape from that life, if he takes interest in the airport? Why does he need Seattle's money when he does not take the tricks? Why would he have to see his hair colorful? Why does Claire not accept some? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems like everything is fine (although I do not understand that this was not the case), and the filmmakers kept a camera on it so that they could have a real documentary <br /> <br /> After screening, I saw that Kyrgyzan defended the lack of stories because of his politically conservative criticism of the film. It sounded like an alphabet learned. I think it was a police force. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of being as cleaner as a filmmaker, Chaven will go ahead to create such a cripple film and then tired old "political" cliches.
