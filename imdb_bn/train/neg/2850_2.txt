If I could understand John Wayne in this movie, then I did not see it. It is unfortunate for Humans and insulting to embarrassing Japan for any thinking person. But then, most of the Wayne films are like this. In half, Hollywood still believes that everyone in the world loves Americans when it is true (and still) somewhat different. The film relates to the 19th-century separatism of Japan. Perhaps it should be isolated from the Hollywood. To put it as minimal as possible, this film displeases the junkystic clipper. (Arrange a magical butterfly with bad music.)
