I ask questions about the purpose of Bittoo Killer's purposes in this imaginary account maker. Are they trying to portray animal rights activist as a sick monster? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think that the people involved in this monster are doing enough harm? How shameful the exploitation and exploitation of the victim! It was like a personality test: Do you disturbs more, slaughterhouse or human killing? They used the actual name of some hunting ... this movie was terrible, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie use this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up line!
