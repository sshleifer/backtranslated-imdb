Alan Rudolph has shown us that he was one of what he really wanted from Hollywood, after four years of making his debut with Art-House Snazer "Welcome-LAA". "Rodei" is Berthum's Cat, Horny Herpes, Art Sweephed Wheelchairs, Carney and Wheat Dung. Meat Luff (playing Travis W. Redfish!) Can actually be rather a charming presence on the screen, and perhaps a small role (in a good movie), but he may be really hungry, but the fakeman's script is stereotypical radically humorous and helpless. The meat of the flesh is in great eyes and the mind is stupid. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbusson, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blanchey all appear - and everyone feels shy. They must, of course, make a bad trip to "Roadie". **** No Star
