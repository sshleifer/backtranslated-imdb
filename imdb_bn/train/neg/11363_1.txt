This movie is advertised in almost every hour or on every advertisement in radio, television, magazines etc. So when we went to Kippipolis Multiplex, we had a lot of expectations. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! This is a movie about a movie about a Hollywood-style movie in a movie. Shades look so clear that we are not ready to make 'big Hollywood movies'. I'm a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. My subject line says, it's nothing, and then looped. You can see in addition to watching television as well as anything else. We had feelings when we saw the shade. Shade is a bad product !!!
