The original Boogeyman was a stupid but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. It's not a great movie, but it's funny about the right mind. The third installment of this series, on the other hand, Boogman's return is simply frustrating. It consists of two things. First, the cheap and secluded new footage. Second, load the recycled bit from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateurish but in an amusingly unreasonable way, is incredibly tiring. These footage have been clearly knocked together and without any effort. It acts as a framing device for continuous clips of first (and possibly second) movies. And boy, they milk those clips from previous films; Sometimes reusing the order again over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that stupefily describes what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of this visit is really sad. <br /> <br /> Boogman's return is one of the worst types of exploitation of Flickr; That kind of exploits the audience in a highly cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and in point as the film is no longer eligible. There is nothing worth the price here. This is worthless
