I'm convinced of an epic epic of the American Revolutionary War. It's not (And in that case, was not Emmrich / Devlin / Gibson Patriot.) But I digress. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie coming out in the old MGM Studios (now Sony) on the screening of the promotion. Visitors had high expectations in this expensive time piece written by respectable Hugh Hudson (character of Fire Fame) and veteran Robert Dillon starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it was not accepted that the foolish comments about Casino's grim misunderstanding were long-awaited to the people of the Scottish generation (!) - and Nastasja Kinski, a member of the American border, to start tremendously trembling Should England be repatriated (!!) Then the story started and it all went downstairs. <br /> <br /> The motivations were lost, the dialogue was harmful, there was no historical or political context of the events. What was strange is the fact that the plot ahead was a plot; For the second or third time, the alleged lover Posino and Kisksky pushed each other, it became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer / pederast. His pronunciation was very much on the map. I guess no English actor was found. <br /> <br /> Many people left Those who were stiffly stabbed, then gighed. I figured that at least the fight scenario might be good - I stuck in it. I was roasted. Undoubtedly, Hudson did not like to have a camera caught in their hand, even to draw pictures with stadicams, which gave New Zealand the "authenticity" in a wrong place, which would destroy the scal value. <br /> <br /> there was a semi-famous TV review. A few rows in front of the audience: Channel 7 Eyewitness News (late) Gary Franklin. I can say he was overwhelmed by the rest of our behavior. And, of course, on the next day in his TV segment, he gave the film '10' on his infamous Franklin scale 1 to 10, when he clearly commented on the lounging rooms that had been blocking the screening at night, who clearly did see it when the industry did not know it. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Passino has not played any other film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career was not restored. I can not tell you I warn you
