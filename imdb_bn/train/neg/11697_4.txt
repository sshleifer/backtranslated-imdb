I am a king who does not think of a great writer, I am not even among him, his books have good confusion for several hours and often have interesting places, but in my opinion, if you think of them seriously then they are very different. <<br /> <br /> This picture refrains from reusing very well about King's story If you have read the book, there is zero ambiguity, no change, no change in scenes or characters. This is a film created by King Fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it's a 'Gypsy Curse', it's a curse on some people who want to curse, thin, The final third has some serious structural problems, and a little compulsory termination seems to break the rules. <br /> <br /> There is a more bad way to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you can also be good to read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
