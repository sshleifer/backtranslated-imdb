This movie is a complete shit! To avoid all costs at this cost of celluloid, it is rambling and intrinsic. I am proud to flood the Salna kitty from 70 to the depth of the 70's sled movie. I want to be frustrated, but I need a consistent story. However, if you see the horse mate, then this image closes you. The most tragic part is the Wang Wang of the Language Waiver Suit. I mean that it is very hard to sit on, the role is not significant and the soundtrack is poorly dubbed. Please, I know the cover is interesting (no gorilla hand feels like reaching for a woman's bare ass) but do not waste your time or money because you will not get back.
