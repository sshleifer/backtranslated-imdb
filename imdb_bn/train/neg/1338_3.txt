I have seen the switching target .. Tvs .... and always feel the same feeling ... You watched Olsen twins making the same movie .... They like to play different games and love boys. Now about this movie .... First All young boys and girls will not play such a big goal ... 2. Can not play on football timing ... 3. If the game ends, the referee gives some extra time (one minute or more ) ... and finish is so foreseeable .... I think this movie is bad because of lack of football knowledge. ... if it is done by European producers, it will be better. Mann actors are also not like favorites ... they are suffering due to real lack. They have played some seasons throughout the house but they do not make them big ... You have to show your talent. ... and the woolen twins that are missing
