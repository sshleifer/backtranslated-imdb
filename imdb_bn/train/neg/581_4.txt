Before I go I must admit to be a huge forest Jovi fan. In fact, what has actually attracted me in the DVD field is the first place. I probably liked it so much to be a big fan and enjoyed the first vampire title. <br /> <br /> But it's not half good. Even John could not save this film for me. My main problem is that it will not be simply scary. Apart from Derek Bliss's character, John does not make any impression on any character, and you can not take care of whether you have died, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict. The female vampire is not only fearful or sexy. Then she feels 14-year-old daughter unnecessarily, then she is so frustrated for blood. Another big problem is that everything is "very bright". Have no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires in New Mexico were not right to set up in the Zamindar region of imagination, but it was still able to get dark and undone. There is no excitement in this picture. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Berzier's Cross wants to be able to walk in the vampire darklight. But this time there are fewer cold bits in the story. The original vampire like the first movie - Master of all these masters it is not an intelligent carrier. You really do not care who these or what to do. The master has no army. Instead he is hiding in some old ruins that looks more like a wonderful temple like a Disneyland attraction. <br /> <br /> So you have it really. Fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of funny stories. Let's give a real down for me.
