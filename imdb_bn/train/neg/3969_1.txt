I'm writing this because I believe that Dark Rainnes was a good film. I found it is not the worst, it is certainly not good. <br /> <br /> A weak script, poor actor, and weak instructions. Even if they can not afford big names, then will the more serious lead actress be asked? It was painful to see a plain actress through film out with her ruthless performance. The story was a clich√© and bad scripted. Special effects were minimal. The "mysterious" techniques were difficult to recruit repetitive here. <br /> <br /> To be justified, Dark Unrealistic is not worse than some terrific Masters' episode. But still not equivalent to quality movies. Dark residues are recommended only for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss a movie in this film, even though it is a weak creature. For somebody else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
