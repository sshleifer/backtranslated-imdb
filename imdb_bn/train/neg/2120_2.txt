I feel quite annoying myself, especially when I see a great touch and tear-jaric movie. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it also surprised me how many people in this movie have appreciated. <br /> <br /> There are various dangerous incidents throughout the film: 1. The real motive of humble Ben, despite the crime to save 7 lives to free his past, I feel encouraged by such a suicidal move that it is boring. Some people may feel this heroic action and others think that they behave terribly, ultimately it is an annoying step for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The story line of the film is more dramatic, but the argument is very simplistic. Medical type, blood type match must be organ donor. At the end of the film we learned that Emily had a blood type behind, which limited her opportunity to get donors in a short time. Despite this, it seems that the rare form of Ben's blood was like him, which he donated easily, despite the donor's blood type, despite the blood type, he was not only able to donate his heart, but also his kidneys, his cornea and his bone marrow, in which case only Blood type does not match but requires tissue antigen <br /> <br /> 3 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, however, some of the annoying facts mentioned above are to reconsider your plan to see this movie. Will help. If you go for a soap opera type movie, go for it. But you are seeking for an intelligent entertainment, this one miss!
