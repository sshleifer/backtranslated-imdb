I think I'm not bowling so much at the stupidity of my whole life movie since I was when I came out of this shit. It does not understand anything. It is thought to be tricky or good to anyone. Due to the lack of true suspicious moments, they repeatedly use the total cop-out technique where before you create the music, the character opens a door or shocks the screen and then there is nothing left. She has to do just once, but I did count three times. There are no apparent reasons, characters, cast to cast for half-story story formed in half .... the letters were not well developed at all. The last was .. bad. Bad, bad, bad, everything, every element of this element is terrible. And I just warn you all that you are here.
