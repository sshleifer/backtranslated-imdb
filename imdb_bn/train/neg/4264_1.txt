This movie makes me undoubtedly hard-down. It was a great idea which was destroyed with a terrible script. The story just did not flow and was well disjointed. There were not many elements of this story that were not explained, or were moved beyond any real thought. Elements like the story of love can be further elaborated, and the canons will be written more correctly. The whole original character needs more about the training of objectionable and less standing around it. Everyone likes the "little man enjoys" the story and this promise, but the scripting failures are not. In the continuation of the final war, it had some pyrotechnics, although it was unthinkable due to the lack of dancing industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
