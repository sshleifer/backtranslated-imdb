I'll tell you what happened, some people with money would love to destroy one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need to recreate a larger screen? They asked fans? I'm surprised that all fans recreate "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors of "Aston Crucher", Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Keeffer Southhallland, but all the music feels, brings out all the songs, and it creates a play. Do you think they want! The film does not seem to be the same. In fact, the original was a bit less, but Bose and Luke were always good, they were in trouble because they were always ready for trouble, and their main purpose was to help the people passing through the city. It is not important to anyone who makes this movie, but they have not even seen the main event ever. My big question is, will they destroy later?
