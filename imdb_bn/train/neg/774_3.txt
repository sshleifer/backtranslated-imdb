Some of these films have been made with some good ideas but they have not made any films before and they did not think that a script should not be edited even fun. When I saw this movie, I found John Candy and mistakenly thought that it would be ridiculous. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so flat, illogical moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some crudest lines that I've heard until that time. So, despite a potentially funny story and story idea, we are with an amateur and crude film, which is probably too stupid for the average adult, although thirteen probably get some smiles. It's really a shame - it can be a lot better. That is, it was nice with Eugene Levi, Joe Flawworthy and John K.
