I just signed this movie to comment on how stupid silly the movie is. Apart from the rip off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other type of terrorist story, it is a movie that admits you to watch a movie that can take the same basic ideas and it does well. It is difficult to blame the actors when such stupid, clich-rayed scripts are given to work with them. When you're crying once again in the movie with your intelligent humiliation, it's bad. However, when you cry yourself and again, you must decide that the director is not the brightest bulb in the film business, nor is the producer ready to make the story in the first story. Most lo-rental actors can apologize for accepting this appointment, because they have apparently shown to get money and exposure, as part of this joke-off-movie, they will not earn any rewards or money. Recognition Being involved with such a damaged person may be embarrassing for such poor judgment. I do not see any point in the plot summary or even giving an example to prove my case, it would be a cruel and unusual punishment to do that nobody involved in this frustration can resist. Just like studying well-crafted films, how can you inspire a good, efficiently integrated work of art and beauty, not only what you can learn from seeing this nudity and what does not work! Caution
