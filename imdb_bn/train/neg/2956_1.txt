What did he think File: HiPi Goldberg plays a police in the future, who is involved in a dinosaur (!) Criminal involved, who is involved in a crazy who wants to start another ice age. The straight-to-tape curiosity is frustrating and ridiculous, it is a high-key find. Apparently it was the labor of love for its writer-director, Jonathan Betweil (who also worked as a producer); Sadly, the end result is immune to charity. Goldberg's on-screen copy can often outperform good wishes and laughs, even though the script is poor, but here it is sinking and you can see obscure results. **** No Star
