Well, ear ornamentation might have liked this picture but I was not afraid. If you like a movie where the shots are so long that you think the actor is asleep or the cameraman has gone for lunch, it might be for you. A major part of this is with such little shortage of unpleasantness. I found some other critics as annoying to find it frustrating - simply a little obsolete and unmatched. The only reason I do not congratulate this star is that the complimentary answer shot the film quite well. The plot, however, has a little recommendation. A large part of the film only shows a scary woman to teach or listen to piano, which can appeal to some people. But if you feel that it's not harmful to you, it's time to wake up with a bad taste in your face, ready to print some of pornography and sexual abuse. Not recommended.
