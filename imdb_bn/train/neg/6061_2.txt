This installment of Horse Masters was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter has to learn some or two things about pacing and decent, potential dialogue. For some incidents, I screamed loudly on TV. Maybe he thinks he is making suspense, but the carnter needs to move him and his (or his son's) overdone, back to the simplest musical score and move a few steps. How many times did the girl say, "Oh no, I do not have this baby!" And "oh, does not it come here"? The processor accepts elements from many elements, many good movies (attacks on the East 13 and Things) and throws them here to acknowledge and appreciate their trademark style. Here's the priceless mystery and power lacking here. It seems that he is trying to sleep through the process of making the movie. <br /> <br /> For better costter movies, try and stay with real classics - Things, Halloween and they live. For the good master of the horror episode, see my personal preferences: Family, Genf and Dames Weigh House.
