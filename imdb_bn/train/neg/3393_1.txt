If your lover is in a romantic mood, then let it be the boy. But if you come on the radio then prepare yourself to bring your HP. <br /> <br /> After seeing a good movie like Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what comes again in Indonesia. It seems that making money is the only idea, but no one really thinks to work in the entertainment industry in the world of entertainment. It does not make people who make films in a 'global' world Indonesia. And since the Indonesian people presented to them have been 'pursued' by 'chasing' as 'made in Indonesia', they went away with it. <br /> <br /> Well, starting the story is good. And it can be improved in a nice flick. But the director never thought about the fact that any music needs all live music or at least good playback and secondly good danceography? In this movie, Playback SA BAD is that it wants you to cry there in the movie. If you listen to any single word, the actor or anyone who sits playback goes after a few seconds and it is very annoying to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The picture is planned to create a movie about Gymnastics in the morning, but ultimately it would be better to turn it into a musical instrument ... they just forgot to change danceography. It's rare to dance to see, they jump over here, throw their legs in the air, and it's about him. <br /> <br /> Well, at least happy is ending ... but if a beautiful candle dinner is so romantic that your girlfriend can not satisfy it!
