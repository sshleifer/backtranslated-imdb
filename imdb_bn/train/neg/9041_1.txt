I liked the film despite the frenzied speed it. However, I did not appreciate Canada's comment on Montana's answer. It definitely will not be answered in Montana and not. Americans wonder why they are perceived as overwhelming in the world, and that is why one is the reason. They consider this planet to teach America's children. Such a central world scene is not becoming one of the great nations of the world. Even in quarrels. I will not mention the United States as 'Alberta South'. Walt will not let us down, so why start now Other than this film was quite stupid, good luck next time.
