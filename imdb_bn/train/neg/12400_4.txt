Matt Cordell returned for the third time from the dead for a cow-round, although I'm not sure that this one is taking care of this, except for these amazing Maniko COP fans. The cordel that died in the last storm has been resurrected through Pudu, and now a co-worker is very hot in search of some harmful people involved in the shooting of Cordell. I did not miss the speed of this early '90 budget, but Cordell was delighted to see the breakdown of body count in a variety of dangerous ways. The problem is that the overall film is quite stable and the Cordel is not just Jason or Freddy. The interest wanes very quickly, even with that end up with a doctor who is scratched his brain with Grand B-Movie Master Robert Forster. Stuck with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
