I think John Rambo has taken his life and trying to throw Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. Sometimes he is dead to somebody else. There was not a fun place in Vietnam and I was tired of Hollywood's Hollywood looks like it was. It's not the worst of these Vietnam-related films, this honor is to John Wayne Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo is taking a 50-kilo-machine machine with more than half of the Congress's congressional and insulting to see the better Russians. What's worse than the end of the Rambo chess speech ... please !! Oh yes i heard they are making another one ...
