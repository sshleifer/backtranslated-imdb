The problems of this movie are many, but I will try to mention some of the most gladdening and annoying things. First of all, the theme proposes a few Vintet's lives in Manhattan, the reality is that everything like movies and TVs is something weird like sexual nature. The lines of the story were thin or strangely, and virtually every scene, camera shot, dialogue line, and emotions were pure, and completely fake. Finally, it seemed to me in the mind that after one week, I felt like a garbage that was not extraordinary for me in recent years. I guess some Wangby was driven out of Outer Dropping Out from the Film Studies program at the 3rd rate of the final. But I believe (at one time, pre-amelia, talented) director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting debate, perhaps the genius genius in the United States has become a soldier.
