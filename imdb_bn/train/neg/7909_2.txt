Incredible! <br /> <br /> This image gets 7 out of 0f 10. One of the worst movies I've seen in these years. Just did not play incredibly bad, storyline (just as you can call it) was just as bad. Everyone knows what will happen in the first five minutes. You can fascinate the audience while you move forward, which is not a bad thing. That is not the case, however. No action, no mystery, even 2 leading actors is not a fantastic one. It was unfortunately a waste of my time, and of course my money was a waste. <br /> <br /> to try again 2
