I needed to watch the film for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I paid out), but I still found the film to suck much more than the average. Jokes Lum, two main actresses ... Well, to use the "First Lady Club" section of Hollywood's women ages, they did not have much in their "hot chick" age and their "district attorney" age I was most upset about the movie, the original plot line, "Bevas and Butt da America" ​​(which suggests all of the boys' money to pay their money to pay their wife ") 'expected to be killed' All in all, a soft piece of shit.
