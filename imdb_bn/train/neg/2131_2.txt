I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (this picture was touted) but this one miserably failed. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I'm sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomomi and Hillary Duff to get involved with this movie. I will keep a fan of them all but only at the same time I can cure this feeling. One of the things I can say positively about the film is that the character of Hilary Zionic did so well that I could not even recognize Hillary; It took me a few scenes to understand that it was me. Thankfully, I paid $ 1 for the red box; I was paying to see it on the big screen, I would really be fuming !!
