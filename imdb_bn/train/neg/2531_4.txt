Title song for this movie ... ... the greatest free spirit song ever! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie in 1978-79 when I first subscribed to the cable. In 1979 only the house started to be a common place. (Or at least when it became common in Missouri). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Changed ........ My new cable subscription found a free month of my "The Star Channel". "The Van" was one of the films that were heavy rolling over at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie again, and it seems like it is a general gloom (along the same lines) the misery of other medium budgets ... ... where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I have completely forgotten that this film was not even existent until I did not see it after watching it in a decade (I found a copy of it in the DVD for sale at the cheap bine) I recognized it, and only We bought it for 4.99 dollars. <br /> <br /> I think I think this movie is a lot better). But after seeing it again was a different experience (30+ years later) than now. <br /> <br /> The kids had a fun van (often all at the same time), having fun with Rock N Roll music, smoking, smoking and having sex behind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In return for the purchase of Dodge Van (with a carpet wall, a rectangular ceiling and a water bed in it), his attention has to be drawn, and finally he has sex with her. But his arch rival came out and came to look for him (so that the two could fix their differences through racing their wings) .... He and his arch rivals destroy both of them and steal instead of his arch rival girlfriend, he The preppy (less attractive) winner on the girl's heart is that she is mostly half / ass date through the movie and she Khi / well off and decided to end the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun moments in it. But after 30+ years of watching this movie, it becomes a trip down memory lane. Because I can still remember Pijor Parlor, Pinball Arkadis, it reminds me of the memories of cruising around a small town when we used to smoke, we screamed at the girls looking for good and wanted to get the body (sometimes I'll be lucky and some decent girl with me For joint sharing and we used to sit behind the back, I think many songs in this move (when they were new) In this movie, the movie has been working as a perfect time capsule for the era (many memories are brought back) <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie which I really I can not remember ... I never remember when a full-size van was described by the film as popular. I think that era is very good, and I was not going around the youth than the van. Instead At the age of 70, young men (including themselves) think Pontiac Trans Mango, Chevy Camaro or Hot Rod Ford Mustang, but there is never a van. The film seems to be the most popular item of the van and every young man who wanted one Was not true of the era)
