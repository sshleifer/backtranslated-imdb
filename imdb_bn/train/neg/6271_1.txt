No words to explain how bad Nightmare Weekend is. It only defies the description A computer that can transform some private objects into silver balls, which enters the mouth of the hunters, which they kill or turn into jumbo. The whole thing is so damn that it is stunning. There is a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer's conversation via the doll's hand !!!!!!!! I'm not up this stuff The computer also controls things like a car, although there is nothing to link to the computer with the car. <br /> <br /> "Film" total trash. The supernatural bad trash. Visually, one type of bad trash There are many sex scenes thrown here and there, which are not too hot or erotic. There is also a scene where a woman loves to be liked or French wants to kiss a tantulum, which makes me wander around the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies. Equally hateful direct-to-home video boarding house, or Bozianman II (Nightmare Weekend and Bojmanman II, both in the scene of a killer toothbrush!) At least try to sense it's fun and whatever's going on.
