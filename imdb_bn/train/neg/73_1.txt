<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> She looked distorted. I want that he and Naomi Watts have an item in the real life because I spent a long two hours in his life and saw what he saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is heartwarming? Seeing his face with shiny beard and deer-in-headlights, I can not say that I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual imaginary soul, but Geoffrey Rush thought that she could not wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Am I feeling sorry for the banker and the killers? It cries a lot from the Butcher Cache, which was actually an entertainment film. This trite was cliche-ridden and annoying. We are only because we believe it will be better. It did not. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes was strangely unknown. Heath and his gang are hiding in a border hotel and due to their presence women and children are going to die. It's not funny. But when they came out of the hotel with armor, it was fun, because we could have thought of Monty Python and Holly Grill's Black Knight. I'm not saying "I'll close the yard leg!" We were shouting with laughter, as the audience was as different as other warped members. When we left, most of the people were talking about wasting time for this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not pay the cash to visit this disaster, but it was not free. Two hours of my life will not return to me again.
