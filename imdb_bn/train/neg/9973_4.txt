"Problem Child" is one of the most proud movies ever made. This is not the worst (although some people disagree with me), but this is not the best. This is a devil 7 year old boy, who has destroyed the joke in the silly couple (John Ritter, Emmy Yasechke), who took him to falsely. This picture is very stupid and incredible because I can not buy for a second that the child can work unwantedly as a child in this movie. Although I smile several times (although I do not really know why) it is helpless and annoying. But I can not recommend this photo. I know that I am very kind. A positive thing about "problem children" if it was better than just a junky sigail. <br /> <br /> ** (Four out)
