I do not know where to start, so I'll start with a snippet from behind the cover of this movie. "Alive consolidates the density of Vinsenjo Nataly with its own version of Kitamura." I did not see the version, so I can not comment on it, but I think the Cube is a wonderful movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case someone clearly confused "tension" with "resentment". <br /> <br /> I'll just go ahead and loot the whole plot, in addition to a pure Swiss cheese in the plot, it is also incalable cheese and the film is not worth spending any time, even if you do not know the plot before but it does not matter. If I misunderstood the plot, do not hurt me - it's probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyes open. <br /> <br /> Nevada, once the US military, lost the street number in Umbau. This apparently makes sense because they are both desert so they are practically the same place. Different continents or not A monkey broke into the UFO and earned an alien resident sending Japanese researchers feeding monkeys to live in the desert. Anyway. Nuclear thing is now passed enough to kill anyone presently "bloodthirsty" host. Japanese military wants to use it for military elements, so they decided to pass it to the other host from current host (the daughter of the researcher). But instead of selecting some of the military forces, those who are bloody and already admitted to the military, they decide that instead of choosing criminals out of execution is perhaps a good idea. Oh, and they chose this particular offender from the death penalty because the first person in history was not to die from irrational electric shocks, which died due to the standard execution procedure, because they died from the influence of Playboy after they were transferred to the electricity station. I do not know if they do this, how they die, even they do not die, even if they want to spend electricity bills, they can roam in the staff room. <br /> <br /> Then what would happen if the film is really light and the undeclared war tears to feel like our hour. And oh wait, now they remember that they already had a father who was infected with an ordinary thing, so the whole film was a waste of time all the time and the human life. Then everyone died. Last <br /> <br /> The only moment in this movie where I did not want to sleep or eat a sandwich, a sister pushed her chest to a wall with a pipe. , And he is hanging around there and walks by another dude. The wall hanging is saying "I'm hurt, shoot me". And the living town looks at him, and it is not that he is a middle class or something else, so he feels really sad and he does not want to suffer from the wall. So he shot him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Thanksgiving is a FREAKIN 'HEAP."
