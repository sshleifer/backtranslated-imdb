Hee Hee Hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide it even big time. I think the first day I saw on MSST. The sun was shining, looked like a good day. Then, I saw this product in Ric Sloan, which included the horrible plush dolls, the harmful destruction on the 80th of the festive season. Kevin, the helpless superstar, tries to influence his girlfriend, assists the security guard in the job, fights on the rack, and puts a lot of luggage in the series, making it very badly shot. No plot or story is needed. Clearly no acting required as the film proves. An army guy and his sexually disguised daughter want to skip you from a mountain, and the Darkie friend who got the kick off of the phone will tell you, "She has some nice red shorts". Plus, I really hated old security guards and had an accident on her supercart cart. When you think it's over, wait for the Club Scam scene. Ask for the road rash. <br /> <br /> After watching this image, it is a good month to get back the sense and sanity. And if you see Rick Slayon, then give him a good kick to show Hogglins how much we appreciate this cropstreet.
