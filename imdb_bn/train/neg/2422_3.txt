Best ABC Family Film If You Ask Me If there was a low sex theme in the movie, then maybe it would be better. Hollywood is not doing anything to make a movie better by adding sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least it's a TV movie. I do not want to waste my money by hiring this trash. If you have to do anything other than watch this movie, please proceed to them.
