The lack of this movie ... everything: story, acting, surprise, consciousness and a soul. In fifteen minutes, I looked at the screen and said, "Do these people gather themselves and feel as friends (besides the girl)?" Another fifteen minutes, I was praying for Amanda Pitt as much as possible. When a bad movie quietly behind its ugly head, eye candy is a wonderful consolation. But not so much! All fronts cheated!
