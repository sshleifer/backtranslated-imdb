My hard statements about "Femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" films have been submitted to you and submitted! Now another species of frustrating reconsideration! Nija movie! Many of these have seen me before, and I tell you, they are not all that have been cracked! They usually do not stick to the point. This, among others, suffers from any fundamentality! Did you get a ninja against the resistance of Russia's nuclear holocaust? And this is not supposed to be a "martial art" movie, too? Do you have lots of gun words like an incredible action movie? This blood is the number one cause of death because of death? Do you waste some of your hard-working cash on a female singing at the top of his watch-tank? Answers to this important question are found in the Nizama Mission, which should be in the category of the martial arts of your video store. For even more nonsense Ninja fun, try to test those godfrey ho movies out by Trans World. You deserve what you get, and that's a promise! Just recommended for ninja adultery!
