I was quite frustrated with this Sci-Fi Flick. One thing, it's managed by Team Burton. Another thing, it's supposed to be a classic, what a remix is I found it boring, rough, and ridiculous. If you have seen it, you know what I know. Imdab is just telling everyone that it is bad and boy, all right! If you do not have to, avoid It's a snorer. 10 out of 1
