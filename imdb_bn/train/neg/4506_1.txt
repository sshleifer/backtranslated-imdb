American filmmakers decided to make a film in Japanese they think. All characters are badly presented, the actors are not even Japanese, and the set is not cheap, unrealistic and certainly does not represent Kyoto between the 20th and 30th centuries. Who will ever read the book, understand that the script writers did not add any additional value to separate the movie from the script. Bad, they even changed the original plot line with a few caves. Rob Marshall is using two famous characters, which are two well-known Chinese actors who hid trickling tigers. Marshall probably saw a Chinese movie and they represented Japanese culture. The two actors make the film more ridiculous once again. The Quinine Tarantino final bills # 1 is more than ten times the size of this movie.
