Why Code Name: Diamond Head It does not take long to put on the network schedule. Before the television pilot movie goes past, the credits are not as good as before, which are going fine. Maybe I missed something because the plot does not fully understand. Depending on what I got from the worst world, a terrorist or a thief or some "tree" (Ian McShenen) went to Hawaii to steal something with secret weapons. The most cruel secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thins), is out to stop him. May have more, but believe me ?? It really does not matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Suspenseful moment should have the mystery. And dramatic moment drama must have. No one in the code number: Diamond Head. Did I see the term "turgid" used for this description made for TV snowser ?? And it's better to describe any one word that I can come up with. The characters are about to care for someone at least bit exciting or worth. And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leadership imaginable. A slug of his charisma is just a little answer. Ian McKenzan is going to be the best thing for a movie easily, but unfortunately for everyone else to get involved, he does not seem to be coming back as a regular cast member. Now if Maxson was thrown into a series lead, then you might have something. <br /> <br /> I'm quickly discovering that this Gaud created the Great Film Science Theater 3000 episode of the terrible 70-made TV made. And that was involved in Queen Martin that goes double. Very interesting material from Mike and Bots. So when I can only give the movie 3/10, I rate my MSST 3 on the rating scale to the # 608 at the rate of 4/5.
