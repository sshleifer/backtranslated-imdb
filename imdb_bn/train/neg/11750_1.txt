The person who wrote, guided and seen in this frustrating piece of trash would think he really cared. Yes Rob Stephanuke, I mean, you! Seriously, who is this bank fund? There are many gifted writers whose money can be spent. I think the idea is great, but acting, scripts and directions are just horrible! The joke is not so funny, I realize that they can take Mickey. But to do it with style, this movie is shouting live skits on Saturday night in 1995. Why, I again say why the studs mean hacks like Rob Stefaniewicq - no comrades are allowed to directly and star in their own movies. Duh!
