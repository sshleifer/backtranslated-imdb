Fraudulent advertisements ... I saw a commercial for the Carlitos Way: Rise to Power, that says "From the promotion of Scarfus and Carlito" it can comply ... Michael Bergman did not create a squarefire, he was actually doing 'room assistant editing' for Scarface . Do not move away from Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he must have a little more classes. I think when I say that I can speak for the people ... we despise shamelessly lying. As far as the movie is playing, it was the best of the poor. I think Puff's parents have done well. However, Louis Guzman will be ashamed to work on this movie. Overall, this film did a good job by filling empty spaces for Carlito's waiver. It is obvious that this project was an effort to create a good film instead of a faster film.
