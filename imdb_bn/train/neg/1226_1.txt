My, how the Almighty has fallen. Kim Basing is a great actress, but when he took the role, he was definitely disappointed. This movie is particularly bad for one reason: Logic involved. In all the films that came out of the 80's and the 90's, it was visible as a movie that could be portable with all the holes in its plot, but in 2008 it looked only stupid. It's the worst thriller I've seen and I saw bone collectors and twisted. <br /> <br /> The details of the story luff (Kim Basing) are just going to get from buying a mall gift, a gang of thugs that comes to her with a police that ends up killing her. Then he was followed by an isolated gangster through an isolated road and he got rid of it with a full toolbar full of tools. <br /> <br /> A lot of things are wrong with this movie. I said that the film is associated with logic at every moment and without the exception of Kim Basing, the production-made-TV is bad. Hell, the TV is bad for making this pseudo thriller. The way he has killed every politically correct lip (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American are all coming together to stash a Caucasian woman.) Do you not love America?) Is ridiculous for a blame. The way he killed the Hispanic guy smiled me hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so much on the left ground that it shred you off your head shamefully. I only recommend lovers of bad films this and anyone else Others, especially Kim Basing fans, will not take this flicker themselves. Do not you want to see an actress that you respect in this movie, which is bad now? Of course not. You were cautious.
