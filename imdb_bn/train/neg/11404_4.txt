It is very impressive to me that many critics consider this a wonderful composition. I'm not as silent as I go to quality movies, and I agree that from the point of view of tech filming, as well as to portray different characters, the film is in a rewarding category. But this film does not really have any idea (for me); I have been watching the audience everywhere. This is a series of mood scenes, probably as great, but I want more from a movie. I look at the story and the perfection and the perfection of the arrival, I could not find what was in this movie. Yes, it can be considered a poem in the film. . . But there are many poems I can not live with the same poem: It can draw pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is a mid-century English childhood, which necessarily limits its universality. At that time and place, I was personally concerned about how a young British boy had to live. Just after becoming big in America a decade ago, I can officially say that discrimination is infinite. I can not surprise whether this discrimination has some impact on the film's review. In other words, the film may have the tendency to fully judge its 'filmmaking' (which I accept) and completely ignore the lack of relevance of the nature of its true expected experience?
