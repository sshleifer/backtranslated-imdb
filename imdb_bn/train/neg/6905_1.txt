Clich√©d Polynesian men drink, fight and sex, create a stream of stupid and illogical comments. The real life polynesians are so stereotyped, much fun than the cardboard characters. It is believed that Samoan girl does not see Samoan or does not act, like the stock white girl, who had some sex with someone. With the weakness of the water story lines you can not say anything about acting - even the most brilliant actors can not even do anything with these movies. Polynesian actors wish to use such a sad scene in such a sad scene and only two or three 'jokes' in a movie. What is the meaning of Qi Corporation, what is the opportunity to create a great movie about a vibrant community? If it is bad and stupid, then making movies is not good.
