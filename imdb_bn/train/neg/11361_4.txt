What these shrubs can do is very supernatural ... Well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen. <br /> <br /> You must first tell me that I like animated movies. Unfortunately this year's reporter is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I have quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has a great 3D effect. Well, I did not see anything, at least something special that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "fly" in this movie is not seeing anything like the original fly. At least they could make them black But the cyan fly, seriously? <br /> <br /> 3) Story with giant head and thin Torsos I was writing for 6-year-old kids in it. I can not say that it is simple in two sentences. <br /> <br /> 4) Extra patriotism. For example: "They're all American files!" Oh, give me a break.
