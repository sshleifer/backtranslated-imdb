A chemical spill is turning into a junky man. It is up to two doctors to survive pandemic. This is an Andresas Chess film so you know exactly what will happen. Bad acting, awesome horror, special effects, and no budget talk. The dubbing is a laughable and most tragic case with the capital that I am compelled to write a word about this separation, ten lines are compulsory due to instructions given by IMDB. My only review of one word is: The wind can not fly, so I have to correct it and take it to the worst. But I do not know what I can do, so .. I think I can have enough words or lines to pass this word. Which is cool, I guess. So in a nutshell: This movie sucks the ball, does not see it. <br /> <br /> My grade: F.
