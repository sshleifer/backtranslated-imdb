Once started, I have to finish showing a movie, how bad it is. It was disturbed to sit through this movie. The reporter with "Sparkling" bullets, "Nijja", shot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seems to be innocent, predictable results and all bad acting was very awesome. The girl finds the reporter in her friends' apartment and "What you're doing here (kept the bat)" goes like a girl, you're hello, you want $ @ $%! ??? 1.2 seconds ... just bad .... save yourself for one hour and forty minutes and play with your kids (or dogs)!
