I read a review to protect this movie because it was a low budget, now accept my things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were reasonably animated but were implemented in the worst way. The battle scenes were not even the only shot of an actor, even a giant shot with very interaction. When the giant interacted it looked like it was on Pintaspe Prane. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, then you have to use models and dolls. They do not look as fancy but at least they can interact, just watch Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> Actor Bauleaf did a previous job but the rest of the cast is not trying or they forgot where they are. <br /> <br /> This script confused me. One minute they will talk about the day after the modern day you can get Shakespeare's theatrical club play club. I do not want to say that it should be all and it should be 'it', but you have to find a solidarity balance so that the lines seem to come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed that when the brochure quoted the old rule in the beginning, it was found that he did not spend the time talking about the rest of the gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In short, this image is very smoothly Turkish, but a turn less.
