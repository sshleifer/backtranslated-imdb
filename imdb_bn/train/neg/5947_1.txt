This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've ever seen. Sadly, Donald Sutherland's presence deliberately gave it some credibility, since it was duped in sticking with it. [The last time it will happen.] <br /> <br /> The character of Leslie Anne Warren is very lively and stupid as they come. There were even better characters than those who died in the film. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, most of these films seem to have a special problem with women, and they seem to pay attention to terrorists and killings. This film can be a bit of a terrorist as it is not sick and ill. It all ends up insulting the viewer's illness in his stomach, and the intelligence of the audience. <br /> <br /> Custom confusing is good. My guess is that they first bagged Sutherland, and used him to cherish others like lemings in between. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself to waste time, this garbage is a chance for this opportunity.
