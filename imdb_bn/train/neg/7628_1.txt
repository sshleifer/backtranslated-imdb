Black and white film. Good Photography Trusted characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Here are some good performances and the ground ground setting for the plot is good (the more it should have been) but it is not very slowly and develop. It is completely base on many without much romance with many undesired nudity. May be done with more main characters. If you want to see something about your family, it is not in the movie and if not, it will be a problem for you sitting down. Although this image is about 1 inches deep!
