Last weekend I bought this Junkie movie in purple and saw some friends that it was going to be the budget version of "Dead Land". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. It seems that they have spent a great part of their budget on cover art, which is very confusing to the fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We saw the point where living children are alive and some people who reach the car are out in the middle of talking on any cellphone phone. They actually talk to a man before killing one of the girls. But once they started driving the car, I could not stop my unbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people think that this is a "very bad, good movie", they are liars, they are liars. I did not finish the movie, but in another review it has been mentioned that they actually became the police officer at the end of the movie, which makes me happy to be unable to see my life forever. <br /> <br /> It does not even look worse than "Zombiez"!
