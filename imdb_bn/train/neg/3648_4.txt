To try to imagine childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Henga), go to the doctor (James Karen). It works, but Adams gradually becomes aware that there is some serious error with the child ... <br /> <br /> The very interesting concept is done entirely by a laui script - the original idea is okay, but hopefully to look forward to it Ends up I saw every "bend" coming. The part is poor - it seems that no basic scene can shoot. The production quality is - to be beautiful - lousy. Very shabby And, cow's scenes are very unpleasant (especially when pregnant women begin to tear themselves) often have special effects. The film ended completely when it became quite clear that there was no idea of ​​ending the film. <br /> <br /> Some good acting makes it a little over-friendly. Adams, Haiga and Karen kept all the good in their roles and watching me but that was about it. This film was released in 1991 and is still unknown - why is it easy to see? I give it a 4.
