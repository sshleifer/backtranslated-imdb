I really wanted to like this movie because critics have been stupid <br /> <br /> It (at least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Because you want to see how it will be dirty. Well, the car is gone <br /> <br /> There is no survival and no survival. Plus beside, cinematography <br /> <br /> I was beautiful, I want to go on vacation, only if <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
