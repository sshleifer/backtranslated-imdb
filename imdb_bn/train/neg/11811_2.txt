You know when you're in the bus and someone decides to tell you their story and sit with a gentle smile on your face when you really want to tear it away and go away? It is good to see this movie. All right, I really like to go and see in April, and I knew myself as the only and only star of Curry Diario, but after half an hour after this latest installment, I wanted to give the death all the slaps of madre Someone's diary was funny, unusual, and at least some other characters managed to get a word of editorial. Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that you are listening to what he is hearing about for one and a half hours, his ambition, how his politics is best, or the playful piece of popular culture keeps his fondness. now. He also found the clips that he did not like while closing it, which I thought was reserved for my loss. Surely in a situation like him you think he will try a little more intelligent than the movie. Probably creating a correct film, with some ideas and a decent framework, or something that is not completely influenced by its annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his stranger's child, I wanted to go and stay in a company of normal someone, especially with a strange fantasy for tacky music, not a self-obsessed film director. The next time someone tries to talk about your life about who you do not know, they give me a slip. Each hit in the fight against Morteitz will be a small victory.
