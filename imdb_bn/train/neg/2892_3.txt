Ursul Andres' nude body is one thing that you believe in God. There are two other women (especially acting a maid) as well as big bodies. So why would a high grade grade give me a picture of the amount of quantity and quantity 3 out of 10? Because, to go to the incredible body of Usulula, we have to sit through a film which is otherwise irrational and annoying. (Remember that I saw the whole 101-minute version, not 78 minutes America, which is probably the most exotic element). According to the Italian-comedy tradition, most of the letters are exaggerated characters (military fiqh, "Latin lover", patient drunk, naive maid) which is not funny, simply restrained. Final word: Check it out, but keep your finger on the fast-forward button, you need it. (*)
