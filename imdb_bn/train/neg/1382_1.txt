The movie was horrific. The theater died silently because 'everyone was embarrassed to see such a trash there. I think someone gave Jat Lee a lobotomy and performed a script with a five-year-old conversation. Martial arts are 'OK', but when Jackie Chan is filmed next to the film and "Matrix" you are good to see one of them.
