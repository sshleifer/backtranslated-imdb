This can be rated a 0, it will be. From accidental woodwork to soft, rural motion, poorer absorption angle and sophomoric disguised headlines have been completely added to the sad spectators, it is a movie disaster. <br /> <br /> Predictable, as it is from the beginning, so will all the characters and how the plot will start. From an annoying, unexpected start to a sad and gradual end, every single presence in this movie has been lost, and every small scrap of this image has been destroyed for this Turkish. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something as heartlessly bleak with lots of similar childhood titles, see one of the Hilsha movies. At least they are obsolete and in front of what they are trying to do. How this horribly bad situation can ever be rated over 5 years is a miracle that can sometimes be combined with a taste or an intelligent standard sometimes for the most suspicious purposes. <br /> <br /> It is not awesome, it is not interesting, and above all it is not arousing any sense of sound. This is my opinion, a crime; It is such an offense that such a horrific offensive and ineffective part of the trash is sometimes not being held and the assets are presented in existence and another tragedy that is still protected by some misguided misguided spectators. <br /> <br /> Even Elvias can not soften the flurry of horror of this film even with the delightful personality and fun ways. Do not do it at all costs.
