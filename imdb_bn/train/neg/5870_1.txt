I did not like this picture! After all, I do not know why, but everyone says here, Clemente Poyce's game is wonderful, which I think is absolutely wrong! She is not like a nostalgia: another look, another character ... and worse, she is an extraordinary actress and so she could not play this role! She completely disfigured the heroine! His game was really hateful to watch! It would be better for the Russian actress to give this role to me, because it is easier for a Russian person to understand the Russian Spirit. Unfortunately, Kootajov looked like a drunk man, who did not jump for 2 weeks and defeated a fight in which he lost his eyes ... (Thank God, some actors in this film, whose game was fantastic! I think, Alessio Boni He was very well-versed in his work! I was glad he was one of the few people who read the book, which is very important to play . Besides, I like to play Russian actors, it was really wonderful to see them)) I liked this work, only a very beautiful view and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense, with whom Leo Tolstoy has written this best, and probably could understand the whole concept of the book ... 10 to 1
