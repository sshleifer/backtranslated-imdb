I saw 3/4 of this movie and here's why we got such a horrible review. It was fairly easy to see (at 3am). It was well-casting - the cast of serial killer Kevin Dillon's role was very credible - he was both charasmatic and cool. The rest of the main characters were not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is your ideal reviewer / suspense movie. A married couple can not conceive so that they go to the reproductive clinic for help. A sociological "genetic material" determines the donor recipients and usually intrudes in their life, as a stalker. <br /> <br /> I said, most movies were quite good .. We raised his child to see the growth of "Canaan" and created a perfect family with mother more and more obsessed. Of course things designed for him is the way he designed it. Do not have a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But, last 15 minutes was just awesome. I'm quite tolerant with the movie (especially 3!). But, I was surprised at how bad I finally wrote. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, here only Quality Kevin Dillon's role was - - One of the best series killers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Try to travel to another channel before watching this .. But, if something is not good, I want to try it .. =)
