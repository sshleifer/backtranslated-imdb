Before the advent of Peter Jackson's trilogy, I could have given the film a high rating, but there is no comparison between them as well. The speed of this movie accelerates, many important scenes from the book are dropped, and small letters develop there. Animation is a peculiar mix of traditional cartoon drawing and live action scenes, which I got confused. And the most frustrating thing about this movie is that it broke in the middle of the story and did not finish. There are some good points - exciting to watch the war scenes, and the conversation follows most of the books in the letter. If you are quick, check it out and you can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you do not read the book, you will probably be confused because there are many missing from this version. 10 out of 4
