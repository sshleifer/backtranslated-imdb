A remake of the stunning 1972 film on the stage, Kenny is nicely cast as the first movie to encourage her character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> The main setting is leaving for a super-modern homesetting. The fine interpolation between Oliver and Kine, which makes the first movie so visible, is replaced with a horrible, sharp arrogance, which instantly misbehaves in the audience. But if it is not shiny, flexible and is not desired by each other, the original genre of another character is so well encouraged, from this term, a distinct OTT character of both characters is killed. <br /> <br /> This version is not really worth watching Slith, look at the original movie and be surprised by the opening act.
