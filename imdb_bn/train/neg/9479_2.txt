This movie seems to be better than the end. Cinematography is good, it seems difficult to play, the dialogue is not very hard ... But even then, in this distinguished scene, about 20 minutes of what you know with a doctor is actually a shelter claiming as a doctor - and it just goes from the south. At the top of <br /> <br />, the monster trick is seen from the Godzilla-looking object, the silist looking helplines. From the beginning of Logan's rice, there are some strange monster worshipers who wear masks like explosives thirteen. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography could not save this movie. Despite some pretty tough performances by the actors, the story just does not go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" has been a good title for this.
