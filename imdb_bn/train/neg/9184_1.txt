F * ck is mine! I saw some incredibly horrible movie in my time but it takes P * ss! <br /> <br /> Really, I can not say this word really bad. The plot that is not there apart, is acting ludicrously, ridiculously terrible excuses for jammy; You know, I can go throughout the day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, pointless, punk or embarrassing. I reveal to anyone who wants to see this movie ... No! <br /> <br /> I was shy and said, I have this rack. It is hidden on the right hand side of God in the huge pillar. I could not excuse this horse sh * a film away. That's how bad it is.
