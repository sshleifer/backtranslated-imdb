It's one of the most bad film adaptations ever a musical. The stage version of a chorus line is astonishing. This movie misses marks in almost all means. Even welding is baffling. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is the song of the Wall. The story of Val is that he is a great dancer but in the section of appearance 3. Yes, he finds a solution, but eventually he is a great dancer. What will bright film makers do? They are renowned for looking at an actress who does not dance and look great. The way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> There are then dance arts. I'm sure Michael Bennet was going into his grave. Why did not they use their danceography? It really can not be developed on top.
