This movie is a bad news and I'm really surprised at the big name genius level, who would agree to appear like this junk. Imagine I had a few strangled agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd. As a result of this fiasco. It really gets you that it gets better. The star's appeal was the director's appeal and there was enough room for interest and ticket sales, but it was a flop. Multiple stories go from bad to bad by the end of the line movie, and you turn out to rub that that is a piece of cheese until finally end up feeling like a brushed mouse. Spike is able to achieve a retaliation against an Italian citizen who can kill him or her by disgracing him, because the film is old and probably several numbers to make the abusive Italian stereotype permanent. Since there is some excitement and magical camwork with some Spike Lee film. He has gifts grabbing your psyche and only for some memorable scenes if you transport in his vision. But the question is finally ... you can stand the head and watch the clock for another 2 hours and you can wait till the end of any place.
