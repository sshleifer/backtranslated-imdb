This is a very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot just does not seem to be any ideas. Wolfman's Furry was made in Spain and I think that if a movie is dubbed from one language to another, it is not translated like the first one. Although maybe part of this problem, I doubt if it is considered for all the problems of this movie. Dubbing is not quite bad and matches the very letter of the voices. The scenes are an array of sticky, weird and irrelevant characters that do more to the audience than more confusion. What I like about this picture is that Wolfman himself and the scene where he attacks. Now if they could keep it together and give some ideas, then they might have some. Do not waste your time on this one.
