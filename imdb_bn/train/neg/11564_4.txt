Italian horror / suspicious film, a rich English lord who used to travel legs and breaths for red hair girls, just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn You know that he certainly loved his wife, because he brought them to their homes - a huge, moving castle - and thrown them out and then tortured them, whipped them and killed them. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me is, at the end of the film, we see this guy acting as the hero of the film by Antonio de Teffe. However, soon, under the advice of his playwright uncle Roberto Maldar, D Tifff will sit with a girl who is seen in his uncle's party. He went on and started to happen in strange things of De Teffe's strange situation. He started to see and hear his dead wife and, finally, look at the title if you are still interested. Also, family members and friends start to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor aunt Agatha (seems like she can be younger than De Tafe and is trying to make her look in a wheelchair and an old look) a dirty fashion fills her fate. Another person is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a complete interpretation of what Evelyn can do. Director Amilio Miraglia has done a lot of good: The film's setting is appropriate for this movie, although we are trying to believe that England is the best. None of the actors look in english Many people with dark black hair and Mediterranean color and an Englishman wearing clothes will not be caught in the body. Cars drive cars on their roads. But whatever, the crypt view was effectively shot and I liked very sugar resolutions. And certainly proud, any film with red head headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a symptom of sexual distortion; However, I think somewhat shocked that the oppression of women was quite good and healthy to free their psychic giants. Come on.
