Released from the UK DVD as access, The Choke is a small slash which fails in most sections: The story is almost non-existent, resulting in a movie that most people revolve around a dark building; Apart from two characters (those who seem to be absolutely alive to the film), everyone is totally objectionable, that is, they can not take lesser viewers when they are buried; Deaths are not sufficiently enough (if short shots of one pound of fillets covered in fake blood become your stomach); And the feature of next to no nudity of unwanted sex scenes (a flawed mistake to create a slasher flick). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where they are sorted by an invisible assailant. For low budget efforts, production prices are okay and casts seem to be fairly good actors, but there is almost absolutely no genuine fear, it's unwilling to get really dirty (it's a slash, so where's a graphic splatter?), Very awesome dialogue (especially dead -Right video strategy from early enough-to-drummer) and adding some style to some sick To yabahara suggests, the film quickly becomes annoying.
