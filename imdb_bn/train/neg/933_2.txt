Unused / unbelievable story lines, (the time I was going out of the time, I did not take care of anymore) Bad casting (Come on ... William Messi as Hit Man?) Bad Directions, (Have you seen Tracey Woolman so badly?) (I thought Anthhetic incomplete, John Ritter character was unknown?) Bad script ... (True, I'm not looking for a formula script but it was really awful) It was the only really good thing baby. Ten lines? Is it OK if your comments are less than ten lines? Reduced - who rules? Why can not I say that what I say in less than 10 lines ??? Is that kind of arbitrary? Why is the comment less than 10 lines?
