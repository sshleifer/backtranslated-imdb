A woman who works as an intern for a photographer, she goes home and finds the hole on the roof and discovers it. So she finds that her neighbor is a photographer. This film can be a great plot, but the plot exceeds any hope. My problem with this movie was that some people were hijacking heroin every ten seconds. If they take out the scenes where anyone snows heroin, it will be a beautiful movie. Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone breathed white powder. Using a drug in a movie was really hair. It attracts attention from a great story about the main plot and a photographer. The lesbian thing does not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
