This picture is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be becoming more acclaimed film-making areas (such as the growth of Vancouver's Primus). Brothers was shot dead in Central Florida, and this little film is a bit of a deviation for the area (Indie film walks around the world and has created a great way with the luminous HBO minicaries from Earth). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think the Orlando The Brothers movie was the perfect place. It was possible to give a new spin on the 'Boy Band' crazy. After all, N'ync and backstreet both come from this area. However, due to the weak script, Brothers rarely fall. Both lead letters are not flat with almost any development (its part may be actors' performers, but some of which must be written to the script). <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Jokes. Jokes are a lot of repetitive (they're fun for the first time but it seems to be annoying). Some 'concert' scenes are poorly managed (and do not seem to move the story in any way through these scenes). <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations, but its a disappointing effort. I hope good for upcoming features based on this short. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Piggie is to go to different sections (fast). Comedy is not its strong suit. However, he is absolutely fond of one of the main film makers in the Orlando area (it's just shameful that he is notorious, not famous). <br /> <br />
