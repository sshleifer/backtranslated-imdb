DVD box claims as it is not as funny and poor. I really love the twisted and wierd movie, but this is really really dull! It has been leaked for an hour, baby dolls flying and many rape! I intend with this amateur sleaze, it was made to make a bad-it-good movie, but it failed. It's just bad! Some scenes are okay, but the whole is a mess. If you liked the amateur splatter like this (only the best way) I would recommend the Andreas Schnass' Violence Sheet 2 and 3.
