Many comments have already been posted so that I am sick of the way I felt about this film. <br /> <br /> "I thought I was awesome - Jim Carry is truly talented, physical comedian and as well as a versatile actor (my opinion). On the other hand, Mike Meyer gets her smile as boring. I liked him very much in "Owens World" and "So I married an X-Marda" - but I was never submissive to Austin Powers and "Hat in the Hat". <br /> <br /> This picture was terrible - Gaga was awesome! Not only was the adult content inappropriate for the children, but some of them were so dated that they made someone impressive for 50 years! Plots were dirty, dirty, dirty! It's a shame really because the kids "mom" was very funny like this. They probably could have chosen better villains than Alec Baldwin - but if it was not for Mayor's ugly, he could have pulled it, the extra role of the cat was a rebellion. <br /> <br /> I mean - look at a scripts even in the mailers? Was a writing? Other actors seem to have one - but the cat seems to have winging it exactly! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I want to mention that the set and the props are wonderful !!! But unfortunately they can not save this image. <br /> <br /> The poor Dr. Sioux - People were a genius! Do not waste his reputation by utilizing his work on this lazy, dirty way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
