As a huge fan of BSG's first two seasons, BSG Razor Eye is standing alone. It is expected that the original glory days will be returned to the franchisee. Usually I have no problem with most of the conversation-driven science fiction that oppose a visual bonanza of special effects. The script is tight with some original ideas distributed by good actors, a little spent CGI can make a deep film with money. This prequel has any advance required for it. Virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible in the world. This view was only kept there to increase the limitations of restrictions. Teens do not love the virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex and violence and heavy dance music. Their part about the intellectual depth of these same youth and the reasons for political or religious emotions such as creating future software or being victims of suicide bombs. These kids definitely do not have this planet. The film is acting as a soap opera with only 10 minutes of little interest. His view with Erry Stolz provides a Divine Conscience through the Firmware Upgrade of the student, if it is not entertaining, it was fun. But this old concept was well-documented and was credible with the bright, classic origin "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Maradona rips off his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this movie was using BPL to use cappuccino recycled CGI, looking soft and cheap and cheap. When I was premiere on the sign-fi channel I doubt this place would be watching soap. Undoubtedly I am suffering from the bad night of insomnia, this time the show will certainly be cured. Zzzzzzzz
