"Like it's hard to describe how exciting it is to make relationships like dramas, such as throwing for good measurements in pornographic terms and as much as we like and make us more money and stuff like that." - Ellen , Lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kisses, Likes, On the Like, Mouth and Stuff" are sometimes the best ones, as well as artistic endeavors. Like allen's hairy hands and Chris masturbation, my year-long film viewing experience and the height of the staff were like this. But with my preference before starting to break my favorite new US-20-something-airhead record, let me see a short list like this brief scenario: <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. Chris is working with his genitalia. And not just: The camera (so well pointedly by Allen and Patrick) gives the viewer a full-screen shot of Chris's fat white-rubbish stomach, which he was after the non-Catholic debate - it was really thrilling. I can say all honesty that I have never seen such mercy. Chris, you should have more such scenes in your next movie, because the bright, brilliant people, Lars von Tier and the continuation of his "Idiotus 95", we all started as needed. A quick w *** and then a hairy, fat, white belly: can any movie-girl ask more?! Needless to say, I can stay sitting all day and hate Chris (though I'm direct) ... Such poems Such elegance, such as style Less than total, divine inspiration that went into filming in sequence - Plus Jane is a solid amount of philosophy. Even the Barbara Streissand could not be even more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Allen's hairy, thick arms. Wally-camera close-ups are photographed by our two directors of photography (I can not emphasize it), Allen and Patrick often make confusion about the exact identity of sexual intercourse. We see a number of scenes on a part of the body (a foot, hand or foot), but it was often a guess game: Is this part of the body male or female? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Allen, Patrick and teenager, cast their own, because their gender was ideal for gender-based confusion. It was at difficult times to guess whether it is like a woman or a male. Patrick is very thin and printed on his movements, so indecent and old, but Ellen and the other girl are so child, with their thick legs and arms. Bright <br /> <br /> Bright - especially the way that is explicitly related to the theme of changing the role of the gender: So the entire core and mind-blowing He used to behave like a man, wants sex all the time, when his former Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spinning. <br /> <br /> 4. Looking at Elaine's leftist partner "He must love Simpsons, which is quite leftist." I am glad that these filmmakers have decided to break the long tradition of suggesting our intelligent leftists. Elen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "preferences" is really remarkable (3,849, to be correct) to handle conversations with less than 80 minutes of he and his generous friends. They actually moved their real-life uncertainty to the big screen with the lowest effort, and I am grateful for them. <br /> <br /> 5. Close up the toes. A lot of stuff for foot fetishists, which I think is a very generous, commendable way to reach out to sex minorities. After all, the shoe- and foot-fetishists are given so little to the modern cinema, so it's lovely to see someone outside the cursus. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. While engaging in meaningless conversations, it is not just a modest little movie about people related to the heart's relationship. No, it's much more than that. It's about light that guides you all to silly; Various pseudo-artistic Wannabes will play well on pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, which are only dropped from the film school, and plans to attack our senses with our slow drivel, essential exposure to enable them to profit so that some real cash for change, With whom they save the planet and solve all political problems in this world, San Pen and George C Luni would like. What is the very best way to do that by making porn at the very beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Allen did the camera, as mentioned in the last-credits, who took the camera and two of them were in front? They probably rented some passengers and handed the camera to them ... <br /> <br /> Visit http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and watch my "TV and Movies: 150 Bad Facts. "List.
