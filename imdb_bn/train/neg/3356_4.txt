Sheryl Jackson's novel 'The Hunting of Hill House' describes the atmospheric story of terrorism, which describes the occult incident in an old palace. The atmosphere is well set out, and the cold is well organized. A hunting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 Chilar 'Hunting' is closely linked to the book, but adds the details to the plot. Fortunately, this is very low, and so the book is better executed on terrorism and cold screen. Black and white photography only adds to the moan of the movie. O of non-SM-fold! <br /> <br /> And then, John de Bont made this. In 1999, movies were hit by a hunting remake - if you can call it a remix. The rebuilding of the 1963 film was a mystery, but at the moment, the film itself shows. <br /> <br /> This is often the beginning, like most horror movies. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and weird mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems that this film is really just a fair re-telling. And then, the first fear comes: A light harpsichord wire slashes the face of a woman (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This will be sunny, and the truth will be told, it was almost tears in between. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film just spirals below. Because the role of Oven Wilson is particularly excited, the acting is expected to be a bit of wood (so it is so much relief when it is frustrated by the lungs). <br /> <br /> Special effects make this film really, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and it will take very long. These are a lot of examples, so I will not bother to enroll them. So, everyone, I, with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you want to see the original, or alternatively, buy novels by Sheryl Jackson. But please stay away from this. And, if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (since many channels want to screen this movie, not the original) or it is cheap, please do not buy it, please do what you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
