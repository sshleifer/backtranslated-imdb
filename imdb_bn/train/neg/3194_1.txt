I can not believe that this movie was recently made in 1984. It does not mention some ridiculous performances, sometimes stupid plots. To get back to Italy illegally arrested in Italy, who will ask Sheriff Joe Dawn of Fat Texas to return to Italy? Regarding the title of the film, you do not have much to say - actually, I can think of it as a title for a Wannabe Action / Police film as Generic. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I only saw MST3K as a shield with Mike and Mask. They commented on the similarity of female leadership with Cinefield's Elaine ("none of them are spunable") and unemployed. The movie is probably not worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's fame came earlier: When his title came to the beginning of the film, Tom said, "I hope I was illiterate, so I do not have to read it."
