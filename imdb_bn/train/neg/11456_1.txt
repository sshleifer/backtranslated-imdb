This is a movie that lets you think: "The real American" Hogan did the same? Actually I do not think so and he was right. I'm Italian, for many reasons I could not be proud of my country, but I did not return to another group (for example, French), only I love Juliet Binocchi. At the end of the film, why not stay in love with the British girl and why a fellow countryman is against Yellas as well. As far as acting is concerned, well, all players work very weak. And then, you know, I hate the "dead poet society" environment. Actually another movie that I hate.
