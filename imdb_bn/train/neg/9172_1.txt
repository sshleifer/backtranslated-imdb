When I go to see a movie about Zumbi, I'm not expecting Oscar career performance, or I'm not hoping to write on The Godfather's level, but actors will not have to look at their coupe cards and their straining to read dialogue at least. The actor does not seem to be typing it 10 minutes before reading the camera. This movie was very horrible, I was really standing up and waiting 25 minutes and I went to the side and saw Shil Creek Manor, which was not very good, but it seemed like Citizen Kane like this nude. Plus, the girls were very nice, maybe it was my only thing that kept me for more than the first 5 minutes, actually I left after hitting the hottest, I was not interested in anything but then.
