One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, is an uninterrupted picture of the exercise at The Fan Slashar Flickr. It tries to spin or twist the genre with a crazy fan psychotic turned preposterous plot line - the manders in the movie nothing to do. (spoiler) We believe that a knife-driven fool has access to and access to a baseball player in an eminent hotel with an interview, security, or camera? The film is trying to drag us into our heart-strings with a fool, which is surprisingly unreasonable and worst. Not sure what all the actors thought when they got on this razzie onboard. A bud as a bigger as they come. Stay away far if you like thinking of your movie
