Deep Shock plays like a TV movie: What does it know about a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a bad design animal "bad guy" and a script full of technical, political words and importer? <br /> <br /> I tested the film because of the organism (this filmmakers have made for these designs in these cheaply made videos I like what I remember) and right from the bat I was frustrated because the boxes in the box were not one of the movies. I played for the kind of film it was expected (really quite generic and did not think at a particular point). The music was standard, non-anxiety action symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I like the design of computer and tech equipment with mini-sub design. The movie really flows, the indicator screens tell you which story you are publishing it. But there is no story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is 3/10 star IMO. The boring quest and the North Pole and the milky mission to protect this animal ... kinda lame. Even Tagore's love relationship between two tags of Loma, which you can not see. This one chalk up to be a movie of the actor's career bench and eager to get a video. Do not disturb.
