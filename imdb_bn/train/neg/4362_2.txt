A group of alien people on earth are going to earth, instead of eating the planet's catastrophes of lethal creatures, where they all eat physical mushrooms and prevent them. Padded and horrible jokes with footage from "Dinosaur's Planet" is a must to miss it. Actor is violent as well, and when it's not as bad as "chickbox" (can any movie be?) It's still quite awful adverse element. The 90-minute running time seems like eternity and you are probably cursing life, so please make a huge favor to yourself and just go, avoid this painful movie, there is nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> They tried to enjoy this movie again a decade ago by filmmaker MSST 3, and it works a bit up to date, although the Arena album is hot, but Lilith Stabs are pretty cool. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Joke Comments, 17 Behind the Scenes feature; 7 minute black feature; Jessica Mills Reporting; Stills Gallery; And the main trailer
