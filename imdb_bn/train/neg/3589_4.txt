When I saw the cast list, I was attracted to this movie, but after seeing this I must admit that I am a little disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors are not able to hold the film behind them. Why? Bad script reason. Although Dylan, Lane and Jones are trying hard to move the film to another level, there is no innovative story in it and the direction is very common. So for the Matt Dillon fans, this visible film, as the admirer of beautiful Diane Lan. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not his movie; There are many under its level. So if you hooked it up by this great cast-up watch it but do not expect something big or extraordinary. The only thing that you remember about this flickr is Diane Lane scene; It's a lot forgotten left.
