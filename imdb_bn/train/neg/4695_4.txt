I've seen this movie several times and it was never fun, but it's still fun and good for some smiles. <br /> <br /> This is a woman who often works in a company and their boss is a blurred and they end up giving her a taste of her own medicine, and they try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> acting is really good. Dabni Kolman is one of the 80 stars who plays a bad guy, not really bad, just unlike. Doli's party pianists to see Common Dixie and funny and its southern wisdom shines here really. So Jane Fan and so little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this movie, her most fun line and she laughs me a lot of times, she'll love him. <br /> <br /> I can recommend anyone who loves the 80's comedy. I love the movie but there is something about it that I do not like. It starts great and has a good flow and then everything starts coming together and gives me less care about characters. They all have a little imagination about whether they want to love Boss, and although 'cute' I think it moves the film flow. The film comes up again and the fun things happen and then gradually slows down, which is very good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try this one without seeing it. I think it may be more or less likable depending on the mood.
