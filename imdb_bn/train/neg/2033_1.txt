If I could give it less than 1 I would like to Do not bother to rent; If someone lets you burn it to the DVD. <br /> <br /> It made terrible movie. Even digital "film" total waste. I watch YouTube made by 12 year old boys better. Lomel claims this writing, if that is the case, he is a classic case that is uneducated in two languages. The story line does not exist, the dialog is mainly shouting, the camera work is being rendered unreasonably with any kind of building, which is totally irrelevant to show off in the industrial transport scene or to a slightly awkward angry young girl. <br /> I can follow at least from the usual plot or see the purpose of a "creative" movie - I like David Lechnich. <br /> <br /> This one is beyond my comprehensible power or it is totally pointless. I think this one "lets see that we can grab a title which is coming soon and a strange rebuke on it and we can see if we can grab some money." <br /> <br /> Why lionsgate is not even bothered with this. Fairly worthless, it is so bad that I will not hire any other by the same director.
