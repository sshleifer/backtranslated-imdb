They are showing up at some close networks It's a good shit Although it is not as bad as B-Movie, they show up on Saturday's Sci-Fi network, but still a fairly large pill. Acting is passable. Complex sub-values ​​of plot and writing and pacing is very slow. Every minute of the movie seems to be a part of the movie where they are wrapped up before the credit - not at the top of the movie, but in denial. Also, older adults in Caste seem older to their age. The whole thing is expected, annoying and is not worthy of being seen. Save your time. It's not even worth to take it to watch it for free.
