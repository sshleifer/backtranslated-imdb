What a disappointment despair! IMDb's 6,1 score here has made some light expectations, but oh, I was frustrated. The first thing that bugs me is the braindead, stereotyped university kids. Yes, I know that teenage girls can be and so on, but why are they always portrayed as a whole brand of deaths in movies? There was a character that I thought was right, but he died before it ended (it did not publish here). Other characters are poorly executed and even the supposed hero / heroine did not do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is quite good and the productions value the cut-off price for such flickers. Acting was not usually very good, Roger Horre stood out in a small role. But it all fails with bland and braindead characters. You take care of them after just 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that is being generous).
