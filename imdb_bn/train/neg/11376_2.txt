Despite the gravity of the subject and possibly the filmmakers having a good intention to create a film with a white expression, the inconsistency of New York's acting ambassador, Branson Green, has easily made LAA Phoenix, making it difficult to take the story seriously. Green, who has been continually rejected by Los Angeles casting agents (like 80% when looking for bigger, blonde, and fools in New York), he has seen that success comes easily when he wants to prove his image false. Unfortunately, due to the new hair color and peace of "surfer" attitude, he had the opportunity to play with the Jericho Church, which subscribed to the Aryan nation's white racist education. Green is willing to forget his past easily, and especially to save his young black friends for ten years, to be the new spokesman of the church. This is no consciousness, how our character is primarily viewed as Principal. Along with the sudden change in character and character, the hard-working with an unlikely reversal, the Denarro-Neglected (as his taxi driver character) is able to fight those villains. One of the best efforts on filmmakers, but one that reveals itself as something serious. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also very annoying and it is very easy to force us to recognize them. Church leader's psychologist Paranoia, self-interested actress girlfriend (the first girlfriend Branson is in LA), and the new blonde girlfriend whose character does not get much improvement, it is simply ineffective to walk, talk ineffective. We were forced to draw ideas about some of our random characters which we were supposed to see only at their passing moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " We continue to refrain from continuing with rejection of its acting scene and disappointment. But for the sake of accepting, after voluntarily changing his appearance and personality, at least a good twenty minutes to 30 minutes is lost in the film, which can be very few. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attracting attention to irrational fear behind racism, it has not been done with sufficient credibility.
