This higher inferiority of the original stupid "dark dead" movie is another trash bin waste. Many people have highlighted these movies, I can not believe what they say. Since I was a kid, I heard how scary and horror these films were and I saw them all and I was extremely disappointed, did all the people from the 1970s, or did they know of this uncomfortable annoyance?
