As others point to this movie, a psychological or psychoanalytic stimulus drill load. <br /> <br /> After seeing all the trainings and acid houses we know that Scotland is one of the world's most gloomy places. But unlike Trainpointing and Acid House, it does not work without the good dose of a sunny or diverse realities. And even without an important script, a movie will not work, and there is nothing new, inspirational or thoughtful about this script for this movie. <br /> <br /> This image won a few of the benefits. Bad British film art is at the moment. I think the Australian film industry was quite bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry was even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I will not be disturbed about the rent from the weekend section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself good and give this film a wide year.
