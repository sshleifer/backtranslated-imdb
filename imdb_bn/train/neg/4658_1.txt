Biff Niccor was a terrible and uninterrupted remake of the 1945 David Lion Classic, based on the novel "Steel Life" by Noel Keward. A doctor removes a particle drawn from a woman's eye on a railway station, in a sad relationship, she is married to a happy Italian reproduction social worker. They meet accidentally on another occasion, form an immediate attraction and arrange to meet each other on Wednesday. The couple fall in love, but after spending hours together after a few hours they realize that there is no realistic chance of happiness and they agree to participate. The cover's main one-acting game is concerned about two common people lying in love. Sofia Lorraine and Richard Burton, two superstars and Hollywood epics veterans, there is no concept of 'general man'. Lorraine Particularly wrong idea - Sophia Lorraine is working as a full-time volunteer social worker in a Citizen Advice Bureau, like a complete match-up, million dollar, that's not true. Burton, dad hair, looking too haggard, wearing too much make-up and platform shoes, does not come across as your average general practitioner. That said, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing their husbands. Burton married a literary critic who wrote poisonous reviews in his evening and blamed him with his husband. Lorraine's husband, Jack Headley, wanders around the house all day long and is boring to the end: He did some exciting work about six years ago. Together, their final scene will cause vomiting, ("you are long, long way away", etc.). Great British job actor, John Le Mesurier, has a three-minute reduction as a friend of Barton, and seems to be very lavish, speaking very rarely on his lines. It's a neat, terrible rehash of a movie classic, a sad and forgotten performance. To avoid all costs.
