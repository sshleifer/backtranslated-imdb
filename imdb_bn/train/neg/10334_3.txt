A story of amazing uncertainty kills "psychological" over again. Characters and the plot are completely selfish (Phoolasi crazy cameras work, which is usually a cause for release in his film) and no mystery is realized. This is padded across an obsolete degree - in the end, you will not clamber with excitement but hurt with annoyance (and, like me, perhaps an extravagant desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neil's performance deserve to grab a good movie. Beware of Phulchi Gaurhunds - there is nothing like "psychological". <br /> <br /> 3/10
