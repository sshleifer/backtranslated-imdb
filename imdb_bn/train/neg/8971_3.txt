After the release of Hypercar ube (2003), and after the alleged ceasefire of the original cube (1998), director Arne Barbarrsh has taken the liberty to bring the third fund to our triangle, Prickle Cube Jiro. <Br /> <br /> The deep, unknown time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, wine (Junkie Bennett) and Dude (David Haband) are sitting in the heart of a giant and inexpensive organization, and who observe their behavior The chamber is set in a demonic network, which is rigged with some death trap. The people who are watching they are guilty, who have made this terrible and deadly aggressive election on deadly injection, these observers have no problem with their work, unless a mathematician, Win, a woman named Kassander, Stephanie Moore) I did not agree to enter inside. Suddenly they realized that their "jobs" are not what they seem to be, and they can be a part of some seriously ill and rolled up ... <br /> <br /> For those who have watched and enjoyed real time, prequel probably Do not be interested. It does not have the possibility of that story; This will not only extend the first cube film. Stand alone, it's a very interesting idea and sure about its own message with a handsome little emotional thriller. It was fantastic self-contained. The problem of Cub Zero is that it destroys some mystery of the core, tries to answer questions with more questions, but it only creates a problem of fixing. <br /> <br /> This new film is a question about the surrendered attitude and the mental nature of the power of evil, certainly the best questions raised, but perhaps it should probably have been done rather than the continuation of a film, which was not what the desire was. <br /> <br /> In this, the other features of acting and writing and writing movies are not horrific. There is a dark, dark look like silent pictures of the movie as 'Matrix' and 'Dark City' and they must have been able to restore the cluster hypophysic feeling of the first cube. Unfortunately, it does not have enough positive qualities to save.
