I was not supposed to watch this movie. Some of the art of filming can be considered art, but it is considered to be my migraine-education. I think it was an interesting plot, but since I did not see it for a long time I missed a lot. Fuzzy pictures and filming my brain branded stop motion. I will not stop watching the mid-way through and return for a second try. I think if I used to live alone in my own lighthouse on the evening of the dark and storm, it could be a ticket only ... PS Not sure that the Lighthouse / Film style thing can be taunted but I do not want to be blacklisted my first review;)
