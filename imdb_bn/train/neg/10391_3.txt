I've seen Gator Bat films, and it's almost the same. A woman harasses sexual harassment by a group of sexual harassment and makes every serious revenge on her. Due to the set of this movie (though not too far) the content of the movie is not glorious. The whole frontal nudity across the film has many times, but for a second it's ever sexy. Some scenes of rape may seem a bit widespread, but this is why the film is trying to strengthen the audience's need for retaliation. <br /> <br /> It is a weak film, there is no other way for this girl to take revenge on her assailants, to keep other natural interest apart from manipulating. I do not spit on your grave that you do not expect to give a serious moral, but I was happy to see it because of significant violence on female leadership, so it was not meant to stop being a T & A film . <br /> <br /> B-movies are notorious for nudity driven and managed outside adolescence, and when I spit on you, the grave is indefinitely more than a B-movie and its nudity, nudity plot drive. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot, the need for revenge against a gang of rapists It seems that these men seem to have come up with new and exciting ways of killing them, as evolutionary drop-outs like Gatere Bat's film, and the biggest challenge for the authors, but the film can not be anything else. It does not provide any kind of message than a meaningless B-movie, but instead it will only see a bunch of viewers who decide what they deserve. <br /> <br /> This page is one of the issues that we will sit through sexual assault. Curiously, the first half of the film is the most nudity (though not much), but it is most painful to watch. Due to some deaths due to death, we put a little below the time of retaliation because they were probably impossible (it seems that the man felt a great desire to embrace.) In his boat, push his giant against motor and propeller, while on the way, women shouted some final words And the ropes), but again, this movie is only for the first half to fill us Meet cha. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that these movies mean, since it literally ends at the end of the last minute. The woman does not live happily anymore, she does not write her book, she does not go away and does not return to that nightmare, she only gets in the boat and motor in the lake, when the movie is only on her track. But hey, what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time while watching it, try and find any people broken or burned. Who am I really looking for ??
