I saw this movie and the original Carlitos Way back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people are going to say that the estimation was made in a small budget but it did not do anything to a bad script. Now maybe this is mine, but I always believed that an assumption is to set up another movie, to play the original characters and maybe fill a bit of a life that we do not know. Power to Wright Power is a film that has Carlito's name. Should have been at least a few characters from the original film, the last does not give any sense to the original. At the end of this movie, he retired with his sweet heart, but in the next movie we will bring him out of jail? And her woman is not even the same woman that she speaks as her only love in the core. I would say the film is short-lived, entertaining, with some modest bits, but it is kept to the elder brother. Do not stay awake at night, wait for this to see, if you really need a hit, then look for another time.
