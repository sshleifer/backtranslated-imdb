Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slashher, and the light fades quickly. If not, what is the other reason to see it? Due to the debris of five college children, they have been signed up to prepare their old draft. When strange homeless people are requesting, the problems are happening automatically, and the group is shortening some people. Then, a killer is loose. I really wanted to say I'm going to enjoy it. It was a fair set up, or perhaps it was Daphne Zuniga among them. The film is very slow, and almost silent as a library. Most of the acting is less than the average, and "points of view" moments are old news Christopher Young, a well-known composer of films such as "Heelier" and "Entrapment", is a repetitive comedy that was well-prepared for a TV movie. Still, it looks more than the movie. So, except for Yang and Zuniga, it scraps under the barrel.
