I saw this a lazy summer afternoon by accident. It was playing on HBO's family programming channel. At first I was drawn, by what was a Disney animation. But after a few minutes, I found myself searching for a remote search, so I found the 'Info Button' to know what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy him in most of his movies, but he is not one thing, a voice-over artist Of course, this is one of the more unique voices of Hollywood, but it only serves as part of a larger visual package. A cute punk attached to his voice made some observer difficult. For the rest of the cast, uninspired I do not think really good voice appeal about talent working in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, weak voice genius, strong animations ... who noticed this movie? Gay teen duck? I do not get it. What role role models really have for young and coming homosexuals, that we must adopt animated poultry? Like the beautiful story, and the title, I got trouble for love, just as a ugly ducking.
