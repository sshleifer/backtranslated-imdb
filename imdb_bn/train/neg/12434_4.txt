In 1987, John Hughes wrote and operated 'Planes, Train and Automobiles', which was a ridiculous and shocking comedy? The best thing he ever done In this ten-year re-use plot of 'Home Alone', this second signal has decreased again, which is not connected to other movies but is equally vague and evil. Four crane ?? All right, four! And a girl among them! Congratulations, Hughes series for this revolutionary change! ?? The metal is electric with the chair, cute with barbel and blinded with paint, ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, when the new kid is even less charming than comic. You think that the departure of almost all major players in the first two films will prevent the same old routines from fossils from fossils, but the only surprise is that they have not turned into 'Home Alone 4'.
