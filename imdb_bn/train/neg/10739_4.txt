We can expect everything from 'Ederine Brood' directly from the video-movie. This is the story of a man who believes that his daughter could be a star. The only thing he has to surround the cameras and journalists is to get him on stage. A simple plan for which to kidnap him and make some blackmail. The problem of the film is not a fundamental plot, but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be fun, but it is not. It is trivial and weird, shallow letters, and the end sequence is entirely without climax or passion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel laughing, but how the whole set-up is busy.
