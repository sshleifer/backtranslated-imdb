I was not familiar with Quarter but yesterday came to this photo in Showtime. The film saw very well with set design and cinematography, but the screenplay was structured and wooded. The performance was fairly bad - I thought the two female lead was beneficial. Even though you said acting actors you do not really believe in anything. The Bible-Thumping Revalidation was without nuance, official captain, hot-head syller, etc. I'm sorry to say that based on these deficiencies, I see Canada as a direct Canadian citizen to know it directly, Telefilm Canada gave away the last credit. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something early but girls have never been exposed. Here they are surrounded by a sheep in a fortress and men are wasting time and energy for the sake of the atrocities of two young women. Focus people Whether these girls have a pressure situation outside of your pressure outside the walls of lesbians - it's just my opinion about the contrast between them. You could better with them if they can target and fire a gun. The question of their "immortal souls" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I think it is related to quarterly, can these girls be the hero? One of them killed an Indian man and eventually saved his life. I assume that one is subjected to his condition, can not be held accountable for his actions, but another murderer who is not worthy of his happy ending.
