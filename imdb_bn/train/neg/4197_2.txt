Incredibly bad acting, no good, unclear stories and flashing images and slow motion where they need the minimum: Adrenaline is not what the movie should be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verban (so-and-so-Dutch soap actress who did not take part in her English class) starred in wealthy girl Freya, who has been practicing to find 'adventurous'. Which is basically a dangerous stunt, breaks the staff and disturbs people. And not a fun way to jackass. Then there's a draco (rivas). He kinda leads the bunch but there are other illegal activities nearby. Then there is the father of the Frenchman (Lockyar), who plays a suspicious role. And, finally, we got Jason (debutant fate), Freire Lover. <br /> <br /> One day, the fray disappears and everyone seems to be involved, but we do not really care about such a thing, the visitor really does not care about it, and the story does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Why is it also built? 2/10.
