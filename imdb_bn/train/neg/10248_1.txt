The end of the world looks like a good box cover, but its bad caution. I made fool of mega star actor Christopher Lee's big fan. Like tentacles (77) A good cast means that it will not be a good film. The promise at the beginning shows then it turns tedium, so much of the movie is very dark to see what is happening. The rest of the cast is shown briefly like Like Princess, Dean Jager and McDonald Career as a security guard. I expected better than the Charles band who again made fun movies like animate and dolls. Christopher Leigh was deceived to make this movie heard. Jos√© Ferrer, John Kerin and Dean Zagrell. Well-known Dean Jagger, along with his co-stars, but both have not made it (lucky) If you make a movie at the end of the world then use a big budget. Good story Diden awakar after two good movies; Allegate (80) and death game (79) are less than his lollipop in Leon (Lolita). If you are a glutton to punish you then look at the end to see the whole world that I call you the world 10.
