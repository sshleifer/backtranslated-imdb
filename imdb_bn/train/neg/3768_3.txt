That's right. A film directed and directed by Fred Tapper and family. (Fred should be better known, the sets of 'Titanic' and 'Dagma' have worked.) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are some scientists, and some forest ranger, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are hot cock (those I think they might be a photographer, but they wear a bikini, some of whom some of them are bad because of someone else). One of the forest rangers commented that scientists are "professional", which is good, because they were professional grub or gelbinus or EVOKS. <br /> <br /> They are walking through the jungle in search of some weird leopard bone, and one even once mentions that the bones may be similar to the notorious Bigfoot. They just roamed around and one of the rangers hit the hottie suddenly. We all hope that he died soon (which means his sister is a nice man, but really only annoying). Then they, * gasp *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, bracelets like animal woodland. Of course, it can not be said that the Bigfoot bone mixed with the bone ... I guess scientists and forest rangers do not think of such things. <br /> <br /> Then Saskatchet and his tribe bursts really angry and we kill all the people who dislike, chasing other victims and buries his great aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (who died in unfortunate accidents accident). Again <br /> <br /> Insid, annoying dialogue (I've done a couple of times), anne plot, unlikely character, bad CGI (a man will look good in a monkey suit), and played that is very good to just add a movie I did not see again <br /> <br /> It is good for some strange smile.
