Last night I saw this movie, and should be careful for someone else to watch this movie. A word - no I seriously thought this was an issue that was written on a screen writing student Quantin Tarantino / Eddie Morphy, as each other word was a curse word. As "Good Will Hunting", I have no problem with the unexpected curse, it helps to be more faded in letters. In this case it was the bang with an attempt to draw a occassional * gasp * or smile from the audience. Three main characters are their own unique stereotype, Wall Street Jarac, Coffee House Zarac and "I'm not-ny-gay-just-in-touch-we-mine-fameignain-side" one-stroke. You just do not give an enemy about them! Those who want to see Violent are all shallow, unredemable damaged. For those who find courage, some fun moments in the film, very early, and very end. The toilet / vibrator scene is a sick kinda "Uh, yeah" way funny. Although really, I only recommend this movie to my worst enemies.
