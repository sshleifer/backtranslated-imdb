The "rash" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing, cruel "movie" I've ever seen. Acting criminal, the issue is actually unattainable, and special effects probably combine the monkey with the problems of learning on a secure laptop computer. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it's creativity from me, but I do not believe I should actually make things like this. I'm sure the "filmmaker" would say that yes, the "film" budget was less (nothing) hampered in the budget - but in that case they would not just bother. Since, they are so terrible to the world, so ruthlessly that they can enjoy its enjoyment only in Imbesli. <br /> <br /> "Cinema" was not like me, "Citizen" or some hope. I am probably hoping for a little awkward budget, a hint of fun and even some power. What I got was the equivalent of the handkerchief movie used. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, our literary scientist who works at the foundation of his parents has pushed some cows in a cup. Apparently, the end result of high-level science research year. Then her parents sent her to a cozy hotel-type place in a comfortable hotel. There are some other people, who are too awful to write about. However, the scientist dropped his test tube on some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grew and killed some people. (Wow, I'm just writing plot summary). Our heroes save a bit of a barrel (a "fuse" - really a part of the string - in it) by exploring the bits of Bermatic Vigars. The barrel bursts unnecessarily with the power of a small nuclear weapon, which destroys all mushrooms. The end (Thanks to love). <br /> <br /> The summary that gets "movie" (and in fact it actually makes a lot more interesting than this). It should not really have been elevated at this stage (which means I outline a plot written behind the envelope with Crayon). Nobody should really be fooling and someone should give a strong shake and "no." <br /> <br /> and those "special" effects. Well, they're all "special" all right. This CGI crazy gone. And done by a person I can guess that the bike pump can be the highest place of modern technology. And when the style of the home computer graphics package of 1984 does not have mushroom monsters, then they represent a sheet-covered actor (I'm not your child). <br /> <br /> One of the most inaccessible things is its laziness about a movie. This can be summarized in the scene by the hero spinning his guns (a La Clint Eastwood) and then unfortunately fail to take them to their pocket. I mean, there are a few rectangles coming up and he could have pulled it, but it could just leave it as well - <br /> <br /> I can not believe this camcodar-shot junk The money was spent. "Filmmakers" should be banned from going to fifty meters of shyness and filmmaking equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think that the makers of friends and family are coming to IMDB and posting mendacious reviews and stupidly giving high user ratings which "movies" give a complete mis-picture. "Rice" is a complete travesty of filmmakers. Mr. Wascavage is very, too stupid or too, very folk.
