"Hunting" has been one of my favorite horror films for the year 1963, so I was terrified of the hope of releasing this 1999 remake. It is likely to be assumed that any preceding original can be equal or even equal. Unfortunately, my concern was well established: this movie is frustrating. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people in this movie are thinking. John Day Bont, who points out "Speed", seems optimistic, believes that he has acted as "very popular" (or perhaps worse), "twister" and "speed 2: cruise control". "Hey John, takes cinematography, yes? Doctor Liam Nixon played an adequate role in his role - to be attracted to a doctor - sleep psychologist - I do not think he can turn into a real bad performance - but he can not even save a lang script. And the weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones proves again (as she did "entrapment") ), Who does not have the ability to climb up to the elements given in his hands. "The X-Files," is an episode of the best actress female lead Elina, which is hidden on the edge of the unhealthy edge. And the blonde man, whatever she is, Wooden carved children in wood around wooden houses are ridiculous than wooden statuettes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The house really Uture mental condition was the result of the uncertainty of whether or publisher elyanara. No joy can be seen in the fact, a lot of imagination goes away - "The cenjilim" and "The Blair Witch Project" as a symbol of great horror movies. In this updated version, we can certainly get CGI Ghost Records, which basically makes the film completely helpless (facing weak script / plot). F / x is not too cool, they consider it done by ILM. Frozen breathing looks especially fake. The effects of the underrated Peter Jackson film's "The Fighterers", which I saw right before, were a lot better. Children's carvings, which seem to be vague appearance, are simply silly (especially when they are screaming), and do not have to write about CGI monitors. Rather than providing relief from bad acting, bad side, and bad writing, the effect only adds to this world of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: When three characters enter Alan's bedroom, and none of them seem surprised to find a huge scowling monster chasing on the bed. This scene where "see" the former lady of the Hanging house of Alan Street ... acting here is particularly bad. And at least, but at least, some strange, somnolent, somnolent sounds, where the winding Blond Guy sounds tragic, an unknown shout says, the furniture gets broken into a piece, and the house moves away from the painting of the old, evil person. We got some satisfaction in this scene, just like a few seconds of his attack, Blond Guy dragged the old man into a fire and quickly cut his head in his lung. I was the only part of this movie that I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> "Hunting" in 1963 3/10 stars.
