- Let me start by telling me that I understand that the attack on Star Crishers was considered as a parody of the 50s science-film. I understand that it will not be taken seriously. My problem is that it does no work. Be a parody funny and this is not just one. It's not as full runtime as once I crack a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I could not find a slew of entertainment anywhere in Starbish attack. <br /> <br /> - I knew I had trouble from the beginning. The two "stars" make their screen with an organs of imaginable disappearance - a water hose that they can not control, which both of them get wet. These two Bowery boys come off as wannabes. Why would anyone want to do the work and personality of the bride's age is outside of me? From superb starters to at least, movies show the continuity of curiosity cheeses, Indians, vegetable males, decoder rings and other mixed bits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is an Academy Award winning element in comparison to Star Wars.
