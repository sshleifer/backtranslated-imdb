There is really no need to start this little review with a plot synopsis. Meaning, Shakespeare Hamlet for love ?? Perhaps one of the best known plays written. I do not feel embarrassed to reach this version of Hamlet, how many people are there in IMDB? 3000 by Mystery Science Theater. Though the show can not be the best place to judge the film, but in this case I can not try to watch it without the comedic clips. In this case, the German version of Hamlet's German version is frustrating. 15 minutes? No way! I want to spend about three hours to be very dark and depressed. I've done it many times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining. However, for what I felt it would give some points which were some good acting. About me right 3/10 words. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy MSST 3, the more they do not help their comments make Hamlet more beautiful. There are some good riffs there and there, but overall, just wrong movies for Hamlet MSST 3K. Shakespeare is too stupid to allow a kind of comedy like a long or stream. As soon as it hurts me, I will give Hamstate 1/5 to my MSST3 rating scale.
