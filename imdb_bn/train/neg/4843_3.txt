Well, I've also read all the breathless reviews and heard the comments about how this image deserves Oscar, so I went to see it today. What a big disappointment! 1) If you read another review, you will learn from the members of the US military who was served in Iraq, how potential are the events of this film. They reflect my own thoughts; As a film I - a completely civilian - started thinking of myself, "what to say? There is no such way." 2) Very few happen in the plots. A new bomber explodes the person who was killed to replace him (a death which is not really explained clearly). The new guy gets an adrenaline nap from his job. His attitude puts others at risk. That's it! 3) This movie is as close to somewhere as demanding. If you want to try one of Bourne's films then try the suspense. If you want to watch a war movie that is mentally strong, try to hire the Goat Tale Spartan, which is about the Vietnam War, and the big forest lancaster (who personally confronted me in a secret supermarket that it was a movie he was very proud of And he saw it as some great work, and which he still has Rahasyodghatanera occult blood, which was definitely the case was widely ignored), or the old black and white classic sync Bismarck WWII, especially in an English language film, is incredible, heart-twisting. Hit Locker does not find your time.
