In the house What about the jimkata that is not already? This is nothing but pure clasp from beginning to end. If you want a movie that keeps you laughing, it's a perfect movie. From Cabot's wild-style mullet / sweater combo to Parbatistan (and it's four billion mixed ninjas), everything about this film reeks shit. Directed by Robert Claus, in the infamous mind that you brought the mirror scene in Bruce Lee's Death of Death, he again showed his complete lack of talent genius. From the other Cartianian to Tadashi Yamashita you will not see a few more faces for your pleasure, although you do not remember them or take care of them after the movie ends. It is believed that based on a book titled "The Terrible Game", if I find a single trace of its existence, then I would be interested to read it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book is clearly a picture of Jimkatar's imagination. Probably a clouse has been created to sell his hair. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and make Yakmallah for yourself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a few.
