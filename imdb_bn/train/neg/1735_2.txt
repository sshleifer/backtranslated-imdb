I get the sense that this zombie producer has ever been made the most painful, ridiculous Western. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any actor could not afford to be enjoyable performance. Production prices were great, which could only highlight horror stories and screenplays. The things I hate: Stuart Granger was so small like the West, his British accent, the decorated party, and the white white holes tied around his neck always fools. The dude and his son were tired just like hungry and insulting granger, and he never spoke or answer. I know that we want to postpone mistrust and congratulate the West as symbolic morality, but with the humorous unrealistic and predictable scenes it has broken the spelling, eventually being the worst where Grenzor miraculously, rapidly and alone, dynamite surrounds a Canyon that passes through bad guys cows And then Gray Keep yourself in perfect place so that she can shoot dynamite from far away so that rock slides are slaughtered and cows and bad guys roam, probably destroying them all. Two main bad guys Everything about the next worst conspiracy is, which is loaded in the soap opera scene. There is nothing believable in the movie: I could not believe what all the conflicts were. The bad guy was driving his head in the market and the cows wanted to chew some grass along the way; Do not see why I have not been doing anything. For that you need a land ownership dispute? It does not bother to see it.
