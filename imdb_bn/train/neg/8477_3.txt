I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the letters were stereotyptical, and the whole idea was a packet of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a lost girl, whom she does not send anywhere, where she is not related. The whole place hates it and makes it worse that a hot guy does not like it at all (well, the whole school can not stand you). Surprisingly he gets a way to make his plus choice with fitness and everyone, gets the guy to fall head over to love heels with her. Then comes the choice, where she will choose between image skating and hockey. He liked hockey and then he went to skating nationals and became an Olympic team. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so unexpected that you know what will happen before. It was so terrible that I was almost in the pond, and when I finished seeing it, I had tremendous headaches and had the desire to shoot myself for such a bad look. If you are not under 10, or actually do not see it like crappy twin movies.
