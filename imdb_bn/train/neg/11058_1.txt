Frustrating and arbitrary genre crime films, ruthlessly portrayed actor Jeremy Renner plays the title of Jeffrey Dahmer's title, one of the most recognizable digital serial killers of the last century. Direct video released in early 2003, "Dahmara" is an obscure, annoying, poorly played and virtually bloodless graduation festival of an extra criminal dramatization that is never confused with the psychological and psychological mentality of the late mass murderer. It was such a perfectly good prospect! However, I have tried to try for unknown reasons, some sympathy is expressed in the audience, which can be astounded that, finally, the appearance of a lonely, intensive and serious socially dissatisfied gay frustration that is simply 'cold, counting and humiliated She was crazy for love in all the wrong places and she was crazy! Overall, the "Dahmaar" of 2003 is one that can go off the crime of real crime everywhere because when I do not have fun, I do not joke that it is one of the serial-killer biology! It is even worse than other kind and exploitable direct video video trash like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker". (Turkey-Zero Star)
