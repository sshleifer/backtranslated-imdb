I do not buy kungfu movie for a plot. I buy them for battle scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for the wonderful battle scenes, but not on any other side. <br /> <br /> The story was beautiful, but it went very slowly for my taste. There were about 3 or 4 medieval battle scenes, each lasting just a few minutes. The last war was a bit more, but at that time I was so annoyed that I could not even pay attention.
