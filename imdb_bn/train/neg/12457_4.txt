It seems like Salvatore can not decide what to do with the film: it's a very weak thriller (and I say so weak), an attempt to explore relationships between some of its main characters. Both things have been tried in mental thrills, but in this case, the film can not hold things together due to poor, simple scripting, bad acting and very dark, very crippled cinematography. I used to say that Salvatores gave her best in other stages and other settings, where she was free to see the characters without thinking about the plot. Overall, a B-movie, a very low price for your money ... Vote: 4/10
