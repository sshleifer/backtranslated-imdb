Has the Irish ever done with film distributors that they want to represent the country in such an insulting country? This movie started in Irish cinematic clich√©s as a primer for filmmakers: uneducated priests, spit before handshake, beef, town snakes, and indigenous indie reindeer music through cycling. Fast, however, it has become visible that the main theme of the movie is the Big Daddy-Religious Conflict of Irish Cliches. It expresses the concern of a protesting woman, who wants to decide where her Catholic-child is educated, which would seem reasonably enough, although she can not live with the villagers of '5 County Wexford. Instead of sending them to Catholic school, he left for Scotland's Belfast, where some of the claws were reconstructed. Although he was there, his father (who looks sharp like George Lucas) and the family gets boycotted back home, which is very bad. I'm not going to give up, because I think people can see this movie, but it's not too funny. One of the problems of the film is the central character: we want to be sympathetic to him but instead he is asked to live. Villagers appear as such a big party, whose challenge should stand, but your kids seem like feeling neglected about it. In addition, it seeks to comprehend the peace process of Northern Ireland in present-day India, when it arises unjustifiably, it means: The woman is told to her lawyer that she must "fix pre-conditions" to return to her. Though the film is based on a true real story, its themes have been dealt with more deliberately, and lesser shelter in previous hackneyed cliches.
