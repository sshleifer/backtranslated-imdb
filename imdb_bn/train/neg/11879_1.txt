My wife and I rented this movie because some people were parallel between it and "office space". Blockbuster and IMDB even preferred "office space", but it was also called "recommended" selection. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen office spaces perhaps 15 or 20 times. I love it It's probably one of my favorite 10 movies. Wicked, ridiculous, and featuring characters that remind me of people that I've worked for years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "Office Space" which they both film. That match is matched. We were probably sitting within the first 50 minutes of HT, this is the benefit of suspicion, hope, no, * prayer * it would be better. It's not We could not take it anymore, I closed the tape. Thanks alah it was a free rental. If we have been P *** *** we'd actually pay for it. We should be rewarded for it to sit through. Now, we did not see it in the end, perhaps it miraculously came together and rebuilt itself. I suspect it. <br /> <br /> Highway tunnels are so bad that it is very hard to believe. The film is so painful that it is painful. Just mail the fridge characters !!! The courtyard is asinine. Comedy horror. We got up to "the printer did not work" and had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This photo is a commitment to Josh Cornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are an office space fan ... do not waste your time with this time. 0/10
