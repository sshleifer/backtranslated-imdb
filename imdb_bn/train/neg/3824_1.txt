I think the film has not historically represented Smith. The goal of this film was to tell Smith's life as "comfortable" to LDS church leaders, historical accuracy seems to be of little concern. The film was designed as a "promotion of faith" experience, not Smith's balanced view of "as a human". To study Smith's life, I have taken it myself and read LDS activities and nobody works in LDS. Like most LDS projects, the film is beautifully portrayed and performed well. However, it was not a realistic screenplay at the beginning of the small life of Mormonism or Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith was given a significant time when he was seven years old at the time of the accident. Although this incident was not in doubt about the formation of his mental outlook, it seems that the main reason to include this film is to establish a sympathetic viewpoint of Joseph Smith. Another point, Smith's two-year illustration, was that in the 1820s, the involvement of magical practice in Smith's family was silent. Another problem is that when the film shows Joseph Smith well enough to enter the wrestling competition, he sometimes misses his mood and fails to show that he becomes violent. <br /> <br /> I could go. This film was not historically in any way and should be regarded as a fabulous film about a man. I would not recommend watching these movies for any other entertainment purpose.
