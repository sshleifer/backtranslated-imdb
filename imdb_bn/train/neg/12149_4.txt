Providence, set in Rhode Island, feeding the public, malicious appearance of the role of the government in the media. Best of all, how America can try to control the media during the Iraq war, but it seems to have ended Hollo. There is really no excitement in the story and acting is never very good. Worst, the direction of the movie is frustrating, the weird camera gets more attention on the corners, which fails to reveal anything beyond "it is not an impossible way to keep the camera." Special effects are very bad ... At one stage the explosion video shows the green screen on the city and it is the best ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This picture has some brighter stains ... such as ads for post-zombie services (including recovery services and a party bus). But it is very little for the film to be good. <br /> <br /> Try to hide and creep for a good zombie movie. It has the same poor production value, but there is a lot of intelligence, humor and talent behind it.
