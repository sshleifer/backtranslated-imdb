Returning to my days as a "personal lesson" that I played on the 4-day plaque. It was a sleeping hit selling Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I did not see it pretty much but saw that it was on the cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I saw for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies and that made me look very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The original story is a teenage boy, Kristel, her sexy maid (Sylvia). He also sees the attraction of the boy, but for the worse reason. So we saw the boy wearing his clothes and invited him to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he breaks the cloth, he responds "fearing" or when it touches it becomes horrific. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's just say that it has entered into death, the body is being burnt ... I can go but it will become more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have never seen sex scenes. Although Eric Brown was elderly, he found that he looked like a child. It seems that she can kiss a woman (if she is acting then I should think of Brown's criticism) and it just came very close to being a boyfriend on the pornographic border. Miss Kristel was nice with clothes and outside, but I did not stop so much from sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Speaking alert ** I must mention the last scene. To me it is only a vague sick, but I can feel the audience happy by making film fridges and merging credits. Our hero returns to school and starts a fertility with a female teacher. He asked him for dinner, and Tom Cruz asked him to see him. She nods positively and she walks away, smile smiles at the camera. Give me a break Yes, I am sure that all teachers will take the risk only for a straightforward looking teenager. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal of this movie in 1982. Of course, it was more than nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed the box office. And appreciating this movie 22 years ago, these same teenagers are now helping corporate stairs and probably run this country. That's a scary thought.
