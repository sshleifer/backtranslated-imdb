Elephant dream is considered to be the main project of the open source community. And this idea was a very interesting idea, in fact it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The image is rendered nicely, which is probably the only release factor. A huge problem with them, however, is a huge overruse of light bloom. It's terrible, though I guess it helps in providing a dream-like quality to the film. <br /> <br /> One thing to remember is a terrible voice. Proge Voice Actor At least half-capable, Emo's voice actor deer. I guess when I have a budget that's basically zero amount, you can not afford to hire real voice actors. I feel like they have appointed an animator to his voice. <br /> <br /> Completely, the movie really does not go anywhere. I think it's more than a real movie "Movie Can Do It". The plot goes somewhere and really fails showing any interesting points. The whole movie seems to have made it an excuse to create interesting interesting areas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall it can be downloadable from official sites, but do not expect anything other than fantastic graphics.
