I found the reason for the death of this DVD 10 pack. You will love those contract packs. Even if there is genuine remasting, recovery and not all Hu-Hack features and movies are usually in full-frame pan and scan formats, there is no denying that there are always some gems. And by "Gem", there are some good shit I have always seen, especially if the film is Madness from 70ss. <br /> <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title scrolls rolled out to Paul's Dr. Tarar's torture dongjon. Does not matter, really, shit strap is a whip, is not it? Yes! But this film is not true completely worthless. There are some foxy elements here and there, and obviously Flick has a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The open title sequence cools down with its colorful negative rice with a cheap TV color. Dialogue is always pleasant. At the beginning of the film, horses and buggy drivers came out to move a dead tree stamp in the middle of the street. "What power!" Tell us heroes Funny, then, when they come to make this peculiar fun, then this fianc√© wacky woodsmen can not stop. You will not forget that this person was not even in the film until he finally reaped the crop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a bad cartoon music which is three years old enjoyable. And why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? I said that during the time of my sleeping when the horse and the garden attacked forest fixes, they pulled a stupid homemade ghost with a stick in the middle of the street and closed the yoke. What a bad situation Oh yeah, lots of boobies will be seen, also, who dig those things for you. Boobies, bad dialogue, and vicious music. For me the best palace of the Madness. It's good to have at least one philosophy, and if you did not drink or drink a few, it could be a lot better. I can not say that I was ever bothered to see it, but I can not deny that it is also a major concern. Kinda is not like a magical mystery trip but with a plot. Hmm <br /> <br /> and Mr. Chicken PWNZ
