The story goes from Antwerp to the lives of ordinary people, their lives. So I said it, and there is nothing else to tell about the story. The movie is fast, like MTV-Flick and is a good photo and we think the director will be talented and more movies. So, forget it and hope for the next Deuss-Barman picture.
