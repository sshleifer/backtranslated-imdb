All right, first of all, I'm a huge zombie movie fan. I love Romero Flickr and have been able to recreate the dead. So when I told every single critic of this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hate Resident Evil and it may not be a particularly great movie, but I did not enjoy it if it brought half a decent plot like a funny zombie shoot. This, however, is pure shit. Inserted into horror dialogue, half-ass plot, and in the video game scene. Those who were in their right mind had a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I've used very few words) that I've enjoyed is the Jurgen Prokov as Captain Kirk (Ugh). Although his name throws out the originality outside the window, you can see his performance that he knows that he is in a horror movie and he can do well. They all are working like Shakespeare. And very bad I could have added Basically the only reason this monstrosity will see is only if you have a.) There is a huge junk buff and each zombie flick will be created or B will see.) MST3K, like to play home games. Watch it with friends and be ready for numerous unintended smiles. <br /> <br />
