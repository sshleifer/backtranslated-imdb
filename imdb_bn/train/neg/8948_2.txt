'Ninin Eighty-Four' is a film about a future society in which the government controls everything and no one can believe it. This is a very dark film, and it's one that will not feel good about yourself. It is about taking romance in this society and being confident about betrayal of lovers and human nature. The film is a very good idea and this community is well-versed in color with bold tune (in contrast to happiness and bright color in dreams) and with the general feeling of loneliness through objects, people and places. However, despite the finesse of filmmaking in portraying this idea, the film was very slow and it does not seem completely convincing. It spent rather clever time than telling a story.
