A spoiler <br /> <br /> Three words can you guarantee a terrific film? Cheap Canadian Production. Brine fits perfectly those words. Horror scripts, stupid acting and sunny special effects are required for each BAD movie fan. Horrible hilarious The post production team looks like giving it up. Brian is the pretty second half, it actually tries to be good! What a bit of fascination and adjusting can save a joke already? <br /> <br /> It's almost Christmas time. One mother and daughter killed one of the most funny villains. Days later, a rebel teen is sent to mental analysis that gets into adequate troubles. <br /> <br /> If a policeman's head is cut off and the blood and unknown blood and blood cells on it tell you that some children did it, who would believe? What happens when Brian turns to be serious when the funny turns active and ends tired as the end? A child can not be scared by scary moments. Try to try a very interesting in Brine and be broken. Psycho-research institute is bigger than big production plants! Our ugly villain and his colleagues I've seen get the credit for pulling some of the worst performances. Viewer discretion is widely advised.
