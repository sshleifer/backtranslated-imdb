Black people become wealthy white people, and the wealthy white people seem to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "fun" moments in this movie are closed. My problem is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> No one can catch such a dead body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I'll give that donation. But at the same time, it goes far away from the other side. I am asking a rich white guy to sing and imagine the things that are moving upwardly, is he playing like a hip-hop culture and people accept him *? And what about Sonny, who loves him * as a rich white man, even though he does not care for his money or power? It is so incredible that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> I could not suspend my suspicions and I could not finish the film. I added an extra star because it lets me laugh at times, even harder. But I just could not find something like "Hip Hopping the White Guy" which has never worked well in a film that I found it trying. This was no exception.
