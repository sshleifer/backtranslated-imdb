Chester Gould's famous comic strip in the live-action cartoon (Batty himself led as a square-Javed Intelligence) In the sweet perspective of the innocent Nostalgia - Verne Batti, an unusual and interesting director from Warren Batty, intended. Unfortunately, the pictures need ham, fun for a while but finally tedious. Dick Trashy Big Boy Caprice Mobster tries to bring down, loving Tess trouted up but tricked up by evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or more, the Oscars-winning industry's directions and set designs are wonderful to absorb, but since plot cricks are predefined (not including any real sting of writing), things begin to narrow. Al Pacino is astonished, the Oscar nomination is the son of Captain Oskar Moody, and Madonna (who is mostly used as a decoration propose), enjoying the song "Sonar or Letter (Always Always My Man)", which is the best original song. Many hearts, thanks to Batiyya - who devoted himself to his attitude - but the film was very quiet and counted. It lacks heat. * **** to 1/2
