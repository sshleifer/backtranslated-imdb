All right, so, some, somewhere, some years ago, it seemed like it would be better to create a good IMX movie, which is riding on Apple 11 and moving towards the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want artists to provide hardware for their home affairs. As far as I can tell, rockets and launch hardware were going on. The general graphics were pretty good - the rocket launch made me feel better, like a good rocket launch always (my popular mechanics flying car gearhead blood is still strong) and 3D was quite effective. The quality of the CGI pixzer was not, but it was generally good. The flies were medium-sized anthropomorphic, some semi-donkeys were thrown for 60-character color (Hoppie flies, African-American giant flies with Afro and black shades) and maggots look more like a grub with the child's head (though they Properly made the words of squoching roughly). <br /> <br /> Authors certainly did not do their homework, aggressive and outdated clich√©s (60-second gender politics mostly in vain female characters, ethnic rhymes, bad Russians, a fat fly only wants to eat, grade-to-level gross-out humor) . In a film aimed at IMX, they took a great opportunity to squeeze in some educational material about physics and spacecraft - they did not get the right to their physics (please zero on the Moon module during the landing time.) They 'even the original radio transcript in Houston and astronauts Do not be disturbed by reading, all of which are in the public domain ; Instead, they wrote their own conversations, which said bad words. <br /> <br /> But we like maggots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 5
