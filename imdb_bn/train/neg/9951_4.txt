Johnny and Jeremy are the type vampires. Of course, the fangs Minus. They are not better than the dark, the corrupt creatures, spreading their own woes. Through their character (i.e., a sharp tongue and a fat wallet) they entice frustrated souls, those who suffer and hunt. Based on this black comedy it is less or less. <br /> <br /> This is not a combination of black humor which I can easily subscribe, because partly it bothers me to imagine transforming it into viewers. sleazy, main character. However, I enjoyed the sounds and tunes of fast-fire (and supposedly malicious) comments. I was very fascinated by casting cast, especially David Tholis; Only Jeremy's character felt very two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and on Monday, work very well together. <br /> <br /> How do I really close it about "naked" (and because of which I will not recommend to anyone), it is repeatedly that it is not possible to defame a person from the wrong. In other words, in a world which is so bad, gives some pain to girls, what difference does it make? In order to recommend (such as someone on this website) that the person is not so cruel that he is not as rough as women in Jeremy, I feel completely stupid. They are both terrible, nasty people And they are particularly interested in hitting the women in the competition. Someone could forcefully say that Johnny gets what he has finally received, as his bad actions suddenly came back and bit him in the ass. But still, her and Jeremy's toxic behavior is treated in a certain degree as a ridiculous issue. And I could have been wrong, but I guess the majority of those who love this movie are considered to be dark hilarious.
