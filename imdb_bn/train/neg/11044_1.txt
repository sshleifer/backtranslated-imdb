Appeared as 'Hydrophosia' in Australia, this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you will be hypnotized and show it to the end, just see if it can get worse ... and do it! The story is considered to be written by the high school dramatic class, although the sets are unfortunate but slightly better than the smaller ones and the played wood. <br /> <br /> The child seems to have been stolen 'Muppet' from the cupboard of 'Total Recitation'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shame the head with shame. He probably needed money!
