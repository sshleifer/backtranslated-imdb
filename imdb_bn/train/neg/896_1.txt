This picture is awful. Offensive but not very expected. This movie follows the family in a small town in the mid 60's. The headmaster of the school is going through a medieval crisis. Write a nice teacher from the big city, who begins to challenge your students with some thoughtful stuff, such as think for yourself. The chief teacher does not agree with his teachings but he is beautiful. You can connect the point. Her teenage daughter (Winona Ryder Wangbye Terra Frauderic) wants to get bored and live with the small town lifestyle. She gets some bad advice, quarreled with some bad boys, and apparently family planning was not taught in her school. Damn it! Seeing director Paul Shapiro chiefly working on TV, the film is playing like a more mature version of a special episode of sitcoms specially or later in school.
