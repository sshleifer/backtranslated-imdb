This movie is as soon as traditional Bollywood fare as star power, feeling and emotional love triangle. What really irritated me about this movie is that the mother of the mother is the ruthless idea. A whore does not have a hired mother (for the child's family) with a child having sex with someone after sex. She is not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen Indian films and television shows that have been created 10 to 15 years ago, have tackled this matter more intelligently. The whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous and absolutely impossible. I understand that most Bollywood movies are not good creators, but they can not be both. This movie wants to see us with characters, but it can not be done with such ridiculous, contradictory contradictions. I expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
