For almost 14 years, Sharon Stone has provided a leg-crossing to the viewers who have bitten the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, he plays again. The "Basic Institute 2" series featuring a sexy Stone and a weaker "Basic Institute" featuring Michael Douglas is a swimmer. However, the original fans may not even be close to it, since the "Institution 2" is a painting film, because Michael Katon-Jones, the medieval director was killed in the murder of the first movie heir. <br /> <br /> The film's plot starts at the beginning of the car exploding. Catherine Trumel (Sharon Stone, trying to forcibly see sexy) seems to be involved in a suspect and murder. A psychologist (terrible David Morrishey) was appointed to test him, but eventually fell for the close game of temptation. <br /> <br /> And there is no other explanation except that this basic power is this "instinct". Nothing is not explained and we will sit through a sleazy, C-Class erotic film. Sharon Stone plays his first role where he closes most of the time. Its part is due to amateur writing, unexpected direction and terribly less chemistry. The movie is unclear dialogue and more sex than the first entrance to this series (a train scene has been cut so that it is not rated NC-17). "Institution" is a compulsory torture. <br /> <br /> To stop it, everything that is made in the original movie is not available anywhere in a guilty pleasure film. Acting here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here, he gets highly offensive. David Morrisy played the worst role in his life and thought that more than twice the expression can not be made in the film - confused and enchanted. "Institute 2" is an awesome way of continuing to run an original series, which is very well managed to set up the thriller with eutronica. Paul Wehrrowne, how do you miss me .... <br /> <br /> "Basic Institute 2" is never heard like a good movie, and in fact it is not. Some movies never leave the paper, and this is what you feel after seeing it. Now, why Douglas and David Craneberg dropped out and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge check for this is so easy to understand ... ......... 3/10
