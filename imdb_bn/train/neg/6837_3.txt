Generally, I do not like revenge films .... PERIOD. But Double Impact is a little more than your usually retaliation plot seat. You can see, DI's functionality, accuracy, external locale (such as Hong Kong), great gun fighting and enough martial arts that can fulfill your interests for the great influential battle. All revenge is like Flickr, it has villains that want to get out of the plate-glass windows on the top floor of the 40-storey building! However, the Double Impact does not have any provocative shit that attacks plots and elitist, racist, and toxic social stereotypes that attack "eyes for eyes" and "death chem 2". <br /> <br /> Double Impact is transparent in the Plot section as a simple wrap. Chad and Alex's parents had a family friend killed by people's hit squad associated with money problems, or at least it was remembered. Explaining why the guys are speaking French is a shy. It was not a pirate plot to make this movie a bad one, but using cleached lines and other films (from Lethal Weapon to Princess Bride) really makes it worse. But the Double Impact is still watchable. But why are there such villains (for example, the greedy British people who killed Chad and Alex's parents and deadly lesbian Redhead chick) you love to hate your fiber?
