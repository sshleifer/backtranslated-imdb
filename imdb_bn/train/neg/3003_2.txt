We all know that countless duds have been graced 80s slasher style and often deserve nothing without our deep hatred. Perhaps it's a little brawl but if "Slaughter High" was not terribly monotonous, even for a slasher flick. In most cases, a child was involved in this plot, who had experienced a carrier-like shower insult in high school and returned to the prison building to take revenge for a group of former-boleies, all of whom were reminded. As you expect, on April 1, they were killed by a masked madman through a power plant, burn, hanging and chemically modified beer. I found a lot of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but at the end, considering it, to reject my complaints and that it is a waste of time all the time. Ignore any thoughts about watching this movie ...
