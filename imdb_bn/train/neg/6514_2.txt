The film tries to try as a maikumi - shot in documentary form but mostly with scripted parts - but not giving an audience with a character that fails to make the delusion of the material. Also, the film appears to be finding real love in Los Angeles, but there is nothing more than an interest in an amateur artist trying to create his first "big movie".
