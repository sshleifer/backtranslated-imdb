Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington), which means investigations are underway because of its possible involvement in missing money. A bank is looted by master bank thief (Clive Owais) and his team and hostage is held against their wishes, then the detective is forced to surrender the thief ?? One of his shots proves that he is innocent and his position is worthy. Send a secret woman (Jodie Foster) sent with her secret and aims to recover an item from the bank's owned Security Deposit Box, and you have the majority of the three dilemmas. Unfortunately, you get it set up in film, and nothing closes in the end. Denzel Washington is her most uninteresting in an inefficient and distastefully egocentric performance. Only the only store for the film is its supporting co-actor Jodie Foster and Clive Owie, who is much better than the film. Actually, Jodie Foster plays as one of the kind, cruel, throats against the most surprising and high-performance performance type. Clive Owake was not given much in addition to Brude and Poz, but the depth of his presence and achievements earned him more than his unused role. It is weird that the genius of this film is so much lost or lost. When you create this image director Spike Lee thinks what you think. But insidious man's most confusing viewpoint has given it an unreasonable appreciation. For a film to create pre-summertime blockbuster movies, it's terribly flat.
