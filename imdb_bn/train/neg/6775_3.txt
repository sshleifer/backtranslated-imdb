I was happy to find this movie in the local film library - Kerry Grant is a director of a comedy set, director Stanley Donn, what is not liked so far? It's such a movie that surprised me two things - when all of them involved (with some well known names) had a turkey in their hands, and what was the worst thing about it in most of the controversial aspects? Still the first thought, but later my vote goes to the scary story, sometimes with the lack of familiarity between script, uncertain voice, consistent and lacking character, and the lack of relationships between letters. You have to add a very disrespectful act to criticism but it is understood that the actor is fighting with this item and it seems to be under-rehearsed. Often they can rarely get enough of their lines fast. Kerry Grant tries to portray his natural charming and fertile personality but occasionally feels uncomfortable and stacket in his delivery. But not to say that, when played in his early role, his suggestion will be linked to the look of Suzie Parker, who will be uncertainly involved with the fuzzy Jane Mansfield. What about the film? - Mainly for me Parker's beauty works with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking, this picture is beautiful to look at. The marine characters are very smart in their uniforms - but you must be surprised at the terrible black fu screws in their luxurious hotel suites. Even Grant could not see her elegant. Next to the credit, Ray Walton has done a commendable job with her character, and I was interested in hearing a pre-Hogan Heroes Warner climber for the German accused!
