Yes, it sums up about me. This movie was scary. Two minutes I wanted to yaw my eyes out. It has been praised as a "innovative LDS Comedy", but it is not good for the church members too! I do not think any people should be so victimized to see this movie of low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that whatever effort is going on in this movie, no effort. It seems as if it was terribly thrown, thrust, glitches, and trit plots together with crazy adulterations, which are somehow coherently gifted (at least semi-integrated) gifts with gifts. Then, there are acting, which is * boring to everyone * involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Terrible "gags," and many mum "jokes" that their right mind, LDS or no one, should be considered completely * stupid! This will be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
