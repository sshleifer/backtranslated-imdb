This show proved to be a 30-minute valuable DVR hard drive waste. I did not expect much and I actually got less. I do not expect to cancel this event in the second phase, I can not believe that Geoco will try to use the Guha Advertising Campaign again. I wanted to spend one night checking my daughter's hair for head shoes than watching these pieces to deny. I wonder what this surprising pass of the '07 fall schedule, possibly featuring a hospital / crime / informative reality show featuring AFLAC ducks? If I fail to express my opinion about this event, then I must clearly say that it is not very good.
