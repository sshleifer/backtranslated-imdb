I am a sucker for a better romance, but this one does not qualify as well or as a romance. The credit was through before I had duplicate plots. With such weak dialogue, plot and character development, I recommend investing in your hours and other half. For the third time I had to leave the sweatpindi and get this bad taste from my mouth.
