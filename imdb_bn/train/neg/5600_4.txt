Fulci tests and fail with sci fi. Usually its non-awful films we still get a great gore of the sum, but not here. Prisinors are forced to hold on a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop, add too funny scenes like when they are tortured. The man falls down and fits a little over the floor for about two minutes, until his friends struggle to keep him as tall as he gets from the floor. The city is a clear model but not bad. And the last explosion is the best ridiculous. And I did not start with a terrible battle. <br /> <br /> 4/10
