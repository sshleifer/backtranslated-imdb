I went to the movies / it was not bad to see "Bit Street", it was a flash of 'dry' / 'cross grove', I do not think, but when it came to 'Rapin', I draw the line. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is seriously amazed (that's terrible to talk about 80s- just f *). As an emcee, Mario Van Peebles is an actor, and as an actor, Mario Van Pahelles is a hell of a bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Any film that cites itself as a "rapine" is well distributed at the highest standards of childhood of that time. A The 6-year-old was rolling in the ales, even on the day back so much knee-high-to-"webster" -a because this rap is weak, so weak that even the BA or the Comedy Central 10 feet gold rope chain It will touch it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not have a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
