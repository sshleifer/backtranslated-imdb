Although I was dry, I saw what Scott Buckalla saw. At the beginning of this movie I had a high expectation for the classic Chasey, but to enjoy the Scottish-Pyar girl and it's going to be great for 20 minutes to finish. The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very tricky. I crossed my fingers that it would work and it would be all terrible misunderstanding, until the credits were rolling and I realized that a happy and satisfying end is not going to end. Unfortunately, I expressed regret that I saw it and I'm quick to jump some Quantum to restore my belief in the welfare of Great Skots!
