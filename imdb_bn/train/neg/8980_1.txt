I'll never forget the night I saw this movie. We were in a submarine at the post of North Atlantic and this was a scheduled movie in the evening. We all leave after the second relay. Even they did not even try to show in the middle. Instead of choosing for a restoration ...... all of this I have to say really but they have to have ten lines in my comments that they have this fool rule. I will not be supposed to put a comment pad with random words so I will continue to ramble until I get my ten line in BS. I could not get George Goblin listed on the credits, but I remember him in the movie. Sining was terrible and the song was even worse.
