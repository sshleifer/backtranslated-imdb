I saw the first 15 minutes, it was a real documentary (it was an excitedly too dramatic "camera" producer). <br /> <br /> When I realized that it was in all stages, I thought "why do I want to make waste this junk observer at my time?" so I stopped it and came online to warn other people. The characters do not work in a credible way. Too immature emotion He played a child in the war criminal country to travel halfway through the whole world. And I do not believe it because "his character Trade Center was so annoyed with bombings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" Children "? French dark fantasy film that kidnaps a boy and steals their dreams ... I like it!
