This is not the worst movie ever known as "Dead of Hood". There are bad movies there. I see most of the Hong Kong Nigra movies, which is basically an incomplete Japanese police drama, which has the footage of Nine, which can be technically called "a movie". <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater but in the theater. Walking through half way, I really felt that I was walking a bit to set this glass piece in 45 minutes.
