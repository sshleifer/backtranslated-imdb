I grew up with my whole life with Skua Doo, my father, Scott, grew up with oby daw. We just saw the first episode of the quarrels, which call it Shagie and Schubi a source. What Warner Bros is allowed to air this shambles on the planets. My younger sisters of characters may well draw. The story may be well written by my 3-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are too much of the Scooby Doo fans). Scuba and Shaggy Not Just !!!!! If someone without Casey Kasem makes the voice of the sacrifice, it will not work for the people only! Trust me <br /> <br /> This program was disrespectful. What is the new Scooby Doo better? Why change a winner's format. Destroy these pieces of garbage and go back to the true Scooby
