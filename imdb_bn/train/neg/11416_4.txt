Having won the title of the most successful movie in Switzerland's film history, my head cut my head! It's true, but sad at the same time. A glimpse of the Swiss Army could be a good deal. This story seems interesting: Initially, Antonio Carrara (Michael Coach) has been forced to release army forces from the military, Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter), her love for the wedding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Melanie Wingor's strong Michelle Blantky Medieval As his role plays, personally I found him rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The story is a romance comedy, which does not work as expected. The romance-section is very tragic, and the comedy-part is not funny, it's simply a cheap effort and is not changing across the whole movie. It's fun for a 12-13 year old Priyadellent, but for those who do not find recreational comedy. Humor is weak except for some shots. <br /> <br /> dip? Cool! Theft? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about Swiss RS, make sure that you have not yet ended your military training, even if you do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give 4 out of 10, because Marko Rima is very funny during his screen. Although many screens do not have a hell of time
