Yesterday I saw the movie Floyboys and my girlfriend told me that it saw the worst movie ... because I thought it was very awful, so I started thinking - no film I ever saw and it was <br/> <br /> Unfortunately I have seen it even after a few years, I think Dean Kane has reminded a very wrong idea as a fearsome military man (beautiful boy Cain has a lot of jokes Not good). A strange deal with the CGI-Helicopter when it could be cheap to hire a helicopter than to hire some CGI-boys to build, but I guess they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the son of the producer. Like to play with his new computer. And how to look it ?? Awful, terrifying. And when the Dragon Complex charges through the corridor then using the same shots again and again - looks very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
