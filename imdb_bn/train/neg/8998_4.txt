The prot√©gist played and one of the film's writers was Stephen Finnberg. He died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, a year later he told me that he was a writer a year before Hollywood. Works mostly on TV promotions. He told me not to see the 'tunnel vision', but it was too late, I saw it! Actually I got it released, saw it years ago. At that time I did not think that it was a movie bad. But as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yes there is a bit dated dates as well as the Puerile. Steve admitted that this was not a very good movie. She said she was a little proud of the 'proctologist' sketch.
