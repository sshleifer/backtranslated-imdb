This is one of the worst cases of film drill I've seen in a long time. It's so awful that I'm not sure where to start, even if it's valuable. The real problem of the plot, and I'm sorry for 'Sly' as it puts a decent performance for its part. But the plot ... Oh dear, oh dear. I especially manage pops from the foot of the mountain on top of the pop, when the helicopter is running. One day it takes five minutes to ride a couple of times! I could go: But it's not worth it. In addition to the summer opening (which will be five years old even able to predict the results) the rest dissolve Sorry folks, but the film is not as bad as it is around.
