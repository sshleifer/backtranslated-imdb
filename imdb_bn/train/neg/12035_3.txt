I expected this to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was really excited to see this short film. Well, they were not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what it really is I do not like. I guess they sort of dull just sort of. The word disturbs me, and most of the letters, though I love the verdant toxic boy and Steinboo. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Girl's episode of the match probably made me the worst, though it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I do not like anything that some characters die. Likewise, the match girl basically burnt the gas station in the fire or how the girl was killed in stress. Ray's death was astonishing, amusing. Death by a car freshener. Very original ;-) It laughs me so hard <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just some languages ​​and Gore That's all my talk! 3/10
