* Probably Spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by Bai Lake' is a vain movie. The acting was not good and the plot was not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by Lake' is a good TV movie. There was no seagull. Jude Nelson was very good in the first film and did more to do with his character. It seems that he is not interested in sigel. His performance was good but it could be good. I do not really want to comment on the rest of the cast, because in my opinion, they are not significant. But I'll do it. Alice's character is rarely shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly he concentrated next to Stanley Caldwell. The role does not make sense and it should have been a little better thought. Dahlia salam was absolutely terrible. His acting was from below and the cast people should have looked at someone else. Director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seems to have an intention to stay there but it does not seem to have been necessary for his death. Acting for this role was good, something better than Salim but was not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He stumbles on the director and in a short time, the director is running dead and Stanley shows. Yes, somewhere this cricketer is not allowed to come in the film and the film does not end up knowing anything about it. There are some killings, not whole, and it's funny to show. One actress gets set electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character is chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled in a plant before drowning. These writers should work hard for the excitement. <br /> <br /> I just want to say that I am not impressed with the film screenplay. The way that normalized change towards low budget starts to flare very fast. Also, the new cabin by the lake is made weak. We were not shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was vain. It worked in the first film because we were shown more rooms, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There were many letters in this series. There was no reason why they all stayed there except for a few. The little show played was really bad and ... they did not have any purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> To everyone, 'cabin of the lake' is coming back from a signal picking up from where the first left to the left. I can take 'cabin by lake' but this was not just impressive. Jude Nelson should have avoided it and should do so. It did nothing like the first and it completely went too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to pull for the second. Not to mention the writing was horrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The possible third installment in a movie can only be good by itself. Throw in the cakes and we can be okay! <br /> <br /> (The filmmakers do not understand how they have shown how they painted the lake scenes from the beginning, all of them were in the tank, and sometimes the filming is not a secret.) <br /> <br /> < >
