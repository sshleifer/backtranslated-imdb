Okay, man, honestly ... it must be one of the worst movies about beija made, but I can laugh myself (I can enjoy that). Basically, it is the way to achieve sex, sex and your own 15 minute fame. Did I mention that this movie was a sexual issue? If you have a letter of connotation and easy entertainment, watch this movie (and not good for anything) when you get this opportunity. <br /> <br /> *** Attention detonator !!! *** The most fun of the movie is that guy who asked Jerichi that he would marry his goat! Pictures. At a triple for bad taste and fun!
