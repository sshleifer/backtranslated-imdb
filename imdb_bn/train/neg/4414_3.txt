Christopher Durung is certainly memorably taught by Nun, because he can not leave the idea. The game, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all for you" - at least Hollywood - was presented - the same voice as Deanne Keaton's lecture scene Sister Mary was a very bitter, a lighthouse, a strong conviction, a bitter argument of the doctrine and highly judicial noon - and was played by Lin Redgrave, she was delighted. But the film emphasizes that we take this greatness very seriously - when it is mentioned, keep the same voice in the "all this" scene. Clash between two approaches and in the last twenty minutes, the film closes the track, falls into the hole and explodes. There is no survivor. If it could work because of the voice of four former students, and because of meeting them with sister Mary, it was like a miriam scene. Or if sister Mary's view was presented more realistic. In this way simply not all works.
