Spoiler alert! ! ! Personally I did not understand why PT did not help to save William's life, I mean why William was inspired or forced to know. I think the Secret Service member is the person every day, and the author was a member of a rumor secret service, now his motivations are clear, well-known. But this movie will not satisfy you as a rental, old but used twists, average performances - these are just works for this movie, just wait for Clark Johnson as SWAT director for you, this time has done a lot of work like this and I still wonder how the producers (for example Michael Douglas) left the movie in the theater.
