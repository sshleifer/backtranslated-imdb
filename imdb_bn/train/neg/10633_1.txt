I saw this video in a friend's house. I'm happy I do not waste money buying this one. Video cover 1975 is a scene from one of the movie Mapicon. This movie starts with most of the rocket blasts, which is not related to the Manded Flight. Siberal's Smoke Gun is a video broadcasting astronaut's short video clip. Instead of listening to the crew, he edited his voice. This video has ended with an exhibition of the movie Jagatudara. His claim about radiation, protection, star photography, and others believes in me that he is very senseless about NASA, astronaut, or ordinary American people. Her science is bad, and so this video.
