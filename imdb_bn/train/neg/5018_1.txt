I just saw Amber Benson in this picture, though after reading the box it seems like it's a good story ... but the first problem was that it was not a story ... or it was actually a story but in absolutely no sense Made The second problem was that there was no set up for these characters ... Yes, they all went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the film realized that there was nothing in them and they did not like each other. So why do they stay together Error Number 3 ... though the director has a long break and a camera with tight camera shots (usually dubbed with vague lyrics) ... he is sadly mistaken. It was painful to see an awesome actress like Amber Benson that time was lost to bring this life back .... My only hope is that the money that she made has been kept in the making of her own film.
