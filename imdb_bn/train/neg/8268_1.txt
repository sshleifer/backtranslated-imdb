This movie is awesome. It has all been done before. There is nothing original. The authors do not bring their own plots when I can not stand. <br /> <br /> A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmmm, many words like a movie like an 80-like big name. Jennifer Garner's acting is even more annoying. He does not work like 13 years, he works like a fool. <br /> <br /> Since then, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it's just so a friend had her 13 work with her. Wow, how wonderful! But, do not ... try to get his friend bad and his job, active on him. But, of course, he came up with a "good" idea and finally won. <br /> <br /> This movie also has a dancing scene that I saw thousands of times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
