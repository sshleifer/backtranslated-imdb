The horrific Persians are documentary about the treacherous tendency of their huge hills to get grass in grass. Seeing this silent, black and white feature, Oriental music scores were shot in a Twink Twink-Twink piece that was not used in the original exhibition, even blue than it. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is a complete failure of establishing a plot line. I like the nanouk's answer and the fifth march, but despite the similarity of the theme, this movie is trivial. Physical trouble is not just that interesting at all.
