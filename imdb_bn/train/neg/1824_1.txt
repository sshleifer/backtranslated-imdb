I do not persuade Barry Levison, Rachel Wies, Ben Stiler or Jack Black to do this film. It's a word, annoying. Perhaps the more exploited Ben Steller's harmful role or strange funny scenes than this can be expected, the film simply makes some forgetfulness. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ended in a sad way. I was very frustrated. I love Ben Steiler's acting. I like it in most movies, at the end I saw Drew Barrymore with Drewlex and it was not bad. About Jack Black ... Well, I have never seen anything good except him, with high integrity. What about Rock School? Oops, horrible.
