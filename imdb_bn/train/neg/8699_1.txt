Kornosaur 3 bad ... terrible bad. It's funny where the point is bad. How important I am trying to convince myself, I can not believe that anyone on this earth could find this recreational for serious reasons. I mean, come, even cover is bad! OK, special effect is absolutely ridiculous. Those "Carnosaurs" are really ridiculous. A scientist tells the soldiers that they run incredibly fast, but when you see them they run fast ... an actor tried to run as much as possible in a rubber case. And the explosion is funny (there is no other word to describe it). At the beginning, a boy hit a jeep and said, "What was that?" ... and other blasts are ridiculous. But the worst thing is the screenplay and so-called stories. You do not expect a good story (or, I do not think anyone wants a better movie to rent this movie) but at least try to understand the story. I mean, how hard is the story of killing at least integrate people of dinosaurs. You look incredibly difficult to look at this. Oh, and if you think that the Trusted Commando is easy to make your character as easy, then tell this awesome, terrible piece of author's authors. I mean, after a friend of his death, will a person humorize? And they do not do it a lot. And if you think a movie about soldiers killed by dinosaurs can be at least action-packed, wake up !!! This movie is incredibly dull. Carnosaurus (somehow invented the name of this hair?) Attack (in the sequence of annoying steps where you are not seeing too much). Thinking about how soldiers can beat them (in incredible fun scenes where they work hard to be serious, but can not remember more than a second). So, they attack Kernos, but their notion works (another ridiculous verb sequence). The plan in another ridiculous scenario (back with a few lame jokes) plans back. And this goes on, and on, and over. And do not forget that acting as special as acting ... and the story ... Oh okay, this movie sucks just from one to Z. <br /> <br /> <br />
