I have seen this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and I have found that graphic, shadow-masculic, children are scared by pornography. The story line is hidden under many graphic sex scenes - and not least bit lover - more feelings of illness The director is not going for shock value but rather these characters seemed to explore why various levels like this. See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.
