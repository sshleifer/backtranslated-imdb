British 'tradition film' industry is out of control. There is no mistake in filming classic novels, but why should they portray them with a talented dancer? This image was disturbed by the strong story of Orwell, it became a vain, flexible romantic comedy. 'Aspistrra' may not be the best of Orwell's, but no one can forget the extraordinary illustrations of poverty like reading it. Orwell is not only cold and hunger, but insult to be poor. In the novel, London is a smoke, gray, cold, heartless city, and the comsters pray for it to explode by a squadron of bombers. But this film can be annoying in any way, and instead of creating an impressive aesthetic trip to London in the 1930s, all of which are enlightened with the golden sunlight shroud, and even Lameth's slums are protected and freshly opened urchins and happy prostitutes. Cambodak's pigeons have spread in the chocolate-box world, spreading across the streets. The worst is the uninterrupted bonhomie of all scripts, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogues. It's very frustrating because Richard E. The perfect person to play Grant Gordon Comstock and this image is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This photo made me so angry! Britain's literary history is proud of its prosperity, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? Those who want to feel they 'get some culture' when they drink their Horlicks and quietly close off, employ it in soft central, anodyne paps employing bland nobodies.
