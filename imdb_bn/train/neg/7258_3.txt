This great movie has a ritual and you only see one of those facial features. Probably hard to believe, but there is a rural community in Fuquay, southwest of Arkansas, who knows that the legend is true. This story is said in documentary-style described by Verne Stearman and illustrates the actual locations of talking with real people. Instead of telling the legend, but in the late 60's and most part of the 70's, the surrounding area was visited by an animal like Biggut which travels along the buggy crick. With three toes long long and 7 feet high, this annoying creature sometimes causes most of the community 'badgee' to be harmed and afraid. I personally crossed the small carriage bridge in 1974, and yes my hair grew behind the neck. Certainly there was about 1 centimeter in the rain. I was laughing when I reached the Shrewweport.
