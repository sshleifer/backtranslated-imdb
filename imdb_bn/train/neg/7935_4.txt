I bought this movie blind and I was mostly upset that I did what I did, but I would say that it is a low price for some cool death and ridiculous acting. This is not a good movie, but I must say that I was quite happy. <br /> <br /> I said, acting is awful, I think I could do a good job, at least, showing a passion. The story has nothing new and has been good. I guess I have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film. I do not want to rent this or download it but definitely do not buy it. It does not have multiple clock prices.
