How many times do we have to walk walking in the background and see the mirror reflecting the wheel? It has been made in two dozen movies in recent memory and four dozen times in this sticky, poorly performed film. There were only two peculiar moments when fans attacked two private spaces. While talking about the characters, the acting 64-digit Diet was flat as a coke. Cup I was drawing from it. Side characters may be drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. Friendly, old sheriff was there. Along with the Alabama drill, the back survival kaki was weird. Lotots'characters with no development The most annoying image was at the beginning of the murdered child. But instead of looking for the child's murder, it was interesting, they could only tell us that he was dead and spent a hard time reconciling his death with his parents community. When they arrive in the cabin, the scenes are flowing very rarely .... The picture of the dead girl is interacted here and there with thrills. Oh ... and the words of eerie were overdone. You know what I mean ... that the doors open itself, in the forest, coincidence, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh That's not seen before. Again, you'll again see amazing self-opening doors on a movie over. Notice the Director: This is a scary scene, if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of this thing before calling "It's a Wrap!"
