My only problem with the musical version of "Les Miserbels" is similar to "Oliver". Instead of writing musicians in the stylistic period of the game's settings, they simply wrote Broadway-type songs, which were historically unreasonable and skewed stylistically. <br /> <br /> Do not mix well with some of the vicinity ditties, which carry scores of dramatic shameless cruelty and dishonest activity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fagin performs its traditional routine properly, although it has the slightest foundation of its period of time when he is compelled to sing. <br /> <br /> "Give him an orthodoxy and pressure as long as he needs me". Two large production numbers, "Who will buy" and "consider yourself" seem to be everything except everything except the kitchen sink. It has to go together, but the other must cross the line. <br /> <br /> Most of the novels do not seem to give credit to such ditties and dance photography by depression, frustration and atrocity itself. Though the novel is considered to be classic, I must admit that I have problems with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, his work has been emitting negative vibration. This can be due to the expansion of his personal life of happiness, which was full of frustration and sorrow. <br /> <br /> All the genuine talent of this product is not behind the camera, but depending on the undefined nature of the original element. All of this experience an uncomfortable down experience for me. <br /> <br />
