The fantasy of annoying children, giving the billing strain to the Joan plathite but doing so little. Happy children follow their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and baseball player (yuk) and runs for the best friend Helel girl - she's 13! Completely pedestrian, as well as sum of sympathetic performance by the boys as well as the baseball boys. Certainly less effort for showtime --- no limits?
