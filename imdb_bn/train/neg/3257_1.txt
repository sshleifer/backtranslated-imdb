The first question to be inspired in my mind after watching the film is: Is it ridiculous? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and Comic series, I knew this movie was not meant to be ironic. So, the story tells us about an American American super-doc, which protects the Republic of South America from being evil. Words like a common story But this one comes in an unrealistic way that became ridiculous. The mandatory last fight shows the worst representation of martial arts I've ever seen. The film can be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.
