Carnosor 3: Primary Species (1996): D. Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Jeanette Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Pack, Roger Halston, Terry J. Von, Billy Burnt. Even why boring review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie where top secret military people discover deadly (and very fake appearance) prehistoric monsters in the hope of killing people in a lethal way. The original was bad enough, Siegel was even worse. It is not related to the previous Carnosaur movie, though it reads somewhere. RATING: 10 out of 2 graphic violence and gore, grisly images, and r red for prejudice.
