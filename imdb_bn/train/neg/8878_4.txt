Goldy won the gold in 1950, and the film version of George Cooker of "Georgi Kikor" dried up and the carrier again tried to find enough good things to allow gold strikes. <br /> <br /> never happened. "It should be done with you" (I can not remember the mischief title), there is still more variety on holiday, which is probably not all after a muted, but everything about this movie seems warm and half-hearty. Even Jack Lemon, which I believe was his first film role, could not provide enough energy to enlighten this reused comedy. The listener knows that the film will end up virtually from the beginning, so most of the time it just waits for the movie to wait. <br /> <br /> If you're a fool of Holidide, you'll enjoy it; Otherwise I do not bother. <br /> <br /> Grade: C.
