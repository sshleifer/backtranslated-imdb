The "secretive" section was to return to the famous appeal of the same name in the pyg-back of Larryd's magazine, when Labor was involved with the investigation of the satirical theme title day Congress. However, despite the A-grade B-movie cast and some good script ideas, the film is still for 73 minutes. It's a cheap-jack all the way to the production. What is needed to stop poor manufacturing prices is something imaginable, especially from uncognitive director Syndny Salko For example, location shots of some day talks will help Daryt to relieve the heir of the studio set. A stylish Helmsman like Anthony Mann could do something with thick-ears ingredients, but Salkow treats it as another payday exercise. It is very sad that Brian Keith's ideal low-end style does not work here, it is only being rendered as wood and neutral, while at the same time, the noble Elisha Cook Junior drags to the wild with the wild eyes. Clearly, Salco is not an actor director. However, you must hand him over to a small number of Beverly Garland, which plays a role in character commitment and dedication. Too bad, he was not charged. My advice - skip this, unless you are ridiculously bar girls who do nothing else, but in general street-jacket 50s will ruin the whiskey.
