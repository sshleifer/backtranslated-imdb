Writer-director Tony Picerillo is a man directly to his own game, recently a widow who has taught HIV-positive for the last three weeks; If he ever found a gay private partner, he took him to an apartment and was related to him, the man was forced to take a blood test and the results returned positive if he promised bloody revenge. Curious idea sounds good on paper outside of the game. The prisoner of James Merceden is actually cruel and brutal, but the actor's own artificial methods are frustrating - it's a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with a more challenging role, but his personality-shy person does not have to look at the kidnappers, and there are no conversations between the two men. Mersheden's gay party boy is certainly not helpless - he is a little sympathetic to the problem of Speedman - but he does not react or behave like a gay man in this situation. The film is not really a cop-out, but it's a fraud, bad editing, poorly-conceived flashbacks, low budget production, and big fins that deceive a stupid trend and soap melodrama. * **** to 1/2
