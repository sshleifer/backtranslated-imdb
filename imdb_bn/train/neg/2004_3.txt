I read the book many days ago and especially do not remember the plot, but remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm sick at home, it's a good idea and hey !! This is a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> This film has been associated with grade B actresses and actresses. I did not see the show but there are lots of ads for the show and I got the answer. Is there nothing more? Sure, but not Lifetime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> With a man, for his life, and what does he do? Kicks him into the testicles What else Women love to but tell me something about girls ... it is not always easy to see. <br /> <br /> It was not bad at all. I got a time or two of cools so I have credit with that one.
