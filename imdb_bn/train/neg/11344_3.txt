I was very disrespectful with Cinderell 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it's probably worse than the title. First of all, I did not like animation, very Saturday-morning-cartoon, only bad in some scenes. I liked some letters, such as Thunderbolt and Patch, but other letters like Crowley were moderate. Creula was originally really terrible, but she lost her quality in the sigale. There was nothing to write about what he said and his animation was ugly. Also his artist Mike Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger started leaving smoking overnight. Without the exception of Jodie Benson, voice talent was very good, especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, pronounced it destroyed for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot swelled for me, and an elaborate TV episode was extremely inspiring. Above all, one of the most memorable and frustrating scenes in the jungle book with Disney films of the 1960s was a great disappointing trend. Sorry, I can only give it a 3/10, it was not just my cup tea. Bethany Cox's Bazar
