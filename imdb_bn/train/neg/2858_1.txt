This will be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were awesome, the B-movie and the effect were only slightly Nintendo 64 qualified. You think they will make more effort on this. Of course, this is a CC channel movie so you have to expect this low rate, but it takes a cake. Hell, I still smile. Therefore, as a shake-your-head in unbelieving film, this one works well. <br /> <br /> While there are some 'known' actors and actresses, I find it hard to believe that the quality of this movie was not valuable for their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics may be good in the 60's or even in the 70's but it's coming in 2009! I do not abuse, let's just say that if you played "Jurassic Park" in Nintendo 64, then you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It must take 2 hours to sit through this thing
