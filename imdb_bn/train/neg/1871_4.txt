A trick to watch this image, despite the unprecedented production numbers and wonderful clothes. The murder-mystery plot is simply a vehicle to mount the number of musical instruments, but it often involves suspending the proceedings as well. Although apparently spent a lot of money on them, the figure was badly illustrated and badly photographed. This is probably a pre-film film because the girls often wear very low cost and even singing a singing song! Karl Brisson looks beautiful on musical instruments but performance is a single note, but when Victor McLaughlin as luittent wants to see the churches for a high-speed signal, you can throw it in the towel or at least speed forward next to the next. During the Liberation War, the autocrat father trapped in the movie!
