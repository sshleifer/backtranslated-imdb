I could not believe some of the horrific dialogue left out of the human face, and the last part of the bluepers attached to the body of the film was really a hoot. And we got TT shots to boot Angelel Petizon (sorted) and Lorraine Crabbree. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by Angel's Petizon brings an alien container to an underground lab in the desert. According to director Fred O'Ren Roy, they were Claus Kinsky Films, the rest of the set from Android, which gives an extra value beyond what is worth the film. <br /> <br /> Inside the container, a midgut alien (boy played by Ray) who starts killing people. It was fantastic to see this little 'animal' in the black black reptile suit, which, like big beetle shells attached to it, is almost running in the dark. We can see even small things stamps and tear on ET's poster, which I was smiling in mind. <br /> <br /> After that William H. Feyer's death by Hammer was found to be like a snake, after the stomach sticks of Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. To take the alien in a low budget, I guess ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing suddenly goes away, before the end of the bluepers reel ends with the last credit, they are finally running out of the film. Talk about the lack of money ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Fred O'Neill Rai, the director's commentary also mentions that Aldo Ray would be shot through shooting and was not sure whether to remember his line. He did just that. <br /> <br /> Tie a low budget cheese. It's fun to see, I'll give that donation. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
