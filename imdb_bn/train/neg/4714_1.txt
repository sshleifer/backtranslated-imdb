I would like to give a zero zero to this garage, so unfortunately, so do not let me warn you about this stupid folly of a watchful cartoon! Looks like the characters were drawn by the ex-students, no, wait, I saw the pre-school good! I like "Flapjack Misadventures" on this terrible plea for a cartoon! I'm probably saying what others have said, two words: RIP closed !! Dexter's lab episode ran under the volcano and ran car-cars? Yes, Mr. Fellow even shouted that idea! They cut the Shadow Lugio in a single episode that defeated Pokemon! (He also cashed in that franchise!) One character, Demeter's Lab is the cheap Rip off! This piece broke the suit for the violation of the statute need to be sued !! Everyone has their own opinions, but who among you likes the RIP-OFF test, you are lying to yourself. Make yourself a favor, change this channel by trying to insult your channel off this rip!
