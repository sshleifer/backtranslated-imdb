Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see why you can shoot a profit for your movie, why you can shoot with your parents Camcorder. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a movie, some people do not think it's a good idea to destroy mini-tape. <br /> <br /> I probably hate it because the person in the video store said it was cool, and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's the cheapest, always the most cruel plot, the most unrealistic characters of all time, sometimes and really, really are really always shown in the history of the film. Even Tom Savenei can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's a complete waste time.
