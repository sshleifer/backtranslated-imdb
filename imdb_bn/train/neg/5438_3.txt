I am most fond of Michael Chaban of the novelist / screenwriter. Her novel "Wonder Boy" Curtis Hanson became an extraordinary movie. His amazing novel "The Amazing Adventure of Cavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he had "Spider Man 2" scripts in hand, which is the greatest comic book of all time ever. <br /> <br /> Directors Rauson Marshall Tharba also has ordered wonderful comedic pieces such as Got-Busting "Dodgeball" and Genius Short Film series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a cast with Peter Sarsagard, Siena Miller, Nick Nolt and Menna Savvy, it seems like a non-breder. <br /> <br /> This is it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> John is in a position to develop the arrest: he works for a minimum wage in Burney Burns, there is a clear relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Flokes (Suwari), which is less than sex, with no other plans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Later that night they went out for pi He asked the person that he began to move away from his troubled state, "I want you to say something to me that you have never told the single soul, breaking it this night." John then tells him a repetitive dream, where he He is terribly terrible about the city, looking at the strangers facing him, but one of them sees him in the eye. <br/> <br /> The next day Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland (Sarsagard) kidnapped John from the job and took him to the abandoned steel muffin and soon John, Cleveland and Jane are going together at the punk rock concert together at each awake moment, doing medicines and lots Drinking alcohol. It can not sit well with Fox, who pushes John for a more personal relationship, such as meeting with his new friend and his father. This image tries to take us on the journey of John, because he shook him for his father, Flokes and the end of his death, as he found independence and expression through his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There was a problem while following the zone across our film: She is completely uncertain. She has no ambition, passion or mission. The night he met, he walked through the life of an invisible world described in Jane. This is not a problem at the beginning. But he never gets any more interesting She is a complete passive character. He easily follows Bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never gives us any curiosity about that and he does not confirm what he wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film and its supporter characters do not go anywhere and do anything other than the party, have sex and get the arguments. In other words, much ado about nothing We have nothing to do here except a good movie shallow skin. Sweeping cinematography, looking at the distance with bandwidth voice-over character, straight and gay both sex scenes, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a sad death ... but it does not seem to matter. Wickedly, at one point, Jane confused with some of the vulnerable steps of the zone, "What's going on, zone? What's all this?" Yes, zone, tell me. We want to tell the audience, <br /> <br /> <br /> The title "Pittsburgh Mystery" must be mentioned in the title itself because that is the reason they are. They all facades, one-dimensional stand-in for real people. The film never gives us We do not know which one of them ticks. We see a lot of them, but we do not know why. And "Why" is one of the worst things a movie can have in absence.
