I acknowledge that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete in any way in the 1995 edition. Why I saw it that I was not entirely happy with Captain Sianyan as Ventworth and thought that Rupert Preni-Jones saw much more like Captain when reading the book. And he was very much. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the only redeeming film in that film. The rest is as much as non-Austen. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliott could never walk like this in Bath Street. It was not in his character and it was not done by a woman of that time only. Annie Elliott was a woman and she was a dignitary. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotations in the book, they are in complete inappropriate moments, who know this book is still another important part of the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very little care was taken to introduce characters, show their nature and motives. Important view has been removed. How could they possibly pick the final scenes in this way? A disaster! And were not far from photographing beautifully like each other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, do not waste your time with it.
