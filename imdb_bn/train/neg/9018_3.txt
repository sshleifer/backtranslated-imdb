It is a source B science fiction film, and the director does not have any bones about it. It is about a dragon who is restoring life by a scientific team. Everything is done stuff you've seen many times before. It's a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotype characters and situations. Without any effort to make us fool, the director invades it by creating a source and it appeals to this movie lightly, but it is not something you can remember. It is best to be cooked, cleaned, done while working. Fun sort of mind. It has its place of amusement, but it's certainly not something you would meet friends, unless you're all drunk and not taking care. 3.2's mass rating is probably fair. I do not think it's painful like most people, but I'm surprised that some people in posting thought this spectacular. That really eludes me, I even see no effort to make this a memorable film.
