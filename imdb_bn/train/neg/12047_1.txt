I was the best enthusiast in the advance screening for this movie. Finally, it is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and this is the first story I read a child (even before Tokyo). I must say that it was a bigger choice. They completely made the plot in a trick and turned one of the things so long asap opera. The elements that were plotters to the plot were scattered throughout the scandal that the audience laughs at a very happy script, which provided the lips only for this war of war. It was a big disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (which was a strange combination of almost matrices, absolutism and original boyfriend's male lover). Pitt (who is a good script, and with more effort, it is sometimes the most complex and original Became a warrior figure). Actors are really trying to make the ridiculous, ridiculous scripts best. It was actually a waste of many talents (Peter O'Toole steals the show, and Orlando Bloom and Shan Bien was kind). Compare LOTR or Gladiator and it does not even hold a candle to them. Goggle on a long battle scenes that battle for a movie and blockade enough for a movie but lots of misery for women. I would not recommend to pay anyone to see this story dragged through a hole like this letter (at least they got that part right).
