The only reason I did not score it was that Sibrell showed that he was very useful in the technical aspects of making a film. This is a technically elite film. It has been said that this is a film based on lies and distortion that is easily disrespected. Most documentary space programs are spent using it, except for the actual event the space program prevents. And Simblebill's "unknown proof" the landing that was faked is easily denied if you know anything about the orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching it, but if you do, then watch it in free Google Video. Do not let Bart Sibrel gain from your curiosity.
