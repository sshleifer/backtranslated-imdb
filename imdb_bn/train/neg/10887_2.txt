...... This picture is quite terrible, the only thing I have to do to prevent me from rating it 1 was that unfortunately I saw it more badly. <br /> <br /> The jungle music, awakening the monster, and the blood / teeth / eyes of the fluorescent UV style give it a "terrible" appearance and the script is terrible ... how long the film can last before leaving it on It's like a test to see. It is not a predictor but a good way. This film is nothing better way. I saw it 10 minutes ago and I thought I would be a little annoyed so you are. (Oh and the acting film does not let down, it's terrible)
