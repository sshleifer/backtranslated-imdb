Sometimes I think about the rest of my head and the movie about killer sharks and / or crocodile is still being made this day. They are making this hair "gaus" -copy, since the 70s, they do not like the best. The idea is still just the same. So we have an animal that starts killing humans. First it throws some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually acting without a person, which is somewhat more famous, usually an expert can play. Others usually kill different creatures, usually one of the main characters in the explosion. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the organism is still alive, or eggs, etc. "Crocodilous" basically uses the same overwhelming ideas and does absolutely nothing to create a bit different bit. Unless you're a captain of this variety of "gigabytes", then your values ​​are very rare. It is interesting that he has played by Duncan Ragazzi although he likes to be totally Zoro. I'll give it a bonus point for it.
