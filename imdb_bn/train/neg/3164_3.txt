Envy Lumbaria dies on her wedding day when an angel of an angel (without the bird) throws him behind the truck and kills him. Then he is trying to destroy his ex-girlfriend with his new girlfriend, a psychological person. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the illogical film will not be so bad that the character of Longoria is hateful and objectionable that he has ruined all the fun in the film. It's like being cleaned with your ear sandpaper. The fair violation, not cast or crew to anyone else, is not the problem, his God scandal scripts that proceedings sinks. It's really really stupid.
