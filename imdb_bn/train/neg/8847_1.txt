This is the US snake opera, all the entertainment prices stuck in the 'Notes Landing' elevator. Each episode has plots like rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, which are different in other dramatic events of this period. For Cast, I saw good actors in a serial box. In the mid-to mid-90s, the repetitions of 'nuts' were. K-Gold is stuck in the lungs like the Napa mountains. I apologize to my comments that my mother was a huge fan of this show and it looked religiously. Still, there are few more runs in the run again (let's hope this will continue). The only positive thing of 'Notes' is the signature Saksphone signature, which is later used as the title music for ITV v sitcom, 'the upper hand'. Great heir, oh?
