I just have to add, someone actually read this and not yet earned the full points. These other critics are not kidding, this is actually the worst color film you'll probably see. When the movie started, I could not believe that it actually created this to see the world. <br /> <br /> They said that it does not look like home movies. It really does. Like "Director", family hi 8 camcoder (DV camera and computer before editing non-linear), any other equipment (lights, sound gear etc), captures some decent acting students and goes out to draw a movie. No script, he went along just as it made it. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, it was my mono tv, so I only have one channel (right to speaker left). At first I thought I would make it wrong. The film was silent without talking in a few minutes. I got up and went to another channel and suddenly I heard songs and sound effects but then I could not hear the dialog. They record the sound on various bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad they are good, kind things. I'm not sure who this one is. I mean, I would accept to be a bit of an emerging filmmaker. And just by seeing bad movies just want to go there and prove that you can do it better. But seeing this makes me feel sorry for anyone I created. <br /> <br /> Actually the only good thing about this is that they were as bad as they were. I thought the chick was warm and was disappointed by the scenes of his bath. Nothing will be raised from him to T and a bit at a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie, it's turning off the shit, but throw some unnecessary nudity. Work for Roger Corman.
