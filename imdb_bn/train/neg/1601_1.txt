Slasher flicks fall as much as stereo-ratiated supposed entertainment to send flicks. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Jan Busby, and the whole cast actually was completely destroyed. Wool jokes are wide, and each punch line is well wire. Fool one liners come at a fast speed, and almost everyone falls flat as squashed wine. Musical instruments only contribute to the entire film and contributes to the lingering frustration. Another negative is completely claustrophobic setting in a derelict high school wall. Avoid it and find "The Lampoon's Gold Digger" like "Lampon"'s real funny movies - Mirac
