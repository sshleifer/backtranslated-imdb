Violence has decreased, triggered stories, animated bad, music is unnecessary and repetitive, and in fact, the show is not funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, each of its series through the same series of HBO, regardless of if it is not worthy of the cartoon world. In this way, popies and blueto appear in a repeat segment such as spying ("Hey Popey is popular, and Flintstones are popular, keep it together, and you will not miss!"). Also, "Private Benjamin", "Olive Oil and Goenne" have an apparently regular segment that shows them as a new army hiring feature. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Public announcement of each episode involving boring factor (standard practice during cartoon, but still annoying). Popeye crossed the road safely, gave reusable lectures and - are you ready for it? The dangers of smoking!
