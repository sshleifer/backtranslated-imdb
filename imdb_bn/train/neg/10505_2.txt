If you like "Blair" you like it It has the same lauai camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspicious moments. <br /> <br /> It's Tom Savini, so if you like Romeo's "dead don" or Tarantino and Rodriguez from "Do not Give Done Dawn" you're a treat. She is an icon and very good actor as well. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie I've seen several times is the perfect movie, and I've seen several movies - bad ones too. I can tell you that most of the horror movies I've received for entertainment, but it was just a free waste. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked girl and the hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... no, I'm just kidding. I have to miss before submitting "vote" on the vote form. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
