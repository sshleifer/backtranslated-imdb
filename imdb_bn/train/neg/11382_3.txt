Notice that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Look at the angry eyes he gives each enemy. Hand holding face, mouth agape and scared eyes. 3. Sunny Tommy Turbul <br /> <br /> I want to say that I hate this program very much, I do not see it, but it's like the code Lyoko, we all have seen at least one, I must definitely say that this program is borderline, disrespectful and dull. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with a robotbie, except for an exception, robotboy, originally, this highly known Gaiky frazyzide will fly the jetpack. <br /> <br> Jokes are very weird, I think it seems to be mostly the "shock" or farting words, I think bullies of the show are very shocked. <br /> <br /> There is one who hides a ball ball under his hatred, and the other uses the devil, for God, he is going to school in any kind. Not to mention the name of his elder brother, who has the qualities of the psychotherapeutic borderline and any other character. <br /> <br /> The whole show I think Xgas and Fosters are turning off Magass. Just like you can call, jammy and kiva, you can say the same way as robotabes megos, where he hits everyone and despite being a robot, he is a free spirit. <br /> <br /> This show has no appeal, I am surprised that it is still running.
