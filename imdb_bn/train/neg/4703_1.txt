"Show me your boobies!" Not funny, and of course, on a channel that shows the cartoon, if you can understand where I'm from. I do not want to think or hear like that of my 6 and 7 year old girls. I'm sad that Nick is so much hyped that this nasty hype and then what we get, stupid small kids played like stupid adults. I meant it meant to be ridiculous but we have there to think that K has sweet little innocent girls and the first grade who can not wait to see this. When I saw it I had to comment that I was disappointed. My daughter will not see it. I want to block Nick, but at this point there is no heart but if Nick keeps out such bad words then I have to.
