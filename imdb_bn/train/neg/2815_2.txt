The poor Robert Eldond also spends another Flow and Tobey Hooper, which usually produces a lot of horror films, but he failed it very badly. England plays the well-known Marcy de Said, who has been accused of feeling pain in the 17th century and for pain on himself and others to feel pain. The story is confusing with the flip flop from a century to the second century and I was confused about what was happening and what was the purpose of this movie. What I saw was a young girl who was infuriated by a strange lesbian, who wanted to keep herself, and a young woman was enormously fascinated by this Arab and she found out that she had died and since then one of the steps of the century of the One century has been demanded to be a descendant and tried to kill him because of his He did not, ma'am momoselera (that was spelled wrong) or anyone had in mind was the picture on the wall D dedasa. The film was terrible, I was surprised to be hired in England for the movie Hooper, and special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the parts of the eyes. England tries to make a comeback from its once hit step "Nightmare on Elm St." using this piece of needles to enter the eyes of the public. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
