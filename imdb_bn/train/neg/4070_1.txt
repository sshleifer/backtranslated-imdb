Draw a picture of the horrific gothic kids of the college, paint the story and paint the whole picture with terrible acting, and you still do not stop the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, bad acting. Fierce attempts at the sudden horror. Everyone gets a little depressed to see it that I showed it. Sex scenes are not annoying for their content, but some of the reasons they want to end as soon as possible. Before the end sex scene just reached the person, it was helpless. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who loves watching movies, so I chose this. But for yourself, save time and avoid this hatred. It's that bad. I literally threw it out of the garbage.
