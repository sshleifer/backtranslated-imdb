Last week, I once had a weekly Nilson rating, and Veronica was good, "It was not the best show you were watching". <br /> <br /> Okay, you're not exactly watching it. It has been circulated twice and 147 out of 147 and 145 seats. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest rated show on any nationally broadcasted network ... and suitable for it. I've tried to see it a few times due to all the press coverage of a "cool" show, a "realistic look" and hipping all such stupid. The reality was otherwise. Veronica Mars is a bore. It seems as unrealistic that it can be canceled and the only mystery is that the CW compels the overall rating of the commemoration to commemorate its opening schedule, after two years of commercialization. And artistic failure.
