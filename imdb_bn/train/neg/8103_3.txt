This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with the Kundar novel. It is not impossible that; It's 99% like its work, it's pretentious and overdrawn. He seems enamored with himself, comes off as Navy surveillance of his character, and his novel is completely misogynistic. I've read most of her works (even her socialist realistic poems). It does not really understand the terrible thing. His novels feature features (like self-absorption) to make terrible study. In one movie, all the things that I hate about Kunda have been enlarged. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. Besides, I can not believe that it is a standard DVD collection. There is no way this movie is that essential.
