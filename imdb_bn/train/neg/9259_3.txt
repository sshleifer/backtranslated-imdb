'The Woman 4: The Awakening' Original 'The Omen' Movie Television sequel. Instead of Satan, holding the body of a little boy, he gets the body of a little girl taken by a wealthy parent, who gets disturbed in school and takes vengeance against those who make mistakes. The film can fight any serious factor and many incidents can happen only especially terrible, but it is hard to believe that this little girl is also difficult to believe in Satan, even with all the events around it. I did not find this picture very suspicious or scary, especially when compared to the original.
