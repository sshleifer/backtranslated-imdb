I have not found darkness to be too dark. It was a cool idea and some ambitious ideas, bad action scenes and a few splash moments go to UGH! However, it was under the point of confusion. Do not you know what is always going on in the dark scene and you already have those weird grains for a movie shot in the Super 8 movie. As Nathan Schiff's movie, it's too much. The director wants to make a real film by Lieutenant, but its lack of how he can do it. The camera is never directed at the right place, lack of basicity of how ordinary conversations can be made and how the movie can be lightened. All of the actors are pretty disrespectful and hammy. But despite this negative, the music ranges from really good, cow's rugs and really good tools from stupid ribbons. Is it such a classic to say it? Is it worth appreciating two price discs? No But it's a good first try. Now if these guys stop their patting behind this movie (they have never ended from what I understand from here), try again, they can do better.
