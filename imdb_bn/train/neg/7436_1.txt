This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the whole one and a half hours, I waited for better and it never happened. It was moving slowly, the plot jumped around, it was not scary or interesting, and in fact it never was. During the role the credits were long and painted, originally like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). Many parts of the plot made in no sense. Several times during the movie, I used to think that I was "out of zone" because the plot of the plot was the same problem even though my partner had the same problem and assured me that I was not "out of the zone" of annoyance, but it was actually a movie. I have not actually posted any film about here and have been actively looking for IMDB films for many years. So actually I'm taking time to write something, talk about how bad this film is and how much you should not waste your time or money.
