My first review of 2010 is "Blue 2: The Rif". The story is about two divers operated by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore a hidden treasury at the bottom of the local reef. A day after the inquiry, they were contacted by a couple managed by David Anders and Marsh Thomson. They tell the youngsters to Diver that they want to rent them in search of their hobby, and find a rare artifact in Columbus' secret treasure, which is reported under the referee. <br /> <br /> The next day after a whole day of four dive diving, they found nothing in the rock and upside down. The past few days ago and the two distinguished divers discovered that they were part of a deadly plot that they could not escape otherwise they would die. They are employed to hire out two large containers. One has a nuclear reactor and another core is there. <br /> <br /> This picture is trying to patch things with another girlfriend (the lead character's brother) with his back girlfriend, I counted this part of the story was wasted time, this couple had a very steamy sexual scene that was available to me There was absolutely waste and there was no need to show. However, there are some good underwater photography and the colors are well mixed so that it gets 4 planets. In Blue 2 is a signal by name only. None of the original actors or characters come back, it is a fool plot, stupid character and an annoying measure.
