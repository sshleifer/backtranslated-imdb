The Living Dead Hood and all the other films they got together and heard with their friends who got zero talent in the afternoon (their lines are totally unknowable and intolerable). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage are better than this movie (though they compare the similarities between them). "Hey, let's see if our film is fool enough to buy!". Hope nobody was ELSE. Apologies to me who are involved in this review is a bit rigid but I had to read your fake reviews and who had the dope who bought the movie.
