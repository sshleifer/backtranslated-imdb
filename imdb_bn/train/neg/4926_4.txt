I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men are forced to carry a beautiful mobile phone movie. I think Dracula is really the resurrection of Judas Ischeriet, because it explains its disrespect for all things Christian, but there was so much speculation that this idea could not be realized as much as possible. I saw this film more so than a genius Gerard Butler's true recognition, a way to remind the legendary Christopher Plummer to remember him (I and these 5 other people who saw this movie) reminded that he still exists. I actually enjoyed special features in DVDs more than the movie.
