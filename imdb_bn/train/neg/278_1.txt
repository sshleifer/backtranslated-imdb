I'm trying the pitch picture for the dark angel. "I'm thinking about the matrix, I'm thinking about Blackdrum, I think dogs wear shiny black skin, or wearing shiny black skin - or leave us some dogs with us, without any plots, conversations, characters, decent work or budget. To do this, just a few hot lips and shiny black skin a hot chick is a hot chick straddling a big blurred bike. Fanboys shiny black skin elevation bangs and big throbbing hot chicks digging straddling the bike, OK? "<br /> <br /> phlyasi, shallow, horror, onset, restless, tired, lazy, stupid, ridiculous, disgraceful, capable of little. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. SF just like the way Joe Fanboy likes it. :(
