I started watching this movie with less hope, because actually I just noticed it because it's a. Who was an adaptation. Novel (a novel that I did not read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectation was low because the movie was not something good, but it managed to keep you interested. This story is really dragged by the director and the actors. The movie is extra, no "beautiful" shot and no fear, conversations are silent and special effects shit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is, as I said, it keeps you interested without using many terrible cliches (I guess the book will be good) <br /> <br /> My vote is 4/10.
