I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. Only the redeeming quality is oppressive. Dubbing was worse than any experience. Looks like it was shot with a VHS camcoder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was a whole place of blood and body parts. I have ever seen that one of the worst movies, but I have to accept a lot of graffiti which was not frustrating because it can be complete because the whole film is so stupid and incredible
