Children love dinosaurs. It is a part of their culture. But they got land before time. Original At least that was the heart of the movie. this. This movie is just the background. Children love dinosaur because it does not mean that you can only combine the old story and show it to the children. There is no plot in this film, the whole courtyard is stupid, and it is more by numbers. Theodore Rex is not as a soul sucking, but it is lightyears away from being a land before it.
