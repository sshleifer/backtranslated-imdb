All right, tell me how I am surprised by the plot, <br /> <br /> But more than one Steven Seagal movie that only signals except Steven Segal Omeg! /> <br /> Just the random low-budget action scenes I'm not really surprised that I burned 90 minutes for this shot !! <br /> <br /> Just rent a Jackie Chan movie or have more fun to watch and have wwf and have there and guess there are intrigues !!! Please, please, to avoid !! Best Actor Bill Sonarberg is acting on BTV and he says a lot !! <br /> <br /> And he did not play very well as I said I can not avoid it. I still can not believe that I lost 90 minutes and spent 10 minutes writing this! :)
