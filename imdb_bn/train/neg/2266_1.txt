The tragic excuse to destroy the film of the ringmaster, Jerry Springer, which should be recycled as a toilet paper, has recently ruined my self-confidence in the film industry. First, it was created. Secondly, people went to see it. Thirdly, some people saw that they saw the best movie. A monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure that it will be 1 billion times better. Most of the pornographic images are in their moments, even though (some of the cool effects of GDZIL) were the moment of the movie when I was annoyed at the theater. If Jerry was a Springer star, then perhaps the only thing that could make this movie worse If I look at the whip for one and a half hours, I can take a dump in the cane. If someone does not hate this movie completely, then I have mercy on you and your children and your children's children. However, unlike Spring's beliefs, I do not neglect children with explicit sex.
