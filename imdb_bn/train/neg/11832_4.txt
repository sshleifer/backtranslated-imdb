From the makers of shake ???????? Okay, that caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Okay, Shake's Maker also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shake. <br /> <br /> Now flash is half like Madagascar. <br /> <br /> means flush is not good at all. Animation and all special effects were very good but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was only for kids. It is not important for adults to actually love this flick. <br /> <br /> There were many jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 4/10
