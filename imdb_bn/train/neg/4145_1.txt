All right, I've seen this movie twice, I've done extensive research on the net, I've asked a lot of people about the feedback here. I went to the original Sheridan Lafanu classic 'Carmilla' reading length, a movie that is based on this movie is supposed to be based. I think the best way to review this movie is to describe a game when viewing it. The plot of the book is not there any idea about the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life is happy and peaceful. One day they received a letter from the general who created his mission in life to take revenge for the death of his daughters. He has demanded the activities of the supernatural power, and explains that he will soon meet with them. Meanwhile, facing a chance with a strange woman, Lafontaines is looking for her daughter, Carmilla, for a few months. Laura soon began to get embarrassed by strange dreams, and started coming down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? What should he do with Laura's situation and General? <br /> <br /> I've discovered this game and want to play as soon as possible, and let's know what their results are. I even have an interesting name, and have a jingle, but I can not be bothered that. This is called "this film does not make sense anymore." <br /> <br /> What you have to do is try to bring a complete plot explaining what is happening while watching movies. I mean the whole meaning, answering all the questions, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> This will answer questions such as <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires roam in the day? <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * And why she leaves the girl, after which she openly reveals that she knows that she is driving a car on her head, the head knows the vampire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is the importance of Necklaces? What's this? Why does it kill the vampire? And how did you know adultery? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Everyone in the film can tell exactly what is happening, but the audience seems too reluctant to publish it. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What's going on?
