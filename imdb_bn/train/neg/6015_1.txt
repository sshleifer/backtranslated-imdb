The purpose of a motion picture producer has never been transparent before ever. Let's see: FIRST, they come to the televised eager to promote the film as the greatest thing from volunteer white bread. Later, they encourage as much fundamentalist Christians as possible to buy copies of the film so that their costly production costs are restored and their advertising budget is pumped. And to the end, when the movie hits the theater, many Christians seem to have it as much as possible to show it again, not on the quality of the film, but if it is needed, they live in multiplexes, but due to some deep spiritual victory because of opening the # 1 box office Saw it <br /> <br /> But of course, it will not be enough. I imagine that a film critic with a critic should give a brief overview of the "left-no-one" review for a discussion. "Of course, this shameful manipulation marketing campaign It is not surprising that anyone, after all, good old fashion capitalism is working. I wonder what many people have been subjected to "left behind" psychology in the essence. Whoever believes in his spiritual faith It tries to compromise the integrity and rationality, which gives me the pitch of my head, it will be seen that many are there, many actually believe that a "joy" in the near future is going to occur and all million people of the world will go to Thin Air together. I wonder, are these people living? Is it really something "miracle" that they believe, or are they something Which they want to believe? And when they reach the end of their life and do not realize this "miracle" happened, then will they be frustrated and upset? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " What an interesting day that would be! If the epoclepse is more spectacular then it can be seen in more spectacular fashion, but in the anthropomorphic sense, the author of the "left-free" series has not shown, but with the production of Stephen Spielberg, with warm clouds, trumpets, angels coming down from the sky, the moon turned into blood, the whole nine Yard. It is believed that this is coming true, just as the evangelists had warned for years, and there was something extraordinary than living in cold, difficult, physical reality. <br /> <br /> In the final analysis, this is the cold, hard, physical reality that I am involved with myself. My life is not so meaningless that I do not need to understand all the fears of "Rapture" and "The Last Times" ... or I do not need bribe or bribe and I am not afraid to be patient, thank you so much.
