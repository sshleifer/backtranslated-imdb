When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a gorge movie. The box even claimed that this movie was a violent scene in the release of the theater (I'm now deeply suspicious about the theatrical release). After finishing the film, I was wondering how it would get video release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apart from this point, the movie was originally created in a shameless scene, which would make the film a long-term release for the release. <br /> <br /> acting on a subject that makes this movie horror. Lisa Munson, who played the lead role, seems to be reading her line from the coup cards. The acting is bad to others, but almost as bad as its. Another bad thing is that the movie is a camera strategy. Many shots are taken by the camera attached to the ceiling. This gets very annoying as the movie progresses. Above all that, very little Gore, which makes the box very confusing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this. My rating: 10 out 1
