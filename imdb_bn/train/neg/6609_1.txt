I do not say that Bogra is the worst movie ever, because I have not seen every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me that it can be good. <br /> <br /> This image looks like artistic effort. The director suicides himself, and I believe for one thing that he has succeeded in his mission. Any listed actor outside of this movie will risk sharing the same billing until they are forced to carry this movie with him. <br /> <br /> But do not let the director blame here, here he is rehearsing for the film's cinematic filmmaker award, cinematographer. There are dramatic scores over, which you expect to carry in the next scene. The light man, who held a cigarette in one hand, and on the other hand kept a light bulb in the pole, and hoped that the light burning of a cigarette would burn every scene. And, of course, the actor! Some of them are not by newcomers, others can be forgiven here. The actors were brought together to revive and develop levels for 'Sholay' India's greatest film remake. These actors will not forcibly forget in this movie, they want to do something to the inventory and willing partners, which can be confronted, will it be energized and the expectations of the public will be fulfilled? So it is asked, Amitabh one side (for now), did another actor really try to do well in their performance? Does Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people will remember his conversation in this harmful hatred of this movie? Do not be fooled, of course he did not, the protest to the people meant that actors could walk in how much money talks. <br /> <br /> I really hope that everyone involved is truly satisfied. The rebuilding of a classic film is a pornographic attempt, which is only successful when they watch the original, only to pollute the mind of everyone.
