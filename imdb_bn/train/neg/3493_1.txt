I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I'm forced to warn the potential audience that this movie is terrible. Just terrible I like the movie Shab Bros (I'm not disappointed.), And I had high expectations for this because I listed it on the "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" website. (I am convinced now that all the 10 best lists are all cut and paste works.) First, there is no step in the film. Most movies talk about plots, which is a remarkable achievement because it is the best slim. And the action itself may be impressive in 1978, but it's routine by today's standard. A special warning to netflix users: they are terrible that the DVD ship; The picture is awesome and it's not even 16: 9 extended.
