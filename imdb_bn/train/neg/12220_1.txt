This movie is ever worse than any film I ever suffered, and I have suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense It is a terrible, compulsory dialogue; Development of unmatched plot; Truly grasping the 'Wonderful Imagery' scenes, which looks more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 Best Interesting Women; Long, annoying sex scenes tell the woman (forget about what you know about virgins! Those who are especially with the fake nipples); Insane, difficult to understand lectures from some of the characters; And they actually used Killer Clown's masks at Outdoor Space during a masturbation scene, it should be a conservation creator, because that movie was pretty funny, but not so. Wadeen the worst of film history! <br /> <br /> Do not miss out at all.
