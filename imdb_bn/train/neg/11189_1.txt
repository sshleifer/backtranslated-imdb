Always enjoy great movies that deal with super-natural and deep thoughts in the spiritual world. However, this film turned me off just as its production and direction. Do not go to a deeper discussion about what this story is about; I can say that it is a great waste of time and efforts to keep it on the big screen. Actors, such as: Mark Adie, Thomas Garrett, gave outstanding performance in his own country of England and we saw him in the "Steel Standings" TV series. Heath Ledger played the real naughty father, and recently we saw him on the "Brokeback Mountain", "05", gave a big supporting role. Shannin Sosman did a good job to persuade a priest in a church recognized by a belief. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
