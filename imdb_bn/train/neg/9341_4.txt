This is Hal Roach Comedy Short, a Solid Winter, "Our Gang / Little Rascals" series and the nineteenth-century ninety-nineth. Actually here's a showcase for the black abstract Stétien Fetchit who gets special billing here, we're going to go to her shake where he hangs the gang. Farina retrieved a love letter from her for the mail, and to read it, Statin told him that she could not read that day, that night she would go to the night school. It's going to be her sweetheart in Tennessee, so now Farina should be stuffed with her ear because she's too hot to listen! In another room, instructed Mary Anne to guide the toffee from the wage radio, but because she is going behind the kitchen, she has messed up the female announcer with rice pudding and the Spanish team confused Mrs Anne with Tasacco and Lux! After the concomination is complete, Jackie and the rest of the gangs help themselves with terrible flavor, but as a very sticky material everyone stuck on the wall. As they try to clean up all the mess, Steppen works basements on various pipes and electrical outlets, which combine the function of variable equipment with a telephone that is vacuum, a vacuum that rings and a fridge that plays music! The end What I described as this illustrates the small nature image of "our gang" which acted as a pilot for a short series of potential Stétien Fetchit films. Just as it did not happen, the appearance of Fetchit of the lazy Negro was only small, and today it will be considered very aggressive. The many scenes I described were good for some laughs but the final order was so confusing that the results were too vague for me. So briefly, seeing a solid winter at least once is a valuable curio. However, Stephen's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
