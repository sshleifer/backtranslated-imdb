For several months I have heard about this small film and now I have seen it. I'm pretty, fascinating how many new director directors make movies where they combine the creative ideas of others to create their own fun-stereosity of the movie. Troops, Swingblade, Million Blair Witch Parody comes to mind. If these directors would like to have a foot inside the door of Hollywood, they are doing the right thing and because of mixing the plot outlines they will continue to make it a Hollywood movie. How many times you hear the word, "It Comes Back to the Human House Future"; "It Fills the Wall Street Dead Coets Society"; Or "Love Shakespeare Star Wars"? I think when independent films were original and not bold, they were safe and anticipated.
