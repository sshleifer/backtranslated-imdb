For a word titled 'Frankenstein's Curse', lathicharges faithfully to Mary Shelley's story, if the changes are any good then it will not be so bad. The tragedy of the animal to destroy Frankenstein's family has been completely excited and replaced ... there is nothing. The heart and moral center of the story has gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer; He gets everything he gets The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even taking it to its office, it's junk: a soft, rainbow film, a pudding bowl with a haircut, a light show animal. This is the first picture of Hera's horror films, directed by Terrence Fisher and written by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, the terrible history of her is safe. But it's crap.
