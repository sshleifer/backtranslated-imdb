This is the "FBI" actress Reed Haddle star star! The film begins with an accidental (advantageous) abduction, which is one thing and the other - which does not refer to the original story, which is called "Big House, USA". Prison break The story is unlikely, at least to say. This is like a TV show, only "violent" (for the time being). <br /> <br /> But cast a trip! See the picture: Ralph Makar has been sent to jail; His cell-mates are the following offenders: Broaderk Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Branson (reading a "muscle" magazine!), And William Talman (read "Detective" magazine!). Honest! You should know that what will happen to the "absentee" boy, revealing a preliminary view, will answer the last "voiceover". If you do not want to stay hanging then do not miss the opening scene between "Ihsman" and son (Peter Vaughan is doing a good job as a runway anatomic). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard Dr. Coach ~ Broderick Crowford, Ralph Maker, Reid Haddley
