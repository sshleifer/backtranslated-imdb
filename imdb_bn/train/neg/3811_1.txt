I used to hate this Friday, part of it as part of TGIF every Friday, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something interesting, see "Non on Will Tell" starring Candie's Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really fun, it shows that after making a terrible TV show, there is no good movie career. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and Bob has to jump from the bridge to make this Cufffest. I've seen Funner's stuff here all over here. I write 10 lines of AHET! To show at least humanity see the 'whole house' in the arts and entertainment system.
