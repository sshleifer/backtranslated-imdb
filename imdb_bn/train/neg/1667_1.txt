I actually like this movie in the end. Sure, it was sugar and fantastic prospects but still it kept my attention in a rainy afternoon. In the end, that is. His final performance at the prestigious Classical Conservatory, where he struggled to catch other classically trained students, what is the main character? Wow this with their acting on this time of intellect and musical tradition? No He tormented Carmen's amazingly fascinating Habana and turned it into a completely forgotten Britishers Spears-Wang pop song. My ears are burning! And, at a terrible moment, his teachers stood on him! There is no teacher at the speaker-initiated fantasy, he must fail at the spot. Save your time, save your ears - leave this movie!
