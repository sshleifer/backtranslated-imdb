This movie is probably the worst movie of my life! The plot is ridiculous and the entire "Little Man" shit is just so stupid. The whole movie is unreal and stupid Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". It is not just an unmatched fragmentary piece that should not be made in the theater. The comedy is not funny and the actress is awesome. Please, I wanted to see this incompetent piece of money saved. Sitting through my little man, I started bleeding for one and a half hours. I hate that something like that! Who wrote this nonsense? Actors do not have any talent, so how do they get Hollywood? They are making money from this junk!
