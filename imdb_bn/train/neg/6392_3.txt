Fans of Gerstein Herschel Gordon Lewis look elsewhere to choose this picture for the natural buckets of blood, because the film has a little bit of valuable value in the bloodstream. Instead, Luis decided to try and say the story of victory, depending on the special effects of the basement on the door in a budget, if the cast stopped their pockets for a day to change, it could probably be doubled. Wonderfully enough, when played cheap and very badly (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), maintains full attention to the plot. Imagine, this movie can be like a decent budget! Overall, it strains for a champagne taste on beer budget.
