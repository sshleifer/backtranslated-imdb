I picked up this movie for the replacement of unhealthy choice of day-time television and for the serious harmful woman thirsty. Well, for the past, it's better than day television. But I'm not sure how much. It has points, but the first 20-30 minutes after the good point pans out and one concludes that they are being made for TV movie, which were kept together for a long time to keep nothing together. In short, a terrible sci fi channel type movie. <br /> <br /> Its point is to show the futility of the future, such as "Blade Runner." ... Of course, this is a "blade runner". Captain thinks, like actor Robert Forster It may be that might be closer. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it gets worse like "Andrumida" reheasse where the muscle crusher of "Alliance" There is a copy, mysterious vampire Willo has made sex more intense, and the new captain can be like John-Michael Vincent running around "Danger Island" of "banana split"; he only kept the uniform with epaulets; he got it very little right. They are all going inside the ship's inner forces, which looks a lot like 'Eureka Maru' because they fight against the 'people' class. That is, those who hold the universe and are divided between different tribes or different communities ... evolutionary attributes ... .. just like "Knights of the Andromeda". <br /> This is a release with Michael Iranside. There may be attributes, but after a while, someone feels that he takes part as a fan! She is probably kidding, but it does not help the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> This is ... "OK". It's OK to see the DVD once it's closed; If they see it commercially, they will probably change the channel. One can see it once .......... But after a few hours, it was all they could see that it was frustrating to see it all. <br /> <br /> For me, that was femme fatale. ............ when he was fighting.
