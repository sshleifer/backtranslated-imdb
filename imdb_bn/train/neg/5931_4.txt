This image should have been only 10 minutes. I mean this thing has only more than 10 minutes of spectacular content (I'm even staggering as a movie). The opening credits of the film were somehow committed. The film begins with people's own short comments, you really rub their hands and stay safe for more footage from Cohen's life. Well, Nick did a reasonable job throughout Cohn's famous songs. The length of the cave's performance makes you more intelligent, whose intelligence and well-spoken words have already tickled your fancy. But since this cave performance takes place, they are only literally from the beginning of the long limited boring performance of a group that does not have the lowest interest to keep in your seat. Do I really think the filmmakers? A five-minute shutdown shot from a ghost concert in Australia! The filmmaker seems to insult the audience by adding this "endless applause" to this endlessly nasty performance really. The film shows very rarely of a perfect torture that you came to see. Cohen's past is not a footage. Actually, there is absolutely nothing left of some of his first days as singer / poet! If you add all the minutes to talk to Cohen but it can not even reach for 10 minutes. But this 10 minutes of damaging cameras - some of which are rendered uselessly in the work, which lead to some illogical people screaming from Kohin's song. If you ever decide to waste your money in this movie, do not do it! Just throw it in the garbage and save it at least your time.
