I see what the director is trying to do but he misses the mark. The main actor was really good but his momentum edited you out of it. Camera work, ie light and exposure, if I wanted to apologize, I could forgive it but it was not. The word was a bit far away and it also carries you from the film. I can see this director do something better in the future, so do not expect a DVD movie 28 days later or something as good as if the total rights do not stop, keep your expectations low and you'll get more. At least it was just an hour. Oh yes and acting without lead was pretty bad if you asked me. But I snob a movie so I took it for that price.
