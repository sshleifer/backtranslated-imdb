When you talk about global warming, something very strange happens: the science goes out of the window and becomes a subject of "faith" and "consensus" discussion. <br /> <br /> This is the reason I failed in Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussions, he kept a debate on "faith" and "consensus" level. <br /> <br /> Of course, when you are trying to stop the global warming to "sell the world for spending millions of dollars" you may have problems telling this thing to the scientific truth: we do not know how much the current human temperatures have increased. Perhaps it's something, perhaps some of it, or it was dependent on the next ice age, and we were not really fortunate that it could warm the planet. <br /> <br /> But we're not really <br /> <br /> <br /> So we ask "believe" in "consensus". Do not remember that any scientist who is strays from "consensus" is unincorporated. Do not keep in mind the scientific investigation about mobilization from consensus. Einstein did not universally "believe", neither Copernicus nor Galileo did. <br /> <br /> Why so difficult researchers were asked so many questions that would go on the field by asking the difficult questions? If global warming is so extravagant, certainly some people may not face such threats by checking this theory. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This movie I wanted to make al Gore. Then, he renounced his support with the "consensus" true "believer." <br /> <br /> Sorry, really.
