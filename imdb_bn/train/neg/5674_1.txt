My god, what's going on A Uwell Bowl Film and Positive Commentary? Wow <br /> <br /> Note that most of the positive reviews are coming from the work of new balls. I myself, as I said in the previous Um Bowl reviews, only hope that one day he will do something really good. I mean, it'll be one day! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People should remember that all the illnesses in the world have seen videos or masks of ill-health ... or so believe Mr. Bowl. In the first 10 minutes of this photo why I needed the footage of animal torture and murder in real life was still found in my life. I understand that the seed (the killer) is a sick person and enjoying seeing such things ... but can not understand why Mr. Bowle thinks that the actual footage will work in the film. Maybe give us shocks? Hmmm ... Well, I'm not embarrassed for one and can handle something in the film. I did not find, however, the use of footage of the real animal cruelty of the least entertaining. You're trying to shock me, it does not work. It just reminded me of how the world was disgusting because such incidents took place and because we were allowed to continue filming in Bolly Bolque. In this context, the 70/80 (Cubby Holocaust) can work for the movie, but nowadays it is not the market. <br /> <br /> This way, we will be guided in Uyet, think the film is very cheap like Bloodline 2. You can just say that there is no floating means to produce huge amounts of money. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Mr. Bowel does not really care, we are treated with boring shots of police officers in the first 25 minutes to show the video of the seed hunting. Each victim of this video ends up in a faster decomp. It's all very annoying and tiring. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit for the first 25 minutes you will be seen with police officers. A very dark room to catch seed. The light here is terrible and the old 'I'm not using a stardy cam' Falasco that he did with Blederien. 2. Until the seeds are caught, the police officers are stupidly growing. This scene is so bloody stupid that you have to believe it. He said that the police could actually kill him. For some unknown reason, the police did not shoot him. Seed is a sick that kills adults as well as adults, at this time you think in the script that the sense will win. <br /> <br /> Here we are following a stupendous death scene. The police sow the living seeds (and they know that he is alive .. why not shoot him in the head ????), then the seed came out of the ground and then killed a random woman with some handlers and then abducted. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go to you, it's just easy! It's even Hollywood horror Fools .... just a little stupid. Uwe bow can not point ****. That statement will agree with any ounce of taste. Anyone who sees this movie and thinks that the form or form is entertaining in any way, it must be given serious attention to yourself as a person. <br /> <br /> We are again treating Ubiy brand a bad performance, guided, enlightened, produced, scripted piece.
