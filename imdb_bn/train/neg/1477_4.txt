I also saw Dolmeet (Ovening) Disco Godfather, two better works of our friend Rudy Roy Moore Blacksplation Canon. But this picture, Human Tornado (Uk Dualmeet 2) will always keep a special place in my heart. Uninterrupted, lack of film production skills and absolute encouragement (in fact, too much), human tornado can not top. <br /> <br /> The first scene sets the tone. Our old pal dolmeet is involved with a white woman, when some racist local police attacked the house for some good reason, and you do not know! Anyone other than the wife of Sheriff's wife in the bed with Ol 'Dol. He cried, crying, "He did it to me!" Dlmeight's tears: "& $ * @ $ for you reality ???" Sublet never had its strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? A very young Arnie Hodson (the reputation of the hostbusters), continuity error (the letters are looking at one way in one shot, and the next, Dolmeight's suits change colors in every night of their KnightClaw act) and Queen's wedding monster eyes are her first scene. <br /> <br /> But here is the real pleasure Rudi Ray Moore himself. Do people think he was cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to be commended for his high enthusiasm. It is a steep clogged full nude jumping, or camouflage in its gang order (such as: Quick! Cave! I have a plan to plan a plan for a mother $ * @ (% and dig her own grave)? She is certainly doing any kind of Kung Fu The time is lost more than the time of the climatic war, which is represented at high speed, but Rudy is biting his teeth and gradually slows down slowly They gradually died slowly, like they tried to make the film an impact, or if they really believed in us that it was fast. In some cases, "matrix" is not it. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, the original dalmate, is an inconsistent film with a great deal, but at least it's fun, and of course you give credit to these people for this effort. Bay. Not only that. I enjoy sincere recommendations.
