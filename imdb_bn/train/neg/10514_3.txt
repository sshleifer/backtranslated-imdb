The nude, sexy, the people who used to eat siren were good ideas, although the plot was very thin. <br /> <br /> The film has a few nuddie / splatter / fewer nudie / splattered pictures from a pointless view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , And Sean Hutson, you will expect a decent plot and decent special effects. Some effects were quite good but they were very low. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene can be seen as an innovative adoption in 'Shower Scenes' <br /> <br /> This picture contains many elements that can be created first. The rate is horrible movie but they are badly executed or used very little. <br /> <br /> If I used to see this alone and 15 years old, I really enjoyed it about 10 minutes (with 1 hand of remote control), then suddenly lost interest and needed a pizza ...
