With a "friend", clearly no taste or class, I offer to look at the works of Ron Atkins. If it's representing his orifice, I do not want to see him again. It is amateur, self-motivated, criminally lazy and self-enticed trash. The headline "Sultan Monglaar" is a resounding budget filmmaker who killed a bunch of hookers. There is a small nudity and some erections, but no single element could probably save it from the hangman's gravel. The light is scary, the dialogue is totally and most of the cheers, and the direction is stupid. At the recent Fangroi conference I saw a Doku of American Exploitation Filmmakers. Atkins was one of those featured. He talked about something important about his work, but after seeing it, I do not see any import. There is no style, either, and the effect of terrible video (like solar) just improves amateurity. It's not so bad to even fun. To avoid.
