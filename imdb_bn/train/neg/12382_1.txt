Spencer Tracy and Catherine Hepburn will enter their graves, if they knew the idea that Diner Rip Off is coming to theaters. Along with Sydney Poitier and Catherine Houghton, these four great actors made a great cultural statement with Stanley Crumar's 1967 master piece. This is a joke off the present day. So a white man from a supernatural Italian family of Rhode Island came to his grandfather's funeral with his African American girlfriend home (here's a GSP insertion). The response of his family members must have been ... expected. The movie was telegraphed impressively from the beginning, my girlfriend actually started to start a fake graduation that really wanted to leave me. Make yourself a benefactor and the main hire. Take a pass from Wake.
