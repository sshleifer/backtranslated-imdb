I do not have a lot to say about this movie. It can be a great tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but this is the most tragic mistake in movie history. This made the final sale of vendors more painful. <br /> <br /> Horror scripts, directional and casual wooden performances come together to make it one of the most painful horror movies together. <Br /> <br /> I wish so much that I will give a snake or chocolate somewhere in the pit of Blue Blubber, but it's a cruel, ridiculous disaster. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why Peter could not sit there?
