... but the problem of this generation is that it is far from a good musical instrument. <br /> <br /> Wicked masters like supposedly, sands or barstones or porters are not always expected; This piece of music still makes the look of Andrew Lloyd Webber malicious. It was deadly lazy and unknown (with one or two exceptions) and after seeing it I could not recall a single remarkable tune - which is rather tragic than the one who has learned from hundreds of others. <br /> <br /> It is a strange non-theatrical. It is performed at an incredibly large stage (to the right of 50 meters right or 100 meters to the left to see something, to break their necks and to express regret for the people in the front) and nothing at all. When a person is supposed to sing at one stage, then you get what you get - and the rest is empty at the great level. It was almost painful to see me as an aspiring theater director for me. <br /> <br /> Looks like Cole Porter seems to have caught French culture in his works, these sacrifices can ever come near. And I'm confused by the popularity of this famous legend.
