Mona Akhena lives in French society without any meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I saw all these star reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. While living an illogical life in the human life, while having a higher and contributing to somebody's life, the character of the mind has little or no personality. She is not interesting or exciting. She's just useless <br /> <br /> I have seen and know enough people like this: they have no secret of what they are doing. They are just lazy bums. I do not want anybody to pray to me, because he wants to steal anything that is not addictive and lets his friends drop in divorce. Sure he is intelligent - because there is nothing to him. I saw plenty junkies, winos and bums are enigmatic; I do not want to see a picture about them. <br /> <br /> There is probably something I have missed completely. Otherwise, I think all the reviews are from some people who have some high art by French French female directors.
