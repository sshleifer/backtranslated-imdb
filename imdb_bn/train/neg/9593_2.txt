I judged with some comments from IMDB, I'm hoping for an action film - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple or a playful, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I saw, it certainly does not seem like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (though temptation seems to be complex). Take three interest groups: 1) Government 2) rebels 3) A group of killers. <br /> <br /> Decrease the first one (they will not appear in the movie). Then let only a murderer, the princess, be rude to the retaliation trip. Add a rebellious love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not managed to convert it to a story or a movie. Some low-end random action sequences and some strange visuals are trying to get sci-fi in a low budget, the rest of which you are left is empty feeling. The movie just does not look like a movie, but a strange, inconsistent, annoying dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/10
