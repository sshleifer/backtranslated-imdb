I love horror movies, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s .. but how do some people think that this is a very horrible movie? Let's compare it with the heading of hateful house movies in the same way. Hunting, changing, burning. Or for a better technology-based horror movie than FAAR (though still great to FAR) daemon seeds Okay, I'll be fair. Let's compare TV's awesome films! Do not go to sleep .. waayay creepier and well done. Many of Salem, night shopkeepers, night galleries, even the basement or the Crowvenen farms are not much better. * Spear * First of all, bloody shower scenes as well as a scene, you have a view like the opening scene ... oh boy! Some frisky teenagers of garden hoses come down to the hose down! Terrible Also, we understand what we understand about the house. It must use its video cameras to see what is happening, and it is a very emotional room. A spirit, or monster, or entity, is it a house that "possessed", but by what? We believe that an unknown object suzie / margaret, we learned to love the hero? Now that I'm about Suzy ... Another scene that bothers me completely, this poor elderly lady comes to you, tells you that she poured her nurse, her heart, washed into a warm pool, suffered for 45 seconds, and did not know what the budget Do you? Is he burning his hand to save his poor elderly woman, who came to warn his life? No, he's standing and watch! In most cases acting was better than the average of a horror film, but the positive side is the end. At least one interesting and funny horror movie that shows the unknown bed of death to people. I have a feeling that those who gave it a lot of ratings do not see it after the broadcast, or they are afraid of their children. This film was quite talented.
