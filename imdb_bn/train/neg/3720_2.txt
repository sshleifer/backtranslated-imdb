Is this picture a joke? Is this comedy? Of course this is not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is no humor in the comment, but in many programs, poor performance, poor instruction and insulting scripts have been laughing aloud. Plot is acceptable - a committed young artist has just reached his peak shot dead by an enemy. He walked through the wrong way. The killer decides to see the portfolios of the young artists carrying the job and attend an exhibition of his work. The killer fills the deceased artist's sister and they end up falling in love. It's all very hypothetical elements and ultimately it will not guess anyone as scripts badly. The image mainly occurs around Vienna and Austria, and it shows a beautiful city. Although you do not waste your time in this movie, if you do not play a movie, do not write directly to the movie!
