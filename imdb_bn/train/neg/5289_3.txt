I love Jane Austen's story. I have read only two of them (R & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I reach the persuasion of my bookroom to understand just the story, and also because I'm refusing to believe Jane Austen It may have been written as dirty. For me, I thought that if you base a movie based on Jane Austen's novel you can not really make a mistake. It will turn a lot of great beautiful by default. I was wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> First, the characters where you are sympathetic and like? In order for the audience to invest their emotions, you must have at least one preferred character, and it is not supplied. Sure, I wanted to keep Anne and Wyandharth together, but only for the purpose of the story, what you know is that they are united. Instead, I had to resist the protest to touch my education on TV and watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was annoying forever, and in the end, I did not really know why Winterwhite was so stunned by that, there was nothing in it that attracted him. He was humble, soft, neutral, socially inadequate and based on the orders of others, rather than his own mind. If you did it well then it could still work for the lead character. This did not work well. <br /> <br /> Other letters show only different color racism, among which Mary was the worst, completely faded horror personality disorder. Where there was a similar error in Mr Bennett in P & P, he was still respected, where Mary was a scary show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In most of the story, I was just thinking about how he was and why he Love Anne, as surely he is such a person who wants a person who is living a little bit alive ...? Saying, many saying, I did not have to be played people better / bad as pictured letters more responses as well. Anthony's head was nice, but as soon as I saw he was in it, I hope less. <br /> <br /> The story is too confusing too. Until the end of the movie, it seemed that Elizabeth was not Anne's teammate but actually a sister (I'm not 100% on her). The story of the whole Anne / Wentworth story was a little fiji. They were together but then broke and they both are sad about it? How? I was thinking like this for a while, and the interpretation seemed to have thrown him because he agreed to do it for somebody else? But it said in a "one after the other" way that it was almost missed, as if it was absolutely unimportant. How can it be essential when the story is very original ?? There was a lot to skip the name, but there was no real feeling for the characters. For example, this Luisa person, who was he? A friend Family? What? Their relationship with different characters and each other was not very clear. Lady Russell had a lot there, but why? Mrs. Kraft and Wyndharth were brothers and sisters, who are very young enough to have Mrs. Kraft as her mother. <br /> <br /> The ultimate kiss, yes was a little weird to kiss on the street, but I did not really think about it, because I was very busy "turn it on already !!" On TV, because Anne's lip shaking and trembling and trembling to feel like an age before meeting with Ventworth. There is some hesitation, but for just a few seconds, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then the camera has work problems. As a regular movie actress, you do not pay attention to the corners if you decide not to look for it. I did not decide to do this here, but I still noticed them. To me, this means that filmmakers are not doing well. Many conversations were with close faces closeups, a thing that should be used only when it is really important to create. In this adaptation, it was used more and hence was meaningless. Feelings held on the occasion are not really a drama actually did not work. The lasting camera camera work in the end was very contemporary. (Not to mention itself on the move.) It was the only Austen adaptation to take on the Austen season of ITV. I'm just surprised to see if I'm going to read books and give it away if it's worth seeing "North's Abbey" and "Mansfield Park". I'm sorry, it's a Gen Austen adaptation that I did not enjoy. Maybe I would rather see the 1995 edition. After all, the BBC is famous for completing the beautiful Austen adaptation.
