I had good luck reading books before watching the movie. This is an epic of teenage age, a dream of summer, the most likely indie film or big budget drama. It was caught by the hack, who clearly took the Bugy Knights and Rushmore notes without learning anything. This written book has lost weight of mandatory mental notes and low lip greens. I am sorry for these actors, because the books were rich and textured, but the embarrassing features of the movie were cut off. Mason has got a great chance in the city, such as Dylan Baker, but the remnant of the story seems particularly bad at school. Poor people = well, rich man = BAD. <br /> <br /> It is almost invaluable to see South Carolina beach, but Gary Sines parks its trailer that means to cross a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> This is a good book, but for the first time the director is an embarrassing turn for Goodlow. <br /> <br />
