I love Batman: Dead End A dark lively film-maker setting for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead and good. Not at all. <br /> <br /> First of all let me start with acting. Is anyone really that good? The best probably will probably be Clarke Bartram as Batman. But that's not saying much. He is good at first glance, and then you realize what he is, the creator of the body who can be a tolerant actor. But mainly due to the fact that Batman is not in the light of the day, he looks like a stroll around the bat suit. Instead of trying for past mistakes, an awesome scarred man Darlite Bertam publishes a boring Dark Squawl in the face which never leaves between Batman and is unreasonable: Dead End, possibly due to so little darkness in the trailer. Message is in the mind that it is entering its head and suddenly getting a head, it is not the opposite, it is quite the opposite. It is called posing, some real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some body-made cast cast as Collora Lead. It gives even more knowledge to the role of an actor who can manage it, rather than a bodybuilder who can manage it, but Hey looks like a comic! Of course, they might work well, if the colore does not like the dialagues. <br /> <br /> The entire trailer (Yes, the trailer will not be full-length movie) then Superman Batman. But the Superman side is all crooked, closing and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He said standing around, laughing, his line. About it Although he is not only surprised as a bodybuilder, and perhaps he has received some acting lessons. Again I told Kalorera, throw the actor. Not the creator of the body. Actors are so compulsive that we do not want to look like a real comic book. We <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For Batman suit as well. Well, I guess it looks good in the dark. I say this because because of some shots you think of what you want to buy from the Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies to this movie. But that's not a good thing. These shots look especially amateur This and many of the entire "film" seem to have shot it in their backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a car shot by Superman. And the final shot of the two faces and Batman at the very end. You've seen the trailer for those of you. You know what I mean. Now only if he could extend the shot through the whole trailer. <br /> <br /> I finally asked. Why are you trying to show your power as a director, would you make a trailer as a small film? This proves nothing when it comes to being a real manager handling story. Here is the difference between the only part of my advice to Kalora, the ability to tell stories and to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead and Not Amateur. I can not think where this went wrong.
