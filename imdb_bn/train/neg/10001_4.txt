I did not have anything in this picture that I could not keep my finger from the beginning: Carissa as the main actor of the career. This lack of uncertain chemistry translates when he shares the screen with his leading people. Even romantic scenery came across as acting actors only. The director can be very good in the mistakes the actors need to do. I just do not know <br /> <br /> But was it scrappy? Was just love chef right? He is the culprit of his cooking skills and the restaurant, and finally more and more of himself and his juvenile exploitation, than anyone else or something else. He did not believe me that he loved the princess. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated in this movie. But, do not forget that the Oscars were nominated, so judge for yourself.
