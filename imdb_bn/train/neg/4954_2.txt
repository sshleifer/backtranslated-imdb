I was raised to see the original Batman animated series, and I am a bright Batman graphic novel collector. As a batman, with a comic book hero as anecdotal, there are some features that can not be changed. Creative freedom is all good and good, but when it changes the characters completely, it's too far away. I purchased a season of "Batman" so it is expected that extra bonus features may be somewhat illuminated by the creators' logic to make such a program. In an interview about the creation of "Batman", one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure) said that "We think we will not be able to mess with Batman, but we can get involved with villains." So, they forced the Joker to pay attention to the unexpected little baby, Penguin rolled over some of his anime nokaf, Bob Fray, a super-guard hole thief, Pisson Ivy, a teenage hippie and many other shameful acts, Bob Cain rolled over his grave. <br /> <br /> To make it all gig: I had more hands so I could give this show four thumb down. It shrinks using only the Batman name with 2 ratings from 2 out of 10. Warner Bros ... Think Again This! Please!
