You must read these reviews to work hard in Britain in the 1960s. Maybe it's true, if so, then this movie is out of date. <br /> <br /> ************************************************** Spirir Alert ************** *************** ***************************************************************************************************************************************** <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can go away, but they do not. They do not have the knowledge because they go about this. There is not enough character development to explain why. Shooting of a bunch of innocent people is not even explained or even hinted at what is supposed to be. It has been mentioned that the war is the ultimate creative expression, perhaps the only revelation that there is no letter in this film and it does not give any sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the institution, they are just killing people. I thought that all the explosives could blow the place or at least the shelter, which made more symbolic ideas, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This movie is a teenage girl who dreams of fighting the authorities, but they really need them. It does not have any moral, symbolic truth, or its meaning; <br /> <br /> If you think that threatening / school shooting is similar to a Colombian or a Mercury technology, then it is a reasonable and intelligent way. If you do not want to deal with teachers and organizations, then I guess you'll love this movie. If you're like me and you're working to build a life for yourself instead of rebelling against "dark" (this film is very blindly), this movie is teenage and annoying. <br /> <br /> You can also say in such areas that there was a lack of money, and the story began to touch attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> To everyone, it seems like a very draft draft that may be right movie, but there is no effort in dialogue, character development, or moral ... so it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If I get only two hours
