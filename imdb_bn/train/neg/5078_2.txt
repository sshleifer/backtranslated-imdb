The "Exorcist II: The Heritage" of 1977 did not give any benefit to him, it is hard to imagine how unusual Thappian great Richard Burton sees disrespect in the thriller practices. You've seen it before: Burton has played a writer who discovered at a young age, with the power of his mind, the ability to move invisible objects (and you think "Kerry" has no effect on Hollywood!). Though adapted from Peter Van Greenway's novel, "Medasa" plays like recycled products, although the special effects on the cathedral finely are firm (if ideal). Lee Remick appears somewhat as a doctor, but otherwise throwing supporters is extremely weak. Burton Hammy is tired ... even Telenis could not even save him at this time. * **** to 1/2
