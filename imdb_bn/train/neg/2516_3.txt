Sadly, I do not remember the book, but I think I was influenced by Adger Wallace's story. This film represents a common German production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - even though the story itself is good, it's just badly adabted. Characters in the center of misery are highly available and exaggerated - they have no idea of ​​performance. Even the German actor Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy are well known and do not like these poor spectators can not be retrieved. But there is hope ... I have been told that following this picture is good and good. So in conclusion, it should be said that this film is not eligible for the cinematic screen, but it may be enough in the lazy afternoon.
