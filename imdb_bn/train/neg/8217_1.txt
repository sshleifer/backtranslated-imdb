Five began to appear in the eye because five teenage girls were driving home for their curfew, they stopped at a shop and accidentally hit another car and decided to leave it. Soon other cars forced them to stop and a crazy female came out with a shotgun and shouted at them, closed their clothes and pee on them, and then drives them off randomly. Suddenly the girls felt that their emotions were over, but the crazy girl felt the fear of losing the fearsome girls, they returned for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Swine's writings with Greg Swisen and Ryan Thesene are responsible for the editing and editing of Thesen cinematography and editing. I have to say that five worst movies around the eye that I have never seen, if not the worst, I mean that I'm struggling I saw a film that looks bad. Now let me tell you that I am sure that the decision to build many films taken here was deliberate to try out the atmosphere, excitement, realism and suspicion, but there were no five views around the eyes that I did not hate it since it was a bad home video Looks like it's been kept on YouTube and it's still a little embarrassing and my 90 minutes minutes A perfectly unnecessary waste of recreational and fun that I could do more. pulled my fingernails with pliers. Reviews on the Web seem to be quite positive but in IMDB (1 star comments are published and they can not be all wrong?) And this is a message board that I think is an indicator of how many people think that it is absolutely absolutely trash And the one that I saw the worst movie is used a few times, and most negative comments mention the same thing Bong and I agree with them. The story is terrible, okay, I suspect it's only short but this is short? There is no reason or explanation of the incident and it only feels completely random. This is going on for ages, here, the amount of the plot will be struggling to fill thirty minutes for the telecast program with a full-length feature. Conversations with these annoying girls are horrific, those of which there are cells in the brain do not seem like they're random stuff and a lot of screaming. O Allah, the girls crying or crying or shouting have endless scenes of scenes that just do not bother and disturb, and do not prevent any intelligent viewer from feeling sympathetic for them that they try to tell impossible to hear correctly. Then there's a real killer, the whole movie has been set up and shot in the limit of a mini van, the camera does not leave the car seriously, and you can imagine that it has become really annoying, only one person's dead body has been counted. Five Across the Eyes is a movie that I hated a passion. <br /> <br /> Once again on the technical level, I can see that the style of film making was deliberate choice here but I have to be honest again and the five essence of the eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen. As a movie fan, I like watching my films look like the right movies because it is a visual medium and I'm not sure that they want to look bad on average in YouTube video or in my home movies because of the camera sequence in bad condition. It's really amateur and that looks bad, it's a complete eye and I hate it every second every second. Only Blair Witch Project (1999) thinks it's just ten times bad and sounds and you're almost there. There are five times around the eye when you can not literally say what's happening or happening because of camera-work and almost peak-black and stained contrast levels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Has been there. The ownership of the two vans was owned by the film and it is roughly roughly the total area of ​​the total budget. Acting was very bad by the original actor, I just hated all the fake clothes by crying and screaming, which was not satisfied but totally irritated. <br /> <br /> I can sometimes go down to five under the eyes and I have seen some of the worst movies and when somebody now asks me that I've ever seen the worst movie, five must be mentioned in the eyes. I hate it, every single aspect and it's crazy moments.
