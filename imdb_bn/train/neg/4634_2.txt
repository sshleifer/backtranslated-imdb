Perhaps some talent is attached, Maria Bello is always great. But it is only a time-consuming fall, portraying each character and misusing them so that one can create a movie from an 'interesting' story. Well, I hope they've got it from their system. Unfortunately for the audience, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and no humanity really. Whatever is going to be all right, it is no comedy, no horror, no context, and nothing to be positive about trying to tell the story. The bad thing will happen, you sit and watch it, so do not you care? 99% of the time, 'based on the true story' makes an unknown alert to the viewer. This means the director and the screenplayers are lazy and lazy to hear some of the lazy things, so they only threw them on the screen and without expecting the film makers to do anything, the audience expects the true nature of the story to remember something. Work I hope they did a great time to make this movie. It stinks on the ice.
