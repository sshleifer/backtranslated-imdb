Let me clean. I've used IMDb for years. But today I had trouble registering on the site, so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I have seen hundreds of movies, some of them are bad, some terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is even worse, even more inspiring than the inspirational French game. (Marivox has not yet reached Hollywood, and we must keep it). <Br /> <br /> For example, for example, Leonontine is a bright, passionate philosopher and scientist, he is immersing chemicals from defilement, shouting the names of famous scientists. And romance between Agis and Princess even played sillier. For this, this pair should receive a collective 'Clear Dance' award, which will be rewarded for the immense and spiritual reconsideration of attractive teenagers (see Miss Miss Miss Miss) from literature as the only Brash of the world in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> In addition to the shocking plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to present artistic tricks in the filming. For example, there are moments when a mobile phone is shown in the activities and inside of the chair, sitting on the chair, the main characters. The director wants to realize he adapted a game. I get it But so far it will not happen in the film. At that moment, seeing a crowd of people sitting in the chair for a moment, then disappeared, scary and confusing. They're terrific with our filling, appear through mists, like some kind of unreasonable zombie crowd. When you see the ghazals and song that ends with this film, then you must kill all of your crowded crowd and 112 minutes for poisoning your mind poisoning. <br /> <br /> -Math McGuire
