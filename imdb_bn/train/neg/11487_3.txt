The best Laurel and Hardy shorts have been filled due to accidents, accidents, and destruction, which were mostly due to Stan, but Oli was severely punished! - 'The Music Box' (1933) or '<br /> <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why (it was based on sketch by Stan's dad?) Boys play it directly' A 'comedy' Built in supposedly funny situations. It does not stop. This is only the third 30th comedy in the third step, which has only grown by Stan and Olea's personality, who do not show any trademark gestures (oily finger sheets, stan empty straps etc.) or comic powers. <br /> <br /> Movies start with the police from them. Since we never see or know why, it is difficult to believe or accept the fear of caught, and thus hiding in the Colonel Botscht's palace. The main foundation of 'Humor', Oli himself left behind Colonel and Stan and both Butler and Maid were very busy. They do not play 'Stan and Wali' in this movie. Their part may be played by any pedestrians studio actor and it will be just as poor. <br /> <br /> Stan mime and he can do fun, but he will not get the chance to do any of that here. He is annoyed by saying too much of the conversation to remove the plot, but none of them grew more stupid than the fool. We are immediately considered as the third heart comedy chestnuts, such as the name of the Lord Plummet's name, the correct spots, "Call me a cab! OK you're a cab!" Tamasha, the police have lost their clothes and is seen in long horns, and Stan and Oli are two parts of an unreasonable clear horse costume, as they flee to the bicycle, and James Phinelson is still doing the whole body of his silent era and keston cop jumps to Jackson. <br /> <br /> A situation in Stann and Wali 'Sons of the Desert' (1933) did a lot of good work in the comedy where we see them love about them - to be themselves Actually, 1932-34 seems to be their best year. <br /> <br /> Since this image can not play with any of its power, why is it bothered? I'll give it 3.
