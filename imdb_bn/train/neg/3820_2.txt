For the fans of Buster Keaton, it's painful to see "Speak easily". Seeing such a wonderful writer, actor, poet, director, and stunt man, this insulting philosophy is like using Picasso as a drop cloth, or perhaps better camberbacks appear to be dissolving and processed in Chase-yes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, like the Keaton Professor post, whose exaggeration vocabulary says to him, "Tell me about the rabbit, George." (The post said something like, "Please let me know about the status of small mammals like logarirdi order logomorpha, sir, I believe initially summarized with the title of 'jorge.') When Keaton made his own character, they could be situationally stupid but they They were not stupid, they were quick researches and became masters in their world, not with a post that never stopped The Titanic did not stop the Bamplling and did not stop any more control over its fate than the sharp mice. And Keaton's real character was a charming innocent and innocent person, so much so that the post is so deeply sexually disturbing that if he ever gets physically stimulated , Then he will keep ice bags in sweat and get medical help. <br /> <br /> Some small, release moments There is also an attempt to save her suggestion as a suitable dress for Ketino's traditional genre, Theodo Todd or Greek dance, but it is not entirely permanent. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movie then get drunk and be with friends. See "Talk Easy", a la "mystery science theater 3000". But without that, stick with silent. Remember about 100% for Buster Ketton.
