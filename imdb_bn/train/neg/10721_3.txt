A drive led by Hafizi Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of Kings in Cairo to know what happened in the previous campaign. They join the beautiful mysterious Simiro (Java Rhondan) with them. They soon began to face their blood mummy ... and only what Simi thinks is happening <br /> <br /> A real graduate. I was caught on TV late in the late 10 years of age. It lets me sleep! I can see why I have seen these years later. This is going on slowly, do not show Mummy up to 40 minutes (and it's only 66 minutes long!), From the bad (grains) to the real bad (George N. Wales) and no violence or blood can be found. This movie draws even more attention than the second-rate plays (involves a trick of foolless love). This rate is three big because it looks really good, everyone plays it directly, Diane Brauer has some good acting, it's a short and mummy attack scene (their three) is not bad. They are not only mildly vague or scary. Still, this movie is quite bad. A sure fire remedy for insomnia.
