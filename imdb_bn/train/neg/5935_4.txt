The most painful thing about this "tribute" is that almost all of the singers (otherwise, with the incredibly talented Nic cave) seem to have missed the whole point of determination of the intensity of Cohen: almost helplessly supplying his line, Cohen sends a full volume of his poems, his hatred One of humanity, laughter, and tears in her everywhere. <br /> <br /> Some of these singers saw an impressive sorrowful face, in their patent attempts to scream, "I am a singer, a true pain." This is the same feeling, perhaps many of you are Lenin's "imagination" Some of the songs were heard in terrific operating versions. Nothing is easy, near simplicity and the perception of the basics gets closer. It does not need to be done, but it is the art of Kohin. Wonderfully it has entered the street, make up like a sex to sell sex. <br /> <br /> I have suffered tribulations and sad tributes, All of them are completely irrelevant to the original master, and if the truth is told, most of these singers think that they are recruited to show an asylum Echena. It Cohen, the object really is no other way to sing them with the respect they may be friends or her daughter, she is very humble heart and a gift may be in the mood. Too bad it was not in the house. Fortunately, but at the very end, Cohen himself performed her magnificent "Gun Tower", but even the flower was completely broken by the incompatible background of all of U2, all of them absentees went to their poor grandfather nursing home. Then they carry their expression. <br /> <br /> If I really love Cohen, sad show, really, and sad.
