If you want to see how far behind you are studying Wales and Citizens, this film will prove it. The drama is a pleasing excuse for creating a self-filled dummy, so that it fails to explain how to read this half-baked scheme, which eventually explains the upcoming courtroom theater and ridiculous plot twists. I did not accept the high rating of this photo on DB; I can assume that there are lots of deaths in Wells and Heyworth's fans there.
