Is our beloved Ramu in the world? Is this the same person who created the government, the truth, and the company? I refuse to believe so. If AAG is Ramu's most ambitious project, he has definitely evinced some of the greatest works of art and has been flying from high mountains. This movie is like a brick fall. I was impressed to get out of the theater, but I was forced to sit because I was not left out of parking. Otherwise, something will sit beyond me intermediate. <br /> <br /> This movie is somewhere near Sholay. It does not even come near it in a mile. I believe Ramu must love The Godfather more than Sholay, because the government was a wonderful job. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, where in interviews it has been said that Ramu is not sleeping for 4 hours a day, nor does it expand. I agree with this now, because her sleep deprivation probably took her toll in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan is not even scary. A few posters and wallpaper I saw before looked more awesome. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari government did a fantastic job because he did not have many conversations (in fact, if I do not remember clearly). He opened his mouth in this movie, and found a place in history. The new man, who played the role of Jai, found that he did not even play the role of the winner. I can not go ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to handle now. <br /> <br /> I have promised myself in the whole movie that once I see it I will see it in Sholay. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Awesome movie. Media and critics are going to cook Ramu's hoof. And just to remind all the readers once, I am one of Ramu's greatest maximum fans, and even I can not exclude him for this act.
