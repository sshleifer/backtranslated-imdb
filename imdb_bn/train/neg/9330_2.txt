Recently saw this movie and had high hopes. Not so much, based on the director who did not create a cinematographic release before, but more on the basis of his cast. Harvey Kettle, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (Body Dual, Brian De Palma Masterpieces) played all the great films. Although not together, and this fact has not completely changed for this reason. <br /> <br /> The image is incredible, very expected and cleaner. The only thing that can be a little interesting is to select the locations that move it. My sincere opinion: this one does not waste your time.
