Fascinated! This is the worst SRK movie and the worst Bollywood movie I have ever seen! I do not like the novel, but this movie has made worse! Very bad music, even bad actors (in addition to SRK, though they do not manage to save the film), and do not have much knowledge. The director sees it all very confusing, why Allah knows ... Perhaps it is because he is trying to make it look very realistic, and yet credible. Well, he does not manage. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie even if you're a few hours apart! (Saying this in your own interest!) Keep searching, you will find something else to see!
