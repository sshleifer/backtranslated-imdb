For several years I have seen a bunch of movies directly in this video Segal, and everyone has the same kind of entertainment; Unfortanetley, entertainment level is a low. Sure, the order of action was entertaining, but that was pretty. When Sigal was in real movies he was really! Under siege, under Seed 2 and executive decisions (at least from the point of view of the workplace), but in the last ten years, such movies do not fulfill the Segel Star's true merit. <br /> <br /> The more positive aspects, the film uses time better, such as action sequence and intelligence usage. Just when the movie just pulled in, a beautiful cool action scene came out of the gutter. I honestly believe that Segal's films will be better if they are not the only ones worried about the film. Acting actresses and actresses are a very important issue, and if these performers and actresses are known to her current films, then the film will get more popular results.
