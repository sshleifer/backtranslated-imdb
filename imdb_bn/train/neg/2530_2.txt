This picture was unreal. And the best way to claim it as something. The first to close the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is in love with this van. The plot, originally, is: Buying a van so that the boy wants sex (which is just fair enough). Incredibly he looks like a new look he scores with lots of girls! And he failed with anything. Then he scores with a really hot chick and understands that he loves this dirty bird who played hard to get. Then he pulls the race with the hot girl boyfriend. And he tips his van. Danny Davito at that time saved the day. Although he did not need to press the van, but the ginger child first crossed the line. I've given these 2 * titles since I want to assume that there are 70 vending subcursors that have more than 70 solid structures that I did not get.
