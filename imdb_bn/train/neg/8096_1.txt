Most of the book adaptations are bad but the film has dropped out of the original parts of the story and has changed the description and some letters. They rewired the story and combined scenes and changed the order. They add ridiculous things to that which have never happened in the book and will never happen. <br /> <br /> If I did not read the book before, it was an incredibly neutral movie, it does not care about you. About them like letters, or dislike them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
