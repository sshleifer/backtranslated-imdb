There are a lot of obvious publicity associated with this film. However, face it, however, why anyone will see that the main reasons will be for Leo and CAT, who are not the best actors of this movie. I'm not saying they are not good actors, I'm saying they are involved in this movie. Special effects were good (and I would say that filmmakers did a good job finding the ship), but there are even some big flaws in the IT. For example, just before the ship runs, you can see an incomplete blue-screen image behind your original character. <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, I really like the story of the Titanic, but I Find out an insult to that story in this movie. The edit was frustrating - for 2 1/2 hours (there is no reason for any film except for the exception of a movie), and the writing and screenplay has been torn very badly for a movie. <br /> <br /> I would say that the music was probably better than I could have predicted (and not only will "go to My Heart Will" song). There is a scene heard by the ship sinking and hearing the sound of lightning. That film may be too highlights. As a complete mood, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sorry for Jack's death, which I know, what the director can not do for it. <br /> <br /> In a brown shell, I find it terrible that they flick an over-hyped chick in the beautiful story of Titanic.
