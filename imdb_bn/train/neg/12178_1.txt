Annie's wig does not look good. He is not nice enough to play Annie and not enough. Annie sticks out the movie, her outfits look like Halloween costumes. Terrible acting and terrible plots. Such a change from the 1982 version of this movie. I think that the role of a small and small girl was the main role. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie Not all appealing At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbox. Miss Honeygno was a miscast. Comilla Bell Molly acted exactly. "Warning" This movie can insult your IQ, so you just want to see it very young people. 8 and smaller. Some plots can be very fictional and rarely occur in the real world.
