Fragmentaric movie about a few people in Austria during a heatwave. This type of movie has been made more often and is the best. The stories do not have anything to do with each other, except for the painful end: 'people are cruel'. Ugly meat, unexpected people and a movie which really goes a long way without creating a point ... Ultra-realistic? Annoying ... annoying? In fact Even the fantastic Franzisca Weiss can save this one! 3/10
