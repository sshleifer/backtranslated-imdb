This movie is extremely stupid when the events start to happen. I could not care less about any characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the main actor (forgot her name) found in my nerves. How it ended and did not seem so early, but the idea of ​​the whole idea of ​​the Allian in these films, and all these pictures looked stupid, did not carry the thing perfectly. My dad told me that it was a stupid movie ... I listened to him.
