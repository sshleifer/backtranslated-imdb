I do not know this movie got so much positive reviews on this site! I'm a big vonnegut fan and I think this shottime is a very popular story about bastardized stories out of faith, but if I'm not, poorly played, very poor welding (Sun Astin Bright, Athletes, and almost all people, Harrison ?? Generic Generic! ) And sub-standard text is rarely seen in this trip. Someone pointed out how nice the cool kin line was. If you read it and think it's a pure comic brilliance (sadly, it was probably the most fun part of the film), probably you would love this movie. But you will not see it if you're a Vonnegut fan or not completely insane. Please
