The video was straightforward - the story is frustrating, Nick Cage shows Janny sticking-in church, and other scenes that bite the film in vain limits (like the view of the laundry room). Judge Rainhole is fine as misconduct - but the film itself is not working on the theme of deterioration and revenge. But it's a good movie for triangle competitions - because very few people saw it.
