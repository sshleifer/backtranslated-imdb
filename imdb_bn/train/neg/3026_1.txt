A model based on Domino Harvey's life, supposedly turned into a reverse hunter. I would say 95% fabric. I always keep an open mind in the film, however, this movie has lost its chances when it became visible that it was narrated in the whole film, something that I can not stand and stop it, the hero of the story is so hateful and a proud Improved b! F I just wanted to finish with his head shot being done. It is very inconvenient, very dazzling and very annoying, it gives a crap-like story, and I think really big time managers do not have anything based on the life of their own imagination or some sensible snobby brat's life to create a movie based on their own .
