It was a flow when National Lampon's class ration was published. It was not long in the theater of my big city. Why? Because it bade !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not really bad but really painful, bad. Most actors of the actors were mostly unknown and after this turkey remained unknown. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (Slashar Flickr is a parody) but lack of execution of each aspect lacks execution. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Watching these embarrassing misfire during your time is more valuable than a nanosecond cost.
