Oh, dear lord .... they have become a fairly excited film which has turned into a swaggering testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this movie was unclear about our hero Kaulowski. He was trying to win a radio from Denver to San Francisco. Why is he willing to risk his life for the price of a young person? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that told us the picture that he was an Adrenaline junkie, and probably tried to take his whole life to the invisible place. You see the point where the left and right shoulders of the road are gathered and the road becomes extinct. He lives only to be free, and means no illness over anyone. We have seen several times that before the accidents were closed the other driver was going well, even before the police was behind him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the vainness of his quest, he took his life, rather to arrest and live a captive life. <br /> <br /> There is full history of Kowlski in Remac (even the first name, even.) He is trying to go to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications. Her pregnancy. She is a dedicated husband, and excited father. After his wife died in deliveries, she decided to take her life, but they answer such questions as they think she might come out of the car before going to Buldjozar. They even illustrated Jason Private by the "super soul", blind DJ (largely dazzled by Kylovan Little)?!?!?!? !!? Give me a break.
