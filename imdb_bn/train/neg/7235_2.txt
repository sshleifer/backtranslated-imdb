Bob Hope is also not inspired by the role of great actors, it can save this poorly written attempt in the war comedy, because its patent timing work is a little less. In this plot, Don Bolton (Hope), a Hollywood movie star, tried to resign his military service in the beginning of World War II, and then he admitted wrongly to the colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamor) in a misleading attempt at the court. Bolton's agent and his assistant, directed by Lillian Overman, is featured by Eddie Bracken, three of them, and three of his training training exercises involved in training exercises depicted in Maliba, California, Hills. Paramount made the systematic effort for this effort, his top experts used it, but usually the direction of reliable David Butler was flawed and in this scenario it is certainly responsible for a missing comedic element. A shift towards the end of the film is still due to the lack of stunts and proof of camera action to create heroism by bolton. Wonderfully, Lynn Overman has been given the best line and this experienced master of thief is very good by them. Dorothy Lamour looks beautiful and works nicely, and Clarence Kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique in screen or radio, but they can do something to save this film, damn it, with an error of assigning it to the script.
