F * @ # I saw that? Steven Stop !! Please! This movie is bad and silly in the past. Bizarre out of action and adventure, Mr. Sigal is now (apparently) looking forward to 'living creature' like supervisor? OK? Oh, and their eyes embrace the roadside in an inhuman way? How nice! Even in this movie, I have something more powerful than a $$ ego-end-fifth-and-no-one-ear-kick-mine for separating Sigals. But the average people are all crushed around him. Come, I can understand the big guns around the neighborhood or drug dealer, but these are powerful people for the people. Oh and get it, Seagal goes through a short sting of identity issues, apparently he and his quart think he is Wolverine! Oh my go ... and that's the worst! Yes, there is a worse than that. We look at his face, even in the middle of the sentence is his voice on changing voice. They obviously do not say anything like that and I believe this might be another actor in the film. It was pure crazy. Although I wanted to stop it I always ended up watching a movie. Steven is always less direct for your video. Awful, terrifying! Awful, terrifying! Awful, terrifying! Two thumbs down! Revival qualities? Well I guess so, I would be fair to that aspect. At least some special effects are OK and I like the choice of dresses for actors and actors. All of the women were very interesting IMOs. Yet, and I still said, it's not ready for XL, Underworld, (insert your favorite junky, vampire movie here)! Everyone should be exiled and exiled from the director, writer, producer, film business. I think most of the people in this picture think about Blood Rains (and only all other Uwe Bow images). My entire $ 1.00 in this movie See if you dare
