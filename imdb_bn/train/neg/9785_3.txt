This movie, after school, is not bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happened. You still feel as you are in the class. A guy teaches a bunch of young painters how to be good paint ball players. We do not get them doing these underdogs badly as we train them to the best players. They suddenly turned into good players slowly. There are also many characters and no character development. Very often the main character and some of his sexy sisters and other kids are spending enough. It may seem like a 'Bad News Bears' (original) because all the boys' teams had a girl, but the film did not have any feeling. It does not have any feeling and after seeing it leaves a slight pain in your bones, it's not fun to bag, it's not fun to watch, and it's kind of .... Plain. Annoying If you want to see something after school before your pre-night nap. The day is so soft and watching this movie for a long time.
