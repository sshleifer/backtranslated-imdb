Brad Pitt is a pretty hard filling for a heterosexual for admitting to the fantastic. But what can I say to you? Maybe that famous extra thing that everyone talks about and makes a star a star. This is the barrier that prevents. It pulls you into the unknown sensual and emotional region. Brando Spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, of course James Dean and more recently Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ian McGregor and Billy Crudup. Garbo, Dietrich, Catherine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampoling, Merrill Strip, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts, and most recently women have fallen in love with Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, alone, has redefined the idea. He goes outside, goes to the car, gets parking, buy a ticket, buy popcorn and go to the theater to see "Troy". If you like an epic on "Wednesday's darling" style you can enjoy it. But if you do not, however, go the same way, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
