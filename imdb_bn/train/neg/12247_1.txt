This film is really terrible. It's 84 minutes of waste in your life as terrible. Special effects are so awesome Acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> This is about a crocodile that attacks tourists because they are drawing a documentary about "Blood Surfing". Blood is surfing when they roam around sharks, but 31 feet of dirt can leave them there when it's a terrible mistake. Shark does not look real. Crocodiles are even worse, and they become more kind when animals run away, but the crocodile gets stuck and two women flash it. Deaths are fake and the pirates only have time to fill. <br /> <br /> is a vain, horror movie which is not worth watching !!
