One of them is thanks-god-me-there-not-documentary. These two battlefields are said to be between Colombian, guerrilla and semi-military forces and the surrounding Madeleine community. <br /> <br /> guns, medicines and deaths are strong. Boys, not more than 22 years old, are in jail even in the middle of the war. Girls ?? Women, not girls ?? Always respond in the same way when one of them is killed, tears and screams. You scratch your head; What did they expect, really? I do not know what's more annoying: night shooting-out and civil unrest, or everyone thinks things are right. Or, seeing that boy, he's obviously not his first beer, all what's going on, 10? If you take one of these young men out of their condition and put them in some places where they have the opportunity to do more, stay more, how many do not want to stay? <br /> <br /> This documentary, all, I'm scared.
