Above all, yes, I'm white, so I try to walk on the subtle subject of color ... However ... white people hate black people, but the rebels hate black people. = OK (because apparently we deserve it !!). Where do I start? I hope this movie was good to say something about the unexpected comedy scenery: the notorious scene Ice Ice and Co. Some really big, really strong, really looking for Neo-Nazis with really angry and scary and get a fight with Joy win !!! Neo Nazis where the size doubles :), and behind! Chase is invaluable ... it is not a film about nation, tolerance and understanding, it is not distributed ... it is a racist film that re-affords all the clich√© stereotypes, white intelligent man who manhandled by it, the black roommate automatically gets a skin head Transformed ... Kisses are terrible, I'm sorry to ever see it. <br /> <br /> If your time and a badly written, bad acting, horrible experience of dust and clear biased photo, save you go into the subject, go and hire American History X, now that a movie
