The filming crew did not get good access to occupied territories, so the filming of Israeli scenes was affected. I saw almost the opposite side of the mother's view. Israeli mother lost a child, which had the potential for great happiness. Palestine's mother has lost a child, which has only one personal life and frustration. As with a completely different perspective, there was no real chance for a meeting to match. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning of each of them. Peace was peace in Palestine. Israeli peace was in peace. With such a lazy, is this kind of film really worth it? I ended up feeling that I saw an uninterrupted campaign - both sides were incredible.
