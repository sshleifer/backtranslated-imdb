Its 96 minutes cruel .. and I love old munster. Yes, things are intriguing; Yes line is trite; But anyone who had this helmet was not a fan. So much of the 'conspiracy' (and I use that word with a great pause) which I think is the old Starsky and the Hutch episode. I had lost countless times seeing a makeup missed by the caller. In the mid 60s (laughable) anytime the producers refuse to acknowledge the timing of replacing Marilyn and Eddie with young actors. Why do not they grow? Adam's family style reunion link does not join the taste of the Halloween party. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Go to Danpa and Herman Transfillier and go back within a few hours (rebel.) Seed Caesar is the most More, yes, the most incredible character (with bad robots), he boasts a strange combination of arrogance and the yaday, but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler. And yes, it seems missing the laugh track. In fact, there are few traces of dead air that are inserted after the sunny track. The actor seems to be waiting for the wrong audience. It's not funny; It's tragic. Oh, and the best part! There is a line in Yvonne DeCarlo which just goes to show you how the author and the producer touches. Marilyn says something like: "Where can Herman and Grandpa be cousins? They may be in the accident, they can kill a car or train!" Lily is responding to something like this: "If you want to drag yourself from the train track, you'll be Henman Uncle." What's amazing about this: Devon's husband of Yevon was a stantman in the early 60's and lost a leg and almost died in a train stunt. He did not recover and this financially devastating his family. (See the excellent biography of biography and career) This line can easily be changed to be more sensitive to him. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fan of Munster, then you have to RENT this mess. It explains how some things left alone alone. Even with almost (real) original cast, it was almost as bad as the restoration of the show some years ago.
