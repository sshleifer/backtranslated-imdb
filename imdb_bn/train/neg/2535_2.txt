Last year such as WWE New Year's Revolution 2006 was an Elimination Chamber match title. The difference between last year and this year's match was the price of entertainment however. In reality, only three people got the chance to walk from Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, at the WWE Championship. The man was current champion John Saina, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michael. Vinnie did not have a belt on a rouge, and there was no way she could; Carlito or Chris Masters And why? Kenny held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It is clear that he was not going to be one. Last year the match had six exciting ties with the WWE. 2006 was an expected and frustrating matter, but still the night match is <br /> <br /> Vince McMahon strolled out and they claimed to lift the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was making cash in cash at the bank's championship match at the same time. There was no time in preparation time and winning the match of the Elementation Chamber, the army could not stand a chance, and skipped the title after a WWE's most entertaining heel spear. This was the only entertainment piece that took place all night. <br /> <br /> The undercards were really rogue like last year. Triple H and The Big Show celebrated a graduation festival to fight me. HHH lifted the win, but was it really no doubt? With the same card, both Jerry Loller and Visa will not get any pay-per-view opportunities to succeed. The King has betrayed Helms (who books these things?) And Big Weis defeated against Cheltenham Benjamin with little help from his uncle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ashley and the women's championship were also on line with a bra and Panties Gantlett match. In one match, I thought that WrestleMania must go up to Brue 22 Mickey James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the contest, but it is clear that it will continue for the future. <br /> <br /> The night's first inaugural intercontinental champion, soon stood near WWE Champion AZ against Rick Flayer. It may be better, but it was a deadly and bloody flyer that was kept after the disqualification. AJ was clearly big fish fish. <br /> <br /> So New Year's Revolution throws up the 2006 exhibition calendar to the crashed fashion. The only good thing from this is that the only way for WWE is up. They do not get much worse than this.
