Boy, this one laughing movie! Although I did not see all of Burton / Taylor's cooperation, I can confidently say that it is the worst. This rich but sick woman (of course, Taylor) owns this beautiful island in the city of Madyathe, when she travels suddenly through the travel poet, then rules over a puppet staff who is turning face. In fact, the whole film is just a conversation festival, most of which are not made in any sense. Even in the year 1968, no one can make these disrespectful stupid heads or pieces, and the passage of time makes even more evident. If it is not for beautiful cinematography and scenery, it will be eligible for a negative rating. The only thing for this movie is its strange smile.
