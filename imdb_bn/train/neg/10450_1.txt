"Movie movie" shows that this movie is the worst movie. Instead of being scared I was smiling through the whole film. It was interesting how snakes attack the eyes, the tongue, the butt, the breasts, for example for the body of the passengers. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes should not be carried on after body bites. For each specific scene the snakes bite the passengers and bind them on the body. I believe the producer did not study his information about the snake and their behavior. I can not believe I lost my money in this movie. So I do not recommend the belief of this movie that wait until it is in the dollar theater or rent it.
