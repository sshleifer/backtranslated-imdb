R O B O T J O X <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No close. <br /> <br /> Completely and completely created the worst movie. <br /> <br /> Replacing "Adventures of Pluto Nation" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this totally inactive, unapproved, unapproved, undirected, unselected world of a thing called "RobotJox" - and I have just found it - they have made the second !! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Johar the Bouticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their movies. One thing that makes this movie just bad in this mess - awesome awesome and diverse like this thing. This is the only movie I ever said - Remove it from NetFlix - now !!! 10,000 out of 10 think this comment is helpful.
