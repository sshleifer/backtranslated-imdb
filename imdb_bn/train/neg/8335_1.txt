Packages mean that Warren Batti and Goldie Haun are dragging a huge bank robbery, but this is not from me! I got nothing! In the first half, there is a new character (without roles) in each other scene. The first half hour is fully available, the rest are only a long, annoying, underlit watch scene. Whether it always has an exciting sound in the background, it's a loud watch ticket, a shining ceyron, a train wheelchair, or even a terrific score by Quincy Jones. There are a lot of sunny parts that are many. Like, the bad guys back behind Peter's back! Or, police are apparently about fifteen times coming. I really hate this movie!
