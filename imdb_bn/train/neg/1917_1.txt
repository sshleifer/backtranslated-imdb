This picture, though not completely bad, should be shot where the actual incident happened. The Grand Island, Nebraska was crashed by seven tornadoes at night, on June 3, night. The Grand Island Holland is located in almost completely, flat plateau river valleys. The creator of this film is pictured on the covered hills of the Ontario tree and relocates the entire event in a non-existent town known as Blanworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this horrific night just because of a poorly made movie.
