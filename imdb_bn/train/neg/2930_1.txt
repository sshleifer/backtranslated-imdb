I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every British city (okay ... may not be aunt Python, some jokes were very good, but I did not understand anything between them), but this gentleman's league is somewhat good for you to get sick. This show was some way better; It helped me to lose some weight because this piece of garbage seems like I'm not hungry anymore. This is not really just annoying, sick and even funny TV shows and I wonder who actually smiles at these things. I saw it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was very disgusting, peeping at the man with a toothache and watching urine on the car ... I mean ... ... so funny thing ??? It wants me to puke No humorous, just boring pictures and cheesy, toilet smile ... I do not know ... if you like this thing ... you go ahead ... see this ... but to be honest, people are watching and enjoying it. There should be some mental problems. Waste
