I'm not interested in Palbayer, it's not too bad, but very slow at that time. The movie continues, it becomes a bit more attractive, but nothing is bright. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a fan of Gwyinth Paltrow, but I sometimes do not think of him and he's okay. PaulBeyer does not have a highly recommended movie, but if you like Lead you can enjoy it.
