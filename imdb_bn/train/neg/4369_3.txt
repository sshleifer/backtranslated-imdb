*** SPEAKER *** *** SPOKILLER *** Jagranoot is a British-made "thriller" first released in the US national. Carloff Doctor Sartreus will have to leave his studies because his funds have dried up. To force Carlow to return to France and start medical practice. She is proposed by a conniving woman, who wants to get rid of her many older husbands. He knows Karlf's money is needed. <br /> <br /> Carlough agreed to the proposal and soon became the personal physician of the husband. All the time, the wife is promoting the city with a good player of the city. Carole eventually injures the old Geyser with poison and he kicks off. However, his son (from another marriage) appeared a few days before the assassination and found out that the will has changed. When she spoons the beans, she spills her semen and even bites the boy's hands. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Carloof's nurse lost Hypo Carleff to kill old men. When Karlof found out that she was not getting any money, she asked her to slay his wife. Nurse suspects Karloff and finds missing Hypo. Analysis shows poisonous, but within a few days of kidnapping of Karloff's nurse, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By Karloff . Karloff instead of injection himself and died. <br /> <br /> There are some good points on this movie. Karl has appeared and read in love with a mad doctor at The Devil Commands and The Man Who Loved Anonymous. It's weird, though, to see him walking hard and near a little hunting. We do not find out why he is walking this way. I thought the director had made him worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The two actresses highlighted something awful. She has a French accent. Although he works badly, you manage to hate him (or you can hate him because of his acting ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you buy sinister movie VHS copy, the audio is a little sticky.
