If Alien, Jurassic Park and many other strange movies, add your cup of tea, plenty of sugar and you can get it down. The image starts around 1100 in astronomy in old England and then goes on to California's current days. Our Chief Carrier (Dean Kain) is the new Security Chief and the 400th Land Land Advisor as a Military Advertiser. He comes with a lead scientist (Carver also has a helicopter pilot) and we quickly find it in a cloning lab and they have something new available to clone. Is it dinosaurs? Like most of the movies above, all the hell breaks and our characters begin to pick. The special effect on the mind is not a pretty good one for a "direct video" movie and Dean Kine gets what she does for. But forgetting the rest of the part we know why we have never seen them before. Again, do not go with high expectations and you just will.
