I remember "Last Missile" (actually I was a frequent guest until my brother and a few cousins ​​burst in the house, who agreed to meet me - I occasionally, Eric Cartman of the 1960s - sorry, boys) and Due to some embarrassment, million degrees of heat appears as a plot device - even in the second class, I knew that a mere missile cable With roughly the temperature or a temperature higher than the temperature that can carry a nuclear explosion and the limited duration of the radius. <br /> <br /> On my lover relatives prove that Turkey was a suicidal crime. <br /> <br /> The production price of the film was very good. The performance is not bad (other than the actor Saturnarajam who has congratulated the governor's associate here). <br /> <br /> But missile concept is baking easily through the surface of the world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a terrific classic of extraordinary comedy. Want to drink beer but see it.
