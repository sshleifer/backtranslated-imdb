And the way they come to the show and tell their stories, as we did not hear it before tonight and tonight (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story about losing a hand from shark, which was October 31, 2003. Do not tell me that There is no solid feeling.) But the biggest thing in the interview is Michael Jackson's interview in 1993 on the charge of being a child molestar. Sadly, Mr. Jackson is dead now.
