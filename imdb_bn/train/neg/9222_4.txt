I like the real cultural activities and the sixties sci-fi films and because of this actresses are seen. They do not matter whether sex workers can stay in this movie and they can work (remember "Candy"?). I was frustrated by this film because it was not enough nostalgic. Here is the story "Dragonfly" a European science-film has been created and the director was fired. So the producers decide to release a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davis) to complete the film. They are a really beautiful woman in the movie of Dragonfly, but rarely. The film was written and directed by Roman Coppola, who used to exploit some of her offspring from her first day and kept it in script. I hope these films can pay tribute to those first films. They may have plenty of cayos by the actors who appeared to them. This film has an actor, popular in the sixties and popular with John Philip Law (Barberella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well. I guess a director has to wait for 60 years to pay good tribute to the film. If anyone is reading this, "Make Sexy as You Can"! I will wait
