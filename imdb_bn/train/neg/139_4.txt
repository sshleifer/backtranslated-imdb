This movie was a friend's hire. His choice is usually good. I had to read the first cover and hope for a better movie. Although it was a horror movie <br /> <br /> Which I do not like. But there was no hurry to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dennis Richards <br /> <br /> opened the eyes again. But that's it. We (our four) <br /> <br /> We are a little disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> Judge yourself.
