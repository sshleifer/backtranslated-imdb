How am I going to rocked this movie? All these small weenies are sick and tired. It works more on authentic cigarettes! Do not send an assassin, it's much more intelligent to snug hundreds of bright, colorful, offensive, poisonous snakes on a plane! The only reason people like this movie is because they think. This is "not very good at it" It is so bad that I will give insects with a sharp stick on the eye, then it will be under it again. I genuinely thought that comedy would be like a plane! An explosion! I was wrong. It's the whole "it sucks, get it!" Or at Samuel A. Jackson said, "Plane is a snake snake, I'm sorry, I did not find it." It seems that the film industry has made movies like Triple X and Die Hard for more money, the same people who bought the CD of William Hong bought a movie For what you spend, they still live in Mummy's basement and play computer games online and watch pornography. Take a look at the theater and ask for one (since I suspect you have a girlfriend) a stupid stick plane on the plane., Metal Metal Jacket, Paul Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clark etc. There is no quibble to show the film, the real fall of Western civilization, this civilized film is just like a real classic classic. Pope Man, even Orgazomorum insult. I have said enough here.
