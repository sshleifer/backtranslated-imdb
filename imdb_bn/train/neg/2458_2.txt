I can not describe how terrible this movie is. Am I just here, whose path is totally animated by its animated? Rhon men look 100% fake with their bad colorful hair, which does not match the look of the actors. Orcs looked terrible. Why the gandafake walk with a bad lecher? Why can they pronounce correctly? Not easy Arman. There was something else like Tolkien's terrible terrible pronounciation * SP *. All and I'm happy to have this studio pulled the plug from this sequel, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Watch hobbit cartoons for a good cartoon of Tolkien's work. The dribble of hell, even the ROTK cartoon version, is even better. 2/10
