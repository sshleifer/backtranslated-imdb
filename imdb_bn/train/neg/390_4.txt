I love the professor for the first two seasons <br /> <br /> But with season now 5? (Or is it 6?) Things are very tiring easily. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, but Donald Trams became his ego festival. You can work for her company, but come! Some say, "You've got fire" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show I did not want to work for him. Because he is arrogant, pompous or as such The program is unreal and makes me fool just like it manages. Good Entertainment? Yes, but touching back becomes tedious as it gets tired .. It does not work in the team, it's not private, it's just business. See your back jack
