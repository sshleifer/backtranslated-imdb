I thank God, I did not go to the film for this film. I would be sorry for the money I paid. I saw it on TV and I could not damage my eyes. I think if any film could be worse than this. They spent billions of dollars in this movie to do nothing. Awesome acting and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote the comments are working on that film company;) It is a big lie! Can they still laugh in this kind of film in 2000? embarassing ...
