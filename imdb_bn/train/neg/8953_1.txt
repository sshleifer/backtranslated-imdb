After finishing the book, I literally saw this movie directly, and perhaps it was neutral idea or very stupid. I think it's next. First of all, it was a lot of small, yet important details were wrong. In the daily life of Winston's daily life, his conversation, eating cafeteria, etc. I think that he is unhappy and has shown clear surveillance to the people without fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that it was impossible to safely show even an indication of his true emotions at a snap even in small activities. These proletarions have seen the street scenes. In the book, Winston knew that it was a huge risk to travel around and every suspect was scared and frightened. Whenever he does this often without fear, you will lose heavy impression of the risk and direct risk from the bat. <br /> <br /> In another tiny mistake, Winston kept his diary secret in the wall, yes a very small change, but it asked, what is the point? The director can do the most annoying thing with a book, and it's a charseless character. <br /> <br /> Big mistakes were a lot more annoying. First, one of the important parts of the book is the Big Brother, a government based on an intelligent, yet weird philosophy. In the movie, they release it and you think directly that the government is driven by Hitler's technology. Which is true, when it is directed towards its fascism, but if you leave the Big Brother, then you really miss the point of the book. The horrific thing about Big Brother is that it contains some points behind his philosophy in a way. When Andrew Love is watching Winston's mind on the ministry, he is hearing Winston's everything against Big Brother. He is hearing that, and the progress of his philosophy progresses, what is the most dangerous and intriguing effect. To the end, (Winston goes ahead), when Winston says that he loves Big Brother, the terrible thing is that you are not sure whether it is due to frustration or persecution, which is the real power behind philosophy or its cause. I'm not saying that I have an appeal to Big Brother's vision, but its intelligence and depth makes this book incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, how can anybody feel any relation between Julia and Julia? Winston in the film? It was terrible, there was no connection. <br /> <br /> Where did O'Brien address Winston before his address? One of the things it was carrying was one of Winston and Bryan's thoughts about the book. In the movie, they just jumped the gun. <br /> <br /> It is understood why this image was a horror: because it is impossible to jump guns and morph letters in less than two hours. If someone thinks this movie is less than two hours, how was it visible? In a very short time, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some important moods and links. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />, Because the book is impossible, and this film only proves how impossible it is, it is somewhat impossible in a small rock film. <br /> <br /> Two stars in ten
