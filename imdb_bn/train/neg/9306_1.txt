This picture is the worst excuse for a motion picture I've ever seen. To begin with, I want to say that the cover is always confusing in front of this film, if you think you are going to see a horror movie with a monster forest, but you are very wrong. Indeed, the faces of the killers are not a little bit like the front cover, this is just a picture they found on Google and it seems to be great. The things they said and thought that it seems cool, there is a scene in this film where some gangs are searching for a friend in the old forest, then the screen suddenly becomes silent where the mother deer is in a glance of young sunlight ... I seriously WTF ??? How are they roaming through dark woods? I bought this image from a man in the market, hope it would be entertaining, if it is not awful, at least it will be fun? Wrong! The next day I freed my work colleague from SICC named Plague. <br /> <br /> The following line is: Do not see this picture !!!
