This photo was so amateur that I could not believe what I saw. This video is shot! No film! From the early 70's, when I showed the video of 'Horror Flicks' shot in the late night network ... I saw it in the video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and it is paying a complimentary. Some of the actors give their best shot. Michael Des Berras is okay with what has been given, which works outside the control of sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not blame anyone for the poor blockage of someone else, but in his role Incredible Her younger daughter voice works against her here. And I think myself a Nastasja Kinsky fan. He must be stupid and exotic, but he is out of range with him. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul is pathetically overwrought. He is with three surprises points in each line distributed. Nobody has to be guided to scream him at all costs. Why do Michael Des Berras want to have sex with such a rage? Finally, as a sweet, drunk wife, Rosanna Arquette is just off, and perhaps the bunch is most credible. But it's not saying too much. <br /> <br /> I saw the worst movie this year.
