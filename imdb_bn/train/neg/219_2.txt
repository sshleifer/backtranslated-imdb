It was a good film if it discovered something more interesting than a lesbian relationship page, but the movie meant it was ... It is not quite predictable that two girls are similar to the Russian group Tietu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing realistic in this film to support it, so they had to use something that is already famous. You know the recipe. Other actors ... Well, I do not know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well-known in Romania and I want to point out that there are not some actors in them (like Mihaila Randulusu). To summarize it: "Girl band tactics" + Frustration / preacher need "actors", + non-existent plot + program to use bad language for mourning = love sick .... very bad ... Though the idea was good ... and I will give myself the title comments seriously ...
