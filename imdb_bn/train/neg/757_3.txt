My kids show the show every day. This is a great program for young children. However, they will be shown to run again and make some more real shows and get rid of Rooney and Daddy's yellow tittle. Bees are the only doodle box with clear white pearl teeth and the children notice these things and ask that 2 never brush their teeth? And if the show ever makes its way to the United States and so we can find out where its schedule is. And if we could be able to add one other thing. Moe you have to hide so much secret Sometimes when you fear a little boy and drag the rope? Does that signal? Others then getting wet all the time. They have to add new things instead of the same show instead of the same show. Kids that way loose interest.
