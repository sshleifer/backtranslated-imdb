It takes place on the west, but the title seems like it is a conventional western. Instead, it is a movie Sheriff a movie. Make a mistake though a bad movie about a female Sheriff. When her husband is shot to death, she becomes a sheriff; He is only a tad bit annoyed by this. His main goal is after a villain who is a woman, but Wilen hired one to kill him. So what will happen, the hero falls in the murderer and the opposite love. Foolish stupid, thank you new sheriff as someone who killed this movie. There are some possibilities to throw the killer behind bars, but I think he will not do it because he liked him. The murderer's mayor's personal reasons after that even silent. This movie is very annoying and it's not really valuable ... it's not one of the best episodes of MS000 3000. I can not imagine anyone watching this without them, because that would make it more painful. Kaman is a low budget director, but he wanted to know better than to go to one place and get out of the other.
