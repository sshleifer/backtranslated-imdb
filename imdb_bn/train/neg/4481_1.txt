I first saw Kelvin Kain-Eskee advertising, but I thought I would give it a chance. So I saw it, and I can say all bleh. This movie was so bad. It is very rare that I hate this movie. Seeing this flickr reminds Alterman's "player" funny scenes, when the authors have their bizarre sense to the producers. I want to know that an MTV producer has decided that Bronto's one and a half hour music video adaptation (but Heathcliff's name Heath and he is a rock star and Hendlie's name Hendrix) is a good idea. <Br> <br /> It may not be too bad, did they not even get such a terrible mistake in all other aspects of this movie? The direction was "You are alone, crazy for me." I laugh out loud all during the "serious" scene and were bored across the rest. The camera work was awake and reminded me repeatedly that I was watching a bad movie trying to be bad. My theory is that the word had disappeared and with its broom went to the beach for a few beers - I could see half the scene was the wave. And in another scene, all I want to do that I could hear. And the words do not say, what they did to Mariah's song "More" sister is totally ineligible, and again, what Brent has done is ineligible. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was an entertaining scene - especially at that moment when Johnny Whitewet caught Catherine Higgil's face - and if you can tell me that the whole story has to do with all the power you have in the scene.
