Annoying Minimal plot No character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It might have been a terrific movie. It probably could have been a religious classic. No, it was a giant let down. It was thrown badly and had terrible special effects. Who was difficult to determine the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I still left the movie confused by some mini plots. I have left this dumbfounded as something called "prediction", which is not really fully explained. I felt I was watching a short episode of a mini series in the Saifai Channel. It seems like a lot like TV movie for a made. Do not go to see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
