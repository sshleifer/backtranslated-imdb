The previous comments encourage it to be tested while showing in TCM, but it is a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but does not get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Pallet play familiar but promising characters, but the script stops them. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving towards the pride of the character of Lee Tracy, it is the best self-centered, physical and verbally abusive jerk. The "public" reactions are badly worried and incredible, because "Schengen" thinks of the intensity of a bad writer. And it believes that the loop wallet can be read for him. <br /> <br /> The "stinging one-liner" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, because I have not even made an effort to be made.
