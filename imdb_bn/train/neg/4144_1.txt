Vampires The unknowable disease spread across America leaves patients with lethal and cannibalistic tendencies ... Travis Fontaine (CS Munro) and his teenage daughter, Zenna (Bonnie Giroux) listen to the radio while listening to the radio. When the trouvis is meant to run on a man, a zombie is meant to be used when trying to escape and fleeing the road backwoods isolated the road. To help Julilla (Brinke Stevens) and her teenage daughter Carmilla (Martamara Carlson) who is waving along the street she has a third teenage daughter named Tessa (Melanie Crystal) at this time tied down Julia's car and gagged behind, a little down the road. To me this situation may seem strange but Tavis, like a soldier, she takes her place and agreed to 'take' Carmilla from Julia's arm and I do not really know. So, with a complete stranger, Trovis drives off Julia & Tessa. Carmilla looks like a beautiful girl, but she is going to be a vampire and she likes to bite people and make them vampires, she and part of a lot of homosexuality too. Trevies, Carmilla and Zenda are traveling, some people call themselves the General (Peter Roginis) who seems to be a vampire killer and probably have everything to do with it, but the film is a mess. I do not know about this, how to manage this plot outline, just like the headache of my head ... <br /> <br /> Co-edited, co-executed, written and directed by Vince D'Amato Vampires Zombies are one of the worst movies ever and now one of the worst movies ever. D'Amato script is clearly based on a classic story titled 'Carmilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu (someone should be sued) and it is a complete mess, plot and logic so much that you can run a tank through them! Does the disease make people jumbo? Why Carmela is a vampire? Who is Julia? Who is the general general? What does he want? Where is the tragedy and adultery? How can tragedies run on a human and still do not have a little bit of human emotions? Finally, with the mental ward? There is also some confusing and unnecessary dream sequences to disturb the audience. There are many errors with this movie, the description does not make the blind bits, the concept is terrible and never explained correctly, plus it is incredibly annoying. There is no positive thing to say about vampires vs. Zombies, not one. War Against Zombies Forget Any Vampire Because It Does Not Mean, Tell Me Again Why is this film vs vampire? Hairy <br /> <br /> Director Dr. Amato is the most incompetent, rubbishy, ​​badly prepared, bad thoughts and brutally painful experience ever made. Vampires Zombies really have no redeeming attributes, there is no single aspect that I can appreciate. Gore really looks fake, there are some blood splatters like red blood, some cheaper cheap effects and half decent modes, where Jubby is offered to Comilla and Jana's intestines, this fairly spectacular scene is perhaps the best part. Overwhelming film but it lasts for only a few minutes and is not made for 85 in any other way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films ever produced, it has been shown to me unfortunate, that the whole thing only sucks. The acting prophetic is horrific, and I mean terrible. <br /> <br /> There is no remaining left, Vampire vs. Zombies are one of the worst movies ever made. (Vi) Vampires beside the title on IMDB's main page. Zoimbies indicates that it went directly to the video, it was great that it would be right to go directly to the nearest fire to get it tied up.
