There was potentially there. I saw the cripple and thought, 'oh, it's been interesting' several times. Yet some interesting plot lines have been unknown or ignored, as they have never happened. The main character was boring throughout the movie, and at one stage, I put it and I both shouted that we'd like to die. There are some really surprising / alarming moments, but these have only been spread by moments that have just bothered me from hell. It's one of the most horrific movies that spawn a little bit and tricks you, but eventually you get frustrated and a little confused about what movie makers are trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> Please save the film for this one is a bad guy, but when Badie is more favorite than the original character, you know that you are a loser.
