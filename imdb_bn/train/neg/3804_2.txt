This is a poor film by any quality. The match point story was a specific conspiracy and the direction and writing a specific charm (Woody Allen mixed his culture with classic English murder and discover what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, but this is nothing. Writing it badly, the two lead to heartlessly and have no interest in the story itself. It requires some maidens with the exceptionally diverse explanations and tie-ups (why the torch cards and keys are kept under the French horns in locked rooms?) That makes it appear for deceit. <br /> <br /> Allen's delightful and wonderful version of Hollywood style (Jade Scorpion Curse / Cairo Purple Rose etc) has given us so much joy for many years. Even the end of Hollywood was a great central concept. Sadly, his inspiration has been eradicated by him this time.
