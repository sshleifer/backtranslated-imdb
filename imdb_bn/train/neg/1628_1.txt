Without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems to really be something important to do. The sad fact is that it is completely stupid at a stage that can not help in every way but rather laugh. Angmerman Bergman's films have reached frustration for the small elements, following a city couple's day in the desert ... they walk along the path of a galaxy, which is always in the U.C. Berkeley Coffee Vault. Almost every line distributed here is extremely weak. ("I think life is made in very small parts like this cinnamon .... but is it beautiful?") Which is not happening at all (okay ... okay ... some of our nudity and a cruel soft sex scene ), There is a very intense anti-war clash involving a pair that creates scenes of nature and several tough people perform golf. With an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> There are no events or interesting things in this movie. I think Larry Buchanan's picture "Strawberry Nike Rane" is a weak example of a Bergman respect. "Golden Apple" is every bit as bad, but presenting it uninterrupted random verbiage makes it memorably awful. 1/10
