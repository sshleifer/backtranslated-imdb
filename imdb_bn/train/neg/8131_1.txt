Unless the title appears to be a mockery for the transformation of a wife (firearm, it destroys it for us). If Encheck, if this movie is not a media-for-TV, it should have been, it's unusually low budget, subdued, underacted, and disks hit every 70's clits. Someone is preferred, and you may be unaware of what this one might happen to anyone. False forgotten without bad, bad performance.
