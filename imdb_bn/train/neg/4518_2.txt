Some of the movies have hoped to deceive me and made me feel like a fire. The movie is ugly trash. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing managed by it is a ban in India. If this was due to the poor quality of the film making than the recent debate, the ban could have been more effective. <br /> <br /> Now my problem has been found in my system, I am able to analyze more movies: <br /> <br /> * The movie feels unnecessary since the beginning, especially when the dramas started the conversation in English. The director, of course, did not make movies for an Indian audience; But it can ease its international audience. It is not really true to look at the character of domestic help in perfect English conversation. <br /> <br /> * Then we get a regular glimpse of Radha's dream. This scene is not very effective. They are coming as jarring and prevents the flow of the movie. I am still fascinated how attached to the story of philosophical conversations. <br /> <br /> * Love scenes feel visibility and are probably meant for the title of the audience rather than the powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve both. <br /> <br /> * Women, Radha and Sita, names for women are named for the names of Hindu deities and hence the audience has been selected for frustration. However, since this film was not the first place for Indian audiences, so the name of the Shank-Nama-election is not intended to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the side is very poor and some key and fine scenes are poorly managed. A good director can create a strong mental drama beyond the subject. <br /> <br /> * Acting Difficulty While Nandita Das took some roles, others were lost. I always thought that Shabana Azmi is a good actress but her talent is not clear in this film. Male Leads were completely garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the world and want to see more of the director, stay away from it. Please
