If you have seen the hazard duck, you know that you never have to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behaviors by kids. If you have seen the movie you know that there is no more! This movie was deer! The main character medicines and it's fun and cool to be thought of certainly do not call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned on the trash. A little lethargic diary is now seen in the original show and works that he is paying for his services at the corner of the street. I was very excited to watch this movie before coming out, I was ready to leave for 15 minutes in the movie. I thought it was better to get it but instead got worse by the minute. I have not seen this movie. It trashed a good show and left me nothing except terrible taste when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, because it is not only wasteful money, but you lose 2 hours of your life, you will never come back!
