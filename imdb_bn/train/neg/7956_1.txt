This movie should be 100 number below. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I saw it, we were almost physically ill. And the story is bad. I could have taken away how bad I was, but what I really wanted to do was add an alert to Frankb's review because I saw that someone else has gone for this problem. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else at this moment. Thanks, we watched on TV so we did not spend anything in it. If we were to be, then the people responsible for this hatred would have been forced to write and they were forced to execute the death penalty under their general instructions. In conclusion, I want to say that I've always enjoyed seeing the laws of Kerry Fisher. But I am sorry to say that I am not eligible to see this special film. Do not waste your opinion by watching it.
