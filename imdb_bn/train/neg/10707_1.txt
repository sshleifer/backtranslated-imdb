Where do you start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Editing was the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was furious. As with the background, most of the movie can have a miserable impact here. Was my volume running only to make it a whole explosion ... and just listen? Probably one of the worst scripts ever created. I can not believe people actually make some green for this photo. It reminds me that I take a shit in a box, the producer can send it, and then finance a movie for me. <br /> <br /> The dolph was a normal, dolph. There is no need to say anything else. Villain was bad, the plays were bad, and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what to do while writing, directing or editing a movie, check it out!
