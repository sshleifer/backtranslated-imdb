The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialogue was terrible. However, the story was not so bad (actually, the lines of all the stories are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I dosed off several times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert, but not a good actor at Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not very good either. And Zhang Zia, what can I say, some lines, terrible acting (but it's based on his script). All the letters that were not good at all. However, some of my things in Rush Hour 2 are always verb and low sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan does not do anything for her.
