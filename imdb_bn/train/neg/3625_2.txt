This is a film that is firmly 50's. The American Film Institute is a very favorite of it for the best 100 American films of all time. I've seen all the movies on that list, and it's one of the most frustrating. Musical numbers (and many of them) are too long and annoying, and there is no connection to the story. The end of the movie is a long-term ballet sign, which is naturally not true with the film's story. It must be acknowledged that it has been made very well, music is fine, and danced with the highest professional quality - there is no reason to include the order in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film behaves very captivating and unlike and unclear. His mental age is about 14 If you want to see a good musical instrument created in "Golden Age" of musical instruments, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
