If you want to see a movie about two completely disrespectful characters, this is just one. Acting is remarkable, like both crazy paranodes of John Casavettes, who are saying, they are really coming out, and Peter Fok has saved his best friend in his lifetime, whom he saved for salvation. Big mistakes, but they are difficult to define root for less, due to both amoral mobsters, and boots to misogynistic bastards. Only author / director Yale May may be gotten away with this one. I was included in the DVD in a long interview with producer Michael Hausmann, he revealed that the "very different ideas" about these two-stage scripts, which the director was almost impossible to work with, was the director of photography, his impossible claim, that the crew continued to sit beside the road continuously Was angry, etc. A large, very functional family this mood comes across clearly on the screen.
