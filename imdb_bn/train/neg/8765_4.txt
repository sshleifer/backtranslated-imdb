I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. The quick summary of this movie must be avoided. J. P. Dutt has written, directed, produced and edited this movie and did not do it well. <br /> <br /> This picture tells the story of Pakistan trying to take Pakistan's controversial territory from Pakistan to Pakistan in 1999. . It is believed that you received a hint from this movie that the Indian army captured the highlands during the recovery from the Pakistani soldiers. But what was a compulsory and heroic story that did not say, this movie makes the Indian army ridiculous and fool, which I do not know is not true. <br /> <br /> I was almost entirely an Indian audience, who was very patriot and wanted to definitely like this movie, but they made themselves laughable in a non-funny scene. <br /> <br /> This script was absolutely unreal. Mr. Dutt has no idea about how the army manages and uses bad war movies for reference. As a result, a script that is brainless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> Most of the principals' acting was not miraculous, but considering the script, it becomes difficult for me to criticize them too much. For the supporter cast, I can say that I hope they are invited. <br /> <br /> The edit was also quite bad. It was difficult to follow what was going on for a long time, and the music would end up with visual changes. Good thing: Cinematography was good, though the film did not seem to be correct in color, though the color balance is often diverse in scenes. Also, some of the songs in the film were quite enjoyable - for at least half a dozen or more verses for the first half. Unfortunately they were a lot taller than them. <br /> <br /> And worst crime to everyone? This mess is four hours long. It is enough that a good editor could shrink around 1.5 - 2 hours of the film from almost shots. Sadly, a good editor is not working in this movie.
