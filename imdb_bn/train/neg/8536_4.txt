This is a common steel novel produced in two people, which can be combined with any type of tragedy. I do not have to call it a spoiler because those who know how to read the novel steel can know how they all end. If you do not want to know a lot about this plot, do not read it. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character Ophilia French is a woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop filming where he should have an accent, because he might not otherwise be able to stop a good actress, actually the kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also a wonderful actor, Matt, who is recovering from a rather ugly divorce. He is gentle, believable and compulsory in this role. <br /> <br /> Two daughters meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip and firstly, Ophilia accuses Matt of the child for Malest's accusation because he spoke of art with kids. After this episode, all of them became friends and then fell in love with the couple. <br /> <br /> The merit of these two people is not my opinion, although chemistry is not great in two leads. The question They could do a good with a script which borders a predetermined plot and stroretical. Seeing two people, tragedy, big tragedy, a secret manifestation, another tragedy, and then they got together. I wanted more than I wanted, but there it is very short. <br /> <br /> I like stupid entertainment, and I did it. In the case of romantic films, it fails to be a memorable one. With "Junk" Turner, "That Secret Affair" is much more impressive (not a style book), as has become some of the earlier films of Steel.
