David Lynch's candid and crisp drawings in South Park represent a nightmare of annoying clashes about our middle-class family. The father is a terrific monster, which is called the most horrible Guttural sound, which is the father of three teeth and an incomplete large round face, which is a way of life of terrorism for sons and mothers permanently horrible creatures. Equally unreasonable characters are presented throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedy (ie, air, flood-like directions), and I usually do not generally like for jokes. However, there were few scenes in Dumbbell that made me laugh loudly. There are some cute bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch expresses a wide range of responses to his characters through a syntactic format of the faces of opposing faces. (Which sometimes does not change in Dufflands). <br /> <br /> I believe Lints really tried forward to straight forward his audience, if annoying, animated comedy is here. Interestingly, he chose to follow the footsteps of the most recent wave of cruel humor (such as the Most Willed Fellel), when he added elements of social criticism of chaos and classic cartoon violence and overall humor. Although the blend really does not work very well here, but it is nothing if there is no lynchian. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
