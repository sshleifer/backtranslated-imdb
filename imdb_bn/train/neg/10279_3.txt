This movie was so horrible that it was almost good ... almost We love the musical, but this is not the one. Even terrible sound quality, poor cinematography and many actors who can not sing or dance, even Anthony Rap is actually managed to give a good performance (especially towards the end). Character Manger, a drunk lady, was very enjoyable to see. <br /> <br /> The plot was very unexpected and fun without singing and singing the chizzi piano. Curiously, some songs (fantastic) are quite interesting (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> <br /> We can be a good stage musical (with excellent actor).
