Julia (Christina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and her son Alex and spent a few days with her family in the family of Suez Island. Couple hopes to solve their problem along the weekends on remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven met two strange men of the shelter and when his brother Peter (Brendan Bissar) came, he explained that a family of mountain cats on the island lived on the island. The lazy Peter smoke shows off the pot and closed headlights while running the truck at night; However, he accidentally runs on Savage's younger son, but in the dark he believes that he has hit an animal. Later, Alex claimed the compensation for the lost boy for the Savage family. The young family does not accept trade, and they start a fierce battle in the family. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie, a stupid screenplay, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly well-played. False stories are completely stupid, and there are many incredible situations. For example, in the street, could two women in the street take the risk of two women to the hated family of two women? The logical system is going immediately to the continent and police forces will be brought to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven left their homes on the continent and their homes and friends, and no one left them behind? When Peter came to the boat at the beginning, he called his sister Julius Alex. There are so many errors in this flashlight that I could write many lines about this topic. I believe this image is portrayed with a video video camera that shows images horror. Good cast work deserve a good material. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ela de Santu" ("Island of Blood")
