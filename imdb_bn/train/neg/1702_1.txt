Let's be honest here: The only reason for someone to buy it, the only reason for someone to review it, and because of the fact that David Lynch created it, is the only reason anyone can enjoy it and you want to have children of David Lynch. But guess what? Even David Lynch could create a piece of dumbness. Perhaps Lynch wanted to overcome the generality and wanted to feel ignorance as a pure subject-intellect. Perhaps, the rogue, the Cacophonist sound and the chicken-scratch visuals are supposed to mean something about the world's humanity, our relationship with the reality, its stupidity. Instead, it just tells me one thing: I only lose 20 dollars. <br /> <br /> If I was offensive due to objectionable, then I could raise Hansen and poured my ear blood. If I wanted to be absurd for the foolish, I could simply take a dump on a plate and can see that for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> Dumbbell has a single redeeming quality - it's meta, meta fun. In other words, it is so bad that it is not even funny because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbbell. If not, carry yourself pain.
