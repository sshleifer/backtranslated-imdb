It's always like other Dracula movies, in the middle of Dracula's Dracula, which ultimately disappointed me. Since the person does not want to be a vampire or not, I want to see something like the first movie that microcredit fights against his master. This is very interesting (because you can predict the story) only the priest or de. Even worse (we need some wonderful plots!).
