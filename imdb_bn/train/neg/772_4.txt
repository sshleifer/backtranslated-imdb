This film is just as good as all those movies that I have never seen. And I am very surprised that in this story Pilate wants to end Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as other films) describe differently. This is not a very important issue: Resurrection .. No other film avoids this very important part: All of us have faith in this belief. Paul said in one of his letters, "If Christ has not been raised from the dead, our faith is useless". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was used by Jesus on the road to the streets while entering Jerusalem. Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was not a legend. And indeed, he was a JEW. A lot of extraordinary documents (selfish and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary person (or I say, God will become human), which in fact, transforms mankind. I firmly recommend him (he was an historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the brightest Jewish commentator in the first one. Century
