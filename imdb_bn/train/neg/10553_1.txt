I bought this movie for Euro 1, did not know what it was all about. I thought, "Hmmm, a movie named Mutation Manner would be very fun, if not least fun". It was not funny at all. It was boring. Very boring And I do not think of annoying movies, but it just can not explain anything, it is not a good job to abuse children only. Hmmm ... the quality of the pictures was terrible. Acting ... there was no acting. Just a few minutes of cracking yourself up to faked up This is probably the material for closing the Zico of Zero on Extreme Gore. <br /> <br /> Do not see this. It's not worth your time. It's just awful. I never buy it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
