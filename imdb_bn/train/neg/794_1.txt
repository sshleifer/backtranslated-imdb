If you are not familiar with the actors of this movie already, save yourself time and stop reading this review after the next sentence ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carriage of beautiful boys, nonsensical, convoluted "plots" until you are ready to scream, go out for an unreasonable amount of time. <br /> <br /> This film does not understand anything. It is a continuous series of emotion, anger from joy, tragedy from happiness, a good series of reasons to express good reason. We certainly can see incredible "dramatic" happening, but we can not just give a tremor because it has no backstory. <br /> <br /> When this picture ends, you'll be sick and tired of this stupid, lanky, girly big 'face. Laughing at all these times, they will be rebellious, laughing, crying, crying, mysterious appearance, "serious", and seeing any other unpleasant expression facing them. <br /> <br /> Some bodies will sometimes go so far as it will prove to you that without any doubt the shadow of "soul" as "soul" as a "soul" of its "actors" will prove to you that the trailer of this site and Not many uncertain comments will tell you. <br /> <br /> Only "converted," non-trivial small films will love this movie, most of them girls do something strange About pathological worship. Freud will be a field day <br /> <br /> If you are one of these stupid "fans", stay away from this hatred.
