This is one of the worst B slashers in my life. The last is something you see to believe <br /> <br /> While sitting on the stairs on the stairs with the Harry standings and Philippe, their parents are taking chimneys while wearing their clothes in their Santa's case. He keeps a tree under the tree, drinks cookies and milk and then goes up to the chimney. Philip goes to bed, but Harry finds her mother dressed in Santa Suit for sex enjoyment with her father. Then, Harry walks through the stairs, a snow shakes the earth, takes a sari of glass and cuts itself off. <br /> <br /> Then you go towards the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who is sleeping in Santa's case and sees small children through a few telescopes. He has two books. Good for kids, a book and other for bad kids. He wrote what he did in these books. The guy is a creep. She also worked at Jolly Dream Toy Factory. Her brother Philip is a family and two children and a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds that his boss only thinks of profits, he goes away and collects all the toys and gives them a few kids. . Then, he traveled to a church and killed 4 people. Then he goes to another house and keeps the gifts under the tree. The kids hold her but they go back to bed. So, Harry goes to bedroom and kills father and leaves. <br /> <br /> She travels around the house, shows her a bunch of kids and goes to her. Parents are nervous and try to come back to their kids so that they do not hurt. How do they know that Harry the killer? Sure, you have to be suspicious because you can never have it. Harry gives gifts to kids and parents pull out a switch blade to try to kill him in front of children. <br /> <br /> When Harry leaves, the town gives light torches and follows him to kill him. They do not even know that he is slayer. When Harry arrives at his brother's house, he has little talk with his brother and Philip surrounds him. He only lose consciousness. Philip loads Harry back in his van. When Harry wakes up, he goes away. <br /> <br /> The end is something I can not believe. Again, you have to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that faked me was the black Santa. Okay, the guy in Santa Suite saw white people. So why did they bring black people? <br /> <br /> Leave it and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa Slay. You get the value of your money to see two gains. They're better than this shield of garbage! I would like to give 1 out of 10 stars to this image. I hope I can give 0 stars for the film's eligibility.
