Redline is a knockoff, without an incognito attribute quick and furious. It does not need to be a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs something! This is equivalent to a pornographic movie, where the story and the conversation are initially equal in 60 seconds and at the same time. Other than this, because you will not get the value of your money. An awful waste of mind, narrowly annoying, impossible race sequences, and expensive beautiful cars, which almost earned negative points for appearing in this film. Sure, he is hot, but disappointed that for the screen woman? I feel like the manager sat in there with a cap full of conversations and plot snippets, and each scene they shook 8 balls every time they switched. Any serious person or someone who knows about it will see this movie and enjoy the race scene.
