The 30 minute cartoon show in the 15 minute episode of Lil Bush Comedy Center It is a fictional, cartoonized Washington DC, and is centered around George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney's shrewd, pillow presentations. Other politicians also act as satirical, and minor characters in the same way. <br /> <br /> A little Bush pilot about the expectations of this commentator, rather a shallow and confidential production that proves his special promise: an ironic look of the current Presidential administration. Although some may acknowledge that there are certain qualifications in the context of the program, it will also be difficult to imagine that the denial of any political personality of any rally will be fully completed, but the episodes will continue to run after its expiration. Which can only be described as seratum and poorly terribly terrible, has affected the slightest possible likelihood of the show. <br /> <br /> The actual use of the comedy's specific instrument for loading its targets in the unlikely way (but especially the original, entertaining, or funny) way of Lil Bush, which can be classified as a technically "satire" In the continuously weak writing of the show, there are more than Bush / Cheney Jokes recordings which neglect elsewhere and put them in a single 30-minute block. In this way, most of the jokes presented by the writers are shameful clich√©s, which were public circulation some 6 years ago. For example, if compared to Death Bhader with Vice President, it may be interesting to hear the Daily Shaw / Callbert Report / Letterman / Conan O'Brien / Leno Monologue / any late-night talk at the first 300 times. Anyway, but not funny here. As was not enough, Shore plots seem to be present as a way to go beyond the old, tedious Bush jokes that the authors have created the center of the program. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the show, when the authors really dare to write the real joke (which seems to be a boring), it is often a little ridiculous. If the show grows a bit deeper and the same old mistakes by the Bush administration and the new character, "Komagyaiar", keeps its characters in external situations, it will not have to depend on old Bush clerks and again, the show is somewhat tolerant, and potentially even considered innovative may be. <br /> <br /> Finally, Lil Bush is the biggest loss in the series, which is difficult to reduce? The lack of basicity and poor writing quality, or the ambition of its painful narrow mindedness. Lil Bush is expected to be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans, that is, if they were able to tolerate poorly written text; As long as the program Bush administration continued thoroughly in the Lighthouse. Despite this, most of the viewers will soon recognize the program for it, it is a weak and vainly rude attempt to ridicule and will be protected by some more intriguing incentives; The price is correct, perhaps.
