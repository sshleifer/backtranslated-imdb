Kevin Clayne and Meg Ryan are among the actors I'm always looking forward to, though in spite of the reviews. I always found Mrs. Ryan as an impressive and acting actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always valuable. <br /> <br /> I almost say "almost" and "almost" in large part because of this movie <br /> <br /> First stop, Meg Ryan does not play a popular character, he plays a weak-willed vignette The nerve begins to spread after your nerve starts early and does not release up to several. After some days. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less likable. So, if you usually like these two actors, then I suggest you pass this movie.
