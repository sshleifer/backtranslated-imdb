This book is so good that at least this TV movie will remove you, but then the book will spread more, all religions, love and math and cotton candy will bring cliques, it is annoying. However, I have heard from the comments, those who do not read the book like it and if it increases the child's reading of a skeleton even in time, it will serve its purpose. The most shameful change is to create a clone of Mary Pappins Uncle Albert of Happy Media (I love to laugh). There is nothing smile that the screen characters are completely smiling at something completely irrational, which is more intense.
