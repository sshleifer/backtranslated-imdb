Disney Cartoon's Golden Era was dying by the end of the 90's. This show should not be considered as a pack of Coke Pack Duck Hotels Spin Off because the show was to do with Dock Tales only. It's a teenager about Hugh, Davey, and Louie, because they create problems for their uncle Donald and are talking about hip-hop languages ​​and they're completely dressed like postalisation. I like a little brave nephew from DuckTales. There are people in Docberg and ducks are the only animals living in Doburg. Scrooge McDuck has no references. The story is repetitive, the plot is annoying but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend you this. If you want to watch a good Disney Show "Darkwing Doc" or "Duckles"
