After life was an extraordinary, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films have been created by the same person as Dow U Smile Dolly Bell, for example. Javette is two hours stupid antics with no stories. Underground wild and stupid humor seems to degenerated here in the mischief buffoonery. It seems that Castro is slowly wandering, since she started making living comedians, starting with the Black Cat, the White Cat which I think was bigger than that, but there were already a few vicious flames. I love his very first movies, and for this reason it is particularly frustrating to see something like that. Let's hope the next one will be great.
