This movie was working with good intentions and a good story. Unfortunately, the film's director and screenwriter failed miserably and created an absolute, annoying filmstrip that I felt that I returned to Harper's 8th grade social studies class and returned to the 67th. <br /> <br /> Waste, someone will accept this story and create a real movie outside of it - the story claims. <br /> <br /> Every time a scene was possible, all we had given was black, and perhaps to show the scene, they might have seen white footage from the history channel. Shameful <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Osse Davies is the only bright light of this dull festival. Other performances were incredibly lazy - it fits well with the movie and anyone who plays Captain sets a new low quality for line delivery. However, if you are willing to accept these numerous flaws and are not concerned with awed or entertaining, but want to know about the USS m Ason, it is a clock price.
