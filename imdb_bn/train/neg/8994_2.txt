This film is a major example of isolating a great resource in a movie. John Cam Candy, Chevy Chase, Lauren Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davies and Joe Flawworthy have received your SNL and SCTV Star in the future, which certainly create 70 minutes of chaos, strangers and racist jokes. A network idea from a future split society can actually lead to some interesting extremism, but instead puts the gate outside, making a hairy, playful projection fun and having complete humorous veins. Look at a much more devastating and wicked Groove Tube or later, the humorous Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see the capsule during the Bad 70's sketch comedy film.
