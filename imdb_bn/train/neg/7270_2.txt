Due to this interesting and semi-sexy love scenes I gave this "loooooooooooooong" film "2". Otherwise, if you do not read like a speed reader, you will not get subtitles trying to continue Spanish Speed ​​Conversation! And, if you can not read the subtitles what's going on in the plot. Endless stares and holes-eye and constant refusal. Boring after an hour or so. Some good cinematography but some of you think DARK has burned your screen. I did not understand how this won anything. Talking about "acting" is difficult because lead actors fall in love with each other and show love to each other if the lead actors do not push each other. The Geraldo character is so interesting that it is hard to believe that someone will push him. And what's with her mother? I did not get it only for most of the time, there were only three people, each of them seems to have a history with each other ....
