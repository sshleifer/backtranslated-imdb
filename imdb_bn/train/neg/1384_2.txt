Jet Li is one of the best war fighters in the world. He has been for more than 20 years and he keeps others as shameful. Although he grew up in Asia, he is almost unknown in the United States. <br /> <br /> The black mask was supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but it failed terribly. Firstly, it is dubbed. Camps may have value (dubbing is not even intimate and it is spontaneous), it seems inappropriate for the general movie viewer. Second, the director of this movie, Daniel Lee did a terrible job. He's spending the scenes so fast, sometimes, you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans of superb martial arts see Jat Lee's movie. However, the director has edited these scenes so fast that you do not even know who half the time! Other times, a scene hangs (ie, Lee begins to hang a hole in the zip floor, when two seconds later the bogies arm their guns, Lee and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely, they are absolutely ridiculous CD Romas? Just give him a strike !!!! Lee, who needs a director who has low tendency of machine gun gun and cinematic MySa- More to create customs. Jop Rap / Techno Music remains intrusive, the possibility of this plot is likely, but all the cartoons are separated by the characters, which take away this film from any credibility and we truly believe that love interest identifies Simon. Can not, because its half the mask? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/10 is a complete waste of time ..... mess ntikara
