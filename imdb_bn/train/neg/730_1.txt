I did not see the first movie and there is no great desire like this. <br /> <br /> I've been struggling to remember something about it just a few hours ago. <br /> <br /> I think that its main plot is a group of very annoying people, on Friday 13th September, that man lives in a house with an old woman and drowns in a wooden rib. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the film ends, I am starting a legal case against the person who sold me this film because I want compensation for the missing time of my life. <br /> <br /> I have to give you 1 pound to take this picture from me ... oh wait I already gave it to a "friend".
