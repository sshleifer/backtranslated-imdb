These are the things I can say a little more than most people, I hate noise and in big cities who have no idea how to sleep in New York, especially! It makes me amazed that people may have all the noise in these days. The fundamental plot of the film makes it an interesting topic. It's so bad that it's about. Tim Robbins does not seem to be fully present there except for a pretty good scene (but especially in the case of the supermodel Margarita Liviva). My biggest hope for this movie is that casting agents will look at absolutely stunning and talented actresses to boot, Margarita Leviva He does not have much to do, but he is beautiful in Supermodel. Even when they are trying to look for more girl next to her. It makes me sad that people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian can not get more fame than this talented beauty. The script is not very good because I did not take much care of this movie, but glad I found some new talent. I hope the producers and directors think about Margarette when they need a big movie big budget movie. If they can make Megan Fox from a star (they are not hot and they are worse than making "talent" - for Disney Channel TV shows) but it should be easy for them to be superb & talent! I would recommend to change her last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more mercantile. It is hoped that this creates his career, and if there is a trial, he can pop up some big summer films or two over the next few years.
