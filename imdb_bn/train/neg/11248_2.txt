This gave a "2" instead of a "1" (terrible), because it was not denied that many scenes were stunning, many talented special effects and went to artwork. But it was not enough to save. <br /> <br /> "Scorpio" tone, Smoke coloring has been done many times in other movies. There is nothing new there. I can see some hat tips from other old, classic movies. OK. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was horrible, two dimensional characters. Slow movement Some of the scenes were nice to watch, but in the end, it was completely annoying, I could not recommend it.
