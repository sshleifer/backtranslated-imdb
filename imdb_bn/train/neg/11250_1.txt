I like the duration, I like this endeavor, but watching a movie that looks like it gives me a headache with a coke bottle. If I play computer games that are unclear and out of focus, I'll upgrade my computer. This can be the scene even after being a director, but it does not hurt the eye and you want to move after 10 minutes. If I did not take someone in this picture with me, I was there. Although it was a series and did not say every movie, the band of the Brothers done it. They look like it's WWII footage, with only one piece of grain, but it was still the joy of watching. Movies need real people, real sets, and real locations; Use CGI when it is appropriate, not for a complete film.
