I went to see this movie in our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Darn in Silent Running and Family Plant. This day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the worst movie I've seen. It went right and then with no discernible point - it ended. The lights came up and I watched everyone see confusion around. The projection was to miss a relie? I did not want to find out. I remember about the film that it is a drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the film was after the completely unknown audience. Fortunately, there was an exception for this Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.
