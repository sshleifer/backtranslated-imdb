This is another North East Florida production, which is predominantly near and near by the Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantations. As far as possible to achieve Street View, I was able to keep the main road of Fernandina Beach. The film is beautiful, and quite bad. Tami Irin is beautiful, but overacts. Aileen Brevin further said. Good for small kids, or those who like fluff in big dosages. From a 4 miller-cinematic source.
