It's been a long time since I finally saw this movie. Acting is very mean, the story is very annoying, and I face losses of executable words. It was completely irrational. O, and this kind of comedy like Clint Eastwood's pregnant showerhouse! <br /> <br /> In the first scene (where is the one with the television show - where are you?) It was right - the cast faced 80% - the forgotten actor. If they are expected for a career relaunch, I think it can never happen to them in their CVs! The script was possible, but 80% of the actors dragged it to the director or director (who should be an actor and definitely an actor). Fred DÃ¶rst was the only one who felt better than anyone else. I'm sorry, but if you think this - I highly recommend that you go back to some frustration because it is only a total loss of time, but a poor example of how bad movies look.
