"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and was rather well-documented in his rather rather nasty life. This film, which appears to portray his life, should be used in a fictional character, because exaggerated events are very strong and exit from Croatia. Not only this, it ignores some interesting details, which include other versions such as NY And public relations related to its religious conversion. It is true that he is executed by Luciano, Lansky, etc. All. But as far as it goes. Explosion plate scene representing Luciano to run Bose Weinberg on his home, with the help of his own mother, it is lazy. Also, there is a scene where Dutch leg diamonds reach Dutch for their protection. It just does not work. Mrs. Fleggenheimer is not working on the character. This film does not require diverse Jewish soil for Comic Relief. Leg Diamond Hairstyle Presentation was a lot of fun. I'm sure that people are turning their tomb. And, however, Dutch actually kills people, but, he is not Rambo or 007. The scene where he removes the pebble is unreasonable. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I did not get it.
