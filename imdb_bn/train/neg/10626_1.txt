This documentary is based on the sponge cake, as soon as you have any authentic evidence of it, honesty gradually penetrates into a large rib. For example, Bart Sibrel claims that they must have multiple illumination form because these shades are crossing, the case will not have two or more shades for each object, when Apollo 11 van allan was passing radiation belt, within 30 minutes it did not claim the documentary 90 minutes And they had a dose of radiation that was more equal than X-ray. <br /> <br /> Learn with little research seriously that what actually happened does not allow this document to be inserted into a documentary that actually made the opinion of what happened.
