This movie gets 6/10 ratings from me, as well as a 9/10 both. Here's why: The movie will carry you as the ideal horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and fears are taken into consideration. It's basically a family drama that you want to see in the Lifetime Channel, but keep it in a horror universe. Story and formula-ages-old, retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the plot structure or at least the conflict, you'll be disappointed. Take away the zombies and if you have something as melodramatic as a beautiful mind of cheese, tripping over the cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic summary and concept is quite original and the top most. It literally means that you and your friends will joke about when you are half-drunk. . . But that joke is actually a theater released. The idea got 9/10 from me. The only reason it is not perfect is that they can take it even more, but they did it. <br /> <br /> Both mixtures are mixed. I was funny at it, but with most comedies mostly, it was not funny. I was with my mother and the younger sister saw it with me and we were more fun than jokes with jokes scripted it. There was some fascinating moments, but there were also pure bitter moments. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope other movies will accept such a high risk and original ideas. I just can not say that it is perfect, or even near it, due to lack of basicity of the plot <br /> <br /> <br /> A big family movie. A great movie for watching with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with someone. . . But if you watch it alone, it will be a bit annoying. Other people always make these kind of movies funnier and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
