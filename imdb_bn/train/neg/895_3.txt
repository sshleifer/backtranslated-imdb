But "Cinderella" gets my vote, not only for the worst of Disney's Princess movie, but for Walt's longtime company's worst movie. Music is truly beautiful, and the story is called "classic." What failed in this movie is the character, especially the title character, which can only be called "heroine" in the shortest sense of the word. <br /> <br /> After a short suggestion the audience is presented to Cinderella. He is waking up in the morning and singing "A dream wants your heart." This establishes him as an idealist (and thus worthy of our sympathy). Unfortunately, this script does not give us any sources what he's dreaming about. Freedom from his servant role? Respect her step family? Anyone to talk without the mouse and the birds? One song (presented in the special feature section of the latest DVD) but it is related to his will that many of his might be so that he can work more efficiently. You go girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very soft character. She gradually took the abuse of her husband's family, escaping her vague dreams for relief. He only reminds his own parents that he is still a family member. For this, if he finishes his work and he worn something, he was allowed to go to the ball, of course, the tendency gesture which is clearly stupid to everyone except Cinderell. Does anyone see Bella or Jasmine in such a scenario? If Cinderella is dull, her male opponent is not something to languish. Cinderella Prince receives no dialogue and almost screen time. If he respected Cinderella or respected something, he did not give any direction. We all know 1) He is a princess and 2) He dances well. Heck, even from the "Snow White", the prince got at least one romantic song. The lack of this development only makes romance less attractive, it lets Cinderella look like a social obscure or stupid, that makes her already poorly appealing appeal. Perhaps <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Animate Approved, these characters are amusing Even when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, all right, say that there are some problems in your story. <br /> <br /> Deans loves to announce all its animated features as "superiority". Many of them are some who are not eligible for this vice-chancellor. Cinderella is a prime example of this fact.
