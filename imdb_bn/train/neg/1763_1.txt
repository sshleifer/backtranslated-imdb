This is one of the worst movies ever made. Commonplace Predictable Flat. <br /> <br /> One point that was one point rate was highlighted in Bar√ßa. I imagine they would use this kind of movie for guarding suspects in Guantanamo or other hidden CIA / NSA jails. <br /> <br /> Often bad films have some release features, there is nothing in it. If I had lived in it or had been working in it then I would change my name. Really a turd It's hard to write more than that, but I think the world observers need such a head. On the other hand, it will create a great gift for people who can not stand you. <br /> <br /> The politicians you hate, the law, the former wife, the teachers hate, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and another host.
