Those who are familiar with the previous two dense films are mostly aware of what they can expect: a small group of people stuck in a trap of the trapped room, paranoia, a bunch of bad acting ... though it is quite different. Nearly half of the film takes place outside, where we can see the people seeing the cube (or at least five) inside the cube. <br /> <br /> I think Cub Zero wants to explain what the cube is to deal with, but you do not know much more than what was covered in the first two movies. Of course, there is an explanation, but it feels quite taller than the one proposed in the first film. <br /> <br /> often shows cheaper (such as its predecessor), and it actually only shows more than a couple of empty rooms emphasizes this feeling only. I am sure that no actor is at risk of winning any prize in the future. They have brought snares from Cube 1, though (by this I mean that they are almost the same, which is shameful). <br /> <br /> I know that like many people, praise this film and its first relationship, but I think it was a totally unnecessary contribution to such a franchise that was not as good at starting.
