I caught this college in a small screen held by members of my college gaming club. We knew earlier that it was more than gaming "Referred madness" and the film was more distributed. <br /> <br /> Tom Hans is playing Robbie, after a young man "rests" for him, he resumed his college career. Semester What we see as the film progress is that viewers are apprehensive of playing a role-playing game called "Majes and Monsters", which once again became known after the promotion of a gaming group. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot, ridiculous at many levels. One view group features "Gaming by Taper", which is probably the best way I can describe it. Although I'm sure it meant to be a bit "culturally", because most gamers know it, it's terribly wrong. Most role-playing sessions are performed in well-equipped rooms, usually some Che and a soda cans. <br /> <br /> Acting, not Oscar-worthy, is not either. This was Tom Hans's first role, and Bose's age and Bachelor's party were more than a year or two in the horizon. Supporting Cast, though not very memorable, still manages pretty performance. <br /> <br /> This bad fact is actually a TV-making movie that it shows "the dangers of gaming". See if you and your friends are planning bad movies night.
