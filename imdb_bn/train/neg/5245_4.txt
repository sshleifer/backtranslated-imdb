I'm a current ASL The student was forced to watch the movie in the class, and what I got from it is a great bias involved in the film. The picture is probably Pov. "The common deaf perception" is not their middle ground. Also, the film has not been mentioned or considered in other notable locations under the debate on this issue. Meaning deaf people who were born to hear and later went deaf. Is that an example of right or wrong? Featuring film and virtually deaf w / all in a capital "D" opinion. It is not bad, but it should try to be a little neutral to be a real documentary film.
