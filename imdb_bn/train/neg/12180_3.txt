This picture is awful, but it can sometimes be ridiculous, although this humor is completely unknown. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous. I will not believe the 2-year-old man with a wicked idol worship trying to unite with filmmakers. However, from a positive side, some terribly intriguing plot twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Haggutm has a demonic missile hidden in her back hole!" It gets bad (and even fun), but I'll leave you. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually ridiculous. The role of kids is mostly clever, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is almost all-terrible near. Adults do not take their role seriously, but it is basically a good thing. If they tried to be credible, then the film would get worse. Which is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you have crossed the overall ambiguity of the movie, there are actually some standout moments of incomplete. The scene of Lady Hugbottom's boy escaped with a maid is astonishingly sunny, although it is boring when caught by police, it is annoying. Butler's character is very small, a ray of sunlight that is almost but never depressed by sadness. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is actually my physical pain. Nevertheless, there was some part of the release that did not start internal hemorrhoids, but it almost monitored. Judging her good part alone, the movie will be about 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is rarely claimed. 1. So, I can give it a 3. <br /> <br /> It's quite generous, I'll say.
