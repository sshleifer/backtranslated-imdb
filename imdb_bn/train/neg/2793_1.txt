So far I have watched as far as I've seen on Starz's Demand, where the worst movies are on top of the list. They can straighten the DVD cuff-feasts directly and keep it here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Obviously anyone with a digital camera and shoe budget can bring horror movies and get it on TV. To be honest, seeing this trailer I looked terrible - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to open minded for low budget movies. The best movies I've seen are that they need to be bigger than the low budget, in the case of films that work around low budget or in other areas. <br /> <br /> This is not one of these movies. <Br /> <br /> If you now know the plot, I'm sure, if you read it. You've heard about it on the Starge Demand, or you have been associated with this reason for a reason on this page. This is an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video for 3 minutes, we know about a sad and small girl. Anyone should keep it together, should think it looked really interesting, but it's really, really not. However, he killed himself. Then he possesses somebody. Then some murders started. It is really dishonest and completely as average and annoying as possible. It sounds like a piece popping popcorn quite seriously when the first gun closes in her apartment. Could they come with the effect of that good sound? I can find a good sound effect for free on internet (with no copyright) ... right. Now <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not give another review! They are obviously film-makers or even directors trying to think of you as precious to buy this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous.
