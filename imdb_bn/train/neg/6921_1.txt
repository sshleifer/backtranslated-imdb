I went to a prisranking of this photo and how it was screaming It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, tried to comment on many things like Pedophilia, Satan worship, secret police, subject, religion ... and it was a mess. Excellent washboard was played; The child and Jesus were right, but different from them .... anyway I appreciate the efforts of trying to differentiate the Christian people (although a little failed) ... even though they did, the way to present the gospel was a little stock and Kuddi. But then he might be after talking to a childhood ... or not. In fact, I decided it's just about all right. Music ... Oh my lord ... awesome ... dramatic over too much. OK. I felt bad for people who made this movie premiere; It looked like a poor student project. I want to stop ranting about this now and see the movie below, if you see this movie, you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes in your hour of punk. Take this.
