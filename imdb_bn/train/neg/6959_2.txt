I went to see it a few days ago, and for the wrong reasons it is very difficult to forget this movie! This movie is considered fun, or not in the theater (probably for Jose Garcia and Gerard Depardieu), not a single laugh, it's annoying, annoying, annoying. Sometimes they were difficult to understand what they were saying. They just talk quickly and understand that we do not open them enough. I was with a friend and for more than 4 or 5 times I said myself a line later, "what he said," and I'm French. I'm not saying that I think that good movies have been made here, but I would apologize for all the foreigners who will see the film (if ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are deeply sorry for the CR @ P. 2/10
