I agree with the latest commentator that it can be the worst movie ever. I had to go ahead with the majority of the film. Michael Madison must have done this as a benefit to anyone. Photo quality of all types of grains. And what little plot there is here is simply stupid. I can give this movie 1 out of 10 if I can give it. I want lower scores. Do not waste your time in this movie or you will regret it.
