Even Timothy Hutton or David Dvoovio could not save the dead fish of this film. For starters, the script was written to be made in B-Film, but in any case Ducchini (looking for a star car to show himself outside the television) and Houghton ("Two Purses" of "Two" he was "General People" after his career I wanted to define it). Chess lines, from scene to scene, use bad wipes (let's - wipes after the 12th grade telecommunications class?), And plain old acting bad sink. Even Duchovny is not the defense of this film that plays the plague. Only Timothy Hutchon raised above all the ingredients. As I read over the voice line, I must admit the feeling of Duchovny's pain. When the director wanted to feel overwhelmed, I saw myself smiling, I did not prepare anything for the last line of Dvojevo's voice-over: "Call 911 if you need your doctor." If there was 911 in the studio only, no motion picture dog would have been created. To avoid all costs. <br /> <br />
