I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this movie, and some reviews are going to be positive. I saw the movie and was quite dissapointed. I found it very enjoyable. It was slow, and lack of entertainment value. Even murder scenes are unbelievable, the real shotgun's real shot-up shot that does not look good at all. And the supposed great turn of the conjecture is not really much, I see it coming, and then the end looked just cliche. This movie may not be so significant, but it is too much by getting that little bit. I would not recommend this movie.
