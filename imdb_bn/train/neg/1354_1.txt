I saw her film Anne Arber Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know one or two things about the film. And Crispin Glover's film is disrespectful. He basically exploits emotionally challenging The Shirley Temple is not only an anti-Christian (which I accept as a little funny), mentally challenging to kill each other, but there is a panic as to the firing. ChrisPin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors, all of whom are mentally challenged. Winning and human rights will be all of these things. It is not 'counter culture' as it exploits it at the Crispin Ann Arbaar Film Festival.
