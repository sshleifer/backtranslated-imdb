Comparing this squalor with the old, low-budget flickr, the old, low-budget porno flick will be an insult. There is no meaning for animal sight and they do not even represent this person and his crime in the broad sense of victory. Shortly behind the DVD case, "The revenge of BT killers' terrorism reign?" It is not a retelling. What does a retailing tell you or how or why it is said to be true. None of these things are true. I saw an exciting studio of serial killers and some pretty crappy movies about them and honesty, this is not one of them. It's not even about BT killers. Save yourself some time and a few bucks and instead hire Dahmer. Serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you want to watch this movie for yourself, check it for free in your local library and you'll still feel cheated.
