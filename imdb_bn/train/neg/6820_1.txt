This stupid, impossible story is freed only by opening scenes where a tough high-level police detective reveals our greatest fear and distributes the audible line: She dies. Perhaps this movie was preserved, the director, this deadly star actor pardoned Martinez's spectacular star power, who was able to fill the screen for a brief moment. A dishwatcher film, which is not available in the name of a hack-tor outside the street, is less likely to be killed than a stone throwing stone for a vague diver and murder than a murderer. His moment is short; His promises are infinite. If there is a consistent continuation of this ill-considered film, then perhaps this unclear Thespian will be treated in more screen time.
