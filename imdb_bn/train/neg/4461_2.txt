After a fairly tall partially piculated nude shower scene, we are out of the romance for this "Blair Witch Project" - For a girls about three girlfriends, they are suffering from a lonely cabin to stay away from their violent life 'week out and smoke pots. They consider the two friends as friendly enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, as long as the film is taken away for some time. <br /> <br /> It can not barely carry 'mysterious' scenes, bad acting scenes where nothing will happen but a foolless consonance, and the film is completely a punk, it's a death-boring yolk. Nothing happened for the last half an hour and when I was really taking care, I silenced it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Tootin looks at TA; Evi Lutzky briefly gets helpless; And Jennifer Heart shows her right spoon <br /> <br /> My grade: D.
