I am a warm B-rate horror movie and I saw my fair share of slash pictures, so I have a significant gauge to judge this film. It is easily located on the top coast of the worst horror films of the 1980s. This gothic is not as scary as the night, it is not as glorious as the re-animator and there is nothing lacking in the camp cost. That said, this film has no value. Remember, movie artwork is a completely different movie. The shots are still not taken from the movie behind the DVD box. <br /> <br /> Villains: $$$ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen it before, killing a murderer. The students and temporary facilitator members suddenly use all the tedious procedures of the threats of murder that have spread. <br /> <br /> Story: someone <br /> <br /> Story $ $ (focusing on the story) Francis Forbes - who after making this film, wisely changed his name to Forbes relay - Zin People started to get jobs in the university, people started to die, and Forbes believes that the killer is targeting him. "Libido-mad student", it is impossible to be honest, because the script does not make any character outside of Forbes meat. ACTING: $ (Horror of all levels. Experiencing the school's school production- High school, which college students can make such a good flick. Forbes Semina As a reflection of the talent show. As one of the students, but everyone else plays "additional" qualification).
