I have seen today's movie in free preview screenings, and I did not give a dime to watch this movie though I still feel Ladies and gentlemen, time money and if you see this picture you are leaving Benjamin in your seat. The acting is the best torpid; Jaffar Barar, in his worst disguise, Kifa Sutherland's phones and Michael Douglas thinks he made the bad choice of leaving the Katherine Jet-Jones for this turkey shootout period. Eva Langaria is a non-entity; He seems to be reading his telephone line. And if you can not spot the "joke" in the first 20 minutes, then you only came to the planet without the line from this planet TV and world recycled story. You really want to see a good secret service thriller, Fire in the Line of Fire. If you want to see and buy it, you will be afraid of the President's safety because the secret service looks and works like the revised versions of 90210. No matter what you feel about it, let's hope that "art" does not imitate life.
