Anna's name was found in the middle of the world's chaos against Anna Hazare, a meat nurse, growing meat and eating the earth, and started attacking the living. He fled to the street and was rescued by a black police officer. All right so far! I usually enjoy horror films, but this piece of film is not considered to be horrific. It's not even thrilling, just ridiculous. Even "Flintones" or "Cuckoo, Fran and Olie" will even give you more excitement. It's not going to be able to get into a shopping mall by seeing many tears of blood thirsty drunk. Those hirons are locked in themselves, they are not good for refraining from eating outdoors inside the shopping mall. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they tend to be mentally inactive. Save your money instead of spending this money!
