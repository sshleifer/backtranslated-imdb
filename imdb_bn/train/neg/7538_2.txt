I saw this movie because I like Nicholas Cage and it's good, I found it weird and totally useless ... so I decided to bother a little and got my hand at the 70's. How nice. What a difference. One of the main ways was good. I want to tell you all that it originally created a statement, its existence was a motive. It really reveals them the fear of Christian paganism of Christianity. If you dig it deeply, it comments on life, but I do not want to know the details, if you are frustrated and want to know what you want to see it but feel free to see it. Version 70, a little date, but a lot better.
