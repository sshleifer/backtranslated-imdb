Steve was a great film made about Biko. Sadly it was not. Denzel Washington - Actors are not the most flexible - Biko was completely unable to express great raucous. Attenborough's big crowd scene is ridiculous. Soweto genocide was not like this, three obvious lines of children (doing some cartwheels!) Maring in the happy soldiers gun Immediately after the death of Bicko, the picture quickly came out. If there was anything against anti-apartheid, it was a black people's struggle, but since we all managed to escape a white man and his family. I'm sure that Donald Woods was an honest man and he used to say that when Biko was not important he was important. Penelope Wilton's expression is in Hampshire and he is completely unknown that he is in South Africa. Everything. The family dogs of wood have more lines than wooden slaves. When the family was forced to flee, I saw the woman - saw the movie - officially about a dozen black people in a huge, full movie - "like the words of this song." She was at a point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> And in fact for the South African white liberals need a strong need for a head.
