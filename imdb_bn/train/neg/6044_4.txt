Entering into a good good serial killer style that unfortunately really gets really submerged in your own satisfaction is really satisfied. Excellent as Will Dofo is trying to find a copy cat using the same Renaissance art-related murder strategy used in a series of resolutions solved many years ago as a NYC intelligence. Scott Speedman is a Duffer junior partner and they have good chemistry (at least for some time). Other characters conveniently pop up in two field type populations together. Cli Dual is a former victim's friend and Peter Stormer's Duffer, some kind of art broker / consultant ... which is a bit difficult to take, though Stormer must not be silent. The end of the film is especially frustrating. Look at Daphore's Harry faster than a fast-approaching neighbor.
