This is the worst movie I ever remember to put down. Everything was incredibly clich√© and retarded. The acting was very horrible. The camera work was not bad but it still can not break it. The writer / director of this film is certainly suffering from Down Syndrome, if he believes that the film will help his career. I like the one and a half hours of my life that I wasted watching this shit I would rather see a video of grass than this. I do not believe that IMDB has written me 10 lines for this post but I think this film is so bad that I must warn others about it. The reason I came to this movie is that my girlfriend requested the local library that it was Chris Crisoferson's film, which was ultimately the title "display". I do not know who was responsible for the end of this garbage in my DVD player, but I think someone gave me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and trouble. In conclusion, the director of this film / writer hopes I can recognize him on the street.
