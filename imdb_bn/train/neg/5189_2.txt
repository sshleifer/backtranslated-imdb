This series is very good if they make only a simple thing: In the Ian Masonic code name: Instead of the code, Diamond Head: Tree. The diamond head character needs someone who can play a loving barbaric role, which Maxson proved he could do with the series of love. Ray Diamond The Real Diamond Head Really plays the role. Makessen is not really that good as bad guy trees. Nue√±o's character of France, Tso-Ting, can not remember his mind whether he is a victim of a frustrated victim or a hard-to-prepare woman. She really earned her salary when she had to play the role of Lady Head of Diamond Head. After watching an episode or two, I did not care what happened to the end. The tree gives her a lot of things to hate, but Diamond Head does not give her anything to like. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, espionage was not like the 1960s.
