Slash flicks are coming down in a few days, so when I heard about the cut I had high expectations and heard something good about it. The best thing I heard was all wrong ... every mistake! This flash is bad and I mean BAD. It's just plain stupid Everything about it Especially the killer's source and how he survives and ultimately how he cares. There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another slasher who is "hip," "self conscious." With wannabe "Cinema intelligent" characters. I'm so sick of that crap Slash style requires something new literally, for some reason it is different
