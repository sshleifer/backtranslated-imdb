I gave it 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wongo wild lady" is bad. This is an exercise in patience. It is like having your teeth been cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no argument. There is definitely no acting (although shark has some quality dialogue). We do not wonder about anything. We do not know where people got it. It's always amazing like me how to get this even released. I agree with the previous author that it is not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and it will fill so much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought at selling a hungry artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
