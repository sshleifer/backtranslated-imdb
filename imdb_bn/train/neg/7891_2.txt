IMDb plot summary does not describe the essence of this film. It should be read 'Get ready to go back to the third pond jail in your family church at the age of 8, listen to the preacher's drone about God's will and all you can think of is to return to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then gradually converted into a Christian Jamboree, the devotee fully devoted his plot to the bubble-propelled bubble wash. I believe that in the last five minutes I will use the word 'prayer' in about 53 times. After 31st, I tried to drag the word to the word 'hunting' in the context of his words. Sadly, this little mind game made the film portable for at least 20 minutes. Plus whenever a character called 'Prayer' ('Priya' to me) as it becomes completely Johnny then laughing at me. In fact, even my Catholic wife was suffering from her chair, almost at the floor. <br /> <br /> All fascinating Christians who have marked this picture as 8-10 stars, I have advised your theology - Circle Square, Ten Commandments, Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and some of the better protection protection standards. . Stay away from more brain-challenging topics in movies such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Win Nut, With Jesus, or sooner release release. <br /> <br /> Maybe Robert Hotel's book is good.
