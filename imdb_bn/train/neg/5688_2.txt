Short version: Seed is not worth it. It's just derivative and inferior. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you do not see a movie with a vaguely defined "psychological horror" section, then this film will probably close your mouth. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening of the actual animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes for the possibility of atrocities-on-videos and later you will not be able to manage the memorable grave scenes later. Climax will play your passion in any way that is probably not in any other picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " August underground consonant, "For example, it is very difficult for you to stay awake at the end of the movie, just as you did. <br /> <br /> The critics have compared this to the old video nasties. I understand this comparison Like video nasties, "Seed" is a mainstream horror film and more violent than less subtle. But because the video nasties are still known to us because of the reasons above - there were some who were still popular. I think I can be hesitant, I think you can understand: those who were stuck were "souls". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We do not have such a film anymore, because today's technology has exceeded imagination, the technology is cool, many things disappear. It will be because small films like this will not be produced. Today we have a great, extraordinary strategy that is very expensive, but it's cold. Today's horror, more than a million dollars worth of terrorist films like this. Person was not so expensive ... they made a real impact on our hands, "<br /> <br /> Perhaps it is wrong to compare with the dangers of the old school. But Cricinfo was nailed to the head. Even most of their most seemingly exploitative, even video nasties are followed by a primitive "true". And this is where Boll is brief. Looks like he saw the movie and did not understand. Everything in the checklist ... BSS is about "a statement about humanity", a vicious torture scene, but Crescenti says "cold". Gorge is all CGI. The whole thing seems like a scene pieced together from other movies to different styles. And panning sooooo slow. Another fun note: A gore scene really reminds me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough BS Poor movie
