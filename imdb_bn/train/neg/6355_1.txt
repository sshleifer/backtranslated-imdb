I could not wait to see this movie. About half way through the movie, I could not wait to finish. All (white) actors are supplying their lines, such as Woody Allen just said, "Say it better ..." Then they said on their lines of screen that they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Farrel really talks, and he does not ruin his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy section of this movie was not as boring as the tragedy, and certainly not funny or even entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a Woody Allen fan, and this movie has not transformed me. I think his writing is as bad as his order. This movie will go down one of the worst 10 movies I have ever seen.
