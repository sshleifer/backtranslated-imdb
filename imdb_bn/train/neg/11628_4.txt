Hello, your friends are so beautiful! !!! Corny, Corny, Corny I'm feeling about that film. It started well with a good idea, a guy (Edward Asner) escaped Santa in jail, escaped a bunch of kids, believes in him and his real Santa so that the fake Santa helps children find a bag of money stolen from them. This image is like "jumping under the air" like the Christmas version. Although the film starts well, it gradually becomes cheshire and cheesier that eventually it becomes ridiculous and you can not take this movie seriously. For example, you've got the character of Squagu type Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who behaves like a dog in Duchess, who treats his little boy as a pallab, he behaves so badly with his son that he should buy her beautiful clothes, wear a poor child. Jeans with holes! But the 45-second scene of Fak Santor visits Suman, and after the end of the film, you make Christmas carol happy with the person and embrace his negligent boy ... Yes, the way the cornea is ... I like all the movies especially during Christmas. To feel and I'm a big fan of seasonal TV movie. But this is a way to top it for me. It's a shame because it's good, but the second half of the film is leaving a supernatural element that does not match the rest of the film. It's not bad enough, there are some tough performances, especially from children, but there are many big Christmas films nearby.
