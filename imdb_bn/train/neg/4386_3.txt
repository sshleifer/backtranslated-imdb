With a title like this, you do not know of a great awful movie. But this was really bad, with even lower expectations. The plot is really humiliating and stupid: a fleeing criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. This trick can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not the whole movie time! The actors are not bad, but their character is rather foolhardy and stupid and cruel stupid stories. No mystery, no excitement and little gore (very cheap) Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with jokes and dramatically fails in it. At the end it became so annoying that I could not stop 10 minutes before the end. I could take care of whatever. Amanda Plummer was good at PL fiction, but came 13 years ago, and after that she did not do any good. So it is surprising that he has shrunk like this part of this fork. Avoid or be cautious ..
