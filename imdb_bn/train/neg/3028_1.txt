My flatmate rented this picture on another night, so we saw it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the whole movie was shot in this colorful, vase, post MTV texture. Quick sequence, cooling angle, slip running camera - at this moment you feel like watching another "hijack", for a moment ... <br /> <br /> When the plot starts, it starts to feel as if Overdose amphetamine Thing does not just make sense. I do not want to ruin the fun to watch it with specific scenes, but again, the movie is so bad that you are not good at seeing it. <br /> <br /> At first you think it is described in a conversation between a crime story Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. Wrong This conversation provides a coherent description. On the contrary, in the second half of the film, Domino's lousy Lucy Liu's character came to the scene and left the audience more confused. <br /> <br /> I thought that this might be a movie about a girl of a rich man but an inauspicious background who may be a tough monster hunter. In any case, the message is expressed by the open view. But the question of the character of Dominino was completely lost in the criminal case. So childhood, no, this is not about a movie about the character of Domino. <br /> <br /> I thought, maybe it's a robbery story. A beautiful bloody robbery. One million people are missing, suspected robbers are hunted by hunters behind, Mafia kids are executed, hands removed, Damino tries to crack, why do not they get any bonus credentials at this time, but this print will soon be available for other U- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Larry's big new, violet show on Jerry Springer show Abaha tried to racial theory, and at the same time struggling to find the money for his sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What to do with this main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Without the director, the audience will be told where the monsters will pay their collectors' fees to 300,000 taka. Then some time you start to think: "Oh, this is a way to distort our society and the media." Reality TV crew is driving around with liberal predators and doing some violent footage. The liberal hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who simply drag their noses and drag them around so many crime scenes. But no, this is not a movie about the media, they just appear spiders all over the film. There are many sub-plots: the Afghans are looking forward to releasing Afghanistan, love story in Domino and Chocco, Mescaline episode, FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> All the above Can things be packed in 2 hours movie? Judge for myself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
