How nice! And although I saw the trailer for this, 'no, this is not for me'. I saw my husband and our friend's face during the trailer, and knew it was a 'boy film'. I mean, hello! A bunch of chick barmids that dance - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then, when I start to see it, it does not see all that bad. So I carried the observer. I finally saw it. What a horror movie If anything happens, this is a chick flush. These girls have attitude. This is a really interesting movie, and a bit of a love story. Indeed you leave with a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, after going through a big city in the big city C major ** C, it is big in the city. This has been a couple, it's almost a new urban legend. But it also thinks about your life and what you have achieved. Well, I have to I think because this is a very familiar story of a bar scene, not just for me, but for many people I know. Do not believe in the trailer for this - it is noticeable to bring in men.
