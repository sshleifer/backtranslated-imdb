This is one of the worst movies I've seen a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was violent and played Hammy. I'm not sure that this film was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played the same role. It is not even particularly successful in the central feeling of trying to appear as an uninterrupted acceptance. Whooshing horizontal camera is a cheap and unoriginal way to cut the pores of the pans.
