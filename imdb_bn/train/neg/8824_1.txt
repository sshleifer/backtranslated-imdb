What could be said about this movie other than "the viewer carefully"? Christmas Eve should come with a warning label like cigarettes, because it was harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely dissatisfied this with a "B" horror flick, but this movie could even bring a five-year-old little fear. The impressive manuscript of stopping thirst for blood in a film is that he feels almost as God-like, as his psychological anger can not be stopped, but the cyclopheit resident in this movie stuck himself in the chimney. Following the extraordinary attempts to surprise her next victim, and of course, with the famous legend of Santa Claus, it is a reminder to the audience that this man is not dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous All of the total waste of film.
