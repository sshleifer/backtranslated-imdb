The good start of the last game, at least well ended, told me about. It seems like we are going to happen so that only the plot can take place, for example, we do not have any reason for a journalist who is the first to be very wise, intelligent, half-way, really stupid and completely out of character, besides the next scene without it. Do not have to be knowledgeable. The whole story can be said in about 30 minutes, it created the average TV political drama The Brilliant Cuba Gooding Junior. However, considering a lot of JavaScript and James Woods doing a commendable job. <br /> <br /> The last game was really one of the worst movies ... which I saw ... and it's saying something, I saw the Gogli.
