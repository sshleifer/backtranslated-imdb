This is often not seen in a film that is such a horrific. I am continuing, hoping every minute that it was only intended as a joke, it was taken seriously. Well, this is important as a continuous request. <br /> <br /> The acting was disrespectful and the situation was terribly narrow and cluttered. If a film was created in 1920 (for example) and the quality of its hidden and hidden quality (cord) then we thought that the movie was so naive. As it happened, this image was created in 2000 and I still can not see a silent era film which is such a little charm. <br /> <br /> Not for movie-gear. <br /> /> <br /> [No Ratings Rate]
