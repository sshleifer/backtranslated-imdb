In the 1930s and early 1940s in Hollywood, I think every studio can be west except Warner Bros. Sometimes they try, it's always ridiculous (probably, they were taking their boots - a backside of a booth.) I read Hamfrey Bougert, James Cagni with this big cowboy hat and said on his head, he looks like a mushroom. Truth! Cagney and Bogart are very urban, to be credible in a Western movie of an XXe century. The story here was no suprise, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I realize that Bogert and Cagney dropped their little guns and placed a machine gun in hand in a 1930s black car away from the set.
