If you could see it, it could be a very good movie. The camera was very warm by hand. I was worried about the opening credits. Many of us felt very annoyed at seeing this. But we stayed in the end because it was an engaging and interesting movie that gave some insight into the young pop culture of South Africa. The black and white film has improved its subtle feeling. The acting looked very authentic. The understanding of the dialogue was difficult to understand, but a South American full-length movie takes it quite fun to find out. If you get the speed of the illness despite the fact that you can consider removing this movie seriously. It's tender, but not nausea.
