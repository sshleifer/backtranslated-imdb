Fairly good movies, but not true stories. <br /> <br /> "Ruby" Hurricane "Carter was a moral liar, a murderer and never found guilty. New Jersey State has not been for the third time for more than 20 years. Carter received a proposal in 1976: "Pass a false test and go free". He did not accept it. This picture should not have been made, but discussion of money. Many people spend their lives in improper jails and are undoubtedly more white than white. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Joss
