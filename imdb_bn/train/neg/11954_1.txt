This movie was terrible. Throughout the whole movie, I was surprised and could not see anything. I had to go to this site and finally read the review to understand what it was about. This movie is worth watching all. It is not only sick and rebellious but completely stupid! Please do not watch if you are not the one who likes to watch bad movies. If this movie questions the Japanese society and its values ​​and role, it is a country I do not want to visit or disturb. This is a completely ill cinema !!!!!!!! I do not enjoy it because it does not have any knowledge. My boyfriend and I are not waiting to see if there was a horror because it is listed under It was a total disappointment.
