As a gentle country starts as a yarn, unreasonable and silently romantic romantic stories are changed, such as Adwyn Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals about himself and things go on for sinners, because the film gradually varies from a southern romance into modern flood. Western <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> But it has become gradually evident that this cowboy has more than eye. <br /> <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? A true incognito actor (with changing face face changes) can play a hiker, speak a little hilarious, but maybe he is trying to do the part without uttering anxiety. While learning more about Harlan, he must be able to make all the slightest adjustments effortlessly. However, with very small changes, it means that we are not sure where Hurlan is coming from, and it seems like a good performance from Norton is slowly confused. Ivan Rachel Wood never liked doing any other work about how to bat his eye in Norman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do we like this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. This obscurity is like a loss to the film, as the writer did not remember what kind of stories they wanted to say and settled for a little hot pot. If the film was one or the other, it could be a tough movie, but what we kept is a mess. Supporters of old fashion romance will enjoy a part of the film, but dark tunes will be closed. Fans of Norton apart (or fans of the lovely scenes of the San Fernando Valley), give it a miss.
