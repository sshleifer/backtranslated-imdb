Now when I was watching this one I had good intentions. I liked some of Tony Scott's work, a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, though I heard from other people aloud. But this was simply frustrating. <br /> <br /> My modest opinion, Tony Scott, was trying very hard. It was just a lot. Allow me to expand. <br /> <br /> Miss Nightley is not very well, but rather well. Those who played well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time was not able to save the movie only. <br /> <br /> There were some basic scenes that went beyond their basicity, yet they seem to have written someone other than the original author. A specific tune is used almost 4 times, which starts a second bug. I strongly believe not to use the same tune. <br /> <br /> Also, the editing has really gone this one direction, because the cutting rate is higher. Oh, and a couple of lines of repetitive reflections on the careers make chace sound easily after listening to it for the second, third, fourth time and more. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see a step-flick that is high-quality and "slightly" fun, and you do not care about everything mentioned above, you might like it. <br /> <br /> (A side note: I'm not a nightly fan.)
