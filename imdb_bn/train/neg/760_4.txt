An unknown and famous "new" Colombo, who sees Man-in-the-Mac in his nephew's wedding, disappears only on the wedding night of his wife. Colombo investigates ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is how it can be said. It is a platonic and surprisingly tall, with a flat script, written by Robert Van Skick, who wrote the highly enjoyable Colombo story "Under the Murdered Glass" in the heyday of the detective; There is no word to speak even harder and the scripts have narrowed the suspects through photos taken at the highest level of consciousness provided to the Colombo by the writer, all of whom are! <br /> <br /> The potential of each Column is possible, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. The history of the series with a series of successively played soap-opera style is an insult. Extremely avoidable components.
