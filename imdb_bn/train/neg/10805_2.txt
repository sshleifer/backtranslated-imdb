I was the only reason to DVRd this movie because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shake now plays basketball for us and 2. I've always heard how terrible it was. The movie is not frustrating. The best part was the document of Shock. The worst part, well, was just about all else. My 12-year-old son and I just circled and when the shock began to climb, I did not see it on the screen, and we wondered why Max did not want to fix Kazmam's teeth in front of him! But for all its frightening we can not only see it, the story sucks you like a black hole or quicksand or tar ports, it was hypnotics. But laughing laughing laughing said, "Workzam!"
