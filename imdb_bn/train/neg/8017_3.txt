I did not actually finish the film. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially if negatively. But I did it because I closed it and I could not see ... I got more than half, and I just reached there by pledging something around the corner. This movie is so tedious, so I was very humiliating. I have not read many reviews, so I'm not sure that other gay sex teenagers have suffered through it, but I'm homosexual, and I went through "similar" verses, day dreams, topics etc. Perhaps in two moments I felt that this image could go anywhere, where I felt that its meaning could be somewhat meaningless, or relativity, but these expectations suddenly came to an end that the statement given in the next step came. I mean, see quotes on IMDB page. Unfortunately you are not able to hear behind the Scratchy Play, or echo-eyed fades if you read only the quotes, it's very painful / funny / missidized. I gave this movie three stars, and these three stars went to the big cinematographer, who did a fantastic job to transform some of the tedious "concepts" of conduct. I think that he did not decide to include all the lengthy shots of TV closure ... He has already done unnecessary clich√©s in movies like Gamura in the Korine ... I think it is very suitable that this movie is in Prem Sunder (because of the kind of conduct volunteer work The connection was, the way he did ...) Because Sundance seems to be a festival where such heavy drill is So it is still accepted as "Arthouse". No, it's not the Art House, I'm afraid it's just plain ** ** rooms. Do not see
