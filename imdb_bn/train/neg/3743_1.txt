Jared Diamond created a point in the first episode that animals of other world animals were not pets but Europeans did, and for this reason we were able to make steel and discover complex machines. <br /> <br /> In the third episode he said that when the Europeans of South Africa responded a lot, they ran between the Zulu and other tribes, who looked after the beef and the crops. So what are the key factors for the success of the author's claim, if their lack of technical, economic, and artistic successes explain? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claimed the germs in the form of roots (black slaves brought by North America) were our biggest arms. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 local fighters and 400 non-military South Africans in any case can defeat 10,000 Julus * without a single casualty, then I think you are gonna be irrelevant. Without germs or germs, we're going to be successful. <br /> <br /> Malaria has stopped Europeans from further north colonies, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I want to know the real number but he does not say.) Then he said that Malaria is killing thousands of Africans today and that is why they can not contact us. So Jared, what is this? Did the malaria help the Africans by stopping or stopping European Europeans? And how well do Europe have in spite of widespread plagues throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He is not saying that Europeans achieved the fate of foolish because of success. Sometimes when the evidence threatens to strengthen its drift theories, he is unwilling to accept that perhaps the Europeans were successful because they worked for it. The obvious neo Marxist conflict is sad to try to prove its point of view.
