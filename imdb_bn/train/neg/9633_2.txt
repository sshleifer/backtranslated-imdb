Rich, sick Elizabeth Taylor calls on the island's archangel angel on the island, or is she just surprised - or more accurately, overacting - as normal? Indeed, the horror of both director Joseph Lossi, "Boom" applies to the world of messy mess, appropriate titles from the tempers in disciplined, ready to burst about the luxurious setting. Richard Burton overtakes Taylor's mountain; He dressed up in a samurai dress with him in all. Although a great look at the widescreen, the picture should otherwise be left to be quite fatal, even failure, even Leas-de-Féillès (Tara's collective "What the hell!" Nadir is here). Uninterrupted, confused, and embarrassing, "Boom" is a catastrophe - although the screenplay Tennessee Williams, who was adapted to his unsuccessful game "The Milk Train Doss Stop Hire Anime", is said to be very loved! * ****
