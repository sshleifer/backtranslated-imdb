What a holiday Two days ago I saw the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "he was out". I try to make a decision that is worse than my mind's hardships while watching. I think, "when he was outside" was bad. It is said before all other comments: Unreal, unreasonable, etc. - The only thing I need to add is a little bit. She started feeling more for a worse son than the woman because I had recommended Darwin's reward for her death (I only saw the first half, so I do not know). Soon I had two Darwin awards (if it was possible) for her misdeeds. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Kim Basinger? So he did not know the script only, but he was also responsible for the loss of this money to the people? I think people think that a lot of money is bad because in view of this, instead of hitting 80% of the people in the movie, money can be used to feed some people and wear clothes and 20%, which is Idiotus, good. They have a chance to show just how stupid they are.
