Oh dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, the cuff was about the Olympics in Hollywood's career. It can not help after the girls became strong, Wayward Bus, The Bourgla, and Rock Hunter felt that Jane was well on his way to becoming one of Tintune Town's hottest stars. However, with the warm publicity and presence of this clanker, an emotion manfield was moved away from the non-debt zone, as long as Fox could exclude his contract from his first contract. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a waste of time, except for the exception of Suzy Parker, the only thing that is bad for the material. Many people blame poor Jenny and her superb role in poor box office reflection on the box office, and she is suffering from this film, but she can only get involved with her. After all, Kerry set the screen on the hard drive? After being very good drama and comedy, Jenny backtracked her step 10 as a serious actress with her consent to portray this chic, stupid danger (in order to appear with Grant). Alice's character is a complete cartoon bibo and although it is good enough to eat a boiler suit, its every appearance of the film raises your nerves. We all know that Joe could have done a lot better than this shoe and yet he is parade like a prize pudding here. A real shame <br /> <br /> This so-called comedy is clean. It's more depressing than fun.
