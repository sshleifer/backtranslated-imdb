I really like this show once, once. Until I did not understand all this error. It's so unreal. I know it's fiction, but it's not even a little bit credible. The reason here. ** People ahead of Splellar ... ** Can we really believe that a child like Yugi will descended from a Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Come on! He is the biggest nerd in the world. And what is there with the hair of Pharaoh (ASK Atim and / or Yami)? In the end, I examined that Pharaoh was wiped (except for a little hair on his head) and fancy hat. And, can we believe that an evil rich man's talent can run a successful business even when he goes to small school like 'Kaamma' named 'Damino High'? Puh-leeze! First off, he will be an adult to run a company legally. And that really does not really make a boy a lot of talent, because he will be the only adult in his class. And second stop, why was he attending a school like 'Domino High', when his business was successful enough for him at the Spanish Sarnobashi Academy? Alongside, the plot is beside his younger brother, very unfortunate and tall. Every time you go around, the kidnapper is kidnapped for the kid. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor child who lives with a good father. It is said that Joey earns all the money to attend her school, because her father has alcohol, but you have never seen Joe something that works like a job. She does not even mention the work. And her sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would he choose a snob like a snob like Dennis on a wonderful guy like Tristan (wearing a dog wearing his brother and humiliated him on public television)? Is he really that stupid? Various characters throughout the show, possessed by demon power, steal their soul by demon power, and fall victim to mental illness. (Oh, this child is safe, not.) Tea is the back-door door, whose sole purpose is the girlfriend of Yugi / Yami. And she has some cool points, she does not have enough time to brighten up as the main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is just awful. All the characters look sick and immune. The perspectives are terrible (especially when they close someone's hand) and the colors look good, but they do not show stars. <br /> <br /> The worst plot of the series is the fact that Yami can send soul back to their bodies in the puzzle of her millennium. If that's the case, how did he not save Uigi's grandfather in the first place, when Pagasas stole his soul, and saved himself from the trouble of saving himself? <br /> <br /> This is really a commercial for yourself. This is only the plus side "U-Gee-Oh: Series covered by LittleCuriboh". <br /> <br /> please. Do something more suitable. Like, watch recitation version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
