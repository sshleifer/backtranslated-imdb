This picture breeches the fine line between taunting and silliness. A bridge system where no rule can encourage marital affair, but it certainly does not promote the winning bridge, so the mockery does not work for me. However, I got some things in an enjoyable way, especially with Paul Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschalk, a big bridge match at the end of the film. It is treated like a championship boxing match too. The referee is running in the competition for the class-class competition competition, like the boxing ring, the referee is running in the competition and the radio broadcaster Rozko Cornes provides a nonstop chatter on the events. At one point he even described it as "one ... two ... three ... four ...", although four diamond bids were a threat. And everyone was raided for them, all are a general event for championship boxing matches. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the actors provide the comedy necessary to maintain some of the motivated ridicule. Most of the pictures of Paul Lucas are not available for the trick and it has gone wrong; Not enough lines were given to the beautiful Loreta Young and the usual comic Frank McHug; At the beginning of the film Glenna Ferrell has an amazing ridiculous counterpart as a wonderful blonde, but she eventually disappears. What a waste of talent!
