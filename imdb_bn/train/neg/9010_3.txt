When you want to feed Dragon to every cast member, you know that you are on a bad journey. <br /> <br /> I went to fewer expectations, read some other comments, and were not given below. Against some other cheap and unsuccessful movies, it's not really funny (and weirdly) funny. <br /> <br /> - Follow the Puranas <br /> <br /> First, the plot is very inconsistent. Looking at the past of the dragon's "past" errors, which are growing within the past 3 hours, the whole concept based on this is objectionable. See, the film wants us to believe that the dragon came from an exotic place that was actually a dragon egg. After explaining these, they show some farmers insecurity together with their pitchfork and dragon pop out. Later, the compulsory "crazy scientist" argues about how the person surpasses dinosaurs. So apparently when the man was near the dinosaurs, or we have a fine little plot hole here. Another major issue is that the lab used for the use of Hiroshima was blown up with "half-powerful" forces. Then two guys walk out checking all of them, and it's almost uncassed! There is another dragon, who knows who from there All in all it is very expected. As soon as people mentioned cloning, I guess they'd clone a dragon. That means that Mr. Smerty-Pant is not so intelligent and smart that the person is going to believe you, if you ignore it, I knew that this movie will be, you know, the dragon <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That's the second bad thing, "special effects." Others mention the falling rocks, the CG helicopter and the dragon in the beginning. It looks a bit better than a blob, but at the same time at the same time for the time being rushed down the hall, it destroys what it was going on. For their achievements, the flying dragons were initially far from right (though one of the caves is probably the worst of the whole movie.) This thing is interesting to see. The scenes where one million different shots of the same person are shown are not shown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For example, they seem to be more enthusiastic about what they are doing compared to the number of recent participants in "Bloodline" and you have to point them out. Although I noticed that the girl playing the girl often used to cover her face, which had a lot of tone lighter than the rest of her body. He looked like he had a bad run-in with some white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and tasty. You do not actually watch the music, but it is actually not very bad in most cases. <br /> <br /> if you do not want to see it in the line below it will not see it because you see it bad I did), although the only interesting thing is the bad CG effect. Do not waste your time and money, other than that.
