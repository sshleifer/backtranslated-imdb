I bought it for fifteen times at the comedy center by watching the information-polarized tower. I was actually looking forward to seeing this. Where did my God go wrong? Now before I give my review, just tell me that I am a person who can find something very good in all movies, in hell I own 1,500 DVD! That said, underground comedy movies I've never seen up there with the worst movie. I tried to give it a chance, but it's not only fun. It was no point, what ever did not object so much and was almost stupid. Was this piece of fun to God who crippled their right mind? This is going to the right-hand side ...
