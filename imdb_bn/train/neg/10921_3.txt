I often create a point outside showing bad movies, and science-channel channels for these films remain one of the best sources. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my frustration when I saw the Siesta Sands. The acting was inauspiciously sub-par, as the crushing abusive display scientist usually stores for us. You probably have a few hours probably made by recognized people, even though you do not know by their heart's name. The CGI special effects are low, and thus, lack of one of the biggest sources of the sciences. Sure, there are some interesting moments such as a guy bent down by a bulldozer, or when the main character keeps his friend dead, he is known for a few days to save a girl, but overall it does not end in the end you are laughing on the floor with a smile , And I consider that a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was rating it on 10 TV scale, especially for making TV movies, I would probably give it a 4, perhaps even a 5. A real shame that I would have to wait 'next sci-fi To get a good smile until the original movie, and I really hope that this movie is not part of some overall quality enhancement science -five original movie.
