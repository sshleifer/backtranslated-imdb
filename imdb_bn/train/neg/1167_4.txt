I really tried to like this movie but in the end it did not work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's output and found it very variable. An interesting plot like all his living films, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are painlessly short supply of Eliv. If all is original and could create for an excellent ash film, the plot is cool. Unfortunately, the paceing is slow and the film can take an age before reaching the fully anticipated places. The action is almost passable, the final war is quite quiet, and just about the previous one. The previous is also made by the camera-work for deadly, less coitus. There are some intriguing ideas about some obvious visual effects and dialogue, but the film has still been badly dragged. The characters do not fleshed well or are not well played and the settings and common color projects are poking and annoying. The film is completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps the faster use of the forward buttons can improve it using it. With about twenty minutes of taking off time runs this could be a nice decent science fee thriller. But the entire lengthy film is dull. Only very patient and scheduled Kitumura fans recommend.
