As others have mentioned, this movie is similar to the fly (both versions) and less well-known science-changed conditions in Flickr. The big difference is that two films were well-formed, who knew what they were doing and it was good. METAMORPHOSIS did not have this facility. METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story which plays the role of wrong people and wrong actors in his responsibilities. <br /> <br /> This story is a scientist. Following Peter Hussmann (Gene Labrak) is a grief-stricken man who is following a genetic healing on aging and death. When he worked to threaten financing, he decided to inject an anti-aging serum into himself. As a result, Dr. Hussein gradually made the rest of the film a mask. And oh yes, it's a great pleasure to see a good doctor through the process of being an incognito. It's really good that it's bad. Some of the lines are classic: "What was it?" "A nightmare ... from the past!" <br /> <br /> <br /> I read the last five minutes of this movie as stupid and ridiculous at this point. I'm just going forward and it's rolling down: A good doctor suddenly seems half-man, half-mannered, a man wearing a godzilla dress, when the police eventually shot him. In the final scene, some overwhelming children meet a small pet bird, who claim that she will never die, and the film's heroine, Sally Donelli (Catherine Bernouv) has clearly decided that the little camouflage is. Hussmann's final avatar The camera then lets us close up the face of the disguise; This, I guess, is the way to show the manager that the camouflage EVIL. Yes, it is a fool, but I used to laugh laughing so that I can not complain. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classic 50 Movie Mapapack that I bought. I'm sure many of these reading did the same thing, because the only way to watch this movie is 50 packs of DVDs. If you've recently purchased a boxed set and you have not seen this movie yet, your time is really valuable, even if I eventually end up for you. It may be possible to find this movie online for free.
