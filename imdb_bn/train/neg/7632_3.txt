Many people see it as a classic, but I must definitely miss something. Early life of Earner was 50 years old - which means that Anna, a movie of Texas life, will be very dust at the beginning of the 50 years. So many people see what? Once you have finished showing the last photo, do not really do anything in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But before closing it does not even have to do much, so basically everything is almost rolling around. High school students plan to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes even in the cities equally disadvantaged adults. You see, there is not much to do for them - except for sex (sometimes with each other and annoying teens) or to make a joke about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I was thinking of adding some drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) died unexpectedly, but nothing happens through Sony (Timothy Button) and Jesse (Cycle Shepherd), but that does not really happen because of this, Joe Bob (Barack Doyle) kidnapped a little girl, but nothing Really happen due to that. Anything added to the dramatic quality of the film ends with the death of Billy (Sam Bootmus), which has really emptied the life of this sad little city, because the men are looking at the body's debate. <br /> <br /> < > Peter Bogdanovic narrated this picture in black and white, which I think is to explain how this city will be gray, but the only thing that I find interesting is that The first look of the actors. Bottom, Shepherd, Bridge and Randi Quaid. (On one side, it was terrible to see how many in 1971 - National Lampon Vacation films actually resemble the character of his cousin Eddie.) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
