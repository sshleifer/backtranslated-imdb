It was another big screen for a 60 second American TV show, it was quite fun but there was too much of the formula. Intelligent Martian plays the role of the world and does not fill the bright people with his views. <br /> <br /> Normal helplessness with the people, the bridge, finally bonds with him and helps him to return home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some extra time if you do not see anything good.
