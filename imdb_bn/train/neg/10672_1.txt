There was no clich√© and no substance in this film. The plot did not go anywhere and at the end of the film I felt like a sucker to see it. Production was good; However, the scripts were played and B movie quality. Because the cast was mixed well with the poor actors. Good actors do not keep their own and they do not lift others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirements for ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Junior played herself in other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for stupid entertainment, I will not recommend this movie yet.
