I must admit to laughing out when I saw this comparison of one critic LOTR. Yes yes, if you drop dwarfs, throw thousands, great special effects, big war, strong characterization, decent plot, good acting, passionate aspects and everything else. Which leaves you with walking And boy, do not walk this film! If Mr. Piano caught his way, perhaps walking through the Wisconsin countryside could be an uninterrupted work for three hours, but every 40 minutes or more, these painful Martin popped up for a few seconds and prevented him from interrupting him. . You have not seen a movie so much walking. It was really a $ 20 million budget, but most of it would go to Mr Piano's shoes, because he wants to get lots of couples across the walk. Moderate explanation, explain why there is no meaning for a suitable video camera or suitable actors. Actually, for some people it's like watching some malicious fetish videos for long periods of time. Even in the fast forward, it's walking in a luning bug. <br /> <br /> As science fiction staff, I think it is wrong to put martins on film: They only get on the path of walk, which makes the director obviously more interesting than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how many dog ​​walks of Mr. Piano?
