I wanted the TV punch. It was a pain to see. I hate it. This movie will never be seen. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is boring. I usually like her but this one does not. I wanted to break the DVD. It's the world's most annoying film. Curiosity he is jealous is objectionable The only remote part of the black girls got all the girls. I wanted the TV punch was so annoying. If you want to release someone, do not buy this movie. If you like Adam Sandler, then do not buy it. It just needs to hate you. If you see your shop, do it yourself, keep it away from the danger of buying people. I paid for a waste of $ 1.99 for it.
