This is an old film which aims to show the desire for independence for young people in some inhuman British school. Oh yes it's like in the army, you learn to obey and learn what you are asked to learn. Yes, there is a young dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and removes their optimism in life threshold. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically how you can enrich great motives ... Excellent motivations that inspire a painter's challenge: Results are a declarative film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
