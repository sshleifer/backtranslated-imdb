I do not believe they have made this image. Completely unnecessary. The first picture was just fine. But there was no need for a signal, after a television series that was already a series of first films. This picture seems like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's pretty easy. Does not come across jokes, flat surfing, it sits like a soap, it lacks any direction. The first image was a good mental backbone behind it. Each character had little pressure. It was very easy, but it worked in any way and I could see the talent of that movie. But this time around, there is no solid story line. Characters do not have dull stereotypes and striking nothing. One good thing: Brazilian son Axel has played quite well with Desilir's son. Creative success in this film was one of their moments. I have heard that they have already shot the second television series as a series of 'Team Spirit 2' but please do not let God give them their third nature insects ...
