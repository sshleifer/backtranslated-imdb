Death and Girlfriend administers some programs to resurrect the dead, to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they revived a dead soul, who started their vacation with the ax and the next day some college people told the story surrounding Campfire. The ax man roams and starts hacking idiots to tell the story. The police say to the police, the blood is spreading on the police's forehead and it seems to have been removed by a mountain lion (??) and soon after some distorted killer, who can not be a ghost <br /> <br /> Morton is a little film movie which was portrayed in a great daylight, but where many characters carry flashlight and are talking in the middle of the night and want to send a signal flare to draw attention. One person has a gun and the bullet on the other hand is not bothered to load it, then if he loads the end, he has the opportunity to shoot the killer, but it does not bother, because it will end the film very soon. Then he threw a gun! There are also harmful characters that do not show any emotions and at least some of them are not worried after their friends have been cut into pieces and harmful effects (a piece of chicken flesh appears clearly, the car clearly expired in it is clearly the model car) and the horror Dialogue and some really ugly female nudity does not help. And in the end it tried to get away with this inconsistency that it was the beginning of the movie that all the discoveries of the same college of story telling of Camp Fire. <br /> <br /> In the last episode, the slaughterers come back to the real and cut them into pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
