The man has designated many titles for a bunch of movies and I think one day he said; I should choose a cheap scenario, try to keep as much title as a can (as I become a title designer) and try to convince people that this is actually a movie. Even the worst is that I've even seen it for sure. If you are interested in seeing a nice title, then see some posters do not waste your time while watching it. <br /> <br /> Do not you think, saw the poster? The only part of her project is that almost anyone has the title job to be done!
