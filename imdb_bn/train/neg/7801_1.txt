I will keep this piece as a reference warrants for this brief brace as soon as possible. ZombieE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - with the other awesome Junky Entry of the right Schnaas - Zombie DOOM (Lawyer Violent SH! T3). These films suck so bad that everyone involved in their crew should be shot. I've managed (just ...) to sit in Zambia's dome - but in Zambia 90's very disheartening - even compared to other terrible movies of the bath - even I had to move fast with the first 10 minutes. Zero acting skills, inept gore, awesome camcorder-style camera work, ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on and on. I can not really find a thing to break this junk - and generally I can break a bit in almost a movie. This is one of the worst movies ever made - you've been warned ... 1/10
