If this movie is even worse, it would have been operated by the Uwe Bow. This nonsense mess is like Ed Wood, a hitcoike. After a while I saw this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to do all serious physical harm involved. Anyone who can give more than 1 star to this movie, I saw this trip surprised me about the kindness of everyone. I give it a star because there is a low rating. All copies of this movie will be burned on the ground and stored as landfills for most toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept under very high security and not how to do it, for example just showing the filmmakers.
