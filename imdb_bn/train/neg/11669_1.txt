I think it's nice to see the wonderful things in a film full of absolute and beautiful and trendy. With a number of Hollywood movies sometimes stupid, we can enjoy intermittent and explosive, silly language and authentic one-fishing scenes. There are places of Minimalism, and can be very effective when employed properly. However, this image is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Do not have any conversations with tall scenes and take rare, diverse scenery. I'm sure that they will hold some great money and insight, because the messages mentioned in the shrouded in confusion. Actor is poor ... great and pedestrian ... and one of the worst stories in history (at the end of the film, if you can finally sit on it). The scenery is ironic, and walking through the Bayer Park, the ridiculously long lasting sequence of the trick is delightful to have teeth. I would call this anticlimatic, but since the film did not create any kind of climax ... even in the "erotic" scene ... it would be untrue. I'm sure that there was a script involved in the filming, but I think it's written in a cocktail napkin with the amount of dialogue. Basically, this film does not give any interest or surprising ... no great story, no astounding insight, no visible drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three fun moments, this film is a waste of two hours. A miserable annoying and dreary film.
