Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anna Mary Johnson, Paul Koslon <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon We are usually associated with extremely poor films such as re-animator, free afterdog, dog and casual freak, which is a little bit freshened here with a little maiden. I press the "small" word, because it is very low budget flashing, and its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story comes in the future. In a world where the Great Director General (United States and Russia, according to this film), their differences do not go completely in the world war ... but the Gladiator style fight with the giant robots. Our hero Achilles must go against Alexander the Russian robot fighter. Many cheap stop motion animation ensues. <br /> <br /> Well, I think the idea is extraordinary. Settlement of regional disputes with great nation's monster robots? Attractive compound can be managed and managed properly if the appropriate budget is available. Unfortunately, a funny movie might end up being otherwise embarrassing for the great director. <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I think if you want to enjoy any of these movies, it has some fun with little kid mode back. I have shown this picture to some of my friends and the movie has improved my friends, "What is this fragment of Bran Frank?" And I'm good this film is a scientist of my favorite director Stuart Gordon? "But since the film was moving in the arid region, I often thought of stopping and not being able to go through that torture because I liked this image as a child, and there is a small nostalgia attached to it, but the other Everyone was not going to get it. <br /> <br /> And I realized myself that the film is really good, first stop. The picture is about giant robots by assassinating hell from each other and for achieving it in a credible fashion, you have to use some extraordinary special effects to create it, costly effects that will help the viewers suspend suspicion, but unfortunately it is a small scale company ( Empire picture, after making this movie, Deoli !) Is a small film, which only helps us smile and laugh, the set and the dress show some incomplete or semi-assessed. <br /> <br /> All right, once you accept that you have a medium stop Seeing a mix of animations and small mixes, you can give it to the movies and even enjoy the big sticks of hell from each other. When the robots are fighting, there are some scenes that are cool, and let me go "So I like the movie thaid!" But everyone knows and theirs, some painful effects will take you out of the protective little cocoon that you are trying to hide. And right back to your right, come back to your right to realize this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes me bother about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. You know, giant robot duking it out? Stop motion animation? Hello But there was a lot of sex in this film dialogue and violence became a little bloody. So I asked myself whether this is a children's movie? Shortly thereafter, I came to the conclusion that it was originally a movie film that was adult sensitivity, which is not really a good mix. <br /> <br /> So those of you who do not feel a bit na√Øve, a little kiss like fighting two robots with each other and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like I do), good ID suggests that you Clear away the run. Gordons is a great director, but he does not do it for me, just for this movie. Well, at least now I'm not mature enough. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 2
