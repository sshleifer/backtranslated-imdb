Nick Stahl's name, the young cast and VHS's amazing cover bought me and saw this glimpse, looking for a good teenager slash movie. What a shit! Clich√©s full of plaque, dialog and performance horror, horrible, very bad, terrible, horrible ?? Summary, a complete waste of time. With shameful plot points, no horrific, black humorous, only a completely annoying story. The picture starts with six letters, in fact, three couples, like a group of friends together, but in fact, very nasty people seem to be enemies, a ridiculous game called "nevertheless" and some prohibited things for everyone, yes or no. This is: There is no previous improvement of characters, spectators do not know who they are, their motives and relationships. Thereafter, there are elipises a year later, and the same group gathered in New Year's Eve party, insulting each other insulting. But the plot and twists are so ridiculous, anticipated, mediocre and incredible that my review does not deserve any extra line. Only a tip: Do not waste your garbage or waste on this waste, you will of course be sorry. My vote is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Yet ?? Jogando Low and Assasino" ("Still ?? Playing with The Killer")
