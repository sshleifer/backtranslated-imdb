I'm a big movie fan. I like all kinds of movies. This is the worst movie I ever seen controversially. <br /> <br /> I should not make everything into a movie that highlights the point in which it closely follows the book. Especially the question of the experience of books has been questioned once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not curious, they are mentally ill. What is happening is not funny, they are annoying; Especially they are supposed to be true. <br /> <br /> This film had a sense of Royal Teunebam, I hated in any other film, running only with running movies was more effective and less fun. <br /> <br /> I will not get that hour back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
