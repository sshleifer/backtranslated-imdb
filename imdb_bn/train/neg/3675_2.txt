Really, everyone in this movie thinks they want to be somewhere else! Wonder, not welded with the left hand, but rather all of them. I did not see anything worse than the drama McLoughon, a little confused in the gun carrying agent. You do not use a spoiled city-brat-look such as a role. The only bad thing I can imagine is to cast a Doris Day as prostitution. The rest of the cast is equally terrible, as Hurt's only exception, sometimes you can try him, but can express regret. Oh, I mentioned that this is a completely insane story? Have you been divorced and want to see your family, so many people are in danger? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography can be bad.
