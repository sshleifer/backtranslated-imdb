At first I want to excuse my bad english. <br /> <br /> I'm not a hostel-hardcore-fan, but still I like that movie. Live feed, however, great time wasted! I have never seen a great movie with superb acting, but who are you surprised? The live feed was acting ... well, no! I've seen some comments as it could be a school project or something. Okey, but not by the media or played school students. This was not a class! And what about the story? The hostel is a really sad rip off. And what about Gore? Psychopathic torture scenes that can create your intensity and leave you freezing? Hole was the most frustrating about the movie! Short, fast and no edge. More like death penalty instead of torture. Oki, where there is blood bucket, but it was not real. Killings and violence remind one of Bridid's more than Sue-movies than hostels. And the brandy was funny! Okay, I smiled at the live feed several times, but the fun was more than disappointing! <br /> <br /> Watch live feed instead of losing 80 minutes!
