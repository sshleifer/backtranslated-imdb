The "Argyag" release schedule for the entire table of 1929-30 has surrounded the schedule, there are two story lines on "A Trophy Winter". First, Hoisier and Mary Ann, decided to make some joke alone, in a winter day alone. Little Whiser refers to the direction of Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. Problem: Suffering from the different shows to replace the whiplash relay and Mary Anne end! Funny moments happen when the rest of the Ganges shows Taffy - and ultimately it goes out of the house! <br /> <br /> The second story is the gang's neighbor / colleague Stepin Fetchit, and his interaction with the gang <br /> <br /> "In my knowledge" a solid winter "has never been shown on television, Although it is found in home video Staten Fetchit Characterization for that shows a mere, slow, and slow-motion character. The "Our Gang" producer called Hal Roach Fatch as "an accomplished comic" and used this "our gang" entry as a pilot for the Fetchit comedy series, which never saw the light of day. It is understood, the characterization of Fetchit is objectionable to many people today, which explains why the film was hijacked. <br /> <br /> Although Fetchit and Taffy have some funny moments but "a tough winter" is a ploding and scary effort. If a positive idea comes from this movie, Hall Roach Studios has become confident and experienced in conversations. The sound of the movie is good, and the effect of some sound used is very funny. For this reason, this film has made an excellent way for the films "Our Gang" of 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
