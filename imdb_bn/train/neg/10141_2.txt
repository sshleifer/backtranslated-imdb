Steven Sigal, Mr. Personality itself, this time America's best stealth pilot who promised to forgive the military. (Who tried to swap his memory at the beginning of the film, for which he escaped from the base, later caught on a gang of robbers at a shootout at a gas station), if he was able to successfully enter the terrorist base based on a North Afghan-based black Sunday named a group Been, who is an American traitor to Air Force Ste Thal fighters thank you. With a co-pilot praised by the traitor, Janik (Mark Buzzley), John Sands (Sigal), his Arab lover Jessica (Sier Petton) and Freedom Fighter (Alki David) will once again fly to enemy areas for help. They are on the ground. Janik was abducted by Black Sunday leader Stone (Vincentenzo Nicholli) and his female enforcer Eliana (Katie Jones), and soldiers should certainly be rescued even after the command of abducted stealth fighters is not reinstated. And perhaps, Stern might take revenge against the trader, whom he trained, rather (Steve Tauentant) in this process General Naval pilots spend 72 hours in the sand on the whole area bombardment. Black Sunday on the board secretly set up a bio-chemical bomb in the hope of an explosion in the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The establishment of Afghanistan is not involved in the verification (.. and how easy and segal and no so easy to move to the unselected area) and the plot itself is nothing to write home. The movie is quick to edit, the camera is a bit damn shocking. Segal was never active as a hero and his action scenes were completely edited, where we saw him hard times finding his enemies just like in the old days. One of Sigal's most important attempts, and he is at least (not appreciated ..) as before. Even more frustrating that Sigal does not fight in the fight for the film's main villain, it's a shame. He does not graduate from any wrist or breaks his neck towards a scene. (Surely we can see some similar adjustments in some of the tools, but it is not clear to any images that I enjoy, because filmmakers have so much editing and close up dizzying).
