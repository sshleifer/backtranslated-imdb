I did not see most of Laurel and Hardy's classic movies. I have always enjoyed talking here, even silly fools, over and over again. This new film tries to bring the classics back to two new actors like Laurel and Hardy, but sadly fails for a variety of reasons. One of them is out of place which is still in their clothes (still in the early 20th century) but both of 90's are illustrated in the setting. Some of the former dialogues were brought back, but it failed unfortunately to come closer to the classic series. This picture I saw and saw any bad movie and should stop it and should stop forever. The real Laurel and Hardy are buried in their grave surly at such a bad imitation.
