And when I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same result. I love quirky, unpleasant humor. But this woman is so annoying B-R-ING, annoying, and awake. She lacks something completely ridiculous. The deadpan way to try to deliver his line is not just funny because the dead on arrival. I saw two parts of his program and ready for Novokine. <br /> <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (19 years old) saw his promotion at the comedy center and said he was a "dumb dogs". I thought that was a compliment. Where he said, "Look at my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually credible. I know he wants to be an actress. She just comes across as a warped nut case. I just do not want to see him around my dog.
