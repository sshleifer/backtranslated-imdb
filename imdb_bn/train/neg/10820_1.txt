What is Franco Jeffrey thinking? Was the Hollywood responsible for this journey, or could I get the idea that anyone who did not speak English as the first language only missed the classic point of Charlotte BrontÃ«? I do not think that I can improve on a comment below, so I'll just imitate it: "Jane Eyre is a great great book, the painting must be read somewhat." It is true that two aspects of this movie were sadly wrong. But the actor expressed regret, because all the best scenes left out of the screenplay. You'll go and share a meeting with Rochester conversation and a fun ... which has been deleted from the script. Marriage proposal, fate Taylor ... has gone. Emotion, half-trick, half-heartedly felt, like an elite sprite of old England, was reluctant to rescue Rochester for his frustrations .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jane's interaction with the end of the novel and the river. But it is unable to remove that love from one of the best love stories ever written in surgery. Please <br /> <br /> for yourself and find out the 1983 (?) mini series Timothy Dalton.
