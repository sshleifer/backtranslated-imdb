The directors are very respectable for these films, but the history of his productions made me aware that it will not get much more than the core of other filmmakers. Her 30-day TV series is kept in mind but her MTV product counting as "I'll walk you", she opposes her seriousness in any documented document, and instead calls her "frustrated production", "recommend me" I did not have high expectations Do Sorry this movie is less than enough to disappoint me. After a while "ask me" as I myself asked exactly the point of all this. The main statement becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the playtime, rather dull stuff, and again this repeat stuff that has already been shown in this way or in another film, so it is wear and becomes very annoying. The end
