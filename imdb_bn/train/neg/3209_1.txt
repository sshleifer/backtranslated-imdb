I saw the unusually bad piece of "Anime" at the London Saawai Festival. If you are looking at this thing, after several beers, do it with a big audience, then you can enjoy something from it. <br /> <br /> I was happy to be in the dialogue, it was the role of the crematorium in my mind. Animation horror. It is badly designed and badly executed. It was a good idea for at least one person who did not have a color blind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say, this movie is a failure at every stage.
