I'm not yet convinced that it will replace Aaconda as "the worst movie I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore strange pronunciation, low production value and extraordinary camera work, this movie is not going anyway. I just went to see it for reading the book and they wanted to see how complex plots would work for 2 hours in the film. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - did they? Characters explain with something slightly as they go forward to play any valuable part in those and then details. Even some of the main characters, some of whom do not have any other than anyone of them, as the film reaches its end, you have no difference with anything in them. <br /> <br /> I would have to write again to rewrite these books, and it is probably unfair to prosecute the movie against the film that it was received from. But after my friends and I came out of the movie, most of the trip to the house was spent to explain what had happened. <br /> <br /> They can even change the true meaning of "Rhodes Aluminum" book. Put another piece of voice on it, so that the movie can get a great title. <br /> <br /> The real mess of a movie begins to end.
