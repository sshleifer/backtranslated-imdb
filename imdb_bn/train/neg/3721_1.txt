Two movies are beneficial for people to fear God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and abusive message, one can get one religious film as one-dimensional. Very bad Paul Anderson went on to live in the house of the cursed Evil, he was really going to something. <br /> <br /> The thief is interrupted by the qualities of very independent independent films (acting, story, conversation, and prompting) and it is clear that the film's intentions are from the beginning. Christian film industry has not learned from this failure, so we are stuck with omega codes, left-free, and other teen movies. Their intrinsic elements are so much concerned with selling their messages: "Reserved, get people!" That's another whacking the audience on the head with another Bible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not believe I'm writing this very effective even about a movie. Leave it completely and go back to Sam's blue out of Paul's eyes. 1 out of 5
