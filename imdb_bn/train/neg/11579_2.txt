I have to admit, I do not think much about characters or stories, even though I was not sure that it was the one, I was very annoyed to see this movie that it was a difficult time for me. How do you call a movie "Tulsa Key" and then can you film it in Texas? The plain desert country around Arlington (I think it was the location) is not in any way like a green rocking mountain around the palm, and there will be many bad places to live in a snowy celebrity. Clearly, no person in this movie has ever lived. Tulsus or else they realized that there was nothing similar in the movie. At least not anyone seen Ramphilis or outsider? I know this sounds picky but I can not help it. I saw this because I love James Spadar and I usually think Eric Statz is interesting. But these two curious actors could not even express this anger, and the story of self-involved people in Tulsa! I'm sorry, the Oklahoma film can not be more expensive. What was "LA Live in die" when shot in Toronto? Will that suck? Well this works so well.
