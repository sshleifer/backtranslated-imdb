Cafe Lumiere Imagine a beautiful photograph Unknowing about the director's work, I am well-known with the filmmaker, he thinks - Ozu is respecting Yasujero. Even when reaching the height of glory, we did not tell anything about the depth of the ozu's depth and density on the density. One of the things to look at the character of the ozur is that he is not even "presented" by his lead character ("perfect blank page"). His man has no medium or close shot. One of the DVD extras provides interviews with actors and does not give way - a good look in their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a big Spanish movie where Nandaka Pass is called NADA, which translates something like "sometimes happened". That this timeless exercise will be a much better title. Through the film we introduced a vague Taiwan musician, because of which we hear soundtraces. But sources like everything have added nothing. If you are not a trainer, there is nothing to suggest this movie.
