I really did not expect much from "The Night Listener" and I never really heard of VideoOstore's cover. However, the film is very effective when suspending and creating excitement. It drags a little on occasion, but it helps to keep an eye on what's actually going to happen and keep you more importantly: when. After the film's progress, the character directed by Robin Williams dragged it to a little "cat and mouse", where the existence of the 14-year-old minor child's authenticity and existence could not be found. Never seen a person. An interesting story from The Night Class, which is great for creating suspense throughout the movie, and you lie and really put it in the dark. However, at the end it is frustrating and it can not live up to potential feasibility. It did not give you a detailed or probable explanation about another major character, which was helpful and interesting.
