Plots do not offer any new excitement, it starts like the cube. There is no other improvement for cottage equipment at this time, except for extra departures it is not safe. Characters like the first episode are not well described, they only become "flat" as a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone makes it a normal departure, then he will be asked a few questions such as "Do you believe in God?", it's not actually creative or original, and especially in my opinion it is a deep mystery Fit into There really is nothing else to say about it.
