Forest Ranger and scientists go into the wood to find a group fossils. They are finally on the ground in a Bigfoot graveyard (it does not notice in the dark), CGI Bigfoot scenes are horrific, but they are rarely talking about annoyance than the persistent scenes. I used to think that only a good bigfoot movie can be made. But now after a lot of sad sadness about the legend, I have serious doubts. Sucking the wounds to see this movie, a handsome girl just does not nude once. And this may not be "bogie crack 2" (better than any average achievement), it is still tragic that Bigfoot's best non-documentary film "Harry and Henrikson" <br /> <br /> My grade: D
