Some funny comedies, some flat, some decent acting, something that is quite nasty. This movie only guarantees the hit and miss, more than 12 years of fun, than any other addiction. <br /> <br /> The child actors of the movie are simply weird. If you are making a family comedy, that tend to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo has grown up on a fun theme, and I mean, the human performance in this medieval period.
