Villa Raides (1968) was a big disappointment! And along with Robert Town, Sap Pacinpah has a hand in Scrapple, but it still appears as a written written film by the great Buzz Coolic. Firstly, the top build Yule Brenner is wrong for the part as the Pancha Villa! He is not enough to play great Mexican revolutionary! There is a lack of fire in his note performance and Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Rowland can play the role. Brenner has just looked like a Russian nobleman who is dressed like a Mexican band, who is in the middle of the Mexican Revolution instead of the Russians. Also, the second build Robert Mitcheon was completely destroyed in the film! Because of the revolution, its part is a poorly written minor role that can be played by a small star as a bioplane flying body from air to air. Mitch did not get a decent line in the whole film, and was better than his other Mexican revolutionary film "Bandido" (1956), which unfortunately did not show any interest in the release of the DVD. In addition to any type of style, "villa rides" is suffering from a woman starring badly! Statlet Grazia Bucela is a young Mexican girl who has made Mitmukh look happy but her cast is simply uninterrupted. Someone like Claudia Cardinal or Jean Peters might have added some bad additions to the wrong line. There are some good action scenes in the movie but there are some good steps to do in the making of the movie, and not less than the quality of the perfect pantheistic photo, and the theme of the repetitive Maurice Jaror does not help the subject. <br /> <br /> Like Paramount does not want to have trailer! Yup, a frustrating movie and DVD presentation which may have been complete and much better.
