Mary and Rodeo's history is so little? Women divorced with unpleasant girls. And why are the main shows and characters very little reference? The girl characters were stupid and reluctant. Why can not they like women who like their mother on TV? Mary will leave Minneapolis, and Roda will return to New York, but why Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens can not be a guest star? It seems a kind way to feel just such wonderful characters. It was certainly good to see Mary and Rod together, but it could be better, much better. Well, Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dike Show has been runiyan, hopefully Marie will do better during the rehearsing of the ground on the grounds of Stamping.
