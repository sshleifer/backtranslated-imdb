How well Kargil was locked in the fight could be a very well-crafted film; Its location, budget, and efficiency were "Savings Private Secrets" or "Black Hawk Down" in India. Instead of trying to run the war with Masala movie coming across it as a bloated, 4 hour bora. Even war scenes use the same mountain of all their battle scenes, and spend unnecessary time in casual talk. Instead of appealing to the Indian people, there was a book account about spending time in a good movie Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even at militant point (like "you, you, you"). Even better, it can use appropriate director like Ram Gopal Varma, to write, manage and edit the film directly. Then, I want to re-edit this movie, only relevant sections are included; It will make the movie more watchable.
