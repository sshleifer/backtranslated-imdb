So you might read some comments posted in this picture and you can think of yourself, "Hugh, there was a bunch of reviews posted on the 30th December." The interesting thing is that these are mostly coming from the same person, or reviewing the word like a small, rich group comprising the "Open House" group. True, my friends, this picture is really unwanted. Just does not mean it is "free" because it gets a free pass. If you are going to create musical instruments, whether on Broadway or local community playhouse, make sure your (A) actors can sing, (b) your actors can dance, (c) you have appropriate sound equipment, (d) You have a well-written score and (E.) you have words that are diverse and charming. Anthony rap can not even save this one. It's one of the unfortunate movie experiences that I'm really embarrassed for everyone involved.
