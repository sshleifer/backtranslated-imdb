I saw some terrible horror movies in my time, and when it's not the worst of the bunch, it must definitely be in the lower half. The script starts right off. A young doctor has gone to a hospital hospital, it is expected that he and his future wife will be misplaced for a better work. how beautiful? The film will go straight to the toilet when you realize that killing some patients. Activating people's souls have a demon on the basement that is harvesting. Under the hospital staff, 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 safety guard work to bring this mental patient down, perform a program that can mostly spend the tongue, and then the ghoully house horse comes out of a giant and through a pinch of special effects magic Stole his soul. At this point the movie became so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to end. There was still one hour to go. It seemed like a half-hour "Tales from the Crypt" episode that one was expanded in one hour and half chip-fest. Tony Lester has been referring to his best John Kofi (The Green Mile), the Tracy Skognes's incognito, frozen nurses ratchet, which fails at every possible level. I just gave this 2 stars for two reasons. 1) His dad is quite hot, he made a little pain easy at the end and 2) the movie is really fine, the film is made of quality with the quality of the camera is much better than the current trends of the horror films. Finally, blockbuster movie passes (which I do, and I still feel cheated), but avoid this annoyance. As a bonus water game, you and your friends will take a shot every time when Matt Stacy (Dr. James Bishop) holds the head while talking. You will be drunk 15 minutes in the movie.
