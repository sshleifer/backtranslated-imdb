I got this DVD from a friend, got it from someone else (and probably that continues ..) Even the DVD cover looks cheap, as the whole movie. Gossips and mobile phones have been struggling with delayed sound effects, I saw the worst actor in my life, this is a very simple plot, it smashes my stomach! With very little financial resources, I must admit it to be pretty professional. Similar to a movie, 13 people did not wait for gangsta flick for a dozen of them. So: If you're tired and want a cheaper laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it to the window.
