Who is this "star" - actor? Movie Maker? Of course, this is the most air-puffed production in existence. What kind of movie does it seem to have a lot of fun ?? Nobody does a lot of fun by making fun, and it often makes for a movie that does not have any fun to see. <br /> <br /> Rotter don's glasses so that the status of its character is Bogdanovich's mysterious Dopgelgana; The scenes with the wonderful Miss Stratan are sweet, but a shameful, look-boys-I-dating-the-queen-queen think them. Ben Gazza makes unsuccessful attempts to brighten his natural cat-cannabis-canary greens to a small plot, which is necessary for him to follow Audrey Hepburn with all the interests of a narcotics in the irregularities clinic. Meanwhile, the budding couple of their children (Nepotism alert: the daughter of Bogdanovich) is very smart and while observing their parents, pick some roughly annoying pointer on 'love'. (Mrs. Hepburn, who draws her dignity, leads to proceedings) - but she has the ultimate challenge to her own care.) Everyone looks great, but what? This is a movie and we can expect a lot of it, if you are looking for it, you will be better off to choose a copy of the valve. Hey - And it needs to be mentioned that Colin Shibir is totally disturbed, even without singing, which is capable, completely disrespectful ... Country and Western numbers match the soundtrack values ​​conflictlessly. Of course, it does not seem that Gershwin (the song that has been written in the movie title); His stage music of 20 might be slightly, but at least they were long on the charm. "They all laugh" tries to coast along the coast of its good intentions, but at least none of Peter Bogdanovic - does not give a good idea of ​​breaking into breaks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dorothy Straten, There is a special place in the heart of Bogdanovich - even it buys it from its producers, then it delivers it on itself and if it is not popular then it becomes bankrupt. Her rise and fall is a more sympathetic and tragic story about Hollywood stories, so there is no joy to criticize the film ... Realistic investment in Miss Straaten's view But "Legged" followed a great echo of "The Last Picture Show", "Pepper Moon" or "Watches Up, Doc" - following "Daisy Miller" and "At Long Last Profit", it was a serious assurance of the stage. The PB never appeared. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is ruthless, the waste of the rental only. If I want to see people in a good time, I will go to the park on a sunny day. For publishing films of joy and love, I will stave off Ernest Lübitz and Jakes Demi ...
