A wife (who once acted under the supervision of Mary Allen Trainer, under the control of Robert Jamkes, who conducted this episode), who killed her husband with a poker, is the result of the perfect murder that is unfortunate outside body as a visitor ... .. Santa Claus suite in Santa Claus escaped from the crazy (a terrible horror by Larry Drake Control). While trying to find ways to hide her husband's body, she waits for her life. Once she leaves the killer killer, who decides to use an ax to miss a number of opportunities to cut a woman's head to rob a murderer to kill her husband. Santa's killer locks him in a closet and follows the girl's daughter, because she tries to frustrate herself to save her child. <br /> <br /> This episode of Tiles from CRYPT uses the old "Santa Kills" theme (add coconut) to the female-murder-husband-husband-for-man-with-routing-routine. It essentially tries to try to find a way to catch training with a dead body, while maintaining a safe distance from one patient. There are not many refreshing or new things about this plot, which are mostly driven by speed. The highlight of the show is not the same.
