And something more "no" on it. Bhoodu Academy, without any doubt, the biggest aspiring film of all time. Is it trying to fix? Tell a story Of course not; As it has been specified, it's mostly just barely legal junkies themselves. So, can it be an attempt to crush homeostoroticism? Well, maybe not for the truth, unless it sometimes does not exceed the most innocent and nonthreatening form of male contact. (No one is happy, almost eight times and again.) Well, it's like a horror movie. Is it trying to frighten us? <br /> <br /> Never, in my life, there is no movie in my life, because of its tidium and its "work" with the emptiness of the director. This is the most annoying and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. Bhoodu Academy accepts horror, zombie and gay film styles, puts it in a grinder, then drives them through a coffee filter - it is simply a coffee filter filter that is like a coffee filter filter, everything that is important, elegant, or interesting in any way. As a result, the 74-minute film makes every glass as hot-glass-stimulating - after only 10 days of gene bing, you will not only be able to see this hatred of humanity's efforts, but with the ability to reassure you.
