Crater Lake MÃ¼nster is easily one of the most horrific, amateur movies I've ever seen - Mansos, poor acting, vain direction, and kindergarten-level production values, in the hands of the fate, the ranking in the right place. After filming of a lake in Belbbaw, CA, and after starting dining in local food, a continuous clay / stop-motion animated dinosaur awakens in a movie. In the thrilling measure, a local has described that the animal is described as "a giant brain with Flipers", it throws its pedantic bulk on the ground before eating it, that it hit a bulldozer several times and it dies. . This moovie is a complete moron for each character. An unobtrusive sub-plot shows a hick to drop 4.75 into a liquor store to buy Ripoll; Instead of buying the bottle, instead of buying a stupid cash and other deviations, one shot a policeman, he moves towards the lake, so that he eats by the giant. Unrealistic close ups of the monster do not say anything more than a piece of staphofhem. A fake wizard who struggled with a dirty British accent (considered him more legit), rented two exaggerated-ridiculous REDNEC boats, some hungry "pre-historic cave art" crayons, and boring-baked-pixin background magazines. In a painful scene, the fake magician and his doping wife / girlfriend / associate directs the film to operate the pad for an additional 4 minutes, how they see them in the night sky, even though it is clearly up till the time of the day. Even constant forward fast, this moovie hurts, and bad pain. Muko says, call the Fumigutter, because this cow is really frustrating! : = 8P
