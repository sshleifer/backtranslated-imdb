I probably told some of Steven King's books to read, it was based on this film. After reading this wonderful work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing in this film with the book is the title and character name. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is kept in a game show. The main object is to survive. But he does not have a discipline. He has entered the city and will run away from the game show (I think you will call them), who do not completely match the character of the film. This trunk built many tension and suspension and ended widely with the measurements. The movie was absolutely rubbish. It was no cinematic quality. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he agrees with this.
