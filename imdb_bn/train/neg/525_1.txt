I looked at another comment and found out clearly that only those movies who actually worked in the movies commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you want to make a bad movie and comment on it, do it a bit less. A little more on "groundbreaking" It is a Boston-based college production which does not even achieve the level of amateur college movies. What would you expect from a bunch of kids? Without a lot of creativity, a stupid action film. It is quite funny if you wish to poke it fun. You will never see until Emerson College is a student.
