In most cases, this film looks like a "made-TV" effort. The side is ham-fished, acting (without Fred Guin) too fat and soap. Dennis Crosby, in particular, his line as he delivered their cold off a cou card. Only one thing makes this movie valuable, and once the gauge is returned from "seminary". There is some bit annoying about killing a small child and this movie can only handle something for that reason. It is absolutely bone-cool. This movie just fixes one thing, but it hits a thing just outside the park. Just the last 10 minutes or so valuable to see.
