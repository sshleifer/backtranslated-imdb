I watched this movie on March 21 this year. Say frustration. But better than "Tridev". Plot Hackneynid News about the morning with his father, wife and his younger brother. When he rescues the bride, the film opens. However, Zuhrhad planned to kill his younger brother. He sent a few people to make a plan. They come to a school school, who are friends of morning friends. Kill this child. His father got him out of the house. Then came back later and he and the cake went out to find him. Sunni gave a good performance, the risk was very annoying, Nasirudun was destroyed. Goddess did a good job, Sonam was suffering, the wish was lost but she looked beautiful. The child played with Sunni brother. The movie was beautiful. Sadly, he had to kill his character. She was beautiful but was boring. The other boy did well. Salt did a good job. Kiran was enough. Amir and Gulshan did a good job. Painting is both excellent and Kenya. The script is weak but there are some good dialogues. Also drag Movie The music was right. I like the song "Seven Sekhandar" which was a song like this. Other songs were forgotten. Do not see this. Ratings -3 / 10
