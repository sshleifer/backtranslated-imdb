After watching this thing, after reading the summary behind the DVD, thinking back to the actual movie .... I was a little upset. I thought, I had slept and dreamed that I would sometimes waltz the downstream down syndrome baby, where people drive 11 miles a day and occasionally do not stop at any time for infinite casual lesbianism. Where do (zombies?) Come from somewhere and (vampires?) Who (the seduction?) Are the pure heart to save the world of citizens in their way. Neither zombie nor vampire significantly face each other. The only battle I think is that Waller Bonnie is locking the girocco's children's pants. Koi ko cat fat! All of them It was probably because we were expanding the widescreen and it was too lazy to change its local resolution, but it actually made more entertainment ... The idea behind me was the continuation of the thesis, the plot, the development of the character, the opposition, the subject matter , And then played the completeity of this film. It saw Cadizen F *** INKEA in Bloodland
