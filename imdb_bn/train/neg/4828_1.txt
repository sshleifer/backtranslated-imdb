I've scanned the train scan from the library and brought it home. We have previously considered taking a trip and will give a feeling of what it was like to us. The film was a waste of time all the time, if I went to buy it, then I would call it a trash scam when it spent $ 49. <br /> <br /> DVD ran a roller coaster ride for 8 minutes running. My stomach felt across Canada and they roamed around with curves in high speed. <br /> <br /> Many footage was probably shot in them and you might think that they could have made a good product. If I had completed this project then I would supply more footage, people in the street signs knew where they were and stayed in places to watch the scenery. It should be 60 to 90 minutes to make a film like this. Oh yes, because the case was in Stereo, the whole film was a good word from the word of speed up sound, at least it could keep some music in it. <br /> <br /> <br /> This curiosity is made by Buster Keton, actor / National Film Board of Canada's Buster Keaton (one of the latest films he made) Who took to the railway trackpeter of Nova Scotia and traveled to British Columbia.
