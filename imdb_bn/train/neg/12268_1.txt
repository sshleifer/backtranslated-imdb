I saw almost four Japanese horror films and they were not very impressive. However, I realized that the path was a sharp script operated. <br /> <br /> There is no way, no way here. It is a detective who is trying to tie the murder similar to the incident happening. After finding suspected suspects, the suspects are frustrated, because they are watching a ghost. Then, following the ghost spellings, for a reason that is never released and takes more than half of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no The film keeps changing the viewpoint of different characters, whose stories do not have much. I've seen this before other movies where it shows a different perspective. There is no case here. <br /> <br /> Also, what is happening on the screen is really endorsing fast. For example, there are some scenes that are made with a little machine scope and ... and then it goes to another scene. I am aware that it could have a dramatic effect. That's definitely not intended here. It's just bad edit. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are "ghosts" who just scream in a way that is not terribly strange or funny. It's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the fears have been done in a good way so that you can see them all. Then one of them, the movie is over. At that time, a wave of confusion spread over the audience because I realized that we all felt that we had lost our time. Someone knocked and ensued smile. It was better than the whole film. Simply put, AVOID.
