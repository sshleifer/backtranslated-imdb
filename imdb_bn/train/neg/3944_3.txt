The movie My Name Is Modeti is a part of the episode that takes place in the 10th gentle Blaise novel "Night of the Morningstar". It describes an incident, in which young Modesi (17 of the Middle East books in the film) claim his leadership in a casino battle. It is not set in the faithful side of the Willie Gervine film that was set before the actual Blace event. The relationship between Blaze and Gervain was, of course, one of the striking aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. Another problem is that the film is simply incredibly annoying because it really is a small screen that has appeared on a screenplay. Casting is fine, but Alexander Staden is really playing as a young sailor and playing the role of playing young Momterti is really old. I think this photo was a quick and messy solution because of not being able to lose Blay's franchise.
