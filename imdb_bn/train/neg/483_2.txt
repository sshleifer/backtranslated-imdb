I do not think French could make a bad movie, but I was clearly very wrong. As has been said earlier, this film originally used the title character as a point of departure; His life and the person has nothing or nothing with his screenplay the real Artemisia Gentiles Gentiles. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> . Along with some fairly modest design sets, Valentina Sarveer's physical character is the primary asset of this film, and from the beginning it was clear that filmmakers were also aware of it; They do not waste time in integrating different "erotic" sequences, which can do more with the title than the plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal to show a beautiful teen in a state of shocking sexual tension can not survive or otherwise. The acting is ineffective, and the score is very generic despite an interesting word or two. The cinematography is fine and there are some nice colors, but in the 1960s, there is some pretty ridiculous sequence of distorted-lens effects for the distorted film by a more appropriate use of a clothing drama. In any case, the script releases the camera very often on Artemisia's body, and rarely on its painting. <br /> <br /> Everyone says, almost complete failure. It is not intelligent enough to be an intelligent film, and it is too slow and motivated to work like soft-core pornography. So the French may fail!
