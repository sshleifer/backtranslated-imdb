I'm not sure that it was a language or poor performance, but everything seems to be about this movie and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> It's a big disappointment to see Dr Ontgang. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor, I could not believe that people could have such a potential that was very promising. <br /> <br /> And above all, in Germany everyone speaks English. Big mistake This is a specific word in German, especially Hitler sounds like Hitler when he is speaking German / shouting. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told believes that it was uncomfortable at the spot. The character was empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events. <br /> <br /> I have already seen Dr UnterGong, whether it is English, everything about this film was fake and ridiculous.
