What a hell !! Why is this movie made? These, and other "movies" of their competence, should be teaching tools not to make a film. Children may like it, but more than 10 years no one will accept it. To make matters even worse, the great talent such as Hugh Goldberg and Armin Muller Stahl have completely lost a non-fiction film.
