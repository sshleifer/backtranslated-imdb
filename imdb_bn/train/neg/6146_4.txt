I do not know how this movie escapes from the wrath of MSST 3. "Jimkata" is a ridiculous action movie, filling (or is it empty?) Paper thin plots, fools, and rare situations. But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor observers, but ignorant, movies, you will enjoy "jimkata". This is a great deal <br /> <br /> Work centers near a gymnast selected by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) became a spy. You see his father had another official agent who was absent from the game, which is called "games." So the gymnast (played gently by Kurt Thomas) train to know about the game and what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Do not promise? All right, so it's still not that Bayer Hons Plot Sipnapisis does not start describing the joy of this movie. They can be found in the strange story of the movie. The mysterious Asian girlfriend of the gymnast, who is not talking about the first half hour of the movie, then suddenly started talking and remained silent for the rest of the time! Or really difficult to shirtless bad guy who rules the existence of "play" when he pleases and likes to break. And of course, through the delightful thrill of our hero "Gradiz of the Craigs" (obviously the real name of that place!). Nice place to visit, but I do not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie is really burning is the action scene. As our drama was a gymnast, the director wisely thought of stopping the gymnastic equipment in the back alleys and city squares in the middle eastern cities, so that our zodiac masters were able to parallel their gymnastics skills parallel to deal with the intensity of evil. Bars and pummel horses It will be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> A note interesting thing. Many, I say half the cast, die from shooting with an arrow. Interesting because the arrow is the only credible effect or action of the whole film. If they really affected, my only theoretical arrow was a major note of appreciation for the losses. Possibly, it was the way to not pay extra. Even so, if you can not afford to pay it, but it is a great qualification and it is looking forward to a bit of auction, which is a simple goal for the referee. <br /> <br />
