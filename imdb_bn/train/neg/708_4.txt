The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate the depressing movie. Ri'Chard is great. She really kept a top authentic performance, and the girl playing her sister was really awesome and pretty. Actually, I was the Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Gallega She is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I am currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but before reading the book I was happy to see the movie. This is a little "real" for me. For the struggle of the slaves, I liked Lestat and Louis's malicious little quarrel. Artha Kitt was so awesome and what she did after her character was that the movie was destroyed for me; I could stand the rest of the show a little. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything) Sorry, but it's not just my show.
