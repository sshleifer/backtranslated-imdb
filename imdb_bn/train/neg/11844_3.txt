The 1920s-decade jazz, the 1920's dress, Charleston and the ultra-horrible yachts (for example, for all calculations) a boxer, would like to like this movie. But there are sad events that all have. The plot is inactive and obvious, mostly playing horror or running from a rare direction, and when the whole thing is not enough, the mirror and the smoke are printed. This is a nicely made bad movie.
