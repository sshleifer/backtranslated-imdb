I really love Christopher Ley, but it was not for his other performances ... and he was a better actor. <br /> <br /> The image does not live in its premises. It's not terrible, it's too much melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, good part here comes" good part never came. <br /> <br /> The evil people are not all believers. Other letters lacked depth. Perhaps if I were in the right mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fiction at the expense of this movie, but .... No ... it was not really worth trying. It was not really very good, it was not really bad, it was just medieval.
