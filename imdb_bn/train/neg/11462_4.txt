I usually prefer giant movies. Even if they are incredible and stupid. But it is so difficult and shameless when this film is difficult to choose and at the same time trying to take everyone seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This idea is somewhat real, but it is very difficult to become scary when I can not help when Archas is known to kill Great White Shark. Destroy a rage Shamoo stuff. Especially in a scene where some buildings explode the cause of the work of Orcca ... and when it explodes, the thing goes out of the water and I think I see a show in the sea by sea. Plus they indicate that they are going to happen even before they kill a lot of horrible moments. On top of that, Jads takes a few jabs. Like him, "hello, we are realistic and why we can bring good reasons for attacking Orca". <br /> <br /> Yes, you ignore your abusive **** Surely reasonable. But your movie was not a thing in Jaws. It's scary. Yes it is impossible. Yes it is somewhat insulting. But quite authentic, not realistic or not, a killer shark is not nearly as scary as a great White. And the weak efforts of developing and writing characters just hit more. Even Javanese revenge is scarier than this.
