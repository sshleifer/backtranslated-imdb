I read the comments of half a dozen other users on this board, and the views seem to have changed greatly. I would like to agree with the people getting this movie to be horrific. It hurts me for writing because I expected it to be great, or I would not be bothered to see the other day. I like the support of Indie Cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, so much more to tolerate this film. Those who went out, I thought after about three minutes, probably could not remember the $ 11.00 shelling, or it seemed that it was not going anywhere, faster, and improving. Perhaps they are more optimistic than me. They or they did not pay for the first place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Logan bothered. She is a klutz. He gay I have that right. The problem is that the movie's absence of the main character does not mean that the film itself should be boring! This kid is in bed like a tall London, re-establish what you have learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc .. No matter or no one goes anywhere. No one can even say something insightful or fun or funny. Perhaps most amazing that I did not feel the slightest sympathy for Logan. That's itself a major achievement. He did not grow, he did not change, he learned (there is no one to teach him anything), he did not do anything, and not the movie! The scene does not make a movie after the scene of the same scene. <br /> <br /> Additionally, the title does not understand in any sense. 1/10
