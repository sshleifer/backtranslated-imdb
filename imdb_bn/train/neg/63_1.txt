Holy chain It's the longest time I've seen the worst movie. All performance is fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of covers that about this and that's your film. Um ... Robert Duval's character is asking the commander and the same people over the same questions. This earns the same response over him. I'm sure this movie has reached six because people think they like it. Good performance with famous and well-known actors, but actual work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe it's a harmful reason since something looks like a new tile is steaming and nothing happened in this movie! Sack
