Definitely the worst movie I've seen ... Can anyone tell me where I laugh? An idea is not a single indication or shadow. Three leading actor epidemics, especially one (I think it is Aldo) who can not make a Sicilian accent from Sicily !!! Dracula's dream is not to say about insertion ... to make this "film" a little longer, another convenient stretch from the worst cabaret tradition. Masaroni and Lititzko could do what they could, but this so-called movie was really hard, it was very difficult to recover. I could have given it "0" / 10, but the minimum sign was 1/10 and so I had to evaluate it with a mark.
