It is impossible for me to regard this movie as neutral. I did not try, I do not think - but I'm sitting, and I pop into adult VHS, and I look at opening times ... and suddenly I'm five years old and care for me very carefully and I'm seeing it <br /> < I can see, this film is a combination of victory which is the child's merchandise-with the bad power of children in Moscow and unclear tendencies, which has a thin story and uncertain animation. But in my five year old, "Yeah! Care reers!" Every time I think about it. So - I would recommend only this film (carefully, reluctantly) for those who saw during their early youth and they would see it (like me) atheist General-X / Y-ers who deliberately are astonishingly bad / weird (a category which is this movie. .. explicitly involved) to find out. Those who are actually looking for an engaging movie or healthy recreation: may be kept looking for you.
