I only saw this movie because I was so much influenced by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT was a plot and had some desired characters and made sense. None of the bullfighters. <br /> <br /> I realized that it could not be any good, at last, there was always an acting role in the painful bad Michelle Forbes. <br /> <br /> Here's a poster film called. Incomprehensible Anyone else called it the worst movie. Both movies have given far too much credit. I'm happy to be free from the library, yet I still feel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "IMDb" must include "0" by voting "Rate this image", only one for such movies.
