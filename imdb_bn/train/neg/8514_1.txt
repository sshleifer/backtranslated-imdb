I give this movie a one, it's really a terrible movie. DVD soundtrack is so bad, it's actually my ear pain. But this aspect, in some way confused, really shows some fervor in the Italian society. I was not really so disappointed, but different incidents were very unusual. So for Kink quality, I'm one of it. Otherwise, video, photography, adult actors / actresses are simply acting as a real joke to love foreign movies. Roberto, the main character has full spectrum of emotions but is exaggerated at the point of being incredible. However, most of the film's children are 3/4 years old, and they reveal the real and the film's Italian life.
