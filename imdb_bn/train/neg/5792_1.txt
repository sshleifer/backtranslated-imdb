Another junk tv made for the piece! This is a shame of a war movie (I used the term very rarely in this movie!) I thought the Savaras career of the telephone hit the bottom of the rock while he made a voice on the Bermingham video which was shown on a regular basis on a half TV, but then I forgot that He was involved in it! I tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but the cable TV kicked in the memory and brought out my scream! <br /> <br /> I like the bit (smiling laugh!) in this picture, which claims to be Liverpool's scene from Polipul, but it is a shot of Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighteenth century. Even the creators tried to black them, even the JZZ (Yugoslavia geljnis, or the UGOSOLVA railway station) beside the locomotem, clearly show train training in the train. Why not just film in the UK, where the picture is set to the highest? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage, and celluloid waste!
