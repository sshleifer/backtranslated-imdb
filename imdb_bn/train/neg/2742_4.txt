I just stumble on surfing this film channel. My first reaction was, 'Oh God again!' To become frustrating today's day, this day has become violent and cruel. For some reason, though, I stayed and saw to the end. Maybe it was my belief in the actor, hopefully they'll give me something to enjoy. <br /> <br /> And of course, why and Helena can work. Also, the film progresses slightly better at the end and actually creates a point. <br /> <br /> Helen Bonaham Carter also surprised me with his character. An average aspect of knowing that he used to keep distance and sorrow. Then again he is looking for a soft side that is just love. Brong's character made me even more amazed ... it was a victory for the act, the film itself was not unique. See if you are an actor student ... If you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. It is a serious sin! Oh my, it was a little harder to feature it a couple jokes ... though for escapists.
