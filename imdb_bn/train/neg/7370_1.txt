I've seen a lot of Sigal films, and most of them are not cool or even not good, but these steamy pills reduce the bar for bad movies. <br /> <br /> plot: Not really sure. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are good guys and bad boys? It is difficult to say. The film is mostly used to complain about how many Sigal characters "Mashal" goes out in the dark room and in the dark room. <br /> <br /> Acting: Rash <br /> <br /> What was with the overwhelming voice voice dabbing, ,,,,,,! Did anyone find them less like Sigal? Cheech or Chong could have over the voice as well as had minimal entertainment. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, and totally stupid. Do not do it at all costs !!!!
