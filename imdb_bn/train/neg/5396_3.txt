If you can not see this movie to discuss Shakespeare's conversations, I have read the comments. This is true, unfortunately, because of all the stir-up dialogue, this wonderful game is included, cut, and replaced with songs. I read this game, and recently it was lucky enough to see the fate, it remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this movie seems to me that I can accept everything I like about it. The princess, though, what she had instructed to do was no doubt that she did not have any supporters, and all the girls lost their cleverness - even with intelligent cut, which did not strip women's dialogue in brief, but took the opinion out of the context Did - it was a little inadequate to hear the announcement of the princess; "We are intelligent girls to laugh at our lovers!", When the knock was not always at all. News releases across the film also blocked the flow and lifted many wonderful scenes, because they later showed information in the scenes and in modern phrases. Conclusion, a remarkable game, destroyed by an odd concept, and stupid cuts. Kenneth, what I usually love you What did you think
