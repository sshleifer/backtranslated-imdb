This epic length has been given to homosexuals to go with this wind, but instead it can be satisfied by a huge discipline of the empty episode that does not happen absolutely. The characters are one-dimensional and there is no story in the story (actually no stories), looking for each other and kissing. It's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposal, like almost any conversation, is completely destroyed in a movie without examining its characters' psychology and making no effort to achieve true emotional resonance. On top of it, it seems like an "art" film, using the worst homemade clich√©s in the movie Snobbery. But anyway, if someone can detect his healing disease, I guess it's okay.
