Yesterday in America and other countries was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) and I went to see Disney's full-featured film version of "Earth". I think, like the automakers, Disney is trying to get us to worry about this planet. Perhaps they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it warrants a particular unit with the word "nature". I know that my little girl loves Mikey Mouse, and who is I to give my personal feelings about a year old Disney? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible cinematography, this was a common Disney disappointment for me. Half-a-dozen Disney movie trailers with Disney Clich ("Life Circle", "Fall with Style"), over-theatrical music, recycled footage ("40% new footage" by Disney claiming) I started thinking that James Earl Jones is a bit annoying. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman started to wear thin every Warner Bros. description. I really think Disney has bought some BBC-style photography that works nicely, they think that if they crush some orchestral music and accredited sound-bites, they would sell themselves. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's passion? Showing the victims of the killing and killing of children? These scenes were half-dozen, with the bloodshed on the edge of their throat closure. I think Disney must recognize that animals live outside of life and death in a rich and interesting life that appeals to action-oriented young people who drag them into this picture by their parents. I also knew how Disney was very well left to understand how climate change was going to do with humans. Are they so afraid of denying minor minorities that they think it is still controversial? <br /> <br /> I recommend to rent Blue Planet DVDs in Netfix. Nature films At this time the British tried their best.
