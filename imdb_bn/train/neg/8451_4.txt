I must admit that I like the first half of the slippers. It looked good, acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and running. A superior Hollywood film. But ... no one has mentioned so far (in at least 20 comments), when it comes to court scenes and the Pat Pitt character followed a plan to rescue his two friends, who were accused of murder, I felt cheated. This movie humiliated my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning Breaker !! If these two boys were with him, why would they not say that during the investigation? Memorialism? If you are not a jury judge, would you believe? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but ultimately, the story is very weak, and this angers me This movie had great potential. 4/10
