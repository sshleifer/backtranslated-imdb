Well, I turned it as expected: Visual Overload but nothing else added to the original. The story changed roughly, compared to Flickr of 1968, but surprised me. Initially it sparked my interest, but finally it was astonishing that the new twist and turn (a) were clearly invented to present a product like Hollywood, and (b) the whole story made it impossible! The story of 1968 was very straightforward and did not include any time-storms or any bogies: It was right that when you came home after a long journey, some may change. For example, the earth may fall into the hands of apes. Like many 'old' films, this original element was mysterious (in hell, can anyone understand this word?). In this Burton movie, the whole thing has been tried to make an action movie, but what cost? Of course, the pictures are too much, and many times and money have been put into a full-fledged culture of appeal (even the ep-music!), But what's wrong? <br /> <br /> First, suspension is very difficult for disbelievers, because apps have a lot of Hollywood-human features. I particularly mention Aries and slaves. These features include mental skills such as animosity, miserliness, and excessive appearance of 'fine' emotions. It forgets that apes are apes, which is essential. <br /> <br /> Second, people's words. Of course, we can imagine that people can never speak, but Afsos spoke, and the man was very durable and imposed in the 1968 edition of AP / Human Role-Switching. It is essential for Charlton Hesson to survive the injury to the throat and his subsequent recovery is related to his uniqueness and his interest in Dr. Zirah. (So, there is no need to do anything like human rights activists or up-to-human love) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, they are talking about a great deal of ambiguity in advertising, but this is a necessary package in the new movie because Captain Davidson is known as Hollywood- Let's-the-world-and-a-good-ending-and-still-it-the-lounge-bar-for-non-cool-diet-coke character for everyone. O my God, will they ever learn? I was just a guy who lost it, from the beginning to the new! They needed heroes! And then the script writer goes to the logic: we need a man ... so why a person will be lost ... because he tries to save an apple from the electromagnetic storm ... impossible! But it is necessary because the viewer shows that he respected the apes! Because, in this modern and politically correct time, we can not make a genophobic ap-hatter on the 68-character screen of Churchton Haysten: Let's give them a bubble version! Fourth, okay, the original version of the original 1968 film "The Key to True Discovery" (he saw that his own mother ship had already crashed on the planet and their lab-apps improved their society, where Hesson discovered that, when he was away, the apes overtook the earth) is done nicely. Second, the battlefield comes as an anti climax. Because this movie is the first two planets of apps to add a plot to a plot. Nice try, but when you feel Davidson and you discover that he's lost forever the planet has just flown due to the uncertain battlefield. <br /> <br /> Fifth: last !!! For Chrissakes, who came up with?! (A) Davidson crushes the two in the footsteps of his escape, which seems to be an unstable object, when chips easily manage the land? Come on, who will believe? If the pods are really small space crafts (Davidson just flew to the destination at the end) and not only avoid the ships, in that case, they can manage safe landing at least once? And what about that end ???? I mean, it was clear in the original picture that everything happened on earth. But here: the whole movie takes place on the distant planet, and suddenly the same (there is a Thad statue) is the AP's culture of the world ??? How? How did the distant planetary missions become technologically before the Davidson mission was closed, during which time the storm was over and the world colonized? Why is thade worshiped? Fool stupid fool <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I liked Apollo Warren as his man, but maybe there was some loose wire on my head. Yet Team Roth Thread Roth (Wonderful!) And the family of Aire (former general, but I forgot his name) was. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1968 has been added / changed in the picture, but not the plot, at least not in this way. It was easy and clear and no additional explanation was needed. It was neatly tongue and carpet. Do not styling everything ...
