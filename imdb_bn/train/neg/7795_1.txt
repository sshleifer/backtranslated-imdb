First of all, I'm not really a fan of the film's "disgusting new eating habits", but I'm not a bad reactionary, so the neighbor in my next house said that he had the worst movies. This is So we started to see it. First and foremost - it's a camcorder sans trips recorded! The second skinny white doctor's voice is dubbed by a big black man! Third, the dialogue does not understand any meaning. Fourth, zombie scenes, though the quarrels of helpless and poor makeup and tomato paste have led me to the direction of the director (and my next neighbor) mental help. It's fun for 5 minutes but it gets old quick. It's quite amateur, it's like watching a bad WW High School video annually .... With Zombies. A note to anyone involved in this movie - I want 20 minutes of my life, before I sleep, before sleeping.
