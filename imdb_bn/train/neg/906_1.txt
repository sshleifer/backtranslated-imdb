Yes, this movie makes me feel terrible, when I realized that I paid for it and tried to see it for more than 1 hour of my life. The cold guy gives me the impression of being a psycho - junkie actor and girl I've seen the worst actress ever. If you appreciate your time from this moment, believe me, I understand that any film will have to earn money and some movies do not have money, but it is a fool plot and no reason to play bad. Whenever I deserve support I always support independent films, but such films give a bad name for such films. I'm still traumatized. I will not believe any wonderful cover anymore.
