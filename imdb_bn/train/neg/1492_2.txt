Last night I hired a batch of films from Blockbuster, and I saw this first (it was late on Saturday night, wanted a "horror movie fix") <br /> <br /> Wow, this was terrible, almost embarrassing. Stupid slasher type of story I really thought was the end of the movie like Scramble; The clichid provider is an amateur actor and it is difficult to believe that the vague dialogue is actually typed and a page has been closed; And Gore's scenes that have nothing to be excited (especially when this movie is in this weak script). <br /> <br /> But I always believe that 100% percent of any movie is not completely free. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> # 1 Bobby Phillips: Love this actress. She is the only actress to show an acting talent. The only reason I got the chance to renter because her name was in front cover. He has expressed his presence in this deviation with professionalism, although he is acting in such a Moroccan story, he seems disgraced. # 1 Unexpected Hilary: This movie which I can remember when there were theaters in the house from around the country and they included three movies as three movies, like three films, then with some scenes thriller film it finally Heinlandland creates the way. Unfortunately, in this direct-to-video age, viewers are so terrible because most of the viewers now have to tolerate these turkeys without being communicating with the violence of viewers and throwing staff at the screen. Which leads - <br /> <br /> Trying to play # 3 porn stars: In most cases, producers do not have to confuse them with objection to being inactive for sexual intercourse, but this trade off usually makes them progress a story That means some lines that are supposed to mean (i.e. "oh yes baby", or "hard!") And, proudly, they all provide the skills at fools while trying to do the job. If I used to think that this character was not an Irish mother, then I could have removed the finger Linne Allen from this group and he was actually trying to accent, which just smiled. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see a positive outlook in all the experiences, and this is what I call this Sisupul Lawyer "Evil Bread"
