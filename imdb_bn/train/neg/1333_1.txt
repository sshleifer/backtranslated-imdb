I was completely frustrated by this movie. I read some of the other reviews here and had very high expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that does not happen in the movie. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor, but here some critics would not believe us as well. I think he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I'll rate 6 of its performance in 10. Acting: 6 out of 10 points 10 out of 10 Script worst: 2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> I The movie has been deleted from my DVR in the 70 minute. In the movie. There is a lot better movie than this ...
