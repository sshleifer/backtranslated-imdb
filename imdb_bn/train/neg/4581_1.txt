New Age Religions / Philosophy Justifying the use of science is a compassionate effort. The two have nothing to do with each other, and most of what is said about quantum physics in this world is wrong. <br /> <br /> example? The reality that quantum theory supports in the beliefs of Eastern religions is an illusion. How? Well, in subatomic world, you can not predict a particle position at specific times. You can only make it weird at one place at one place. Also, observation events seem to affect events. Can pass through solid particle barriers. All these, far, right. But then they insist that this means that if you sincerely believe that you can walk through the wall then you can do it. This is the complete poppycock. Instead, the theory claims to be possible for you to walk on our level, walking through the wall, but it is only by chance and nothing to do with faith. You also have to walk through the wall permanently for the longest distance through the wall, yet it is in contrast to astronomers. <br /> <br /> how it misrepresent their example science. But more annoying details involving an unhappy photographer, Marley is played by Maitlan. It is so confusing that almost half of the pictures make it impossible. To do something with negative thinking, leading to addiction and self-hatred. Some may be true, but there is no relation with Quantum Physics. <br /> <br /> Plus, string theory is a new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of spoiling your time with this draw, I offer you a great series for NOVA for the Ebie Universty, PBS, which gives you a history of physics from Newton and Gravity and history of only 3 hours in Ed Wythe and M Theory. Quantum Mechanics If you want to know it without an immediate convenience fog, it has been well explained.
