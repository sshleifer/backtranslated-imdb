For the first time in the year, I felt the need to log into today's IMDB for reviewing this movie, because it was only worth seeing. When I read it, the plot seemed extraordinary, I was expecting a short mystery thriller, Clostropophic Phantom Hunt. Unfortunately, it gets watered down a lot of difficult, tedious love stories and so many narrow and tooth-gnashingly stupid "so-bad-movie-like-this-without-bad-movies" -which dials it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Main character No, actually, it's angering. And lazy <br /> <br /> - Related to: Cheap Thrills. A long parade "just time" moment. <br /> <br /> - The main character. Well, it seems that real people did not really enjoy the real people in real life, but instead earned all his knowledge in bad movies. Thus, its characters are boring, lonely second generation clich√©s. They are nothing but intrigues, placeholders, and little personality. They are "broken men and women who still love each other". Apart from 100,000 movies, it has never been seen before and it is not realistic or enjoyable. Think of a great two-dimensional Hollywood rental and you've got it. This movie does not have a character that is remote, fresh, attractive, or attractive. <br /> <br /> - Very bad, unclear resolution which is getting worse and absolutely unexpected. "Resolution" may be obscure here, because the film is a radioactive mess that is not going anywhere. Through that time, though, you do not care anymore. I forwarded the last third of the film, because it was so intolerable to watch. <br /> <br /> All right, it's Any feature of this movie feeding, it is buried under all ineligibility. Do not watch this Turkish.
