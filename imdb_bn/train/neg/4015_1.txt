A friend told me, "Like Debian Dallas" it was another classic. Somewhere close I think my main complaint is about the most irresistible lead actress in pornography. Even more terrible that he is on screen almost all the time. But in those days where I read it, there were some "artistic" value of indecency. I'm unable to find it though. If you are interested in pornography history in original, then it can be appreciated by pornography industry. I do not know if I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a gifted person. He even tried to allow Simon and Garfuckle to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.
