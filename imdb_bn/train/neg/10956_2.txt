I purchased this movie from GamieStep's Discount Movie Bin and the cover let me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is upset and they use the whole movie as ten different monkeys which are rarely seen. Not to mention they use a stunt double, those who make a great effort to make a little man in a monkey make a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director had committed suicide more than the murder of Chompnis with the movie after the movie. Warner Bros. The film has another less fare preview and he ended up due to the money in the studio. It does not help that he was not even infamous for that terrible work, he was not even known for making a pop-chute film. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie ever made?
