A movie is so mysterious that it is not so annoying with any real story, that it is annoying to present a specific end or perspective. These are such movies where the end or the aspect is first captured, and the story is only to be avoided. Because of this, we often talk about "the story of jumping through the hoops", trying to make progress in the forefront of a logical fashion. <br /> <br /> The story "Broadway over the comet" just jump through hoops, it's a three-ring circus. It's so ridiculous, so fantastic, so stupid that if you feel tired to speak loud on the screen, then you will spend much time with it. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this painting is Sesulf is a woman who chooses between family and profession. Because it is so confusing, so they will make people of opinion objectionable. So, in the end there is no point in the story, the theme has become irrelevant and often, even in poor screenplaces, the act does not save anything.
