I had a lot of problems with this photo. It has some basic information related to Quantum Mechanics which is fine. Although quantum physics has been for more than 50 years, the film presented this information in a great way that seems to be: "You're not just blowing it up!" Not really good. This world is no longer surprising. In any way, I was already familiar with the Quantum theory, and the wave equations that must be described by the particles, are not new. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie, however, is that these people use prejudice theory as a means of providing scientific basis for mysticism and spirituality. There is no serious problem with my mysticism and spirituality, but Quantum Mechanics has nothing to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. Interviewers for this movie start with the idea of ​​quantum theory and then jump by saying that by thinking that only you can change your subject, we need to think positively so that the world can have a positive effect. And to make our lives better. The logic is completely ridiculous, and the logic does not logically follow the Quantum theory. As every so-called "expert" interviewed for this movie, theoretically there are a number of physicists who will completely disagree. They will explicitly state that the unpredictable world of tribal world does not support mysterious concepts about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that people are going to see this movie and will eat it completely because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. The main intensity of the film is based on the total misinterpretation of Quantum Theory, and it is advisable as an attempt to justify the religion organized with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, "experts" said that the majority of the hypotheses made around the world have been proved false by the whole history, so the idea that we hold around the world is also false. is not it? That does not follow completely. And even if it does, I do not see how its logic helps. I mean, if his ideas are a common guess, I should guess that they also lie on the basis of their mistakes.
