My family and I have tested the underdog at night. And as bad as the underdog (my four-year-old likes it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar-worthy stuff. The only thing that can save this movie, if Evel has come to retreat to face this face to face the film itself. I would admit, the soundtrack was good. I was not sure that the movie was set in the 80's, but most of the music is coming from Europe? Who knows If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and see the pattern tested on your local TV station. Or if you are dead in this observation, people can enjoy it under the influence.
