From the package (which looked really bad and ugly) I stopped this movie from a friend (thankfully I bought it) "The final vampire awful" was printed. After watching this, I was thinking that marketing campaigns are probably more expensive than the film. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is followed by some vampires / zombies. <br /> <br /> The light, the sound and everything reminds me of the first attempt on the holiday - if the video is not bad ten years old VHS-system. I gave the movie 2 out of 10 and only the promotion-t-shirts looked kind of cool. I usually do not want to exclude film-students or splatter-films, but I've seen Branded and I've seen a $ 20 budget movie from students who are ten times more than this shit.
