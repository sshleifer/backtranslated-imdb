Ho-hum gun An inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands of deadly biological weapons. Undoubtedly antedote is working along with all of his son (Luke Larry). CIA agent Olivia de Abo and cats and mouse car cassettes and start a gun fight. Cast includes: Tom Conte, Hendrik Heis, and an elderly Roger Moore. Moore suddenly seems clear in one of his clear attempts to move through this mess. Perry fans will be accepted. Wrong for the role of de Abo, but look beautiful.
