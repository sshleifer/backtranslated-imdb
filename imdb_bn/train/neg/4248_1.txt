The film contained all the above mentioned friendships, laziness and thought. If you are going to make a movie about the vampire that has been already done thousands of times, then you will do better. I would say the first movie will not be cut. Some horrific / horror movies simply fail to "break some of the blemishes and leave it for fun because all the stories are just false". This was sad, no different, and like all horror movies, once you break that road you will not go back again. <br /> <br /> and end? How do heroes work the same way throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they can not get covered now and work at the end? The last very climate and spelling part 3 which I will never see. Terrible movie
