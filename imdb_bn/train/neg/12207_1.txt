I think when I like this movie. I was 12 years old, I had 64 of the comodos and loved playing Rambo on it. I was really thrilling when I really cheated to buy this movie. I put it in my VCR and started: This movie man is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says three words of the whole movie (ultimately without that terrible image), and the same expression on his face. And in the middle of that stupid love thing, it's just so amazing predictions. I just ended up moving the whole thing fast and went on to exchange movies for something else.
