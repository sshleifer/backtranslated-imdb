The movie starts with a playful scene, drinking three and making small talk in the bar. All of them are made of overwhelming stories. As the film is released, it appears that the most horrific story is true. However, the film is still not very interesting except in view of the scene on the scene and where the main secret information is released. This revelation only took place half a time in the film and it is clearly not seen. The rest of the time the director is lingering in a god abandoned in the Russian village full of unfortunate and kinky old ladies. Of course, this is a nice and somewhat frustrating picture, but their praise goes a long way, encourages the development of a potential plot or character. I saw this movie as another example of making shy or lazy films, instead of creating an interesting story, filmmakers leave the audience to find all the odds and ending through strange information and some nearly incomplete stories (case-point-meat trader stories). It has a stylish look on the surface, but there is nothing other than lacking talent in this particular case.
