I have seen that someone has already thought about similar analogy, which was like the first thing in mind after seeing this movie. They said that the ingredients were but there were no plots. In addition to the child's screen (which I could have felt or represented in nature rather than being more suggestively presented), I liked this movie to break half in a recipe. A list of elements, there is no instruction to combine them into a finished product. From the beginning, there is a lack of character development and story development ... Unfortunately, many times in this uninterrupted drill we are annoyed with plot bits and we think "Ah- okay ... finally we are going to learn more about why this scene is going on. .. or ... who is this character ... or maybe we are going to be grateful and appreciate this character ... or understand it and understand this interrelation of relationship Cut to be more involved ... etc. "But no such luck! On the contrary, I was tempted to stop it many times, but I stopped it. When the carrot was thrashed, only that mini-plot in W-mini-plot (and that badly presented) was just a ruse. Finally, why I am with it because I have nothing better than an iPhone, and they give 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It is not that the letters are not preferable to some degree, or you can not identify their humanity with them ... this could only be better with more efforts. I shot around Santa Cruz and wondered if it was some film film project. I hope I could review it better, but in truth it was a disappointing and frustrating vacation.
