I was very disappointed with New York and I saw the initial screening of this movie, with my friends and most of the whole audience. The film was not so bad that it was good; It was solitary as a snake-bite victim. Samulal came Jackson was exhausted wonderfully by most and snake effects were hair. This movie reminds me of some of Chasey Saifi's films except for the spectacular glasses or even the camps. It all wore, flat, and overtly looked formular. I'm actually saying that Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP can understand that it is a part of * and played with it, but how the film fails to start is a script that has no fear of suspicion. This is the worst kind of movie: It's fun.
