J. Generally speaking, when the great director / actor coordinates are discussed about Lee Thompson and Charles Branson's team. Probably because nine of them out of joint ventures really run gamut from good action entertainment to moderate. Unfortunately Kinjite: The forbidden thing falls into the next. <br /> <br /> It's tragic because the cannits could be a lot better. But for my life I did not understand why the lost Japanese girl needs to be born, a man got some cheap jolie because her wedding romance was over. It was probably good for another movie, but it did not have any purpose here. <br /> <br /> A straightforward police drama with Charles Branson, who saw a little more as his colleague, and his strong bias against the East. That part can also be used as a little explanation. But he and his patient partner Perry Lopez will have to cross whether a Japanese Japanese girl is going to find out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Jem Fern√°ndez is a stylish, murderer pump man and he and Brunson have some history. In fact, in the film's best scene, Branson gave him an expensive rolls watch and burned his car in the fire. <br /> <br /> <br /> One day Fernandez called Bronze and Lopez for the night. His Rolex Shack, he killed Wazir and killed everyone, but Bryan and Lopez. I really think that the small incident was followed by Fernandez's Vice Chancellor of a few rounds from LAPD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I was good though the whole picture was good. This is the latest movie of the Brainson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last director. She should have gone through something good
