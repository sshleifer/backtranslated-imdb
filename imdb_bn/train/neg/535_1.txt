Some comments from this audience are just ridiculous. Is not it painful to watch with your other important? I apologized to my lover for my boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It was very slow and very curious. <br /> <br /> Both of Red Grav, Venace and Natasha were inappropriate for this, especially Vanessa with this ridiculous, warm American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire's Dance was a similarly drunken and strange girl that she was in my so-called life. He still did not push himself in any way. Girl, find new ways to cry! <br /> <br /> Maril Strip was the only release part of this movie, he was on screen for five minutes and I swore to God, he got me out of the movie screen and woke me up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, I've been good to see him every time. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Ilin Atkins were great in their half view. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a good shot film, it was very nice, the settings were very attractive, I was providing relief for severe frustration. <br /> <br /> I do not know, when it's very nicely in our time, a film involving a Cast in "Best Actress" is very kind. This was definitely more than a few major editing errors and the main character (Ann) was a huge quarrel. I'm happy he died. But that's why I thought Lilla, Anne's friend, bad - mostly because these two ladies were good actors and I felt a little sympathetic. <br /> <br /> BAD Job, Movie Evening. You were not entertained and you were not even thought-provoking. I hope the book was good, so it did not waste much time for people. 3/10
