A great slasher movie - very bad it is not part of the producer and script. The essence of the fundamental plot - People with red-eyed fetish, such as the flute coma and their degree of success, call on their flat to go in only the dimensions to stop them. Just behind the scenes Katia Crowe considered the film as an advertisement and saw the movie cut the hack. Nothing flows, the redhead was lost at that time (it was not closed before?), And most of the time the camera came out and when he got up he started filming. I can not blame her that I had passed 2-3 times and again had to try again and try again to plot something. When you see the end, do not try to attach it with anything in the past - you will only get an anorexia. Time, effort, or God's forbidden value. One reason to get 2 instead of 1 is - Hacking is the release of the movie and the scariest version I've seen is the hacking opportunity for the smallest.
