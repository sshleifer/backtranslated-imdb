I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I peeped it. What really gets me makes it no sense and why its annoying. Richard Hugger became bound in the cable and Jarvis strangled when he started to put out with Richard's girl. Then Jarvis's friend Truddor played some stupid songs on his guitar. The next morning Richard's daughter talked with Jarvis and Troyby and then went back to Richard and still shows him while visiting her. Then they play some happy music and the film ends. What does that mean? Did they break up? And what he is saying is that two people (Troubie and Jarvis)? It's puzzling and poor to go. I can not stand that annoying movie and ideas are not. From the 90th edition of Lord of Flies, I saw it as the worst movie.
