It is a confused and unorganized mess of intermediate scenes of annoying dialogue and monologues. It's not terrible: you have to make a tremendous effort to try to get involved with him. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought the fasibindor would make it somewhat interesting so that it can tell why why Arion / Lvira end up killing themselves? , But instead, in each scene, some are trying to explain: "When he was a young man, it happened ..." and "he just returned from Casablanca and ordered to spend everything down ..." <br/> <br /> Soon in the movie, Irian / Elvira is talking to a friend prostitute in prostitution of a girl (Surely a Butcher Room is the best place for a nice little chat), and While telling him the story of Elvi's life, the fascinator shows after the murder of another cow. It is difficult to choose between focusing on annoying images or transvestite. Of course we came with a very forceful and vague symbol of "I've had a lot of trouble in my life and are going to die". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A former lover has to face, after performing very gay corrections with two homosexuals (such as taking essential steps to homosexuality) He recognized the LV. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (for example, the story of young young Evian), but everything in the film is lost due to the selfishness of the fascicidal.
