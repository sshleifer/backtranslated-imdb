The fourth "fiction" feature returned back to the year 1882. "The Legend Begins" in the small town "Perfection", which was then "Rejected, Nevada". After the story began, seventeen mines were killed by the deadly "Graboids". In the current "tramers" movie some characters have metaphors and literally both ancestors in the past. The most obvious Michael Gross (as a hiram gamma) ever returned. Unlike his descendants, Mr. Gross is disarmed with firearms; So, to shoot a few "darts dragons", he shot as gunner Billy Drago ("Black Hand" Kelly). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is in a west, with smaller versions of the original "Graboids" of the original film. This tomorrhoids "Dart Dragon" is not as close to as terrorists as their "Trimmers" (1990). As a result, in this film, the characters spend a great time on the ground, which did not happen in the original movie. And, citizens were so curious to give up the war so early, when Gross decided to move to the city temporarily. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roma (as Juan Pillilla) did not rally in the fight against people immediately without gross? Frustrating <br /> <br /> **** 4: The Legend Begins (2004) SS Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Rome, Billy Dragro
