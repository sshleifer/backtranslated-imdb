When it comes to horror movies, I'd rather stop suspending disbelief, ignore sub-paragraph production values ​​and ignore plot holes for good fear. This movie offers only no scares of the offer. It can not be enjoyed even as the camp. Bad conversations, bad acting, bad sides, killings were expected and poorly operated, music was boring, camera work was bad, even dress was bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were trying hard, but those who faced horrific, dialogue dialogues and obvious lack of direction. I suspect they got a rehearsal. It is embarrassing to see, and it is more annoying than the creation of "wonderful", it requires a lot of tolerance. This is one of the worst movies I've seen easily. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but it's so bad that I'm forced to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you see this film, then do not miss the "Making Off" -property The writer / director thinks that the woman was made a brave, bold step. (Saw.) She and Cast will spend half an hour deconstructing this movie as it is a new age "citizen Cain." It's like listening to a group of third-graders, behind their Christmas page scenes. They really think they've created some of the elements. It's sad, really ?? The only reason I give this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be preserved for true repression, such as "Manas: Hands of Fate" and "Space Rebellion." So "American Nightmare" is not a movie I've ever seen, but I want to say that it is nowhere to be somewhere fifty.
