Sorry to go against the stream, but I think this movie is unrealistic, annoying and very long way. I was tired of seeing C ena Rowndes himself with a long struggle and feeling the crisis he was facing. Maybe there are some movies in the movie or it represents an important step for the director, but if I wish for the pure entertainment pricing it will be omitted.
