The film should definitely be shot in one day, the scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointer, even the green light of the visible matches the actors !!! Intrigues and intricacies (including at least one thriller genre movie) in addition to even the slightest plot and lines. All that is needed to do with Poy in the film is a shallow and childhood system. The film is clay and no romance. If you want to see a fun B-movie with a relaxing evening with friends then it will go for it (like I did) but there is no way to take this photo seriously!
