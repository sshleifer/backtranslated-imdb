Let's just say that I reduced my distrust less than Hulgins than Spiderman. In other words, I believe that my problems are low, with Tobi McGuire Manchester's toughness, Elijah Wood can stay at home rather than throwing. I do not want to write precocity because I can not get precision, but being passionate, professional, British men are getting into scrap near death every weekend, well ... funny. And this is not the film. The idea of ​​war, war, is taken very seriously. The gravity of the disguise, with which the matter is treated, reveals respect, because it does not establish or resolve conflict. It seems that plots, there is a big hole to run the Guinness truck, which has been combined with the "fish outside the water" theme so that viewers can learn how a human can become as viewers can keep watch over the woods. . Football opponents make other youth delicious with deadly objects and they go as soon as possible. Character cartoons, especially Harvard Americans. Character development and story lines are telegraph across the audience across viewers. Unfortunately, the irrationality of the film can not ultimately reach its height, then you spent almost two hours of your life that you are never coming back. Instead of this crop, choose "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club", and frustrating. It does not waste time on an empty melodram, tired old "Yankee in the King of Arthur Court" or tears, the arrival of the arrival of the age *. They are just pure, dark, and fun fun; The way is supposed to be fierce.
