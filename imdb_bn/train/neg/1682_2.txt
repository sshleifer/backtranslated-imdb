Takashi Shimizu had a great opportunity to make a remix of his original movie Joo-on the Grood. Although I did not see that movie, still more imagination and originality than my own operated remake (or some other words, about the skills of Japanese gecko tropics). Perhaps the script was written in some way for war crimes, or I can assume accessibility for American viewers. What starts with something potential - going with Bill Pullman's sudden movement indicates something very bad - just goes into total brawl. And as a horror movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Afraid of Just how exactly some music time is when you know exactly when something is right. A black cat? Yes, why not just a ghost-boy like a cats like a cats can not be made, which is just scary for cats. Plot? Why the story can be called, without any match of its true flow, only shuffle between past and present (i.e. flashbacks are inserted and meant to be organic with whole contents, not them), or for that matter, care about someone in our cast. <br /> <br /> The time or character for those who are very close to what is happening to us or what they are saying, there is a little bit of care. The film's creation is fierce (i.e. 180 degree rule breaks many times and is not in a forgiving or misleading way) and is not seen even during intimidation. (Glamor is particularly frustrated, but Palman, who later saw her first scene, sadly miscast). Even when Shimizu tries for some average "wife" fear, such as when women are inside the office building and hatred is driven by the soul, it is still absurd. Just watch and ghost shots are backgrounds when he's going to lift that. Either you go with it, and if you have so much power, or you will laugh hysterically at the results. Count me later. <br /> <br /> I am not entirely sure where this project went - did it have to revisit the studio for Shimizu, or do not abandon enough of its viewpoint? Or maybe Raimi used to say something, and they made things more confusing and / or lazy than anyone else. Blame gives us lots of information that does not make sense or at least gives some frightening-fungus to chew us. It's a sad sequence cineplex trash.
