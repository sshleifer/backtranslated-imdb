After reaching the conversation about Charles Bukowski, a friend told me about John Font last summer. I did not know that Phantom was a favorite writer of Bukowski - the author of the same edge and comedians as a generation before. 'The Dust' was the first book to read the book and it was one of my favorite novels. The novel is a sad, dreadful young writer who described himself and the outside world as an extremely gifted, talented writer who had no idea about the real world experience. In the novel, the novel is a virgin, there is no idea of ​​winning the status of any woman, which she wants to write in the magazine. The story of his wicked relationship with Cemalar, how he was determined to be his first sexual experience with 'injured' fans, and how he did nothing at the end, but the story of failed attempts at love is frustrating and real, ending without any sensitive Hollywood. The adaptation of the movie has been true to the book for a while, but love becomes a cultural trap because of racism, illness and death. The heart of this story is true, that Bandini has become a blurred and comical mad and never had their love and never will be the real thing, none of them wants to find each other. This movie has found the true meaning of the story and it has been replaced by scolak. I can not believe a person who wrote Chinatown, can read this book and make a movie about it that seems to be wrong.
