Except Brady Diversity Hours, in a while I've seen several Halloween TVs. Video production attributes were not very bad, but overall appearance and feeling were unstistably the first of 80's. And Marie Omond looks like she has fought with Avon Lady. And the big time is lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> It was even more interesting to talk about African Pavilion at Alex Halli at World Showcase, which will open in 'almost a year'. <br /> <br /> This text was 17 years later and it is not yet opened (unless you count Disney's Anne Mal Kingdom). Finally, for all the flaws, it is still an attractive part of Disney History.
