A woman's nightmare burns her fear of burying the living. The cheating husband decides to take his death and sticks him in a coffin and puts him in the basement and uses his fear. Of course, Be-Horror movie Queen Becky Steven is transformed into terrible ghostly creatures. The only reason to see this amateur Junk Flickr is because Michael Berryman has two small scenes with a small camera and Delia Sheppard. And Brinke's bloody rampage is quite fun to see in the last twentieth century. For example, the special effect is that the head decaying decapitated is really awful. See also Better "Scalps" or "Alien Dead". Of course I do not expect the entertainment dedicated to Fred O'Neill, but the "fear of hunting" is very dull, very dull.
