Paulbier's disappointment and sometimes very annoying with the story of love, which does not partly work with the casting of Gwynth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire movie with a confusing look on his face and it is difficult to know what looks like in David Shimura. <br /> <br /> But occasionally the palanquin is quite funny, especially with church scenes and group scenes with a smile of his friends but that is basically it. See only the pablers for those scenes and the rest move forward. Trust me, you are not much missing.
