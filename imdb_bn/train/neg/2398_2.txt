I saw it as a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where Pappa", "AirPlay", because it has been mentioned in favor of the real theorem like comedies and theorem. Well, the wrong decision! <br /> <br /> It's not just funny, it makes you angry because it's not a weird, bad way, but a bad way. It's bad-bad. The script does not contain a funny line where you are trying to entertain your audience with humor. <br /> <br /> The speech bar of Adam Armin is probably the single annoying thing in this movie. Still, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from crushing throughout the film and there is no difficulty in looking at the camera. This amateur constant without curiosity fits nicely with continuity errors and bumbling along with stories - you can find one. Ed McMahon - I remember J Lenno, a late night talk show person, who has always refused to call herself an actor. Well, I've seen a few Leono films and compared to the Macmahan, Lawrence Olivier. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Good is good. He gave that a few lines. I'm not easily afraid by bad comedians, so I looked up and looking for quasi-jokes for every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has literally performed: He is in every scene starting 75 minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, not ready for a test. In this case, you have to be strict and the grade will be 'F'. (But please do not assume that I am a teacher, it is a politician and a child with respect to a career in child Masters.) <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a favorite Scroopy Horror / Sissy movie, have fun and juice to see "Bruce Campbell" with "Man with a Skying Brain". Or if you prefer modern high shallow SciFi Schlock Sunshine / Core Clock. Those who are equally funny, though unintentionally.
