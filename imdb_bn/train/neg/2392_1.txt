We actually saw the theater twice, because we could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we'll miss something ... No, what was missing from the beginning of absence. I went back to Robin's novel to see if I really went back to Robin's novel and I discovered that during the day I was funny and exciting, now it is much more isolated and unclear head junk. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film decided to fix the initial problem, and the rest of the train ran from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a happy thing. Some beautiful exotic photography gets steamrolled by the placement of random cameras in the internal shots. All actors seem to be at least uncomfortable - Andy Dickenson positively sees the season - except Rain Phoenix, who has impressed that she is too unaware to realize how terrible her performance is. Dialogue is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes do not create second-to-last feelings and connections between them are indefinite. And yet, the movie stumbles in the dark, making sure it's something deep saying. <br /> <br /> It's funny even the worst; It's simply annoying. Gass van Gent has made other great films that I encourage you to encourage, and I'm glad he was alive (and saw that this mess).
