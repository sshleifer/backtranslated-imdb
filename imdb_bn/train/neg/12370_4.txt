They should probably call this movie The Map because most of the whole stupid movie revolves around a map of the cemetery. Mention how much the same annoying shot on the map. Compared to the map, they show only the smallest shades of sweat that are constantly moving above the head of our main character. Of course, the creator of this picture showed us how incredible exciting events are happening at the grave graveyard at the grave. Now let's not show one of our death scenes? We hear a whole lot about how everyone listed on the map is dropping like torch but we will not see anything. Some were so intelligent to focus on my life so I was fairly generous with its rating, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. As long as you do not have deep estuaries with moisture or sweat, I suggest renting a good movie, as I spit in your grave or drink your blood.
