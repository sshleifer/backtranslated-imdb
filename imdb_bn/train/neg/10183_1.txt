This is a very terrible production. General compromise has always been that when Princess Margaret was spoiled and became extremist and emerged among the luxurious luxurious guests, she was a very nice young man. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress failed to get across that. It has also been found that the hair does not extend hair in the production budget - initially, Princess Margaret's hair was roaming around the neck of permanent birds and it seemed that she was dragged through the bush. Acting in the Dune of Edinburgh, actor Rory Bremner was prepared to follow his role of imitating Prince Charles and he was very sad. <br /> <br /> The production was a defective, clich√©, shameful shameful load. I think all the Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
