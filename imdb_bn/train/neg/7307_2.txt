This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is completely random and little or no knowledge of events. There is a signal that the illness is so sick that I could come down with a case of cabin fever (I am Sori). I describe it as a bug as it smughed a newspaper because it seems to be a different part of the mixing thing together. For example, Kevin Pancake loving Karate goats are curious to be on his own, then there are police which are a little weird and distorted, then addictive, then they attack some random people who need help explicitly. Then suddenly the main character appears to be sexually connected to his friend's girlfriend because he is stupid to go down a plane. Then, after some good old family racism followed a rabbit managed by Kevin's Karate Children. It is really very disgusting that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. If you do not like Eli Roth, there is no reason to enjoy this movie, even it does not make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word but it is only allowed to use it will be seen as the only word. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
