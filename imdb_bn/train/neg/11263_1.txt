For shame, shameful that a fine actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be thrown into this part of the annoying drill. The film was not just bad, but it was rather terrible and there was no quality of release. The plot, (there was one?) Takes place somewhere. Russians should kill fools or kill the game and the rest of the cast should be taken for their cruel performance and declared ineffective. I gave up about 3/4 paths and left it. A "1" terrible only because there is nothing. Do not waste your time in this time, you will not miss anything.
