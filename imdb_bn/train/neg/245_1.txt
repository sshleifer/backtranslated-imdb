Without a shadow of suspicion, the mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever produced, yet still maintains a nerve in my heart because of its special effects poverty and surprisingly horrible sound track (and see what you need to be honest) in the first 15 minutes Combine to create. <br /> <br /> The first scene of 'Space' is almost impossible as the cinematography, the empty dialogue of your eyes as a washing-up liquid bottle. Before working on whether you have gone crazy, the credit roll and the action fight with life. <br /> <br /> And stay away from the nasty plastic giant snorkel that terrorizes our heroes. At the same time get double bonus for the pair of original actor voice and at the same time doubled voice. Pure genius <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this type of thing is that I only saw a copy once, so it is unlikely that it will be very likely to meet yourself. Perhaps I only existed one copy. <br /> <br />
