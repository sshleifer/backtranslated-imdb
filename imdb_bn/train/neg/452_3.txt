I saw this movie for a project in love. Please try to think Nicholas Cage as his character, and then tell him to recite what he says. My life can not continue ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... my brother was close. Of course his fault. And since the happy ending is the beautiful man that mother's care undoubtedly saddles and lonely. There are not enough extensions to close, bad scripts, and miniature characters. Protect yourself, unless your good smile is up for you. The costumes were done appropriately, and the extra did a fantastic job. I'm sure it was a fun movie, but keep it more specific, I can not recommend any person of this movie because it is not an intellectual film. This is not a chick flush. This is not a rude romantic. And I can not show kids to follow gender and questions. All in all, just do a good flick.
