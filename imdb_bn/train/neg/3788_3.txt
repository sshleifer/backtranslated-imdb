There are a lot like here. The actors provide the first rate and the script well-drilled, good conversations for the in-house capturing of the preferred family. However, for that reason the truth is not true. We see Leo, who has clearly learned about HIV positive evaluation, has responded in a manner that is not in favor of a favorable environment, for which she finds herself. Besides, Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family were also working for them in the light of their love, this picture is a little surprised. Leo's brother Marcel is acting as a young actress, usually the rest of the cast is impressive. Unfortunately, the authors can not decide whether they wanted an effective, objectionable family or an intensive study of HIV-related effects on HIV-infected people - so this only indicates to both. This movie provides food for thought but it is more like the display than the provider.
