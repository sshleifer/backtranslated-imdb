The box office at the box office is so good because I must have Eddie Murphy. He is considered as his first movie from "Beverly Hills Cop" when he was warm. It has risen 2 million and it was R and it created an estimated 80 million and it was pig that it was not all popular. I was never like the big Eddie Murphy fan, so perhaps the other reason I do not care too much for it. This is one of Eddie as some sort of lost lost kids. He will find the terrible danger of the golden child or the earth. The plot is very bad, but it does not compare to special effects as it is as bad. I saw this offer done some things 70's done better than stuff, Ray Harryhausen is the best thing to do well. Nevertheless, due to Eddie, the main reason for watching a movie is that, unfortunately he is not very funny at this point and it seems foolish to keep him in the "riders of the hidden ark" type. I think they were expecting a fish from the water effect, but it does not work for me.
