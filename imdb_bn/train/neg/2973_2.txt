I have two big complaints about this photo. <br /> <br /> 1. That's in my local rented shop "Precision" section very clearly shelved a soft-core porn. (If I know what it was, I did not rent my time in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. There is nothing to do with the title movie. In this movie, no one does anything that is horrific or emotional, it brings together both. <br /> <br /> In fact, make those three big accusations: <br /> <br /> 3. For that reason I have seen the movie for a long time to discover the number two point in this list for some reason. Boy i'm sorry Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistakes. This movie is virtually worthless on each level.
