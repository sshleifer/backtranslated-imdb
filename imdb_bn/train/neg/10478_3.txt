I sincerely consider this movie as one of the poor efforts of the Dominican film industry. Although the first 30 minutes of the film is a little funny, then their role of society changes (Men usually work women and women generally do what they do) read the movie. Not boring and all fun. They allow a lot of things without explanation and the end of the movie is expected. Roberto Angel did not like the character of his character and his little playing. I hope to see the good work went to the movie theater but I went out really frustrated. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
