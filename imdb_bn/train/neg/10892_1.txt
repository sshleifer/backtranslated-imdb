This movie is awesome! I do not even know where to start, I'm stupid even I can not even describe this terrible. Blood is the first of all flourescent, and acting is unprecedented! The only good part was the biker chick which saved it. This movie was fantastic, I can not see it could get such a bad vote like 1. It seems that the students in high school have made it.
