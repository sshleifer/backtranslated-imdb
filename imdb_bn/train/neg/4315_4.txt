The only good thing about this year's event was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the program was very low, it was a bit annoying. I think it's a serious time for the show to find new directors and producers, it can actually bring something new. It is quite clear that they have tried to 'hip' the shot more and acted in Bionos and p. Presenting a division to DD and Prince this year, young people apply for the audience. Also Chris Rock's presenter tried to renew the program and was making efforts to make it more attractive. None of this really worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he was not really a good presenter. I really saw him as a man who just spoke in different departments now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, not everyone came to the stage, but in the middle of the theater The award was also handed over. It was a bit weird. <br /> <br /> However, I can not remember being pleased with the award winners. In the past two years, this event has always been rewarded completely, no film is completely rewarded. So does that mean it was a good year for movies with competitive competition? I do not think so. I think most movies will be widely forgotten in 20 years without the exception of "million dollar baby" and "the Passion of the Christ". Of course, I do not agree with every single award handed out this year, for example, Caleb Dissankel will win for the best cinematography, or not that I do not like Robert Richard's work, he really did some extraordinary work for most of Oliver Stone. But I really deserved the deschanel prize way more rewarding. I liked winning Jim Miller and Paul Rubel for best editing and John Debi for the best music. But oh well, academy awards certainly can not please everyone, I understand. People will always complain about the winner <br /> <br /> It was also interesting that most of the awardees were nominated and more annoying than the winners. Did the prince decide the names of nominees at one time? And was Shane Penn's humorous? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed" Iranans were the best presenters of the night. <br /> <br /> Overall, with a very forgotten show but beautiful winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
