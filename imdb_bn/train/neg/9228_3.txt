Siu incredibly slow, and I'm David Mamet fan. The film follows a young filmmaker, who is making a very barbarel-esque film. After that the movie started to beat me. Deep and deep? Not really. There is no end to the movie "Dragonfly" created in Siu. This is the large parallel peak, which lacks a last (my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to catch this picture on the SaxSW movie festival. I had high hopes that you saw Yu Tuma Mama Tambian and a number of great films. I was waiting for Jason Schwartman's performance. But it was not a simple film. If you are not 60-sci-fi or slow movies, then it will not go anywhere, avoid it. <br /> <br /> Syu looks like a student film. If you recently wanted the Sky-Fi-Esc Indie film for Danny Darko, it will not let you sleep.
