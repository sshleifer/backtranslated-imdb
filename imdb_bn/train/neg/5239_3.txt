I have seen this picture which I saw here based on very favorable reviews of others. <br /> <br /> They certainly have seen something on this movie that I have not seen, it is sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well and its first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, but it does not seem quite incredible, it starts logging in and drags. <br /> <br /> Finally you will find out <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Purchase a bottle of wine. A robbery and a new store, Clark, Auguste Rose, was killed during robbery. <br /> <br /> When Jamon came to the ambulance, he went to the hospital with him. It seems a little more, but wait, there are more. <br /> <br /> The public became completely dark with Rojo. <br /> <br /> The reasons that do not make any sense, because John, a very good life, beautiful, loving girlfriend, safe, good salary, beautiful house, beautiful car, expensive case - he was disappointed like Aggi Rose. Want to read, and live in less salaried jobs, live with dippaid girlfriend and potentially dangerous people with dump. <br /> <br /> I do not know why this slow-witted, half-baked film has received favorable reviews. Of course, Goldblog does a good job - he always does - and his appearance has improved over age - but if you do not have any major inspiration with Jeff Goldlum and he does not see the film he is in, then I will not recommend this turkey. It will not come back for almost two hours of your life - and believe me - you will have nothing to be grateful about the end of these two hours, without being grateful, you are still not watching this movie. <br /> <br />
