I was unthinkable after the promotion and 6 Oscars awards, which was waiting for the cathrine Bigellar movie with great expectations. Unfortunately it's not really a good movie. The situation of the situation certainly seems to be correct and reliable for all calculations, but then this story seems to be incomplete and the film's direction seems to be uncertain and dangerous. The actors put a good effort, but for me what is not really trying to be a movie. It's not like an atmospheric and complete metal jacket, an epic as a brand band, not packed as a job ... well, something. Why I was nominated so nominally for this epic proportion, why people can not see it 'hyping it'. In the past few years, you think of the film's eligibility, I think there is not much to choose from here.
