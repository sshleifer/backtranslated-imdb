Too bad, I really like Kristen Clock and Gary Busey. But the director failed to keep this together. There are many activities, many commitments, but it comes out of hockey. The director does his job. The promise action comes off of hair. A great attempt is made to save the image. This version of "The Rez" (Direct Credential 1996 credit) is not worth it. The other director did a good job.
