So, Steve Irwin. You have to appreciate a person who is not only willing to throw himself into the river which is clearly filled with croak, snake, shrimp, pests and mud from the previous reptiles, not only daily but also encouraged. He does not want me to do this, but he drives his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall into the parallel universe of my film section. Their teeth are drilled, have a migraine, or have no film experience and hence like the cool mediocrity (currently better populated by Disney film). It's very shy. Well, Steve is very shy. He is always so happy, and will spend right through the blues teenager (I can now hear it: "The movie was so stupid") or Tylenol Codin. I said that his encouragement was catching, but if it were, I would have been my master in the whole room of the snake, and it has not yet happened. I agree they're beauties, but I'm not even going to their pets. <br /> <br /> Plots were really predictable. Bad guys were so bad, for a minute I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronics superstore. But the film was filled with animals, and Steve and Terry, which I saw. That plot really was a cause of throwing another croc in a truck (if you could call it). My expectations were low and I lived like that. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be a series of signals, where Steve and Terry (working on their acting skills) have a movie with real intrigues and more animals with fur. I still can not believe we will not see Steve again. I hope Terri and children are involved in Australian zoos and discovery channels, at least. I can not imagine a chicken that some members of the family of Irian force me to say how surprising the cross is. Crikey!
