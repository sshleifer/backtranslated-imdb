Dude, really !!!! Where have you been in the last 20 years, all these threats, awful? This is a trick, there is no mistake in having a low budget, but it's ridiculous, if you want to look classic, Todd Browning Freaks, Dracula and Frankenstein, The Dimming Slow, Ernest Thiezer, Paul Wigger, but it's a ridiculous issue. Golem and the Ghost train passengers, you can not compare it, it's a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc. Total waist and free time of money, many movies were watched, I was always as fierce, I'm really stupid, there is nothing to say please do not try to see something that please understand
