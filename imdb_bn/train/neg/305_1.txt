Mr. I am happy to see this movie after Sandler is famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy his other films ...... but if you are a fan like me ... stay away from this. It may change your thinking of Adam. You will never be able to recover from the horrors of this movie .... People of my house spend a lot of time with old people playing Scrabble .......
