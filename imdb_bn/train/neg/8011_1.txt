During the screening of the movie last night, the audience was so shocked by the conversation that I (half of not even kissing) walked halfway. The filmmaker thinks that he is bringing some bold new territories by presenting a homosexual story, using the inspiration of the fascinsman inspired by the film's inspiration of David Lynch. The performance of this movie has been so low and bored that I think it was going to exceed how incredible a script of the actors looks like. What's worse is that it is colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director thinks? Perhaps he has watched such a supernatural effort like Bunuyel, Jordaski, but the problem is that the previously mentioned director showed all the small sensitivity that is rarely here. Ten years ago I used to understand the significance of this film, but when we got a great adaptation of bad editing, masturial skin and show May Love, why is this boring with the cinematic tide? There is nothing new to see here.
