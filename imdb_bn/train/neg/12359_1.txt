I thought it was really a horror movie - I shouted to myself on my TV several times. The gay man had one or both of the wicked wickedness; There was absolutely no chemistry between them, and Richard Rocco seemed to think that he would kiss the dog. The film covers their long and oppressive shoe, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but for some reason it does not cause any reason. These reasons will be made for some interesting characters, not in battles or make-up scenes (even if you love the movie, but also LAM). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Save your money.
