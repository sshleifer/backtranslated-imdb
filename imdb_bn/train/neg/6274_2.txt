I'm generous giving this movie 2 stars. The line about "You've even seen the oz wizard" was the good part for me! With the terrible writing and acting like these films appear on it, it is not accepted by many of the remarkable TV reality shows. Make yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royal baseball game, you will not be happy!
