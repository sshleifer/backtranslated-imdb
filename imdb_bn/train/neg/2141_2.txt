I dislike seeing this movie with my boyfriend, who like me, the fan of the first. This movie sucked right down! It's the first magic lack. You really understand that the word "mouse" means every word, the animation is painful, the palace is much different from the first movie, there are new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, fortunately the Prince did not have many lines that kept him from the silly words. Originally it is like the lion king 1 1/2 like without saying all of his different stories by the mouse. Because I give 2 out of 10 because the songs were not most enjoyable with songs, the songs were most enjoyable.
