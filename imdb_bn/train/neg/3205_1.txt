I have seen this comment that most of the people discussing this movie comment on MST3 airing. This is fair enough (as it always has been and how its broad exposure), however, "the ultimate justice" was unlucky to see his true form, I just want to make a few remarks and comments Off Edition. First <br /> <br />, must accept that slightly more than the original version compatible broadcast MST 3, largely due to rosano braji and bhenantino bhenyantinira a eksapojitari scene (I can not use names of characters) instead of actors, but I just "bhenantino bhenitini" love words) Why leave bhenyantinira harmful character directly maltake It can not be explained. (This is not the convincing plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was spent just for a long time or it does not provide many sheets for Reefs, I do not know. Another plot point originally missing: The betrayal of the Ventinino Ventini stripper of Joe Dawn Baker, apparently unsupported in the version of MTS 3, is explained by a previous, highly unpleasant scene where Ventini rape her in the shower. This gives him an intention to turn against him, the whole scenario is just really ... icky (There is no other word for it.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments ( "Son of the words" and the Sheriff "dija include" Shooting forever scattered screaming) fully work with them The edited TV's printing results, and the absence of the original film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < . " However, Sheriff Joe Don himself ridiculous cowboy outfit-slash-dressed, complete with shiny badge! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> bhenyantino bhenyantinira naked butt on the screen seems to be?
