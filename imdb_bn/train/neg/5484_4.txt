This film is about a family, which is moving to Genoa in Italy and trying to match the mother / wife with death. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genova" promises, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. This movie contains scenes that illustrate only family life, such as swimming, piano lessons, or eggs cooking. These scenes are lazy and tiring, failing to engage the audience mentally. Finishing it as spectacular, moving or not emotional is very frustrating. I can safely say that I am frustrated and bored by "Genova", the good thing about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of the genus. "Genova" can work as an extended tourist advertisement for the city, but can not be enjoyed as a movie.
