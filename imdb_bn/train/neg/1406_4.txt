This "movie" is more like a music video. Kushturika said in an interview since 2004 that she is making a movie, she feels like making music, and when she makes music, she feels like film making. Stringer Casturica wrote, "Give me this promise" is the best song. "Give me this promise" very little "word". <br /> <br /> I like "Life is a miracle". It was a music video for the first 30 minutes and after some points, but it was a beautiful plot. There is no plot "this commitment to me". I was looking forward to the movie with great hope, because I read that Script Wroco Bojic wrote - one of my favorite writers, who is "a miracle of life" Ranko Bojic has written a very good dialogue, but for the sake of kushturika "noise", and many for my sadness, I only saw two conversations, which I could identify as written by Rango Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to produce his chaotic music video for his son Straibar's song. <br /> <br /> <br /> In an interview with Gordon Mihik (who wrote the script for "The Time of the Jumps" and "black cat white cat"), Kushturika never followed the script. The "black cat white cat" was the only script, for which Castrica said, she would not touch it. According to Gordon Mihik, after returning to Castrica script, and if not, he does not make a good film. And I think this is the "promise me this" case. He should follow Ronko Bozic's script. <br /> <br /> "This commitment to me" is billed as a "comedy", but there is very little moment, which smiles to me. Comedic moments are in the same style as "white cats of black cats", but they are not funny. I think the difference really comes in that "black cat white cat" Gordon Mihik wrote. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people who liked me "making this promise", they think it's very positive movie.
