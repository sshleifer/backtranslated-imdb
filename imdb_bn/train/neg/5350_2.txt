Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Maranis is the horror third-rising star of this funny and entertaining "honey I fear baby". The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but instead of children, instead of narrowing of the children and garden, they are searched with adults instead of the inner house. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The film is the most annoying, shame at the worst time. <br /> <br /> First, the continuation of the continuation of the toilet has completely broken the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first film, apparently Rick Moranis The actress has played his wife, the kids playing the kids have changed, the neighbors have played those who have changed ... you name it. They tried to make us believe this same family, but agreed to say the result at least. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the story is not a repeat of the original with one of the originalities. All of the comedy (and rarely) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are directly copied directly from "honey I'm torn babies". <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I'm sure it's been done in a small budget, but they go astray worse than the rest of the rest of the world. You will have to scare away these small figures of huge geographic area, but you will probably end up crunching most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem is that it is annoying to identify the work inside the house. Only some things happen, and when they happen, they are not all thrilling. The first movie was fun because the kids were working on nature, grass and bugs in it. In this one, adults (come as rather annoying than kids) deal with the dust, a joke and a joke trap. Rogue <br /> <br /> Why do not I know that why this kind of series of Liberation War of the Moriband series already appealed to the Disney executives, because they could cash in on five minutes without thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this dull cash-trash where it should be: shop dust of the shelf.
