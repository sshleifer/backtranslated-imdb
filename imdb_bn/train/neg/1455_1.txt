I am rarely surprised in any film that is based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a film, I cringed across. Terribly trite, distorted and riddled with straight lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Famous Hitler biography Ian Kershaw was originally a mentor for this film. However, he thinks the script is so historically wrong and ridiculous that he denied it, and claimed that he would stop using his name as a name (it would embarrass him that people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene is beaten Hitler's dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loved animals on humans He brought the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned sanctions and animal testing. She was a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film is a non-ferrous, iron cross made of ferrous. Just lying He was rewarded for a long time for repetitive bravery. <br /> <br /> There is no historical document that Hitler had sexual relations with his nephew. One <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In real life such a dirty film you did not even know that he had existed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
