Without the ability to shut my eyes or block my ears, my personal view of hell stopped and this movie plays for eternity on every available page of that room. The only full idea that Streisand is playing a boy / man is only to start digging the surface of a humorous surface on this movie. The single most important issue of watching movies is "voluntarily suspended suspension". . . It is impossible to do that in this movie.
