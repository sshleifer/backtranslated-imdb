One of the few movies in the movie titled BB BITA, in hopes of creating some of the few interesting ones. All aspects of the movie - scripts, acting, direction - middle Three are the wood played by Lead. I think John Dal wanted to move to a movie business, but then someone realized that he had a little talent and so did the TV work. Li Kei Kobb can not usually get extraordinary scripts and poor ones. Jane White is supposed to be a femme fatale but does not come anywhere near convincing viewers. There are two weirdest cars in the film which I have ever seen, among which John Dal Lee ji cobbled later, especially the weird DVD transfer is usually alpha.
