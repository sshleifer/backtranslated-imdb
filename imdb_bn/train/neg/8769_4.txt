This is a movie I hope I can give advice to my American friends. But after four attempts to finish the film, I knew that I could not even close the mortgage. You are almost sure that the actual fight was not even long long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing such a movie. But out of the flat, you can not go to visit the private ryan to save the greed. Do not forget about differences in film budgets or listeners - they do not prevent the director of creating an intelligent film. The length of the movie is not so bad and it is repetitive - they attack on the same hill but they give different names. I thought the LOT was a terrible terrain - this mountain looked like my backyard. Character Development Sequence (Before returning to their last moment, Cylinders Flashbacks, before being appointed) was throughout the film and was not only stuck in a long memory. Until this day, I still have to see the end. But there were many good movies in Border (not saying much).
