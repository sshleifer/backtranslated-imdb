A late demon's "true" story when an American industrial plant starts to pollute the water. Extraordinary, though not really good, in the giant movie many people are trying to find the monster and trying to find out what is happening but not completely involved. Make us specify a monster giant donation that they clearly create to scale for some scenes but it takes away something that is like a threatened dog. A fun absorption film is the silly that the right frame of mind is silly. (One of my allegations is that the printing used for the release of Elvira is so poor that it is a well-filtered video tapes, which was its head 20 years ago.)
