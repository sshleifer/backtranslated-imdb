When I come to the IMDB board, I always get annoyed at the "worst movie of all times" post. After watching this movie, I think I'm going to create my own post soon !! <br /> <br /> The first opening title: a gas stove on a great land, yes, fire = explosion = great action packed movie !!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Actors : I think Ice is a great rapper, even a wonderful actor (sometimes, I say, "sometimes") but Steven Siegel, such a policeman he is playing ... outside words. Cast is left ... well I do not know where the actors were hired but jijs! I said my dog ​​would be a better actor than them! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hijacking Korean is not it? <br /> <br /> Action sequence: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I said to myself, well, calm !! At least some pretty piratics will be. I was wrong. Most of the rest of the movie are filled with low-paid stock shots taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are funny, music is pure shit, last happy (I mean I was finally happy because the movie is over !!! ) <br /> <br /> My cousin was happy while watching the movie (I'm 22, she's 42 ... good). The film was at the end of lifting and burning it. Perhaps next time I'm going to see it ... (who never said ???)
