Dry the three beautiful women in California to serve some festivals (or anything). All hotels are booked so they have to spend the night at a strange old home. Do not they know that there is such a strange person who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yuan. An annoying, vain, stupid stupid "horror" film. Boych and his two friends are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is Dul Dul! Butch and his friends are not any actress - all of their faces are blank through. The final "revelation" is a sunny prediction and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested in the way. Some unsolicited gratuitous women have nudity but it is not enough to save. Boring, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
