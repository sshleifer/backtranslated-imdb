This 1996 film was the first adaptation of Zenear I ever seen and when I did it, I was concerned about it. So much of the novel was dropped and I asked William Hart to make a mistake as Rochester. Then I saw other remarkable adaptations of the novel, three small versions of '44, '70 and '97 and three mini series of '73, 83 and 2006, and I noticed that there are more bad adaptations and worse Rochesters. <br /> <br /> This cinematography is not as far as the most subtle people of indigenous Ayri Adaptation. Director Franco Jerifferelli, the beautiful long shot of ice from the winter sky, the permanent position of the Rochester in the inscription and the flick out of the Zane window - but he is less good to tell stories and bring life characters. Nevertheless, his script excludes the novel page from many important scenes. As a result, the film does not show the depth and complexity of Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does not include the fun part of their sexual intercourse. There are a few short conversations in Rochester and Jane, each of them has acted nicely, but the words they exchange exchanges are not enough to show that they attract each other. We know that they should fall in love, but we actually do not see it happen. The scene where Rochster General Mason wants to know about Jane's reaction to Zen's reaction, leaving his case after his leave, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the last episode - is reduced to four sentences. Jeriferrelli does not make mistakes in replacing his poor writings with other wrong writers for Bront's superb lines, not important scenes are completely changed and rewritten, but he makes less objectionable, but it is a great mistake to remove many important scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lilita is more loved than a little girl, waiting for love. All-time reliable young plathite is very desired, but many impressive Mrs Fairfix has created, and some do not realize that Billy Hotel is supposed to play village wrestling rather than the hard-working working Grace Pole. Although Charlotte Gainsberg is growing up as a heroine, it is the perfect choice for physically playing Jane Eyre. With irregular, strong features 18, looking for every bit like slim and broken, she comes to the nearest of my inner vision of Jane since any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of his screen I was enchanted by his performance. Gainsborgh manages to better predict the strong desire in which the audience is hidden behind the internal fire and firm mask. But unfortunately the script did not allow him to further extend the more enthusiastic and vivid aspects of Jane's character. Due to the so-called scandal of such scenes and so much of the dialogue, the Zenzberg genes are incomplete and therefore must be dissatisfied. It's a sad thing, as well as a good script with Charlotte Gainsberg's version of '83 Zenna Clark was as good as Jane. <br /> <br /> It is still clear that Gensberg is trying to play, knowing that there is no trace of Rochester in the character portraying William Heart. Hurt must be aware that he is physically and type-intellectual, so that he did not even try to play Rochester in the novel in many good films. In addition to his Rochester, blonde and blue-eyed, a soft spoken, well-established noble, shy and quiet, slightly puffed and bright, but basically nature and light. He is so ridiculous, temperamental and scary that the line refers to this characteristic of his character is absolutely ridiculous. In addition, during many moments of film, the heart's facial expression becomes frustrating if he fights against the fatal attack of sleep sickness. Especially in the proposed scenario, he got up from a general feeling like a patient and was unable to open very few eyes. If you compare it with Rochester novel's powerful-deliberate and captivating novel, it only quarrels with power and mood, but Hurt's performance does not disappoint many visitors. Still, he has repressed me less than the defendants in the '70, '97, and the 2006 edition, and I will appoint General Jane Iirei in more than three terms. Clearly, Hit thought was that he could not be the Rochester of the novel, and did not try to do so, but George C Scott, Sieran Hendes and Toby Stephens thought that they could, but they unfortunately failed, and I'd like to see Rochester Rochester See than that. And I would rather look at a Zen Zenner film that extracts many lines of the novel, but does not invent the new version from a version that uses modern dialogue, which they can pronounce in today's Starbucks cafe. Of course this is a failure of Jane Irie, but at least it is an overwhelming one, which can say multiple adaptation of '97 and 2006. So I do not want to suppress anyone to see this adaptation: You will not get Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautiful movie.
