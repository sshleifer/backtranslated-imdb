The price of watching this movie is if you enjoy marveling on special effects. There are some interesting visuals. In addition to <br /> <br />, it is not usually 90 percent. The title is true. <br /> <br /> The value of excluding the story is not worth it. It's like performing a brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to start with It's nothing original and very special. So do not go for all the stories. Just look at the effect. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, it's got an invisible (and sometimes half invisible) man, a little sticky at the end, diluting the purity of the great FX treatment. However, if you ignore the "standard" piratics, see a view (or not see). Finally, this is an appropriate FX movie that is for that purpose and alone for that.
