The first film about the medieval time tourists was Les Vizetta. I like Gene Reno as an actor, but there was something else. Unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, which will remind you a little bit of Louis De Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this is the same letter of seagull, the same parts and great part travels at the same time. Characters have changed a bit now, since the characters are now supposed to be experienced in time traveler. Therefore, they have jumped up in history and jumped down without paying any attention that they were frustrated after filming. Duke, Gene Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his game, but his character is empty, so he can not do much to save the image. <br /> <br /> Now the Duke's slaves / helper, he really has all the attention. The film was only about her and her frustrating / annoying / fool or whom she was supposed to be. The event is; This character tries to produce smiles from the audience, but he does not succeed. Like someone is saying that you are really very joke, you already know, but ultimately to say a joke, he cried aloud loudly, <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like Les Visiteurs, Do not sell the taste in your mouth. If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you will never be able to see a seagull. If you like this sigl ... well, I think you still have to see many movies.
