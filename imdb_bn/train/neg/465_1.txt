When I was on the other day of the movie store, I went beside blonde and blender, but it seems that maybe it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure that before most people saw Romi and Michelle, blonde and bladder might have been just a treasure that was passed. But when I started to see it: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was scared for some. Not only that, both of them were at the final thought of warmth: Pam Anderson and Dennis Richards, not to blame them, but they were not well known and they are playing a role that I think was more for women than 20 of them, 40 of them Its not supposed to be <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Sad But when girls erroneously mistake the killing, the police live in their stories and in reality they are giving talents to women due to their "blessed ignorance" attitude.

I was supposed to be that stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went unnecessary and was just unnecessary. Will I ever recommend this? In one million years, girls are trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens" at this time, it is a sign of depression and a huge blonde BOMBshell of golden and blonda <br /> <br /> 1/10
