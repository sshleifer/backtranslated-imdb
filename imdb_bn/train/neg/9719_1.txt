Ummm, please forgive me, but was not missing more than half the letters? In the original novel, Valizon was imprisoned for a 19-year stolen robbery and then tried several times to escape. He breaks the parole and follows the police inspector Javar lonely. There are many characters that did not have this version along the way. Some prices will be worth mentioning in Fantine, Cosette, M & M. Tennardier, Eponin, Marius, Gabocche and Angelus. The only character with the same name is Java. I was confused and frustrated throughout the movie, trying to see how it was connected to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
