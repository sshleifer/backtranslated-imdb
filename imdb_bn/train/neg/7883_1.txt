Incognito cover, title and power to pray Very short hidden print deceived me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's really good to drag me. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4, the film started throwing in something that was not set up and was not created in any sense. My first thought was, "Nobody knows this story, who knows the story." I'm looking at some parts of the movie, I think I missed something. <br /> <br /> When I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, then it was all shocking, noises, to stop the strike. No knowledge, nothing said and was boring to hear; I closed the word and went ahead fast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm practicing Catholicism.
