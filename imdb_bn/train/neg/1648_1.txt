Personally, I'm able to really praise the film, even I have strange power to enjoy something. You know, at that time when you want to sit there and watch some awesome cookie-cut action movies for the time being. This is the only movie I can remember to actually stop in the middle, and I have no desire to finish it completely. The plot was so closed and predictable, I had to tell what would be the next scene easily (and I'm usually very good at it). The actor was terrible, I saw good acting in the middle school drama. Even the scenario was bad, the flow was all wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a parody that has forgotten fun.
