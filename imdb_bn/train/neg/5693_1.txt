I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was the worst, the worst executioner and the bad-acting movie I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (SP?). She came out with her in a chair, tied? puh-lease The worst part is that it was not even bad at a good, ridiculous way. Just plain terrible - I did not understand why they were even bored to show it in HBO. I thought Beluchi was ridiculously stupid - incredible as a very "incredible" person suffering. Idk, I could go - again, I was surprised by the positive reviews. The only thing that has kept me watching is how interesting it can be to the movie and it's interesting to see how bad it is. The last one was not frustrated by his silin! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." The ridiculous.
