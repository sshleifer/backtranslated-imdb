At first, it takes half a kilometer to get out of prison and start a job. What is the waste of time, we all know that Hackman is going to do some work for his masters, why would one third of the film be deleted in these sequences? Then Hackman lives in a hotel and the story does not go anywhere again, only to prove to us that Hackman is under a close watch and what he said or do is told by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then showing more reconciliation with his wife is more waste time. All these practical steps, conspiracy and plot twists should be taken as easily as 10-15 minutes. During the actual work, I was so annoyed that I just wanted to finish the film. Hackman is as great as normal, and along with other actors, but it is a ugly first circuit.
