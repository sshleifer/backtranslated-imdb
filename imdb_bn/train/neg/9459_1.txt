Bad Bad Bad These three lines enrich this painful little film that can only catch fools and their parents in movies. And her ... # 1 America Movie! What is this country thinking? Mike Meyer is looking more like Michael Jackson. Some sugar ladies fall asleep in 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty joke. It grotesuque and terrible. I would be very happy when the green-egg and ham came in 2005. (Not) Eddie Morphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find lost green eggs and hamsters. They will try to smuggle Sam-i-Me and that means that the guy is running away with him. (I hope they do not destroy the classic book.) Do not waste time and money on this.
