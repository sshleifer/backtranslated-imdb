Andrew, I could no longer agree. My girlfriend is watching it at this moment, and I think this movie is scary. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They're doing all this for a man?" <br /> <br /> I know there is no intensity of this woman, there is no sense of fighting between tragedy and identity, and these men are very valuable. Zhang Ji sees more stupid than admiring the men, during the dance scene where they won over them. <br /> <br /> Japanese people have much intensity than Japanese people, and Geisha is Japanese culture. I was sure something similar to the Chinese, but the face does not match with the main. <br /> <br /> However, dialogue is so weird, so American. If European Europeans with European Orientalists did it, they would do a lot of good work. <br /> <br /> I want to add more: It seems that most of the people who love this movie are American. Say sorry, but no surprise. Spelling for you is not normal, not sensual, for all. I think Chinese actresses are beautiful, but I can not say that they are good actors in this film. Yes, cinematography is fantastic, but honestly, I can not see that these characters are complex, deeper. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm not sure that's awesome to see.
