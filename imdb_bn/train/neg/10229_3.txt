I'm based on my observations of one episode last night (9/27/06). I do not think I will meet again. Acting was perfectly wood, the plot was completely expected, until it was completely unrealistic - I believe 30 million dollars for the death of drug addicts recovering with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) was so embarrassing, almost embarrassed about his role - perhaps he realized how bad he was writing !! I fully realize that the proposed drama in this season is quite poor, but they can certainly find a better writer. Perhaps they are outsourcing writing in India or China! I bet we will not see it next season!
