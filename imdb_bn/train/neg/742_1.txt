If this image is in the 20 million budget, I would like to know where the money went. A monkey can create a better CGI effect, but this horrible piece of trash was wasted for 3 hours, although I must admit the machines and the Marians must really see, actually a real play station 1 game and wonderful mid-90s From a game has never been created. Where is the money to go to the money? Pendragon movies can create a great movie with a good old fashion model and computer-controlled cameras with a George Lucas around 1975-83, and they care about the actor (as well as this case) that is worth 20 million. This is probably the worst movie ever made! I would like to sit on the 24-hour repeat screen of Ishtar instead of seeing this picture. I hate it completely! I return I say this is the best movie ever, because in contrast to other bad movies like Plan 9 or the Tomato or Santa Claus Martians, these movies are so bad that they have special places in your heart, you love them. There is no love for this movie and there is no place in my DVD library. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I gave money for movies and spent on cast and other vices for crew. Pendragon movie congratulations! I want my money back!
