If you have not seen it yet, then I say, just go, walk in the park, do not waste your time. The scene is not worth acting on your money. * Spoilers * - I can not determine what was bad: the movie or belvedine hairstyle? Elen Pompeo's acting talent is very suspicious I hope he can improve it over time. The story is incredible. American Police Locks Canon is a war criminal in Europe? The infamous Slavic Mafiasi is protected by two hunks only ??? A mental art teacher leading a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police executive dumbler hammer than a sack ??? Give me a break. Although there is only one good thing about this film: At least, production costs should be less than 12 "of the ocean" which was meaningless and prominent.
