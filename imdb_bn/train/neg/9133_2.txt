This is a strict review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. Television went out of my life in 1981, so I did not follow the series or any part of it - which means that I'm thinking of the most critical critics of the nostalgic elegance defense. <br/> <br /> (potential spoiler alert) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Really wants and understand what is needed. The "intellect" of the script, which is based on it, can feel almost old feeling in the 1950s. Some of it is badly written, such as Maddy Wilneck breaks up the furnishings instead of shooting, and men need help to prove themselves to be strictly female. <br /> <br /> I often think Susan Faludi shows the simple tactical conspiracy of men, but in this particular case I am with her. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Both characteristics of 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, Country) shows how wonderful was the ability of Willis to be. Impressive! <br /> <br /> rating (and I _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
