This movie was not absolutely rogue, but it was quite bad. Actually the acting was quite good! Jeffrey Combs has done a fantastic job as a crazy scientist, if you do not know anything, but its specialty type: D. Bill Farsi .. Well, I'm not sure why he was in this film. He was the very best way for such stuffs, and his role was not exactly demanded. I rent on the power of these two leads, and I was not really frustrated. I mean, hack, it is about half of the people / half shark. It is not Shakespeare folks. In addition to the plot, which is full of holes, and poor conversation, I want to keep in mind that cinematography wants to like many things. The shots were trying to look "cool", but to hide the scene or just coming out of simple Shuegui. They were very good conversations when it blew many times and cut the premature before the person could even provide lines. It was quite bad. But if you are a Jeffrey combs fan, check out this one is valuable. She gives a great performance and she can do with the character. Forsythe are not bad, and are also female lead. Although I can remember his name. Bottom line, I do not waste your time otherwise.
