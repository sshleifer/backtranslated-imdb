I have seen myself that I did not see who gave it 10. This movie has a plottish and / or difficult time to follow. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not fool it, it's about 98% odd drama and 2% comedy. All actors turn a great performance, that can not be denied, but it seems like it's really lost. Do not know if the original script was good and it should be edited or what will happen. This was possible, and instead it was really a flow. I really liked it for half an hour to invest in this film, but the video does not return the rental space in time. Save your money and see something else.
