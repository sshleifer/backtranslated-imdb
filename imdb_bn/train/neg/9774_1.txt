Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Rickom for For a Dream" and co-wrote it with the screenplay in Ornofski's film. This movie provides an intestine depending on each level, and the stereotypical character of characters and ill-effects that destroy them. "The end of Brooklyn" is still unfortunate and many letters are sad, but it rarely makes them in the same trial. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Especially when movie homosexuality is equal to death. A gay character is found in stone, a galaxy is introduced by dynamic car, and dead land on the sidewalk. The other is crucified and is still beat more easily. Another shocking piece of shock quality, which can be compulsory when it is really good, the union workers are apparently fighting with Streak Breckers. Who will think of a drama about the Brooklyners' action sequence and truck blasts? <br /> <br /> Director, Woolley Adel has a level of expertise like a TV operator, but for the real he is far behind in the film for the movie. The film can not decide which way it is absolutely strange. Lake has given a vague role that there may be a manquin filling, and Belldwin just looks like to look stupid in its equally small part. And then as our leader Jennifer Jason Leigh arrives, a cruel hookah named Tralal (believe me or I'm not kidding). Its performance is nothing great and the fate of its character is the least dirty to say. The bad use of color and composition looks cheaper than it, and the more provocative bit takes off the "real" edge. A failure
