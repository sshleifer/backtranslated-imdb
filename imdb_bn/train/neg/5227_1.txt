........ And that's a very bad one !!! How long does this train-debris end ?? 14 episodes or something ?? I can see why now <br /> <br /> I bought the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Anoxbox. It was so free to buy my first one. Only good things about this experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on acting, because I used to think new people who are not really getting jobs, just below right below. At least I've never seen them on a main show, theater or TV. If I do that, then I have easily forgotten them. <br /> <br /> But the special effect was absolutely terrible. Actually, this is not a one-million-dollar project, but the original Star Trek has done better than it did and it was thirty-five years ago. I especially smile on the ships from bad boys (factor or something like this) because the ship was watching the fire, behind the fire, a huge model coming out of the engine was like a rocket. I finally went to the top of Will Quote, behind the Roadner. The modern jet / rocket engine does not make it even worse. <br /> <br /> And it was not even worse. The wild-west type shooting-out made me wonder about the fact that I was watching an amazing movie or gene atri. <br /> <br /> Hello, Do not waste your time ... I What ... disaster is all 80-minutes called "firing".
