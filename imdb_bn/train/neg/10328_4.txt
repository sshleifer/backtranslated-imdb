I had a pretty good idea to work with the show. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and the acting is bad. There are many other things that can be better portrayed as opposed to gay marriage or a cemetery search. The show can not be correctly stated as a comedy show because it has a comical lack. I would like to say that this event was very less successful in limiting the life of the Muslim community. <br /> <br /> There is far worse than the second episode. I had high hopes about this show, but I was kind of disappointed. I still admire the CBS for presenting this concept to the audience. However, I wish you luck for the future.
