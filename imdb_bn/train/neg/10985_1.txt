I do not know what Margaret Atwood thinks about allowing this movie to be the same name as his book. I was always a great fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn a movie at work. I am aware that the translation of the movie book is not perfect, but the film was the greatest of all time. The woman's name is correct and the story of some people is correct, but this is about her. I think I lost a good part of my time trying to make it through. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Luiz Parker I did not really have anything with this book because I only wish to have a good script for working with them.
