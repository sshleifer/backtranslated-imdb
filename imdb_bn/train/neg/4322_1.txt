Read and take notes - you can save 88 minutes of your life (that was all!). <br /> <br /> Fable in CAPRA style ready to make this image faded, this is a modern small town American Christmas (I'm guessing). If fails ... are completely and absolutely failed. I have been trying to figure out a good thing about it and can not Please mention me some highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, migrant workers in the Santa factory spend eternity as laborers. Angels are actually those who live in former cowboy trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> I do not waste it for you, but if you have to contradict it in the dark, there should be some light in the movie but there is no one. Even photography is lonely - snow seen at the end of ice, cold, humid, and unfortunate everywhere. <br /> <br /> You can assume that the film is a happy (surprising) end. What a tranquility!
