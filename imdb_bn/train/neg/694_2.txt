It's 80's early. Have a group of suspected old looking teenagers. And there's a crazy stalking around. Yes, this is Slasharvil. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Shocking. Why is it called a scandal? I have very few thoughts. Unless you have a great idea to hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - in balance, not a great joke; To be honest, a junk scream is really a scream. But there you go. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is concerned about a teenager who works to clean an isolated dormancy. They are aware that a psychopath is loose. To fight against this development, they split in darkness. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> The trick is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I saw was Vipo one. It seems to cut a perfect violence. This makes the DVD more uninterrupted because, let's face it, a slash film hanging out of violence is a waste of time. Slasher- For film and video only nasty completists.
