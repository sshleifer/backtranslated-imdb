So this was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" at? Is that such a sad plot and terrible acting? Seeing Jim Belusi is so shameful that it is so repetitive (shot, survival, lying, beaten, survival, shooting, lying and false propaganda etc.) Call this script for Bright's, shameful sad to see Timothy Dalton (or he Did I just pay P ***, depending on what I used to pay?) In the efforts of Southern Sheriff. For that other Brit, bleached blonde one, what a *** ***! Recently, this "English-speaking" (Six) has a tendency to glorify super violent lips, thanks to the two films of Madrasah, perhaps justifying the violence by using Pope Fiction as well as the use of laughter and the use of humor. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the style. Definitely miss one.
