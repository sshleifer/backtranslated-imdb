Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy couple in history, and so deserve, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Originally a horn cracking factory is the fourth of a man crack, and soon enough Ollie cracks with all the horn crying. He is sleeping with Stan on his side, he needs to be silent, and Doctor (James Finson) said the phone was coming to check at Oli. After realizing the plumbing and electricity by the repairer of the river, the doctor came for a checkup and after some testing, he got goat's milk and advised to drink some sea air on the ocean. Some trumpet games are running after Stan, hanging the window by phone cord and car accidents, he and Olly go to a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the goats, try to feed the goats, and Stan brings his trunk! Meanwhile, on the first page of the newspaper, the murderer Nick Gingjars - fled away Convit (Richard Crumar) escaped, and while he was asleep, the boys remained silent in the boat, and the goats were going to the sea with a boulder with a boat. In the morning, see their location, and the killer wanted to eat something out, and he inspires Stein and Ollie to make fake food, as such. String for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat When Olly started to shine a bit, Stan began to help her trumpet and Oli's anger threw her to the killer, and it continued before it reached the police, only Oli's anger could be kept in jail. Comedy was the smallest moment, but it is not a big black and white film. "Well, here's another nice mess that you found me!" 100 years 100 years, 100 coats, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 of comics comics. OK!
