I gave this movie 2, and although I myself feel a science fiction fanatic, I think it is very difficult to take this film seriously. It was AMC on a late night, and I'm happy I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for some of the laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The average effect of the duration of the special effects is not horrible, but not cool. Of course we know more than Tuesday, but we can not really catch it against this movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were a number of pieces of this picture, which I wanted to know about some more details - astronauts' injuries / conditions, morgue cities, lakes, animals etc. Overall, like the long version of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - a sugar finish is complete.
