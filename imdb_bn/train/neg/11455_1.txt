First of all, give some ideas about my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 congratulations I enjoyed: Superbod, Noked up, Hot Faj, Brad of Glory <br /> <br /> I hate the 2007 comedy : Ivan Almighty, Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chalk <br /> <br /> My first instinct should be followed and the "hot rod" should be stopped after a 20-minute mark. I knew by this point that this movie would never smile at me once. The script is absolutely cruel - I do not know how this nudity is operated in the 6DDB in IMDB. Anyone who is older than 10 years old can be mentally defective. <br /> <br /> It does not come close to Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Sambar can not carry anything else. 5 to 10 minute sketches on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they know Ian McKen and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... They must be indebted or something. I came to tell you that it would be a cellphone movie, but I think it would be funny at least. <br /> <br /> I do not usually comment on movies in IMDB, but it was so awkward, I just had to warn the people. This is the only 4th movie I have seen that I was compelled at 1/10.
