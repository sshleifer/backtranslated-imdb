One of the five bad movies I've ever seen. And I'm not exaggerated. Actually, I recommend watching it so that you can get the same feelings of disbelief as you can see the shows. <br /> <br /> In the 400 votes, the movie gets a 5.3 / 10 user rating. But there are probably a number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably the message of this movie - the nuclear weapons humanoid humankind. An all-star little league pitcher who left baseball because Chuck Murdoch has a nuclear weapon. Soon "Amazing Grace" Smith is the all-time star Boston Celtic who inspired and inspired the Chuck's story. Soon all world leagues of different leagues separated from professional level colleges to higher schools. Later, all the children of the world went silently in the streets. It inspires the United States President to meet the Soviet Premier, who agrees to eliminate all nuclear weapons for the time being at the beginning of the next Little League season. The movie ends with throwing the first picture with Chik, the President says to his new best friend Chuck, that because of not throwing the baseball every year, he will not worry about the disappointment of every batsman. <br /> <br />> A negative underworld boss somewhere along the line, amazing Grace murder. When the President finds out that he has been told that the FBI can verify the killer, he can not prove it. So tell the President Underworld Boss ("But this is the only" "I do not care, put him on line") and tell him that he resigned from the company's board and he has sold all the stocks. And do not leave the line again. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie was so painful that I could not stop it. It was on television from 2:30 to 4:00, and I saw it all. I have not turned off anti-nuclear campaign opposition. I was all turned off by an integral break in organized sports. I did not understand why "Amazing Grace" Smith was killed. And all these famous athletes became friends of Chauk, why Baba was upset with a policy position with his son. And when the father said to Chuck, There was a clich√© moment at the end, "I never said this to you, but I'm proud of you." Coupling
