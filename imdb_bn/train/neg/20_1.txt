This movie was terrible. At first I read the plot summary and saw it right, so I saw it. The acting was horrible. It was almost like the camera shy camera. Everything looked fake. I feel bad for Edward Farling, the terminator 2 was my favorite some years ago .. I saw it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> This plot was also bad. The authors probably sleep deprived when they come with the line. <br /> Plus <br /> Plus, it's a good kind of bad movie. If you see how bad it can be, you will only see it, so that you can tell other people how horrible you can not believe in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think everybody will see it, so that we can appreciate the film, better, real.
