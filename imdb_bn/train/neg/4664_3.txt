I voted 3 for this movie because it looks gorgeous as the green wind output. But this was its usual mix of "art" sex and provocative whip. I know many people like this movie but I soon got very tired. It's definitely not for everyone. The universal McGregor might have taken part in the credibility, I guess, but he certainly could not waste his time. I hate handing someone to the corner of the camouflage but please ..... !!! It's obviously very interesting at the plus side and I enjoyed the song but did not see it till the end and I can not say it for many movies. I usually see the whole thing but this is unbearable !!
