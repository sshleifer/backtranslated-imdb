You have never seen the film and still know that Jerek Tu is a disaster. The question is, "how it has been created", because if you throw someone money and ask to make a movie then they will do it. <br /> <br /> The question is, why was Steve Martin allowed to make it? I think he needed money for a dirty suit war and it was determined not to cost him anything. He knew that Seychelles would be so terrible, that out of pride, he would not count the royalty as income. <br /> <br /> This sign was the only way to be disappointed by the revival of Karl Gottlibi and Steve Martin's favorite poor black family. <br /> <br /> and "dcreasy2001" (Una Mark Blankfield?): It is clearly clear that you have done some sad power in this movie and you can feel the only way you can get involved. Being the single cheerleader of the Sigail as an IMDB user comment. I was praying for you for taunting, but, you really had to make an effort at the spin. Why do not they 10?
