This movie is considered to be a "light hearted" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mysterious" wonders. But instead it comes off being merely curious. There are two things in this movie that my mind thinks horrible: 1) Santa shows the way.- Have you ever seen the Santa Claus more horrible? And 2) "Satan's evil rep." Just watch the little weird dance of the pitch is a watch. If it can be MSTed version or if you like to laugh a lot, just watch this movie. I can not believe it is a child movie.
