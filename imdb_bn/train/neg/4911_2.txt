First to die 2003 <br /> <br /> I will admit my mistake first: I did not understand it was made for TV movie. I was "thrown" by "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes long. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their character. At the bottom of the film it definitely falls into the "Chick Flick" section. Although there are some violent scenes, no calls should be made to call "R" for any violence. There are no nudity or gratuitous sexual scenes. Actually, there is no sex scene. He was the guest of the gruere (who was absolutely beautiful), Christina Copeland, Sonia Solla, and the Glennis Davies SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing for the progress of their career because they were used as supporting actresses of the lowest level. Robert Patrick was fantastic, he usually and Mitch Pielligi thinks me a modern day Lee Marvin. During the Millennium series, I did not give anything challenging to show the magnificent meagan galagor to the respected glory of an actor as an actor. Tessi Polan was the most frustrated about Cast. Besides being the average actress below and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely boring. I found myself mutating TVs during her dialogue. I would recommend this movie to enjoy lifetime-type TV programs. I will not recommend paying any money to watch this movie. I can not find anything that might cause censorship, it is a film that is only suitable for watching TV, because nothing will be taken away. As a TV movie I rated it 5 out of 10. As a feature film with "certificates" and strong cast, I rate it as 2 out of ten.
