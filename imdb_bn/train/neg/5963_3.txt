This movie starts with a practitioner execution of sorcery and her mistress. His head is cut off and his own body isolated different lamps ... "The thing that does not die" sounds like him? Well it can play something like this, but once the body is assembled with the head, all the interesting and horrible deaths are completed and the film comes very slowly. I say the movie is only 88 minutes long and I think "when will it end"? The characters of the film are often stupid and they are really worth their death. Villain is very bad as very slow and really surprised you that he managed to do something that is afraid of jewelery. The only thing to look after your head after re-connecting is to actually flash that many boobs are flashing that you've actually started to lose track. Yet I would like to see a horror movie, soft-core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way too slow to move even in moving speed along the path to be somewhat enjoyable. And if the meat does not fall behind the box, it is made like a zombie attack in the city, only a small scene where three or four bodies attack a house and they are easily distorted. There is no reason for the film and their view is rather meaningless. So in most cases I say that if you do not come to the film really cheap then you have to avoid it.
