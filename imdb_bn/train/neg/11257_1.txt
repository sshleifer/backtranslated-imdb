This movie feels so empty. The maximum number of actors in the screen are 10 on each screen. Because everything was shot in front of the blue screen, in fact no additional and sometimes the movie seems weird. <br /> <br /> The work was fierce! It is so clear that it was in front of a blue screen because action scenes let you see the actor / actress walk half-way in them, thinking that they are running for their life .. looking at the floor for their mark ... <br /> <br /> Spools: You will also find yourself banging your head to watch the movie. At one point of the Sky Captain's home base, they like 100 aircraft sitting on the back of the aircraft. An advance warning has come to them ... So what do they do? There is nothing. All the planes have been blown up and Sky Teamman is again fighting the only person ... <br /> <br /> The whole world is attacking and he is the only person At the very end of the movie you saw hundreds of plains ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
