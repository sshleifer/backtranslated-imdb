What's in the sky Is it an airplane? What is this superman ?? Error, not ?? It's a turtle !! See, what happened to the cold war! There is nothing but bad news and other things! Americans shot a Russian war plane somewhere in the Arakk region, and later blasted the defrostes and literally spawned giant monster prehistoric turtles. He is not a very friendly bird because it immediately comes to destroy everything and everyone on its way. The controversial government finally decided to kill a brand new and ultra-sophisticated ice-bombs, but there is another surprise in the gamerah shop ?? Great turtle can fly! The first time this will result in a wonderful wonderful and ridiculous sequence! Gamma looked at his back when suddenly the fire started from the fireplace and he got taller in the air. How can you love that? There is also a terrible sub plot which is capable of communicating telecommunication about a boring baby, but it is not interesting enough. Flying Turtle, man !! There is nothing more to write about Japanese (and American re-edited) cy-fi efforts, except that it is a clear and complete shameless rip off of classics like 20,000 Fathom like the original Godzilla and The Beast. Influence and giant design, unlike the hawk and previous films, it is not a success to create a mysterious environment. Also known as Brian Donlewi ("Quotesmus Experiment") and Dick O'Neal ("Wolffen"), which are well-known and even Japanese mahmud-scenes are not very convincing. Gamma's own and personalized theme-song is rather cool, but it gets an extra point for it.
