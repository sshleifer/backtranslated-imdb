It was a terrible movie. Originally a semi-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do some horrible work to American forces in South Korea in Zen March. She became a slave to an American military family, they all looked more white than they all thought to be Korean (I believe the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 of South East Asian, not all Koreans), and the teenage son's family Start out of his hatred and end up sleeping with him. The military and military forces of Korea and the United States are completely depicted as insane. Of course, screenwriters and directors are probably white men who have spent a day in Korea before this movie, and have no intention of showing any real insight into the life of Korea for Korea's citizen or American GIS, and instead of just wondering how their kind-hearted Asia-made fantasy film has created this completely incredible film. No one except. Anyone in Korea who knows it will be completely rubbish Eventually, the North Korean Hanhole spy girl dies in a clearly defined way "to pay for the sins". Very bad film for a made TV to feel it.
