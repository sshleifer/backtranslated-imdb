I recently saw this movie in DVD and I would say that I was not impressed. I know it is forbidden to dismiss independent films, but it was felt without entertainment. <br /> <br /> The courtyard was attractive, but its death sentence was reduced. I thought to myself "All right, they're just coming in, the story will be soon." Before I knew it, the film was over and the story never picked up. All that I did not find played is impressive. It was quite bad. No Star Wars Practical trilogy is bad, yet bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the running time was, I would say two hours (because it's a safe guess). However, when the film ended, I felt that I was entitled to receive a will, I was responsible for closing the film and walking through half. <br /> <br /> Again, I was totally disrespected, and finally bored my wits out. I am not a person that requires a fast-action action and explosion in a movie, so do not start with me because I do not like it.
