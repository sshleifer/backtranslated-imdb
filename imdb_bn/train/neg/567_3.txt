This movie is one of the most horrific films ever made. Joan Jovi can act in a movie? He is not an actor or an actor, what? Is he killing the vampire with his guitar? And what about the terrible plot? O my God this movie really sucks. Ultimately, the queen of the vampires is surrounded by the Russian armistice by the eternal vampire Ari Zuver (blade), but when "fantastic" killer comes, only 4 vampires left !! What happened with the other 10-15 Vampire? They run out into the sun ??? And what to say about "the grand remnant" when the head highs with the forest heavy shotgun ??? That's really a "no". In the 100 episodes of "Bufi The Vampire Slayer", only a passenger with no snail dies! This is really fundamental!
