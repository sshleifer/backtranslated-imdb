I covered this movie which was a bad move. It was not all fun and the main character was insulting. The girl was beautiful but the story and acting were terrible. It was absolutely nothing with surfing. A terrible movie with a "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and a real surfer. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and because of Gordon Gecko and being married to everyone, the movie might see a resurgence, but if you do not see it, then do not waste your time. A bad movie with great surfing, real surfers and amazing, diverse cinematography was in God's hand.
