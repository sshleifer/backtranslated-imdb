This movie was a great disappointment for me. I was waiting for this movie to come out for years, and before I went bankrupt, I was a faithful follower of Kyos comics. They do not only cut the story line half, but they changed the data. Lucifer's statement is that Hope's father is untrue. He corrupted his father, but he himself was not his father. The voice does not accept the letter, and once you hear the voice of a favorite character, the voice you hear in your mind is never returned. I can not remember everything about this film that is wrong. If you love Lady Death, the following line will not see this movie. It's not just comic justice!
