"The house of the soul" is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country where the military film was like dictatorship, just like the film tries to describe, and although everyone knows that movies can be far away from reality, this particular movie behaves as both anonymity and fools . The things shown here are not as simple and linear, and of course the political process is more complex and interesting that "house ..." in the plot. If you do not see the complexity on the screen, then making movies is not good. There are many examples of how the film politics can be done so seriously. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda could be present in the potholes and palm trees. When you talk about certain topics, you do not have to be careful only but your public intelligence must be respected.
