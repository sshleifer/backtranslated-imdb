I'm sorry, but when it comes out in 1978 it can be scary, but it is not kept in modern times. The only attractive view of the whole film is Michael Michael killed his sister Judith, where Halloween masks wear. The most challenging moment of the whole movie when his father unmasked his mask to kill his son. The film goes downstairs and does not accept it until the last fifteen minutes, but then it is too late, we have lost all interest in the audience story. There is not only a character development, and if people are not too much like him, then Lauai is such an exceptional heroine. I am sorry to disagree with everyone scared in this movie, but if you want to watch a horror movie, see The Shining or Rosemary Child. Two of the best horror films ever made. Halloween certainly does not belong to them. I can not believe that Roger Ebert has given four stars, because the film has no way to get such a high rating.
