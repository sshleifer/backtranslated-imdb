Now, I've seen many bad movies. I like bad movies Especially bad action movies. I've watched (and enjoyed) all the movies in Gene-Cloud Van Damme, where he had his own clone, where both of them were playing pairs, and three where he was a cyborg. I actually played a fashion designer and fought with a truck full of durans. (Hey, if there is nothing else, he's got a big ass and you'll see it almost always. With the DVD, you can even stop and zoom!) That's why you can trust me this movie is so bad, 9 looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about a snake eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The set is bad. The war is bad. The stunt is bad. FX Bad The performance is visually spectacular, during the world, it seems to be the worst performance of every so-called actor in Cast, including Lorenzo Lama, and it really says something. And I'm willing to sit in bed with everyone involved in this movie, is lousy in bed. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It's curious to be funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that if you see this movie only then you are born stupid or very rocky. I could sit in my house because there was something I needed to see to seduce me from the cure urine from my laundry. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but there was nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's Camio as a gay arsonist.
