This movie stinks! You would like to get back to it plus two plus back. The Sliding Dorses, w / gwyenth paltrow and directed by Peter Hovey, Melinda and Melinda tried a lot better. That movie was cute, malicious, and played well. I saw what happened to both Gayanath - rather than the characters they played - and the performances supporting cast Cast were excellent. <br /> <br /> Where melinda and melinda are tiring, the dialogue has been consolidated and I am able to have less care in all these people - at least all Melinda One Melinda is so effective - its first glass wine 10 AM - And so gentlely he is not funny, and a ridiculous sense. Second Melinda is fine, but forgot. Woody Allen's previous ALW movie worked because I guess, he spent time on screenplay and the actor was gifted. A piece for this movie He wrote these plays for two months: You can say And when Sevgi is talented, the people around him are not enough to be present. The movie is closed by Clo Sevgi and a bunch of other people that you have seen in other movies but can not remember. <br /> <br /> Sorry, very sad.
