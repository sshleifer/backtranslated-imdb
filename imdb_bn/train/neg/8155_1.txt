I like Robin Williams in his more serious role (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World World Garp). This is my favorite Robin Williams movie. But enjoy the day, though good acting, among the worst movies I have ever seen, and of course the worst Robin Williams movie (worse than Smoothie's death, club paradig and worse than Alladin's ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story is going to have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is a giant bottom. I do not want to feel like a Hollywood Hollywood cheese-fest, but I have more than 90 minutes of complete and complete disappointment. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which actually reminds me of bad) because it seems that the only point of the film is to see how much a person can fall. Answer? Who care
