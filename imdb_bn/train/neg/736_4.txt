Twenty years ago, at the age of five-year-old son Michael Hawthorne, his father had killed his mother with an ax in the empty street and then committed suicide. At present, Michael (Gordon Curry) invited his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friend Chris (Mick Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuel Wagheyre), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendan Byers), Mitch Maldiv, Philip Rhys ) And Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend her Halloween in the country with her grandparents. He asks his friends that they will represent their greatest fearsome horror and celebrate an ancient Indian with his Indian friend Crowe (Byron Chief Moon), using a wooden dummy morte (John Fedel), which will eliminate their fears. Forever. Michael's biggest fear is to be a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong, and Mornie returns to his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "Frightening Resurrection" is a frustrating and unkempt slash film, using this fun idea to overcome the greatest fearsome of each friend before expanding it, but the clich√©s are full of a dirty script. For example, there are some exaggerated performance, such as Miss Mrs. Palmer; Others are very weak, but ordinary acting is good. There is no explanation why unfortunately the dummy is living; Even more, surrounded by close friends, this group does not feel pain or sorrow when everybody dies. For more than fifty minutes, it can be used to create a good dramatic situation of low speed. Finally, Michael showed a lotus that his father's interest was that I did not look at the story. I do not know whether the previous reference has been edited in the DVD published in Brazil with the running time of 87 minutes. Special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noute de Halloween" ("Fear 2: Hello of One Night")
