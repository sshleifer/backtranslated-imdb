Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to enjoy an inferior complex, I hated to talk to new people, and I had a great idea that people hated me. But after seeing an episode of 4 non-Blondes, my fate changed. After Part 2, I started applying for a new job after fashionable clothes, and I actually felt genius. After the series ended I beat up most women and often won my local karaoke competition. If you ever have a crisis of self-confidence and do not know where to turn, travel to Poundland and the DVD is only available at 99p.
