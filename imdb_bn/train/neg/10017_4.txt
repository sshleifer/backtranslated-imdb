"Ghost of Drugstrip Hole" is held in a lukewarm network, which has long gone, where a child can commit the biggest sin, deny the law and get a traffic ticket.

This is for drag-racing - this B-Flick is mostly related to rock n roll, people! The people of American International are clearly suitable, on behalf of the square thirteen and still do not feel as adults silent. There are a few fun entrepreneurs and Frooti Exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would come out for some fresh air ..." Dad: "Where do you think you are finding it, under his neck?"), But the ghost is coming a little late Is. In the 65th minute, the film cheated with our climatic car competition, which is actually off-screen and pre-"skub do" -style unsolicited spec, which gives no idea. However, for nostalgia buffs, some fun is fun. ** **** to
