Although Casting for this movie was commendable, especially Diane Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for an actor or director to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I and my wife have decided that we saw the whole movie that it was like a train's ruins, and almost impossible to escape. It may be that we will finally express ourselves to the "Hope" message and we will be able to collect some of these efforts. Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> The audience was able to "sense" this narrow story, a credit for the sensation of the human brain's intelligent curiosity. The authors, however, seem to have nothing to do to simplify this normal requirement, to find us the meaning. <br /> <br /> It was added that the people involved were not only secondary to their artistic craftsmanship and for any internal emotional character or storytelling. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the films made for TVs floating for years. Sending a message to the audience may be the initial interest of the authors in the past, the current writers and producers seem to be objectionable to their audiences, initially, we feel that the only reason as "surrender" surrender through illogical advertising is to create a documentary from a movie.
