Another devotional strike again. It is not a spoiler because people who bring this overly long, pseudo-scientific infomercial come after the study ... The illumination of Ramath's school. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy is deceptive behind the hidden behind an OZ-like screen, I walk away. Thanks to Ramtea, I saw this picture a credit copy on a "friend" recommendation ... It would be sad to destroy the valuable assets of this New Age lobotomizer. I can only hope that they "can really believe that they can walk in the water" can take adequate guidance in its "logical" conclusion ... in other words; Walk, sink ... or stop :-) As a movie ... to get a strong "1" on its entertainment value, especially to make the most hateful character in the history of the movie (photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!) . If you see this movie, then it is recommended that borrowers borrow from borrowers who recommend it.
