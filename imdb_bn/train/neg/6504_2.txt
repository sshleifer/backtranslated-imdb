Why did I see my life ruined 1.5 hours? Why is this film made even? Why am I commenting on this picture? <br /> <br /> One critic says that the film is patient to see it and it is not for everyone. I can not think of those who are for this photo. After reducing acid attack, for a while, some people can see it and give some ideas beyond it. It is inconvenient, it is not experimental, it is common and easy garbage. The film does not follow any plot line, when you think you have something, all right ... you do not. <br /> <br /> I think the final film has some conclusions (no intention), a view of what is happening to the audience. I do not think it would matter, keep a spoiler here. This image is to be missed by one of the filmmade world.
