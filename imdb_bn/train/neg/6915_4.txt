This is some of the films that I think it might be before a few years before the event. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not really good. Alec Beldwin was quite good, but the plot is the best flimsy kind of it. Cast what they are given is quite good, but again you just as well as the script. Bildwin gave this directive though I could swear that he did not direct all of it, I thought that I read somewhere or did not have much to shoot again, but he certainly has some possibilities. Although his work in "30 Rock" is not short of talent and he needs to be more busy. I hope the show will thrill out of La La Seffield, but maybe not that long. 9 years it's gone. So if you want to see a movie that you do not get too much then it will not really hate it. Finally, before the liberation war and only a film in the DVD, I can not remember myself. Seeing Alex Beldwin and Anthony Hopkins again together, it was fantastic to see that many people watched "The Age". Now pick that nice film for some real entertainment.
