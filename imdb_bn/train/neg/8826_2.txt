This low-budget movie is compared to the classic "Silent Night Deadly Night", it is labeled as a slash flick. First tell me that I think even the "Silent Night Part 2" is even better than that (which was originally filled with flashbacks for more than half of the film). "Christmas Eve" as a person who makes the main character crazy (mental sound) slowly (very slowly) mentally tries. He can not understand the real meaning of Christmas and he is annoyed with the fact that he created toys made with a lack of quality and love on the basis of work. Clad as Santa, he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, without the actual need for special effects, is killed only 3 people. No excitement, no thrills, no gore, no cast One exception is that: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is well-known for his additionally eliminating Tom Hans as the defender of the classic "The Green Mile". He must still kicked himself today to accept this role. He really is the only one who can work, his supporters role is better than the lead lead. (Not even bad, but if you are covered by a little supporter character you are not too great.) And what about that weird end? (You have to believe it, believe it). "Christmas Evil" is perfect boring, nothing happens and artwork is just confusing. It's not a slasher If you want to see a real Christmas slash, see the best of all time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
