Do not waste your time or your money in this movie. My roommate was hired because he thought it was a movie called Descent. So, we decided to see it in any way that it seems that might be bad. It was there. I can not believe that this movie was actually produced and presented to the public. It was so awesome that it's almost like an accident scene where you look away but you can not create yourself. I feel emotionally scarred emotionally. It went through a semi-low budget movie where a college girl attacked her with all kinds of porn flickers by a boy. And really not a good one. I went to feel bad for women while hating the rapists. Almost Above all, a horror movie, which certainly was set for NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your kids see it.
