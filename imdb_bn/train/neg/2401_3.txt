I've seen good teenage time movies in my time, this one, but the cake takes. More comedy than horror, "full moon high" cheese-in "C" in the festival. This movie star star is not bad. The only way it is made is to send rolling rolling only. Adam Armin plays a 50-year-old American American high school football player Tony, who did not grow old due to Wierfal bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie is the Halloween player. He bat everyone! Ed McMahon played his super-conservative father, who had finished his bullet. Adam's father, Allan, plays a tight game that is not the top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be coming out of the place due to the attack, and then he will get the chance to catch up in his kingdom. Smile more than blood shed, this movie was just a development from "Tin Wolf" at the beginning of the 80's! 1 out of 5.
