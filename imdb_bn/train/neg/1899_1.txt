I saw it because I thought the carriage and the cooler cars are going to grow. Guess I was lying. This movie is very annoying. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < When they make sure that it is correct, then kip pulls a trunk brick and throws it into the window, it sever it. What does her friend get when she gets in Porsche? They start the car and close the night. They followed the police and provided only one warehouse. So, the entire crew ditches all cars and their individual ways to go. Then, we get a glimpse of rain in Memphis. She is giving a little lecture in a bunch of kids with a go-kart track. Then, he faces Elleigh Jackson (Will Patan). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother's cripple * is asleep *. Among the most notorious car thieves of tallest Angels, known as Memphis. Memphis met a junkyard head and Raymond Calletti (Christopher Ecclestone). This man threatens Kip's murder if Memphis does not supply 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Waste the last 12 films! <br /> <br /> Carr: See 10 cars out of 50 of the movie ads. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> Chase: At the end of the movie Chase was a joke. It was not at all suspicious. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: The dog eats a burger somewhere in the movie and three whips are melted. It's impossible. The keys are flipped open. Dogs were seriously damaged by scent, stomach and large intestines. Guys suggested laxatives to help him find out laxatives. It will not work. Dogs will get more diarrhea but there is no key. Ryan Dunne was described in Jacques after hitting a toy car up her ass. Laxative, lots of diarrhea, but no car. The same thing with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. During the chap: When Elan breaks for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries hard to start the car. You see behind him a police cruiser who does not look at his car. However, when Nicholas Cage again started the engine, the police officer dashed his head to the right and saw the car, and immediately followed him. It's stupid. So when he heard the car and started seeing the car, he knew that the car that he was looking for was there. How does he know the correct car? He only sees behind him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. Movie stupid I have never seen the original but I have planned. <br /> <br /> I can give this picture 1 star out of 10 stars. Be quick and furious instead.
