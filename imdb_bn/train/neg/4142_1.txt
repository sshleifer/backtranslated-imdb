This is the worst movie I have ever seen! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I saw some bad movies but this one took it. Most of the plot and movies are fast moving the film to make it faster, or do you think it is thinking about what is going on, because you can not seriously remember that anyone has thought about this movie and you are watching it. I'm sorry for anyone that has had to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and do not see this movie because I know that you think it is the greatest waste of your life.
