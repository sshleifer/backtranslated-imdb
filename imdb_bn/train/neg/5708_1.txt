People like me will be separated from this movie. It's not just realistic. Plot Sooooooo is predictable. You can expect everything that can happen firmly, of course, they get riches and become rich richer, and cheat bad guys. We've seen it a million times before. The authors of this film must think that most of the film is stupid. They must be right because most people really like this picture. I mean solving riddles in a few seconds. Manhattan subway hidden secret room hidden? You will think that the room was discovered earlier in New York by all the underground work. And all that civil war was created during? Please and love story in Ben and Abigail ?? How beautiful, and I was weak in the romance of Clive Cussler's novel. They just fall in love, within 2 seconds I'll be even more anxious to save my own ass and get something. Hell with girl girl and stupid pieces of paper. 1/10 garbage
