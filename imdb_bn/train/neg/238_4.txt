A Cinderella story created for adults who lived in the dreamland. Romance is very unreal, fluttery, loving dovey, perfect etc. Cinderella's plot is very late and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my eldest. If you are looking for a romantic romance with a twist but it is definitely you film, but for the rest of us, people in the real world, I would recommend saving you three hours of watch time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We had a great time bashing the majority of the unreal view. Maybe I'm feeling something .. I just can not believe in a movie that can beat Classic like HDDCS !!
