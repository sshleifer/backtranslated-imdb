Bug Bunny accidentally ends at the South Pole while trying Florida holidays. Where he met a little penquin, which he tried to save from an Eskimo. This little try and penquin adorable, but in the end it laughs somewhat lighter in the section. Eskimo is not really that great of a foil for the bug and when I was paired with other unknown antagonists I met many other well-known bug forest cartoons, even other shorts. So I can not recommend this one in good conscience. However it is nice to see it's void form. This cartoon is on disk 3 of "Lonny Tune's Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My grade: C
