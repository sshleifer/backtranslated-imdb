This film is a mix of clichés from a recent movie. There are some optimistic ideas, but when the director was apparently aiming to quarrel with a scary unclear film, what did he end up was a messy mess. Lead actor Danielle Wau did a perfect job, but with a central theme it does not seem that there is not much to work with. In addition, the film is mostly horrific (though, in fairness, there are some vague moments in the ugliness). <br /> <br /> * The mysterious death is the mysterious death of the twilight, the misleading librarians, the love of the former love, the identity confusion, the death by the barbarous monkeys, the adipisal contradiction, the humiliating parents, the proud homosexuality And criminal gang links The only real commonality of sharing these elements seems to be that they can reveal the nonsense obscure idea of ​​confusion and dissatisfaction. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this movie is that despite the death of the monkey firmly on the DVD cover, this law is not directly direct. Instead, director Julian Lee seems to be using the monkey footage - which is not too scary. <br /> <br /> * Last speaker * <br /> <br /> Avoid it. For a wonderful psychological, confused horror story, see Tail of Two Sisters (2003) in Korean film.
