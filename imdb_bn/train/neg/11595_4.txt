Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> At the end of the final photo, Elise defeated Freddy, <br /> Now trying to reconnect his life. But her unborn child is carrying a demon presence - Freddy, trying to get out of her world again <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kiss Sunshine, Catarl Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (lost space, producer 2). But Russell and Harleen did a good job, Hopkins IMO did something with this entry, a position that should be forgotten quickly. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly being spread with Freddie himself as a father and ridiculous demon monster. Even about one and a half hours, they become rather tedious, and of course, are not scary. <br /> <br /> "Sister's appetite, bitch" catch-phrase is the only memorable thing to be very forgotten entry. *
