I will not recommend it unless you are interested in David Copperfield and do not want to "complete the set". There are some good performances (e.g. Uri Hip) and well-known moments (for example, deadly), but it actually got actually compared to the BBC version of 1999 and earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There is an incredible change in the story, which in reality is not a big intention to stop it (turning stolen jewels into a point). The American cast was weakly selected: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong as Bates Trotwood, and her English accent is slightly better than Dick van Dyke's cocoon. I can see why Michael Richards was elected for Mr. Mikeby; He hams up a lot of it, and rather, becomes boring. He speaks his line in an pronunciation that transcends the pronunciation and becomes simply annoying. Anthony Andrews is tragic as Mr Murdestone, but one almost hopes that he will be black-capped and David's soil will be connected to the railroad (though perhaps partly due to Dickens's fault). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with a newspaper. It helped to pass on a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than finally charmed
