Hmm ?? I agree with critics, who said that "weird people of liberal nature are reviewing this movie". I thought the movie was quite interesting to watch. I think it was mainly because of Merceden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this image is absolutely psychologically compatible and on the other hand homophobic deeply. Thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs on the next. I'm not sure whether the film is intended for dialogue or promotion and promotion. <br /> <br /> I was thinking the role was moderate. A lot of conversations that asked questions about 90 degrees. I wanted to get some money from the plot, but in the end it's a conversation with crazy people (Speedman). Because of his loss, I (Speedman) feel sorry for him, but not really. Its loss is no bigger and certainly less important than the victims worldwide all over the world. <br /> <br /> Is this picture unknown to HIV / AIDS? Yes: The intended audience is that. HIV is a dark, mysterious, evil killer? What is the victims of this? There is no answer to both questions. There is less or less bad intention than HIV or its victims lupus, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, cancer, or their prey, for God's sake. It is not only deliberate or neglect - because it is just a disease-sensitive - or evil - it's just so. <br /> <br /> Excuse me to risk this ignorance or fool-power? - No. Should all people be safe sex? - Yes. Safe sex will save the world? - No. Safe and realistic in realistic and passionate people are realistic in all instances? ?? Of course not. If everyone follows the rules, we will live in life, no one has ever risked and sex was not spontaneous and enthusiastic. Do I neglect this photo especially with gay sex? ?? Yes HIV spreads through blood and body fluids in infected and infected people. Transmission is not necessary for sex, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always annoyed by a person's terrible violence. I did not really think that this picture has done a good job of describing Tommy's violent abduction, captivity and illogical apathy towards donation, and such insane violence happens every day. <br /> <br /> Image from the flow of cognition notes: Tom Mad. <br /> <br /> Why does Dan not ask "Why do you think", "What are you doing?" Implications: Men who have sex with men get "AIDS" imitated: HIV = Where was the responsibility of Tom to treat AIDS sex? Why Dan's liability for condom use? "You slipped it off before you stuck it out ??" What are we talking about here? Was one of the strangers? "Maybe he does not want to hear the truth" Are you kidding me "He got up in heaven and got incredibly hurt about what he knew about me" ?? Right ?? If Dan lives in HIV? Of course not! Why is this whole world so gay? The They think gay men are HIV because they will give the rest to the world, and we all die ?? Are you having fun with me ??? Is man really stupid to think that homosexuality is the cause ... problem? Do we feel skin patients in this way? Malaria? I can see that Tom was hit because of his wife's death, and he blamed AIDS, but seriously? Who is the fault here? Hunting or Virus? Illness is really a liability liability? (They do not think they want to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is essential for social security, but not so driving, flying, not leaving the house, or living. Do we really want to blame these patients? Safe sex between Tom and Dan will prevent Tom's wife's final death? Probably, but Dan is not the only responsibility <br /> <br /> Tom crazy. I've mentioned it. <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "You can get what you deserve" ?? Come on! Day 24: Violent, polite, and homophobic. <br /> <br /> What do I overreacting? Probably. But I think this film refers to a judges finger for their helpless and insulting motives towards "live world" with unsafe sexual orientation to gay men, when the rate of sexually transmitted gays is equal to or less than Hartirosis. We all have to wake up and be serious about HIV / AIDS. Every year thousands of HIV strains are killed in HIV.
