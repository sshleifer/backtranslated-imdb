It has different floating versions, so make sure you can identify a copied copy, otherwise there is a view of some grape and nudity. Some versions also exclude opening order and other bits here and there. The screen that I saw has the screen titled WitchCraft: The original release for Evil Encokers and DVD releases is released by the Shikke Show while maintaining the title of Witchcart. It looks like a beautiful face print and all the footage, but there are some crop / aspect ratio problems. In Italy, it was released as El Cassa 4 (Wecchraft). The first two were released by the first two El Cassa Evil DAD films (repetition) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmyrej), which is known here as the Goughhouses in America. To make matters even more confusing, the rehearsal was abandoned elsewhere as a GHHHouse. Without Germany, the GHHHouse 2 is actually OGRE: Daemons. 3. Okay, I'm going to stop now. I'm beginning to confuse myself! <br /> <br /> Despite the title, it is a very hit-or-miss horror attempt. It's some good, nothing. I was actually in this picture for the first half, but at the end it became an intelligent mess. A large, empty hotel located on an island about 50 miles away from Boston, is a mix of German-speaking Die Hild (Hildegard KÃ¶nif). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Wight Light" and his virgin authored girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying magic, has jumped into the hotel without permission. Alongside, real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) arrives, who shows the potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddy (Robert Champpen) Brooks. Tagging along is their children; Pregnant big girl Jane (Linda Blair) and a very young boy Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as foreign architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - then Hasselhoff's wife). When everyone goes inside, their boat driver dies (boats) and the boat disappears, so they trap themselves and basically look at the mercy of "Lady in Black". <br /> <br /> What can you expect? Find out here? Lots of overwhelming One of the characters has their lips off the lip and then flipped down in the fireplace and eventually slaughtered by the left cast. A crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a sword fish through the head, someone fire, a grab, a sesame road tape recorder, virgin, being raped by some monster, thanks to a boys vulgolo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technological standpoint, it is a beautifully filmed film with great filmmaking, a decent score and good influences. Hotel / Island setting is very nice. Blair (especially the end) and the juice both feel that they are having fun and are as desperate as the bad witch of the knee. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The occult themes are very annoying and confusing. When the characters were thrown into the sinking layer to torture and kill, the filmmakers decided to shout at shiny performers, shouting on the effect of red silence on the virtuous effects of the Varkooto. And the Dive Layer itself is designed with empty and cheaply incomplete woodwork. And when most casts are at least modest, a number of performances (especially "actresses" who play Haaselfhof's girlfriend and child) are so bad that they are constantly confusing
