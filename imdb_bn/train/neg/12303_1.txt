This movie is so bad that it's good - a strange fun way. I can not see it, I had so much smile! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, without it's a parody. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul Emily Wendell, Leak (Correa Sevier), who finally learned that we are in prison, plays a hard-working working wife for her. Sevier's only thing is guilty, but bad acting! If you think, he's worse than another actor. Actors * have no idea that they are actually in horror movies; They are playing it directly. Everything about movies is bad: acting, scripts, love scenes, pensing, plot twists, music choices. Climatic scenes are so ridiculous - firstly the church's shootout, then the final sound of Luke's Emily-I was shouting laughing. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Luke has crew many lifespan and Abu Cruch, and we found his naked smoke. Probably the highlight of this image.
