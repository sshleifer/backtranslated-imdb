There is only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: It reminds you how bad it might be to you. We often look at movies that we describe as "pretty horror" or "not very good", then you come across such a movie and you can see that not all other movies are "good" but they are as bad as stupid bulletproof. It was a birthday gift, which spent less than two seconds (in order to give me a gift) through the DVD durbar bin transactions in our local superstars. It could be an incognito search but it was not: It is so thoroughly written, written so badly, so badly operated, acting so badly that I am astonished and not arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's awful. I suspected more than 30 seconds, but sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad they can be enjoyable. This is not one of them. It's simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, I'll throw him bint tomorrow.
