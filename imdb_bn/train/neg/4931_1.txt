At this moment, we got a Junket "Cheyenne" manufacturer (called "Joe Petto") (who found it?) Who killed people and survived, made bad toys. He goes to the family where he lives only in the same house where he and his mutant Robot son "Pino" (again, find this?) Lived. <br /> <br /> is the worst (and optimistic [lasting] last) in this half-series, it's one and the same as soft-core porn movies, but without gender and nudity. It's like "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Doll" and low-cost hybrids of bad home movies. In 2000 they began to start six chapters of the series, but it was abandoned and never ended. We all hope that it will remain ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
