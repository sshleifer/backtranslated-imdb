The living dead hood is a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma City, where drug dealers and prostitutes are filled with streets. Then one night, Rick's brother shot while driving under the street fighting with his brother earlier. Frustrating, Rick urged his scientist partner to bring his latest source, which brings sick blood cells for health. The formula was not tested on humans, even the dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives a double dose of body formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and only the body is confiscated to return to the human life and the banquet. Rick will be able to find his jumbo brother before the whole hood is transformed around the death. One Piece of the Living Dead Trash Trash This plot is a direct fraud of Resident Evil, it is very terrible, especially for his brother, Rick's nets are crying, guns are so fraud, because every time the weapon is fired, it sends sparks and make-up is lame. In front of actors it is just fake blood. Zombies are also fixed. They must run, roar, and heart enemies in the shot! Zombies should not only scuffle, cry, and must be shot in the brain by the enemy! This picture is so awesome, the only true moment of this movie. Living Dead Hood is 3 out of 10, little entertainment is here and there, but it only succeeds as a festival of low budget crunching.
