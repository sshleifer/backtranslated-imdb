I enjoyed the previous Etenbaek movie that I saw, "The moon is burning". But the movie was rather poor and nasty, "Romutos" often played to laugh and laugh. It is commendable when itnebak how the film was not created without any meaning in its spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth it), I look forward to fighting myself as soon as possible in the next Gore scene. Of course, there's Gore, and if you want to go ahead and enjoy it. But be careful: there is a strange amount of hair comedy and tiring stories. Many people are likened to Peter Jackson's film, especially "Branded". But Jackson looked at similar budgets in "bad taste", it is clear that there is a lack of things that Jackson of Ittenbacher has - talent. 3/10 (for good and abundant effects and limited resources to get the most - but the money I paid is not worth it)
