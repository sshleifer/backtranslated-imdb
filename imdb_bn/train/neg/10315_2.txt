I can not believe that people thought that this trash of trash was fun. The attempts at humor in cruelty, hatred and idiocy have shifted, 'There is something about Mary' to leave a little reason to stay in the end Sure, Cameron Diaz is very nice, but it will not be enough to save a movie. Ben Stilla works hard to work in the plot, and of course very talented, but losing the movie. <br /> <br /> Once a view of the scene was not credible. The shot is made badly and time badly. Farreley's brothers should keep away from making movies at all costs. I checked the IMDB and saw what they are working so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; Bonus I laugh at one moment. It's not like humorous or alone defense from my opinion. My wife is very hated The next day we saw the 'Rush Hour' and smiled at myself. This movie just stunk.
