I guess this film is based on a real story ... It is about two young girls who mocked an old man for 48 hours. I do not see where terrorism comes here ... There are some "strange" and "miracles" clues in the film. And two girls (Sandra lock and ... Ah ... oh well) are playing two psycho-men disgusting ... they do a great job (even though its top is only a tad topped). The movie is not good and it is not awesome; It really is really dated! I mean this thing is going to sink with 70. If you like things that's not really bad ... you know ... that thong?
