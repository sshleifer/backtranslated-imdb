Jennifer Jason Leigh and Murray Winhingham are a good match by illustrating a lot of good brothers, but only Winnhingham is able to bring something credible or substantial to his role. Leigh, bar band singer and Alcoholic Sadi Flute, continuously praised singer from Old Seas Georgia, Jonny Mitchell Mould. Perhaps due to his dual responsibility as the photo co-producer, Leigh seems to be calling himself a corner: he is not as believable as a singer and even deliberately, he gives himself a much more screen-time microphone. Probably a tour-de-force is expected, Leigh is drawn and nervous and messy; However, we are not able to see any talent in this character (Leigh is definitely a strong actress, but she decides to keep away from us). If Saadi had even slightest curiosity or appeal, then we can imagine that she gets a break (small) that she does, which she does. Since, the chances of getting on the stage are diminished. Director Oulu Gosherbard wrote some intense dramatic series of crafts and the editing in Finlay adjusted the performances of Sadie Bar with Georgia's sell-out angina show - both sing the same song - and this is a tragic moment ... but what is the point? * **** to 1/2
