"Shadrach" was not my favorite kind of movie. I found it overly emotional and the actors were below equal. Harvey Kettle and Andy McDowell were good but some of the other actors were not credible. I do not believe Paul's parents will leave and leave him with the dubny family, especially when they had their home. Their social classes were too far away for this credible consideration. It seems that Dabney's lifestyle was very hugely. At the beginning of the movie there was a scene that Andy McDowell was coming out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was it? His son What was supposed to be seen in the scene? Why was the scene even included? It was nothing to do with the rest of the film, and in fact it was not directed again. It is unimpressive and does not look right at all in the story. There were many inconsistencies in the movie for me. The story about Shadrach was beautiful, but I was not convinced that Dabnira was kind and generous to be portrayed.
