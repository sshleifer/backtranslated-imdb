Playing in movies is often a bad idea because they are two different mediums. Do you think ZULU is a great idea for playing at a stage? Imagine that the two heroic red kotes are sitting in a tent where "Blimy has thousands of them" great movies and a bad stage game <br /> <br /> There are two essential requirements to play at a stage of making great movies <br /> <br /> 1) A fine cast made on screen chemistry <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paper on Chairs and Chase Polyminity will prefer a good casting but this land Do not Parimintry travels around this hit-man, enters the house to kill a wife acting with a chairs in the house with most of the activities taken from inside the house. I did not take these two letters seriously though it was probably the script's fault, it can not decide if it can be serious or funny. Since the story is very stable, it is very embarrassing for most of the conversations, because of the impressive fascinating impressive mindset of dialogue, it is very important that it revolves around sex. If you want to see a great translation of a stage transferred to silver screen but it is a miss and 12 instead of ANGY MEN.
