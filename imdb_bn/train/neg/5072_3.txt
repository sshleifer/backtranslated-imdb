And a self-admission to boot. At one point, the doctor's assistant mentioned himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> The computer can not be used to replace or rebuild brain functions with increasing concepts, this film does not spend enough time for the premiere. During most screening, girlfriend-in-a-coma split between domestic disputes and behind the brain's killer killer. This is a scientific-drama / drama / thriller attempt but which of the three fails to deliver. <br /> <br /> As the restoration of Frankenstein, it is missing everything from the original. Nobody is afraid to make a doctor crazy or even get admitted to hospital. The transformation scene is about to open up a coma victim and create it in an amazing computer that is not even shown. There is no praise when testing works, and when it starts to be wrong, there is little response. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Possible suspect. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing a person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco is overplayed and underused both as a setting. The surplus sequence seems to be happening in SMA, it plays a significant role in a cable, this mountain resides in Halopostion, gives a look of Pier 39 and ends with the final ceremony in the Golden Gate Park. More specifically, with ten feet of steep side in the park - the picture is always enough to keep the bridge. Once the obvious scenes are enclosed, no other effort is made to explore the city once. <br /> <br /> Acting here is the only saving grace. Care Dulla shows a good range and actually blocks some of the mental scenes. Suzanne portrays love to recover from a coma well. Tony Curtis receives only a boxer in line and many miscreants strue with most of Frankencia's interpretation by his assistant. <br /> <br /> I also gave an extra star for the scene, where the car drives from the bridge to the south, it falls into a u-turn in an irrelevant parking lot. , And then he returned to the North Drive bridge immediately. It takes a whole lot of things - courage, ignorance, timeout - try and slip it by the viewer during a single drive.
