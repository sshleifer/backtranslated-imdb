The title says it all. "Tailor Gunner Joe" was a tag given to Senator, which relied on public ignorance about World War II aircraft. The rear-facing guns were dependent on a stick that would prevent the gun from shooting the previous gunman's shot from the tail and preventing the gun. When Senator was practicing on the ground one day, he succeeded in shooting the tail of the plane. He could not do that if the gun had been properly connected. The gunman's officer is responsible for accepting, in front of the camera, he was responsible - he created errors, not a senator. The film does not really report, it shows how it is viewed unilaterally. This image was designed to do one thing, destroys the reputation of a complicated person. <br /> <br /> PBS was a very good program on it. He is a hard-working, intelligent, ambitious politician who has overcome tremendous difficulties in the development of great height. He made some mistakes, made some serious mistakes, but none of them were shooting an air tail tail. <br /> <br /> Popularity of this picture likes general stories, the one-sided story that they do not have to worry about.
