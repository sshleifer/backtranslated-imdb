Well, what was fun ... without fun part <br /> <br /> <br /> This is my second least darling, even I thought it was worse than 'Lazar' and 'Ghost in Machine'. <Br> <br /> Start with good. Teaser, it worked incredibly well and was also emotional. I was curious to see so beautiful creatures of this episode, as that great animal lover. <br /> <br /> But then all is bad, and I believe there are a lot of it. Little sense, that animal is abducted by the aliens and is being delivered? whaaa ??? The dialog was very awkward. There were about one or two cited lines. <br /> <br /> Worse, all of whom were vivacious and vivacious living souls were very unpleasant for me. What is the point at the end? They all died quite a lot. We did not learn anything, we had no entertainment, I did not get sorrow over the death of Sophia ... only very frustrating <br /> <br /> * Star Shame because the season 2 is doing so well.
