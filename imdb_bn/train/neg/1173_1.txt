If I had only one camera which wrongly adhered to the floor, only for every shot, enough film, and then lost that film and was forced to upload some digital video tapes to some mobile phones and was forced to film around two hours of French Revolution, And there was no set and my 4-year-old autistic son painted the backgrounds I was also the only actor I ever found, who did not make so much of the soap opera auditions of that year, and I was not forced to use any music in the movie, and the zoom function of the camera did not work in addition to the one time, it started accidentally zooming and ' Oh, if I hate my audience, then I can do something like this terrible, but in the wrong way, I will The proper waste of his name. The whole grand looking but totally fake looking backdrop reminded me of the latest creations of George Lucas, which made it even more frustrating because through the whole film, I had the hope that behind the film, the film was a lightaber dual / space laser war height. I do not want to hide the movie for those who did not see it, but it's not how it ends. The only thing that I can think of is that the film has been lost for more than a year, writing this review. Peace be upon
