This movie was an endless surprise tension pack! When you thought it could not be worse, they added more pink and fiji-rain van with more woke and cook scenes. As you can guess, I was hunting the original version. We saw Supervanan, the host box that lays down the garrison, the prison breaks, and more. Who might have been so much fun to present a dollar store Christmas!
