I always liked Spike Lee's movie, but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I hope more about Sam's son, and instead of rarely got a movie with the serial killings of 1977. Talking dogs were ridiculous (you know that you're struggling when all the film's sponsors laugh laughingly). The whole movie was very fun and not very interesting. The sexual scenes plot was completely irrelevent. I do not oppose sex in movies, but it should have some points (until it is a XXX movie). Above all, we are very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort !!
