This plot is very helpful, the decisions of each parent are fully calculated on the most incredible and unknown decisions of adults. As far as the children are extreme and superb like the linear delivery, but I say that the whole plot depends on the complete foolishness of every adult, and in that case, the only way to explain the actions of the boys of total disbelief (and at the same time) their actions. Why would the charming little boys take a baby from a baby? The child reached the edge and at the same time why was it the last place of search? Why should not two boys be told at the same time in the absence of children that in the absence of any child, one can not rotate around their diet and diapers and literally sinks with the places it is searched for? There is no possible reason to ask viewers to believe this. After believing it will be asked that it is very painful for the trial (even formal settings).
