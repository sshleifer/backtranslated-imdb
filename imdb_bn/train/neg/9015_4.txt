The first 45 minutes of the Dragon Warrior are fully acceptable and are surprisingly watchable. Characters are credible and attractive. The cloning lab looks really high technology. Then, it collapses all. Characters begin foolishly, and a new subhead is introduced to a synthesis furnace (and it is supposedly "present day"), since a new sub-plot is introduced, which is the only plot support it needs to kill the dragon - only it 't. The finish is incredibly weak. It is astonishing that the movie has started so well that it has become so wrong. <br /> <br /> The Russians played all the characters except Dean Kain. In his peculiar circumstances and details, such as Vesela Dimitrova, the character played by "Bailey Kent" (and then, on an occasion, vaguely switching to Spanish *) despite its heavy pronunciation; <br /> <br> Due to the start, I considered this movie as Rating 5, but it is really more frustrating, so I only gave it 4.
