A series killer died in a snowstorm and mutated in Snowman's evil wicked frosty. Then a killer spree is gone. Interesting plot Scary words And it's scary. You are five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of delicious. I saw it on the wire and I'm happy that I did not pay to see it. This is a low-budget movie, all the elegance and style which can be a full-length film. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I just do it. Although I did not like the movie completely, I was happy to see some scenes. Bathtub views and post-explosion scenes, such as Passo References. Hackers were enjoyable in many ways trying to kill Jack, and he just does not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low budget B-movie comedy, but the low-budget B-movie horror.
