I saw that movie, and I was shocked! Robert Carllele is not Hitler, he is a man who tragically tried to be Hitler. Movie is false, it does not reflect the truth. The scene hit Hitler with a gun. Hitler did not hit anyone, he would not hurt the man with his fist, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understanding ?? Another thing is: it is very clear that Hitler is so evil, he is even more clever than shown in this film. No German has accepted him as leader, because he can see that he is evil. So true Hitler has not shown his bad side to the people. <br /> <br /> Have you seen any Yankee film "Dere Untergang" or "Dunfelf"? With this extraordinary actor, a great movie. And it's a German movie. I think this Nazi-German theme should not be perceived as a film that does not know anything from Germany. The Book! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> This is a great movie about a very sad time for people Across the globe
