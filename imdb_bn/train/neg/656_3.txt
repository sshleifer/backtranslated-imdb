Note: I could not force myself to compose a constructive review of Promoting Night. It just can not be done. Instead, I went through the way I thought about watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The things I thought when I was watching Pramos night: <br /> <br /> - This huge death will happen to me so tired of that dream, he will wake up only before biting it for the main character. Of course, when I talk about "broad death", I mean throat slash or stab closure. Was Dallas the whole "It's just a dream"? Which is saying, I wonder if a couple stabs will be the cause of death immediately, wondering. <br /> <br /> - In just ten minutes of the film and I can already count two hands horrible clich√©s. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - After meeting with the hero's boyfriend, I'm sure he will die. Anyone want to set bits? <br /> <br /> - A teacher murdered by this movie who is obsessed with donor's main character (By the way, does anyone think that "Donna" is a horrific name for the main character of a horror movie?) He spent three years in the highest security prison before breaking and celebrating Donna's high school promotion. Although there is no accounting for taste, I am amazed that whoever takes this time to take someone as inferior to take it. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow promotions in hotels and do not keep track of students. Apparently the students fully buy a hotel room and they are able to please inside and out. I think if this is not a plot point, then the movie will be disturbed by the mind of 90 minutes and they will throw dust only when they go to the bathroom. I feel annoying to pronounce my speech with everything off to trade for their tensions. I've already "counted the pieces of bubble chew under the seat" and "my wallet is estimating how much money I have" and I only mark 20 minutes. How do I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> Note: Do not forget the milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> - Favorite Image Writer: You used the fame enough to get this movie <br /> <br /> The 1980 version of this movie was not good, but this was compared to this reunion in citizen kan, or at least the Godfather Like it It was one of Hamari's most dressed clothes by Jamie Lee Curtis, and at the end there was a little "turn". I miss jammy li I want to act more. <br /> <br /> - Certainly not many dances are going on in the prom. Instead, they get fights with their lovers to plan to attend college. I have raised these colleges by name, and I can not help but who will have to cheat for these girls' entrance exams? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up her mess in the scene. The only logical explanation for killing someone in the carpet or in the bathroom and at the same time some people can enter the hotel, there is no sign of any struggle. (On the other hand, note: this is a very lazy killer, Michael Mayares has been hunted for his prey.) <br /> <br /> - It's official: In the theater, the whole audience is firing at the killers. Does it trigger? Whenever Donna returned to his hotel room, all the members of the Serena ordered to get out of the building? Was he a constant dream, and after some dramatic events in his dream, did he stress his strategy to reconsider his move? Or was Brittany Snow's inconsistent performance? I would say it was all of the above. <br /> <br /> - OK, who "closes the screen in the third phase"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - Finally, the end of the movie. My friend activates me and says "Donna was not very smart." That is the week's understatement. Like a tornado, a small smell of air, or a week's long-lasting power loss is like a little inconvenience. <br /> <br /> I get Rotten Tomatoes and do not see anyone waiting to move a preferential review. <br /> <br /> - I can not recommend it. I refuse to recommend this. This is lazy like a horror film, and the only way to enjoy your cheese scent is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for the theater patrons, Alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * **** Outside
