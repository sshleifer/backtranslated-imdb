This image was very well-advised. I'm an enthusiast movie girl and I've seen the preview for this movie for several months. Although I was really skeptical about how funny this movie might be, my friends thought it was going to be great and highlighted me about it. Then I went and saw myself sitting in my seat, I fell asleep until I thought that I paid for this movie. I laugh most of the things in the movie, so I did not feel bad and would spoil the good mood, plus I want to get out of the movie! I always go to a movie with an open mind, I do not try to go with them in many hopes, but this movie was not funny. Now I've never seen the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. You have seen so many previews for the movie or you want to enjoy it and enjoy it, but the real comedy fan asks you to pass the ID. Maybe check out the Comedy King again. Meet me with parents to say something !!!
