I was scared about my nephew in this movie, because I do not think it would be good to do it. The kids, 6 and 10 years old are set to see it, so I caved I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but there was still much cry from the book. The film seemed right with the feeling of 10 years old intellect and humor. I saw what the 6-year-old understood and presented the solution to the issues he took. I finally explained that movies sometimes do not show the best solutions for the problem because it is more fun to see what might happen if it makes "stupid" or "fools" choices.
