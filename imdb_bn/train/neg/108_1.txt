Prosas: nothing <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A female reporter is running in a hetihaker who tells people about the story of death's death. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never In The Day Of The King The Junko's Chronicles Illustrating in a budget of around 20 bucks, TZC is a complete horror film that relies on Langi, wonderful actors, who can not work to save their lives and it is more serious than being scared. How is a movie like this made? Simply tell, avoid TZC like sexually transmitted diseases. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: laughingly enough, this film was made by a film company named Breanne Damage Films. They certainly have been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this kind of brain. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 out of 1 (if it was me, this movie will get negative ratings bajillion)
