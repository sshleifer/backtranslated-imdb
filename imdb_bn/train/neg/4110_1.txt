He does not have 7 feet of a game in Dynamite basketball, his skill sets do not apply in this context, and his inconsistency is delicious. <br /> <br /> True behavior, though Miss Eastwood, who is unable to speak, is so expressive in English, I actually did him Google, he wanted to know that he was a Russian beauty who understood his meaning as well as his lines. But no: she's just a talented American who will let you laugh with every line of reducing. Whether there should be an open question whether the line should be understood or not understood.
