I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised great view and music. I was a great fan of the same movie ... Barka Barka, wide angle, very short shot with cameras to cross the length of each shot, the film is very much composed. Even some of the scenes were identical (road with traffic). When Barka told a great story about nature, man-made environment of nature, spirituality and shocking fashion and a great story about the horror of the world around great music, this movie jumped from the shot, an extraordinary story, medieval music score and then. POOF, it's over! I think there must be something wrong! World history? Half the movie looks like Egypt and landscape (Arizona, but I do not bother to check). People fiercely, this is awesome, if you must rent, but do not buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this in.
