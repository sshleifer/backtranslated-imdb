How Irish critics rave me out of this movie is beyond me. Irish actors pulled out for each Irish movie covered by the usual band. Horrible scripts with forced character quirks (brown sauce). Romanticising all that bad about Dublin 'A's attitude, it's a dump but it sure is not all the same great'. Lots of tidbits perfectly for the American audience (supermarkets market and its terrific compulsory catchphrase). And the coffin nail was the character of pen mine. A great actor is forced to play this part, which can be a five year old writer. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie has been dropped, and it seems bad to you. Well, at least he was not putting on his awesome American accent. The international audience will be warned: stay home and watch snap and lock stocks. You will have a good time. Intermission is a walk outside
