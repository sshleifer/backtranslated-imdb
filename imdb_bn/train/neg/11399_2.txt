I can not believe I saw 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie that I am going to be good at the end but the boy was wrong. The plot was unrealistic, the acting was extremely poor and special effects were awful. Even 2 beautiful girls can not revive my interest in this annoying and bloody world. But I can not tell the lie, some lines of the film were quite memorable, such as the Asian boy said, "I've lost my virginity to kids so f **** stereotypes" <br /> <br /> If you're not ready or Do not waste your time with this crash if you want to laugh .. Perhaps you can see this movie to accompany some mate.
