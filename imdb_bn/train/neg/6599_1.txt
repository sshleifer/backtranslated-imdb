Who was George C Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Actually close enough for any movie that she was in her. Now Ol's is not able to do anything with this film ... but once he has said something that will tell the story to T. <br /> <br /> I do not think his exact words, but he can basically say that the great writing can save the bad performance, but can not save great acting bad writing. This little observation was not more than "Lorele and Hardy of the All New Adventures: Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All) imitate them very well. This genre of their movies should stand as a lasting deal. That is, when you come face to face, you fall in the face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Much time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I did not want to know why the beautiful British lady wants to kidnap? I want to see Stan and Wali (or at least, their stand-in). The plot was not too long to explain the plot to the screen and was not always dedicated to explaining to secondary characters. This plot revolves around <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most of the jokes are called "watched-down" skeptics. Call. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, how about Lorel and Hardy?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " And the movie makers play it for ridiculous effects. Maybe an illustration will help: <br /> <br /> Luni Tune, Duffy Duck Picture Elmer Fad. His bill fell off and he kept it back. That's the classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> This "gem", Ollie accidentally binds into some people. They turn around, tell them to be careful, and continue their delightful way. That's not the slapstick. That's not even funny. It's just ... annoying ... and this movie is full of jokes in this kind of. It seems that they are the bread and butter of the film. The authors and directors accept these gentle moments and they are supposed to be funny. Please, the example I gave is the most extreme event, but I can only slip it too much. <br /> <br /> Long story short: The picture does not work because Pintut's script fails to capitalize. And the power to rattle Stan and Wooly in disguise. Instead, the script capitalizes on plot expositions and Lam Jokes. Seeing this movie is basically shown two wonderful incognito, with whom no real element was given. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but incredible sleep help. <br /> <br /> I'm saying it's a miss with a real miss and long as the stick (as long as you carry "Atoll Who" and "Be Big").
