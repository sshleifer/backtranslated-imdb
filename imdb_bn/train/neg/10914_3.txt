What is not frustrating is that a nostalgic life suddenly becomes abhorrent, pushing his life backwards and learning some valuable lessons along the way? The formula that does not get old, is not it? It's such a sure-fire way to make a classic film! See big hits like Leah Leer and Big! ... it must have been Rob Skinner's line of thought when he made the semi-successful Dude Bigelow: Male Gigolo and the animal followed it. Since I already detected the plot through the conformity, let me paint more: Shendar plays a depressing police, who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery ..., like a horse in an inappropriate time, like a horse, like a leopard Run etc. This is a little more favorite like the other Snyder-Starring Flicks of the movie (such as a Lang-same-Plot Followup Hot Chuck), but it seems almost as if they were dancing to the romantic lead of the audience ("Survivor" from Colin Hassell) and inserting a camera from soft McDonald The reality TV star wants to hate it by casting it. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing memorably good without production value. When I finished this review, I wanted to say that a little reference to other movies is okay in the movie, but when the lines are delivered exactly the same way ("you can do it!") Then there is a word for it - "milking." Actually, here's another word - "cheap."
