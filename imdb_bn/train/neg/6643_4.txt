Terminus paradises were exceptional, but "Niki Ardelean" came very late. We already have this enough and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Big directors do not have any problems beyond their time, not back. Why do people see only Romania as a post-evolving country? <br /> <br /> We are born not only reborn, and someone gives a ** ** ** in the old times. Most people do not remember or remember, and the new generation of movie consumers do not understand a bit. The first day of the roman movie will be the final song - private! Maybe small managers should take steps.
