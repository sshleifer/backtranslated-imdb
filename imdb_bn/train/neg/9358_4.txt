From the moment the movie starts, there is already a isolation. This film takes place on the border between Normand and the Middle East, and it also portrays a correct word as an international film. Most Americans do not do this like custom sound. Also, I can best reproduce the acting, it is a little hard to follow from the beginning. Who is that? Otherwise the film is very accurate in clothing and footage. If you would like to see a movie to feel as it was in the past (though without the scope of the act) this movie is worth the rent. If you are looking for a movie as an epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
