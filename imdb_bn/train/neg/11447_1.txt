Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to walk after the first ten minutes. Twiners were the only people to laugh at the theater. Do not make me wrong, I like silent, stupid movies like the next cheek, but the whole compound, writing and humor. I think they think of "Napoleonic Dynamite" - a strange and random view that will lead to a worshiper's audience. Instead, it has ended to be forced, weird and weird. The only bright light was Isla Fisher, and I was scared that he (and CC Spaces) signed up for this terrible thing. <BR> <br /> Thank you, thank you, I did not pay for it.
