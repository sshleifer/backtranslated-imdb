This is a tyrannical movie. Two tragic young women deceive and oppress the middle-aged men. There is not much to give away about a plot or a "spoiler". I would only comment on the flick's most annoying part of that end. Most of the pictures are locked and camped, which is psychologically consolidating in the camera. It is a soundtrack that repeats, with a videvialian song about "favorite old father", which suggests a cruel quality that the visitor does not actually see. Music is boring first, then influences the viewer rather than the persecution of the audience than what is pictured on the screen. The theme here is youth amok run, understandable as' 60's response, but done with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
