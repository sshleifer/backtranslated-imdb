Funky Forest to Speak: The first contact is an understatement of a bad movie's incredible proportion. I can really go to a good art house film, even in El Topo, Naked Lunch and Stevev 5+ live romantic and curious romp, because there are really valuable discussions during the rolling of these movies. <br /> <br /> FFCC tries to be this greatness and intellectual in every way, essentially, there is no substance in this film. This movie has been done badly, the scenes of this movie are not inspirational, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie. I made chocolate for guitar brothers, but it was immediately removed by some unnecessary and irrelevant. I tried to think it deep and meaningful, but it's just a very nonsense folly. Without the camera, students of Freshman films can create more interesting things. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and Skit Routines get 1 point each, everything else is very poorly, pseudo-creative, heavy intervention efforts. Other genuine directors such as Sogo Isis, David Lynch and Jodvovsky's films are as good. Give me a break. I am convinced that the people who are annoyed at the FFCC are doing this because they have no idea what they saw, because it was nothing but a lightly relevant statement, and there you will be immersed in your shoes until you are mixed with stupidity and mixing. <br /> <br /> This movie was extremely frustrating, Style 5+ Survival was coming out of high quality, actually a movie that is really meaningful, cinematography, interesting conversations, funny moments, good soundtracks, excellent performance, excellent pacing and Flow FFFC is the perfect opposite, annoying scenery in every way (20 minutes of a night walk on a blue sea beach? The entire white stage? The alien ball is floating in white space? A strange school hallway and then a ... school hallway?), Terrible cinematography, wonderful dialogue, Not funny or ridiculous, you only have two hours, your soundtracks ?, amateur acting, uneven, disturbed, and often Yacim drag plane, save a zero flow. <br /> <br /> There is something claiming that makes FFFC a great movie, its pure talent that is so incomplete at every moment. It's just a way to stroke your own ego, because it can be a good value for "non-directional" movies if it is not related to "boring", "vain" and "terrible". Personally I've talked to two people who admitted me that when FFCCC was terrible when they left the theater, the Art House Eliteist's extraordinary silence showed them the film again and then came back to me again ... "Hey, it was very good. Like it ". <br /> <br /> I'm going into my legs, this movie has diminished, Roger Ebert said that the film is the best thing he has ever seen to lose his virginity. "Emperor's New Clock" I say ... this film does not give any direction from the Japanese to cycling / trippie from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of tea, party 7 and kamikaze girls can not be compared with many good films (even with low budget), and honest 5+ survivors. See FFFC only if you are interested in a chaos pill in the SHOESTING budget.
