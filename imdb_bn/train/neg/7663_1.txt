Constantine as a Dollar Store and Stephen Dorf as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as they read ... Well it is Stefhen DORFF for Christ's Sake !!!! I personally like to thank those brilliant casting directors for hard work and effort. You guys are My low humorous opinion like the public in public, but it follows directly with your previous choices, discovering a film about the brightest neuro-physicist in history that invented a pill for the treatment of all diseases known to humans and could get it. They have to play Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I would love to tell you that. Seriously though you give me $ 7.50.
