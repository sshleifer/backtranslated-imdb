It's not the best made slasher movie of all time, but for what it is, it's quite fun. The plot is not too bad but the murder is very bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the featured bands in this movie, you will not find this movie as fun. I knew a person who saw this movie and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you must understand that it was made during the trip to have extra time, play with children of mosquitoes, and drink as soon as you return with friends. It will not be taken seriously. It is the best of its punk and Ubber cheese with more than 100 murders, which is mostly very poor, it's a fun movie that can be seen by friends, drinking and being delighted!
