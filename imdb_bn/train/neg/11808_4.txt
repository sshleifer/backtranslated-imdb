An example of this 1973 classic 1944 Billy Winger movie "Double Edmnition" is a textbook to destroy a great script in the rimak. This grade-B TV sheets also generally illustrates remakes folly. Hollywood has gone after greedy executives, who paint claims of black and white films, and claims in wide screen movies shown in Pan-O-scan versions, the industry ignores hacks that take and adapt to the classic film. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Billy-Willeder-Raymond-Chandler's work was spent half an hour, in the end the film was made for a specific time-slot for a specified time. Then update the production with mix, color photography, smart, upscale set, and TV-known actors. Thus, brand-new "dual compensation" excludes cinematography from atmospheric black and white film-nir, which enhances the mood and character characteristics of the roots. Dusty, galaxies, clustrophobic sets have gone, requiring the wishes of the people to escape from any of their circumstances. Loose lovers between Keyes and Saif and Loch and Phyllis. <br /> <br /> The film, which focuses on "Dual Damage" of Jack Smight, is more than "Dynasty". There is a designer home for Phyllis Dietrickson, and Naffe's comfortable pad will be difficult to afford for an insurance salesman, he does not mention that driving Mercedes is convertible. Both characters have no clear purpose to kill for a minimum $ 200,000. If there is no money, then perhaps love or murder for love? Not in this version. Richard Krena shows little interest in Samantha Eger and their kiss is like radioactivity between brothers and sisters. Carna failed to catch superfamination, and her attempts to bi-sexual and sexual counsel were horrified. The egg is a little better and lacks sensitivity and depth, which suggests internal work of a supposed ghostly and impressive mind. Only Lee. What cobbles do a credible performance like. Director Jack Smith and his three principals did a lot of good work. <br /> <br /> There is no idea of ​​creating this rogue reconciliation without meeting the time in the broadcast schedule. The DVD did not have any convincing reason to revive this bud and it packed it without filling a double-disc package with a real movie. The only text that can learn from this Mufffire is that a great scripts and great dialogue can be devastating by poor casting, lack of direction and TV grade production standards. 1973 "Double compensation" title should be "10% Compensation," because it only reduces 100% fulfillment of the original film.
