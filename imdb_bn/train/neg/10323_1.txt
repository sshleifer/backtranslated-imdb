I was excited to see a seatmaker who would hopefully represent the Indian Kandians, but I did not consider this shot to be funny. The producers and cast are likely to get back both bad and good feeds because they are worried about being talked about! I was prepared for some stereotyping and there was no problem with it because the reasons were present for one reason, they are usually true. But there really was nothing interesting about this stereotypical character. "Boat is new" Dad, who does not understand his daughter. Radical feminist Muslim daughter (who is a terrible actress), and young modern Indian person is trying to politically correct her mosque (she is a beautiful actor, I only see her better). <Br> <br /> It is very strong and the dialog is not well flowing. It was so likely to do something like that, but sadly, I think it failed and did not look at any other episode. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed watching Canadian actress Rock McCarthy, she is always a treatment and natural for her works, her daughter has no bad acting ability in the show!
