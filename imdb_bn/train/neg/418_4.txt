Good idea as an "invisible man" will work well and can handle more carefully with the age of superb special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the mad-scientists jumped into the early 20th of the film in the early 50's. There are some great moments, most amazing special effects and the idea of ​​the invisible people walking on the street. But soon, we have returned to the hypocritical prison in the underground lab, which means that the rest is not only expected, but planned. <br /> <br /> There have been many remakes of old movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it is becoming clear and clear for every movie that the idea of ​​the Old Classics under the crazy crazy nose like Woroevane (whose moments are) is very bad. It is clear that the meaning here is the basic problem: time and energy are not quite close to the script, and as a result, "Hall Man" is critically disappointed with the lack of cleanies, dapi letters, predictions and no depth. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the impact that made me particularly influenced was the oath. While making such films, modern producers are very keen to see their kids. Therefore, language (and, sometimes, violence and sex) is too tensioned. When the whole world flees, the good guys go out "Oh Darna!" And "oh my god" "Hall Man" grants gratitude to those kinds of hypocrisy and gives freedom to know what the characters say to them the most natural. I am not saying that the most natural response to something wrong is made - but if someone swears, it makes it more credible. I think we can thank Verhoeven for her.
