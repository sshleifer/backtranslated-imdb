At the time when the director was pursuing this plot, something went wrong at some point in time. The movie failed to deliver every aspect of movie making, with the permission of rebuilding the most favorite movies in the movie. Artists can not take the best of the film, which shows that the movie itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The edit is poor. The instruction is shit. Acting is out of this world (omg)! Those who are laughing at their dialogue and the stupidity of their clothes, their characters look laughing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a free burger with it.
