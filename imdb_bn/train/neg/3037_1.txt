One of its stereooptical MTV generation dance movies, and I do not see where it's all about 'Not bad'. Acting horror, it follows the same story since all other 'dances' are in the movie. It's terrible! The name should not be shouted. 'How is he moving?' As you can ignore movie title grammar? At least some dance movies had half-decent dance scenes, these are not even worth a watch. Because I have it out of a 10, just because there's zero. I do not seriously request any more than 60 years of IQ to see it, and do not waste your money. All say at 1.6 / 10. This movie should not even be made.
