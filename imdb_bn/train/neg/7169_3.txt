This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, the small enslaved, Alice and Jared Harris are imitating Christopher Walken which makes this movie entertaining. Alice smoking, when her name is called, the listener and the unusual way are strange and interesting. Jared should be praised for imitating Christopher Walken, and Christopher Walken's permission to remain in the film.
