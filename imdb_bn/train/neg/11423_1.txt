What happened in the making of this movie so that it gets accustomed? One year after "The Breakfast Breakfast", a brilliant film with the same actors like "Saint Elmo Fire" (who had looked at the novel and played it later, as it was still a high school graduation from the former, but without solidarity or discipline to film their roles. <br /> <br /> This was the point of instruction or writing, since it is both of the same person (Joel Shamker) But from then on, the gospel has given us "The Phantom of the Opera", "Phone Booth", "A Tie Tie to Kill", and two Batman films, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman forever", which are good to great direction. There was something wrong with "Stef" because it has no talent, no comedy is worth it, and the sign of life's true value is very far away. <br /> <br />: The character Oz Enda (A hearty little girl with heart and help low lucky man guided by Murray Wienhigham) Billy (who feeds his wife and his girlfriend with a helpless slogan that drinks too much), and there is no sense of right by his own way of Rob Loy. ) He is still a virgin. Billy really see a challenge and possible victory but Wendy is not "ready". Wendy is not so ready, it's faith in the beliefs of friends. Later in the story, when Billy takes his wife to his child and marries another, Billy grasps some strings of his life together. Billy is going to New York, to convince Vendi that her child is to leave all parental responsibilities and leave her child, that her virginity will be perfected from her "without gifts" to him. And breaks, those who work as a social worker for the broken family, do not seem to be relaunched by this solitary all the time. Give me a break. One thing that he can give once, does he give to the victims who leave his family and friends? This scene of ShuMakhara frames as a wonderful and sensitive moment. <br /> <br /> There are many examples where a complete disconnect between the original and the price and the tasks like performances are done. </ br /> I think some might say that "80 years old" but I remember "80s" in which men began to be responsible for their marriage or children living outside. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad because it's really valuable and it's synced with the right one. <br /> <br /> As this technique (not a story), it was awesome. It is distraught and feels like a 3 hour film that was edited within 1 hour and 40 minutes. Time transit and jump makes sense only. Pick up what's on the floor of the edit room, put it again and the movie will probably flick more ... but it's still a horror movie. Maybe, Shukra has become a good and strong director since 1986 (she must have had it) or perhaps she was from her head when she came to St. Andrew's fire screen to write screenplay or maybe the actors of this group Took it and went on its own way - which I really think.
