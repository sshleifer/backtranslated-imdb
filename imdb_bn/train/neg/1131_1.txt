It is a shame that a talented director, Despechin, could not perform better than Phoenix, an intelligent-talented actress, who lacked the essence of publishing a very short and clear plot. In an effort to fill a centralized circle of crisis, performance and presentation are very strong and fail to draw any sympathy from the audience. In the long-running periods, the immunity of Esther's struggle is very much effective and turns the story into a weak frame of devastating display. Content like struggle for continuing the direction of Phoenix Despatchini is intolerable and ineffective, as Esther is trying to do the same thing with the assumption. Never feel the painful victory of Esther, we never feel the victory in Phoenix's genius.
