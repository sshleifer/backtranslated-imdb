I can not stand the majority of reality shows and it is the worst with Paris Hilton, and sure that it is its agency. But "you are being fired" or "you are hiring", now how many seasons? After watching the show I do not want to work for the people for his arrogance and I think the paint has more recreational valves to look dry. <br /> <br /> I like listening to just one person, and say, "Donald I gave up and you've got some money and buy a beautiful hairstyle." I see he is trying to achieve fame wrestling in WWE. I hope he's got hurt so I will not see his gracious looks anymore. Reputations should be sad to feel so bad and there is no talent and should buy your own donkey to buy it. If I could give this event a negative sign, then I could have done it, but it gets 1 and it's not worth it.
