How did I meet or even hear about this junk-movie before? Bloody tinquli, ridiculous plumbing and hanging around 80 cheese-atmosphere, it's okay in my lane. Nobody is really interested in any reason, employees and students of an elite Catholic University are victims of unknown psychotherapeutics. Julie Parker, a newly recruited teacher, is involved when all the people associated with him die or behave strangely. This movie is sunny bad! There is absolutely no logic or combination, and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl was killed and her body was dumped in a container. Then, and for some reason, the story has been going on for three weeks, but the girl still murdered has not been mentioned or even missed. Even by his boyfriend! The acting is unfortunate and even a bit of nudity to enjoy. The murderer's revelation is very interesting because the producers really believed that it was a real turning point ... it was not, friends! "Splatters University" is one of the worst ever-turkeys.
