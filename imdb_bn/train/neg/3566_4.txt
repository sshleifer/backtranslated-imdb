Now, I did not read the original short story to know all the literature points that went here, so I'm not going to go down that path here. <br /> <br /> But I have learned some time ago that Stephen King movies are simply-not-awful films, perhaps few exceptions. This was not one of them. It has started well enough, and once I'm not going to complain about acting, even though Fred Guin was normal surprising. I will also forgive the total lack of parental skills, because the story has to go forward here. <br /> <br /> But there was one consistent point that I could not help but bothered. And that came very close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters took part in the stupid activities of fools. The moments I mentioned are: A little jambi is running around the house. You suspect it under the bed <br/> <br /> (a) Before roaming in the dark, roam around the bed, expressing your whole body as well as no exposed cannabis can harm you, or <br /> <br /> (B) slightly from the bed Move away so that you can peer at full open position from a little extra security position, or at least you see the turbulence coming in time for reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's (A). I propose to prepare myself for the deaf today. Blaye <br /> <br /> Make fun of enough pictures ... not just scary.
