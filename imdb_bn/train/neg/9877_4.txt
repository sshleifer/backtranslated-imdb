A comedy based on the fabulous Mr. Fox classic Road Dahl book. Wes Anderson instructed and honored to take the short book of the same name to a big screen full-length movie. I respect Anderson, who was an incredibly talented man, although the film seems to have lost its own cute spirit. Anderson thinks he is a genius, and if it happens as a bad movie it will be his first bad movie. You go to school and your first bad day is exactly like that, the first day of filmmaking is Anderson's first bad day, so I make it easy. I would admit it has a cleverness and excellent spirit, and the animation is excellent, but the film gets increasingly difficult, keeping the story behind and having random things happening in random things. The letters are well, also. Jason Schwarzman is the smart ass boy, Ash, and especially compelling of Mr. Fox (George Clooney). The film does not create up to the level of horror, but as soon as it goes along, it certainly close and close. I'm sure that Wes Anderson is with another amazing movie and when he decides to make another film, he'll go back to the track again, but now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, your film was frustrating.
