After the initial release of 4 very good urotrash titles, the Bloodsucker was able to scraps under the redemption barrel with Dance. I found bleeding anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious countdown invites many actresses to her castle for a little holiday. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get one decapitated. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are red fountains in comparison to local fish markets on Friday. <br /> <br /> The speed is frustrating. The story is stupid and the skin scenes are not terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> miss it.
