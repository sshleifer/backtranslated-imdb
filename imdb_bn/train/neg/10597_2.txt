This movie was absolutely terrible. I can not think of one thing better about it. Plot holes were so huge you could run a hammer through them. The performance is so bad that June Cloud will be ashamed, and which is saying a lot !!! And conversations, key dialogue ??? To remind myself that I was the first one to be fond of (the comments I use very rarely, it is a guilty pleasure more than the other). Goldberg was in the picture to cry loud! Nothing good can come to this movie. This movie makes it worse that it's too bad that you can not even see it with a bunch of friends for fun !!! This will always be my top five bad movie. 2/10 Because it is very difficult to give 1 for me.
