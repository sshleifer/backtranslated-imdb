Quite quite The "Horser Masters" was just as good as the 1st episode of the John Carpenter season, it is completely opposite. He must have proved that he was still a terrible master of "cigarette burns", but "pro life" is probably the worst of him. <br /> <br /> It's a fool's atmosphere and tension and totally stupid. It is welcome, despite the minimum time running an hour. The script is meaningless, the characters are anxious and unexpected, and the conclusion is beyond stupidity. <br /> <br /> And those suckers actually bought the DVD (one of them me); How do you describe carpenter film? She is actually proud and she talks about it as her best work for a long time, and she appreciated the script. And commentary on the track, where he showed a clear screw that has been finalized, he only said that he did not consider it necessary to correct the mistake and that he only allowed it to be there. I fear the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm leaving a positive note and mentioned that the effects of animals are remarkable, though. Technically speaking, this image is top notch with effective discussion schemes and effects.
