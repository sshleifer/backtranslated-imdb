... but it's definitely not without merit. Meanwhile, writer-director Preston Sturgess is researching the effect of the unusual movie about his story, creating a wide array of still unique characters and situations, and writing tricks and sometimes unexpectedly intelligent and compassionate dialogues. (There is no doubt that Coen's brother's next film is going to be respectable to Starges.) <br /> <br /> The main problem is that this plot is not yet there; Not surprisingly, the unexpected plot of twists and visitors kept the fate as a sudden change in fate. Coffee slogan hanging a flashy thing, and finishing is thoroughly predictable. Frank Caparo makes this thing even better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Starges, see "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan Travels" or "The Character of Morgan Creek". If you've already seen this, then go ahead and see this one.
