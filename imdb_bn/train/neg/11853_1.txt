Let's face it, romantic comedy is considered lightweight in comparison to theatrical movies (see Academy Awards nominations only for each year). But still, the better ones are really an art form. See "When Harry Met Sally", "Seattle-Seattle" and "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling to see two people determined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to create something like a romantic comedy. But some do not believe in romance in the main character, and there is nothing interesting about that big lack. Modine is a leading way of leading people - especially a romantic lead. I was sure as an executive producer, its meaning was - but in the good sense - throwing yourself. And Gerton ... I saw the possibility of some comic talent possibilities, but there was no script and there was a badly developed character. And whose concept was the English pronunciation? <br /> <br /> <br /> Others say it, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly executed, badly executed; The actor is terrible miscast; And the characters, well, we just do not give them a hoot about them. <br /> <br /> This is not an art form. Rent "Moonstruck" go back again.
