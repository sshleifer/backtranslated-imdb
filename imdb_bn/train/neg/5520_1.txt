This movie was portrayed in the troll as a comedy. This is an extreme tragedy. It leaves me sick of my stomach. I hate it. I think that if they want to make a movie more than enough people to reflect the true intent of the trailer movie. If I knew I would not watch this movie. I think trailer should reflect a movie theme and purpose. I tired of it. I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I was extremely disappointed. Now has been several days and this movie still has a bad taste in my mouth. I'm never too disappointed in the movie, or I've never been writing comments on bad movies. I really think the trick contains true fraud because if they show the true intention of the movie, no one has seen it.
