I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (Penguin March) and heard a very positive review of it on the radio. However, I was seriously disappointed. Most of all, this movie is horrific boring. Literally nothing happened. I tried to describe the movie content to a friend, and both of us were smiling because I only "come to winter after winter, and then to prevent things like spring," and then an eagle, a river, and once it is dark, and The girl goes into a cave, and the other time the foxes have children "and so. About half an hour later I smiled, cried out, my eyes turned I cursed the critic on the radio station, and hopefully it will end soon, but the movie started and up. Finally, when I finally went to my chair so deep that I want to see something like Steven Hawking, the most annoying parts of the movie are ( A) Girl, who must be given to identify some of the children, she wears the same suit across the whole film (one year), And it shows only two facial expressions: Joy and seriousness: He is a tricky, no question about that. However, this film has done a good job without the appearance of all its people. I thought I was optimistic that he would eat a bear, Will drown, or something similar, terrible. (B) The adult voice of the girl, which tells us nothing is insignificant, obvious, annoying, unexpected. (C) Music, which desperately lacks subtlety. When the girl jumped happily around, the songs went too close. Even when the cow is threatened by an eagle, the music still remains threatened. It reminds me of the early days of filmmaking, and it was very predictable to enjoy. Surely, most of the kids like this movie with me, at least they are involved in some way. So, my alert only concerns adults: if you are over ten, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in other places.
