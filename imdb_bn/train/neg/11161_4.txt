Directed by "Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br />: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starred: Jack Black, Ana de la Regra, Hector Jiménez, and Darius Rose <br /> </ br> /> MPA rating: "PG-13" (for some rough action and for funny humor, including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Tell me what you will say about it (I know some people condemn it to the end), but I Always thought that "Napoleonic Dynamite" was a funny movie - the wall was the biggest Not a brighter brick, but a fun movie. Jack Black is also very funny people - sometimes annoying, yes, and disappeared greatly by curious audiences, who worship him, but funny. Very rarely has a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy some degree. So, I was so happy to hear that Jared Hess, the author and director of "Napoleonic Dynamite", and Jack Black will be gathered for a Spanish Fearer who became a wrestler to save an orphan. My only reservation was that the plot looked a little thin. Unfortunately, one of my reservations has fallen throughout the film. This plot was acted as a skit on some shows like "Saturday Night Live" or perhaps "Mad TV", it will work shamelessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs very thin until one and a half hour runtime and this comedy falls flat in comedy. <br /> <br /> Dancing was raised in Mexico monastery and the Lord became a devout man. Dancing (black), because of moving away from the whole monastery, now decided to follow the dreams of the monastery, a professional wrestler, and follow his dream. Monastery means the lowest daily hit, Dancing decides to join a wrestling competition so that she can win the prize money and provide good food for the orphan orphanage. This plot is so sweet and careful words. It seems like Jack is the perfect movie for Jack Black. After all, see what he did with "Rock School". Well, for my displeasure, this plot is completely objectionable and completely destroyed by overall humor that moves away from the film's heart. Again, the way to show this Hollywood scene is that they think that younger viewers can only understand satiric jokes and fools? Of course, I know that this is probably the general thinking of teenagers, since many were enjoying this movie. Obviously people will smile to see a fat woman scurry like a mouse across the floor, but do not expect to get a reward putting it in your movie. A seven year old could do the same joke. <br /> <br /> "Noche Libber" performance is really good. Jack Black again proves that he is absolutely cheerful and he can even smile on paper and even create even the most stupid, worthless lines. Unfortunately, this movie was not enough just for her. It does not give him anything to go and because of any joker's work he had reasons. I have never seen or heard Ana de la Regua before, but now I can say that she is not only talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to take my eyesight. She just click on the role and it works nicely well. Heckly continued to laugh at Hector Jiménez, who played a nostalgic partner, Eskletto. He did a very good job and it was very effective during the partnership with Jack Black. Darius Rose, who played an orphan in the name of Chancho, did not have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. She was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they are lost in such sub-par. <br /> <br /> "Dancing Libra" just does not work. His plot is stretched very thin until it is very tight. Its heart is dirty by fun humor and impressive jokes, which does not just work. I rarely smiled and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of Cast. And that leads me to the "Nacho Libre" bright side: Yes, throwing. Was this cast OK? Well, the lack of a good word, they were. They all clicked, there were excellent chemistry together, and pump life as much as possible in flat scripts. I was completely entertained for Jared Hess's "Napoleonic Dynamite" film, so I was surprised to see myself bothering me often with "Noche Libber". Something went missing here and I still did not understand what it was like. I know that "Nuncha Libara" is not a good movie and yet it is completely worthless due to its cast. There is a small reason to see, only if Jack is looking to work in black. But, if you are not a Jack Black fan, avoid this movie as a plug-in. I like black, but I've worked with this movie and this review. <br /> <br /> Final thought: Yes! This surprisingly frustrating follow of his violent "Napoleonic Dynamite" by Jared Hess. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 4/10 (C +)
