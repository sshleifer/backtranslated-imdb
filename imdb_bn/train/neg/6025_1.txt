The leftist is "we know we know what we know because" we need to help Christians (and any other stupid person) to think that they are "worried" and "trustworthy" ("not known"). OK. But, at the same time I feel bad for a little boy because it is not a good movie. This does not help any message. I work in a video store, and I know people went to see the movie because they were religious and they thought it was. Nobody thinks in this world that they do not know what will happen in the future, unless they think they do not know that they do not know. I was quite enough (but I was too much later) these people wandered through their noses in the air, thinking that a movie starring a semi-gifted TV actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away. I do not deny any details about this film (because Ai did not see it (because I did), B-It was too frustrating to handle my atheist-self (because it was not), or CI would really say something bad about There is no reason (because I). Because, (there is no word to help explain this word) I want this film out of my head, I want it to be made in my head, i I want to see that with my open mind I have seen it, I want that Kirk is so proud and gives me the end of the movie as a coach, and I just want those things before watching these movies on my head, The head is becoming floating! My peaceful anger is ending. Sorry, there are some people in this world who can see the movie about Theat In the future (but not so) in the future, since they can give Seven Dollars plus donations to human, animal or rain charity, then they can not really believe that it is real, what they really are. ****)
