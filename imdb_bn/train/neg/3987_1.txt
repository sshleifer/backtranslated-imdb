I was out of the movie before the end, but I could not finish this trash. This was the biggest load of racism by trying to pass as a legitimate film from "birth of the nation". Characters were a little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see any actor wanting to add their name to this photo. Lee has things like that must be out of the garbage like this. I know that anyone with the brain and I can do a good job .... want to see the paint dry. I hope someone will create a movie about mutual relationships that deal with the reality. This subject is deeper ranting of a bitter director like Lee Lee deeply.
