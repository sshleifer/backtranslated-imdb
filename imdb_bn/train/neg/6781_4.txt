A good cast (with a big exception) pushes his way through Epstein's smart light mockery. Manfield was never good, or funny, he was associated with Walton, a gentleman who is determined to be a congressman to get out of the war. He and his friends - along with civil-concert grants, started the city's Swinengiste party to flee completely to service through head and art commentary in San Francisco on vacation. Due to the interest of Grant's love, the only theme of this movie is the effect of a note by Suzie Parker that takes a lot of time to film and reduces the speed in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; Envy is that he is set to love to serve every serviceman (of course, for his war effort) but he is a married man who loves his wife. They steal the movie in small problems with Grant (who is having fun here in the first part of the movie, when his non-actor is not associated with the co-star.
