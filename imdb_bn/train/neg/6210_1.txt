I have seen this worst movie since Lindsay Lohan with "I June Who Killed Me". <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that there is nothing more than despair and despair that you can choose to see. Hey, Tim Burton, I'm going to be your big fan ... Did you even watch this movie? I mean seriously, F% # <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . .. and the end of the movie. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie .... Rain is there. I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.
