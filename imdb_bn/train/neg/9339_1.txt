I thought they should call "White's" instead of "Heights". Godauful ... a movie that people hate in New York. Those who are so confident and their lives seem so important ... stop me Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in this type of Lily White Cast, this movie is actually crying and stealing it ... and so they introduce it, it's a letter that is more white than the rest Cast (I thought he was the first Albino) who was supposed to be Welsh! I'm still trying to pronounce! Intellectual disrespectful ... This movie is a film that is capable of fooling many people because it has some ambition. Better than filling the theaters with MI 5-10, this can be a good game ... because you do not fall from the floor.
