"Igar and The Lunatics" are completely disabled and amateur efforts in a crazy-hippie-slip-healing-spree horror movie. Apparently almost 20 years later, Charles Manson was still inspired by the rampant but incomplete trash-filmmakers. This is a common trombone production, which in other words, has many irritating and completely irrelevant padding footage with irrational plot. Are there a bit of random sound and unnecessary nudity in December ?? Which is not bad ?? But it is frustrating to look at all that it is all too vain and ugly. "Igor and Lunatics" are so frustrating that it uses lots of footage, such as the example for example the murder scene seen in the circle. The plot involved is trying to tell the story of a hippie culture managed by drug-addicted and steady mason Paul. One of Paul's lowest number of disciples, Igor, became very disturbed with Bible stories and drug addictions, and gradually made the entire religion more descendent in criminal fury. Just a little illustrated with a little example like Igor: She's actually black-black-hit-hiker girl tears in her heart from the chest! A boring synthesizer soundtrack and some really embarrassingly faux pseudo-artistic camera tricks, such as the slow-motion footage and the sequence of protected dreams. There is probably a sequence that qualifies as a suitable for low or low trash fantasy and 'When a poor girl is cut half with a stem. For any particular reason, the camera holds a bloody stomach plaque for the entire pants.
