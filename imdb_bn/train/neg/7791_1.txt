I saw the original non-dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this film really is. I thought I saw the fate of Ghawzi 2, Rabid Granny, Jumboam Lake and such bad movies, nothing could prepare me for it! It is not really a conspiracy, no good acting and even special effects, especially because of the so-called zombie, white makeup and nothing more than their old clothes, there was pain to sit through this flicker. Their good set will not be destroyed by the ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to spend 90 minutes of your life, watch it for others, do not do it, because you'll be sorry!
