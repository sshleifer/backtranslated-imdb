I gave 1 more than that because I had some moral lessons in this story and it stimulated some thoughts and comments from my wife and me. The acting and dialogue was intermediate and I must admit that I felt like this was hit with God, God and Christ are our Savior elements. Movies and story lines did not need it. If, I, you are a Catholic or Christian Recovery to avoid this one, it will vomit you out. The film can be a good job of displaying a thin line between a good citizen and a potential buyer who focuses on how anyone can be.
