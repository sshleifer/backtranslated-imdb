I have never seen the telejon movie, when I saw it on television, I thought I was giving it a shot. Unfortunately I would say I was disappointed. Tarzan was 40 years old and was somewhat more weighty. How would I imagine Tarzan would not look And, if I do not miss it while making my own cup of tea, Tarzan does not scream at her traditional anti-war. Tarzan was also dazzled through the trees - jumping from the vine to the vine. <br /> <br /> Oh well, many for hope. However, there was Jane - monkeys were there monkeys. There were some people with a guitar there. There were villains and good boys and a romance ... all very harmless and expected. Nothing bad, you understand, but not equally good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not the best movie to present Tajan: 4/10
