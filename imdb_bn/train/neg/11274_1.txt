I agree to write another review so that you can get the issue of sister film fans about this film. Last time I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, acting. Thirdly, how is Jesus Christ thinking of creating such garbage and then when we are enjoying from us, there is no freedom fighter from beginning to end, but Joseph Feyen finally flew into very surprised climax! <<br /> <br /> I can not believe that when I could pay homeless people or something, I wasted my money! <br /> <br /> are you getting the picture?
