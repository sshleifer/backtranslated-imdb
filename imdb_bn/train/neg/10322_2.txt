If you are looking to be unexpected or busy or both, you will probably see elsewhere. LMOTP is not too much thought provoking even beyond rehashing the usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed that I was actually sitting in a narrow mess. <br /> <br /> Along with a slimy impersonal camouflage, it initially attracted attention at the beginning. Poke, innocent and commentary and entertaining anti-septic excursion that CBC typically produces at production. And once "Zoom Messelmes in Roman Canada Ruffle!" The campaign welcomed him, could follow the scrapping of the show because it only judged on the basis of his eligibility so shallow. <br /> <br /> If you are not obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and / or are happy with the most miniature audio audiences of this issue, I do not really see how curiosity arising out of LMOPT benefits is beyond enjoyment. Other shows have highlighted the problem of cultural / racial biology in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP entertainment or insight will not rank among them.
