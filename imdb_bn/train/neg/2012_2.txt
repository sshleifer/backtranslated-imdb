Some future lives in fascist or near fascist states which strictly limits personal freedom to repetitive themes in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such actions post a warning for unwanted trends in our society; But they must be entertaining to be effective. Unfortunately, most of the books are really useful enough to read widely, in order to post a warning than our entertainment. The problem with the film is usually round the other. Perhaps the first such work was probably widely known, probably George Orwell's "1984" (the first was published in 1948), and it is still available in both books and in a film format. <br /> <br /> or read it: And then, when you feel somewhat frustrated due to man's inhumanity, then reach Cinderella 2000. Based on the same theme, a feather light budget movie comedy offers easy but unused views; And with the year 1984 the calendar has passed beyond its previous period. Most comedy is equipped with a troll but there are some really interesting moments. Through this, you can draw attention to whether the film will get a new extension or it will eventually disappear in redemption by releasing it as a DVD for practicing your mind, because existing copies of the copies have been disconnected in the past. These days, many bad films like DVDs are being shown and I am not really concerned about what will happen in any way. The best films of this genre are probably "handmade's tail" but I'll happily soup them all for a well-made movie of Jack London's wonderful novel "The Iron Hill". Aspiring as this, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker dares to try it (IMDB lists a B / W wash silent version of Russia only in 1919).
