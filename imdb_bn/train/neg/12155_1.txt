If this movie is directed and produced by the intention of creating a bad film ritual classic, it may have been hit (I can say). Have you ever seen a movie that was so awful that it has made it attractive? Well this is it. Acting cast should be nominated for each of the worst performing performance awards. It would be difficult to find another movie with such production budget, which is very low at any cost. The whole thing, starting from the scene, defies the logic. The dialogue is totally incredible and unreasonable. Dieto for the film's behavior and general stories. What really boggling the mind, some buffoons in a boardroom have actually decided to spend money on this piece of trash. How nice.
