When I rented it for $ 1 in the video shop, I did not expect this movie, but at least "more sex!" Made a little promise with its "killer cut"! There can not be wrong! Well ... you do not have to say, the box is a fraud. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her boyfriend (?) Follows her in a violet steadicam vain shit as a camera. Then he gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and caught by another. They did not drop their wrist to a real cause, and when they showed it "cut", someone could see that it looks like a crayon cut them off. <br /> <br /> From there, the girl is repeating the same theme / unnecessary murder by two boys for about 84 minutes. Add one spoon shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had no problem with this picture, this box did not cheat me for renting a flicker. If I rent a bad movie that demands more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! Within 85 minutes of a chick, a full frontal shot that is clearly rebellious and not pregnant, which does not fear children. If this killer is cut, what is the theatrical cut? Of course, I doubt this garbage was actually put in the theater in the first place. Actor Shame in this movie I see their screen debots here because they did not do anything before, but they were all established before it was released. I did not know whether they were already established and the studios were sitting in the movie until they were semi-big names or not. But I want to know ... they actually spent 14 million dollars in this movie?
