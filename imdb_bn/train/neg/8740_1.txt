My friends and I rented that movie last night and we were in the best smile for a while. The movie is not supposed to be fun, but it's just so ridiculous and there is no reality in it. First of all, Philippe (I forgot what his character forgot and I really care about it), above all, using his regular employee IDs through top-security terminals. Not only merciful, but its top endeavor is to find the scary lego room that hosts supercomputers. This is plain funny. The stress that we are going to feel is completely destroyed by the pillow room. The ending, like all else, is very very chessy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows 'at the right time'. However, this movie is a good smile. If you need anything to make fun, definitely see it.
