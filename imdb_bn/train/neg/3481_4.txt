<br /> <br /> I said, but anyone who can be intelligent enough to read this can probably change every plot from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie I like. I hate to hate your intelligence that some movies do not hate it in the way, but it felt all the necessary blessed end to its trudge very expected. There were fun bits to be sure, but there were a few original ones. At least it does not go for guitar. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegatt looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually only redeeming features. Everyone else has a cardboard cutout, including, wonders, James Gandolfini, who should be made in favor of this. <br /> <br /> All, it's not a harmless, but inspirational, 90 minutes.
