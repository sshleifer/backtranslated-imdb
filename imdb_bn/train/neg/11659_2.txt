I * like the real horror movie *. I'm a huge fan of parody- it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans felt the concept of perfectly conceived boys, then forgot when they sailed out. I think Wayanes' trick is a family of geniuses. Well, even jeans are wrong. <br /> <br /> The image starts with a promise. I like the "Exorcist" parody, especially "come out, mother" Gag. Now, that Wayans-quality material. But, unlike, I can only think twice when laughing: 1) When Tory Spelling is provoked by a spirit in the middle of the night, she gets tired and starts talking to her in marriage. Meanwhile, he says, "This is just a booty call !!" Which was fun. 2) "Save the Last Dance" parody where the syndike character unknowingly hits a girl while practicing new girls. But the little giggles are not even a match for the side-split smile of the first horror movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is full of authentic trash, cheap gross-out gags. The joke from subtle or intrinsic first movies is magnified and overdone. For example, in the horror movie I, a number of them have been explored that the character is gay. This was sunny. However, in Dairy Movie 2, the whole gender-finger scene with the ray under the bed was mind-laced and incredibly disrespectful. The pattern of this whole film. Shock humor * Single * is not too far in a movie. Unfortunately in 2000 and 2001 it was a trend. <br /> <br /> As much as it hurts me to rate mein movie, I have to give 2 out of 10.
