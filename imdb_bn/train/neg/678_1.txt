I can really say that I am happy to sack the socks while watching movies, or I would be very angry to lose 2 hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that wanted to be serious, which my husband and I started laughing aloud. I recommend this movie to people who want to make their own version of MSST 3K.
