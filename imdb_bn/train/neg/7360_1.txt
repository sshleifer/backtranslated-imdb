This is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. This is especially due to theoretical impossibility (such as the Bank Loan Officer, as an obvious agent, that he is through a cable or a scene where someone says that it is safe to enter a room where it is like a safe agent. But 'the virus has been released, it does not mean that it can never be found), the cheap set (the bank has It seems like it was built weakly like an accident), and bad acting. This is the story of an organized crime group that successfully steals a capsule of lethal viruses. However, in deciding to move it from a head security deposit box, the main hexco, as well as a bank's hedging, is being reported to the same FBI agents, and at the same time a horrific earthquake exploded. . Not saying, after the earthquake, more dirty than one. However, the result is not for an enticing action film, but instead, one of the ones that has apparently z-grade junk since the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is because some pizzing screens should be made from computer graphics rather than actual screen capture). In this case, Ron Perlman was doing what, I have no idea. I saw it as a surprise that I was embarrassed at it.
