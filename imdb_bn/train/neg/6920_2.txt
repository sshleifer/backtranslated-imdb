Body Slam (1987) A terrible movie out of the plane. Less budget repeats, pedestrians (best) in direction and writing and lame are played. But if you're in the old school wrestling (in the mid-1970's by the middle of the 80's) you can get more entertainment than the average viewer. I must warn you, this movie stinks on the ice. I gave both of them because I want to be generous. This was "directed" by Turkey Stunt Master Must Needham. They are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and Screw Wrestler, and a bunch of C-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The summary of this "movie" is a furnace that is "hair rug" and wrestling. But the others who do not want him to succeed. There are more but I do not want to SPOIL it for you. If you can get rid of bad acting and intrinsic tales, there are some surprises for fans of die-hard wrestling. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend it to my bad enemy (and I want to say it).
