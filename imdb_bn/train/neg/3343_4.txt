A fascinating story about a soldier in a war, who lacked a young girl from the enemy to save life and was scared by this incident, though she protected many other captive children. The film shines a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher, which is mostly operated by hallway, bathroom and even going to the square house. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay very little attention to their teacher or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (SAM Decker) soldier / school teacher plays and decides that he will go out of education and go to another area. However, the Principal asked him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. At this moment when all the hell breaks down and the story becomes completely bombed. Try to see it, if you decide to see the IT!
