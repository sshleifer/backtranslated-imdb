I'm a big fan of TV series Largo Winch. This movie was a pain for me. I had to use fast forward to not fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone destroy this title? The story was only the good thing. Actor sh.t. They can not play the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a Neil. See other roles in this actor. The war scene was unbelievably annoying and not legible, however they are not following the situation. Like other critics, fewer budget films have said bad bad actors. Next time someone else can do something better than this title. French can not do the right thing with big movies, such as Alien 4. It is a bit brighter, 1,2,3 after the alien
