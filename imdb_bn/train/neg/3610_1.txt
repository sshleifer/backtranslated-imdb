A patient escapes from a mental hospital, kills one of his employees and then kills a university professor on his way to the local college. Next semester, replacement of late professors and students will have to deal with a new batch of new group killings. The conversation is so clever that it was difficult to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. This is one of the cheapest films thrown together in the middle of the 80 slash era. In spite of closing the heroine, this is just a poor junk. Dreadful acting, awesome scripts, awesome effects, awesome horrifying horrors !! "Splatter University" is a junk to fix in your visa, when you do not have anything to do, but I recommend to look at your head cleaner tape but it will be more entertaining. Avoid it and instead renovate "Girls Night Out". <br /> <br /> Strong graphic rattling for violence, profanity, short nudity and sexual orientation.
