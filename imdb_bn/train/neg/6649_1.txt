Well, anyone who can really say that this film is fantastic or even better, is confusing or knows the director, writer and producer and is trying to promote the film. I saw the movie because a friend of mine has worked on it and it's terrible. I am an actress, and now I have worked in big films and even innocent films and this movie has bothered me. Because I'm not so rude, because this picture was clearly different on "Mouse and Menus" and they can file a case because it's such a horrific rif of the story. An industry where Hollywood seems creatively bankrupt ... to accept a classic book and movie "Mouse and Man" for someone and destroy it with a new spin bug. Actors, accents, conversations and aspects were amateur and there was no disrespect to writing. I mean if you are going to take a new spin in an existing story but make sure to make it better than the original or better to justify the new spin. Not everyone liked this movie.
