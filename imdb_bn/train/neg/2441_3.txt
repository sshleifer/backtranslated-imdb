I thought "intensive care" was quite bad and very strange fun. But at least as bad as I thought it could be. Sometimes it's a bit suspicious, but never really shocked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fun is a funny moment. But the classic moment of all time: Peter (Coen Waters) beat up the killer. He lies in the corner of hallway moaning. Amir (Nada van Nie) kneeled beside him and said, "Poor Peter, can I get you a band-add?" <br /> <br /> This image was shot in Dutch and English. To cover costs, all license plates are in the United States, and a skyline in Manhattan in the news studio background. If you are Dutch and see the original version of Duch, it is very interesting.
