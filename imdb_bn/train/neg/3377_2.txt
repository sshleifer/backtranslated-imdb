Broadway musical, "a chorus line" is the best musical instrument in the controversial theater. It is about dance experiences for those who live; They enjoy the pleasures they have and they sacrifice. Each dancer is auditioning for parts of a Broadway chorus line, but what comes out of each of them is how their life discovers dancing as their vacation. The movie version, though the stage shows no emotion or beauty of the show and is the worst movie adaptation of the Broadway musical instrument, because it is lifeless and no affection for dance, all of it. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake Sir Richard Attenborough was created to give the job to the director, whose instructions only gave proper touch and pensing for "Gandhi". Why can someone in his right mind ask an epic director to manage a musical instrument that takes place in a fairly narrow area? <br /> <br /> which brings us to the next problem "A chorus line" does not take place on stage in a theater and with a real set and limited costume change. It was the least flickering of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, that film did not translate well, and nobody would really think it. For this reason, the film should have taken us in the life of these dancers and had to leave the theater and the process of ultrasonication. Singers may offer their songs in other environments and even given their first ballet, jazz or top class flashbacks. Hack, they could dance down to Broadway in their vivid imagination. Yet, there was not a fantastic story to create this film, as is the complete indifference of Attenborough's dance and the show is clear in its unimaginable direction. <br /> <br /> Many dancers are surprised to tell them about the dancers. He or she does not want to hear the story of the director (Michael Douglas). The character of Douglas is impressive about what he has extended to sympathetic people, and who has no patience for him. <br /> <br /> Although the makers of the game were claimed to be true in nature, there were some harmful changes. Very nice "hello barley, hello thirteen, hello love" - ​​a snoring stage number that took the dancer back to their adolescence - was removed and replaced with a terrific "unexpected" song so that it was nominated for an Oscars. Adding insult to injury, "wonderful" simply uses the same story as "Hello, love" but without intelligence or deviation <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What to do while transferring a Broadway show. If you want to see a movie version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Foss's bright "All the Jazz". Fosse's daughter is "a Chorus Line", she should be involved, as the director, who is Fosse. He deserves much more respect than this sad attempt which will know what to do with this material.
