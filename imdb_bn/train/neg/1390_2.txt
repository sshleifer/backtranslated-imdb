I'm catching a big fan of B5, only three at the end of the season. When I saw the previous season faithfully when it was syndicated, it was one of the best ideas stories arcs to hit television eventually. Even Phil's episode was interesting. The movies were well-made and entertaining to hit the theater. <br /> <br /> which brings us to the 'river of soul'. Naturally, after seeing everything I had high expectations. Martyn Shane seems to be acting in the film Edward instead of a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself, looks good in the outline form, even the story board may have made it. However, the idea was to fill the film for two hours when it is probably suffering. There is no special effect to keep our entertainment in total absence of a compulsory story. There is a place where they were certainly short of time and corrected the conversation only to fill the story. If it is a regular season, it will be rated in the worst phase.
