I did not know anything about it before handing this movie. Plots were terrible with a large gap of horror data. I do not think the movie "Battle of the Wits" Actors are making fools only, sometimes they make me shout my teeth with pain. This plot was predictive in addition to the abdominal stomach abdominal homo lover scene (I was not homophobic but I was physically sick in my stomach). And you can say Jude Law in the Detective section, fake accent, terrible accent, terrible dentistry, everything in the garment shop, everything is a mask. The whole movie just felt like the time of wasting my life. This movie was a feeling of a puppet show as a window to show Jude Law and Michael Kine's dolls as dolls and houses, really warm for my opinion.
