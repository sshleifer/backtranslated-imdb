Alan Page co-star said in the movie behind the DVD box. Until it is more than two-thirds of the film and even a minor role, she does not appear. I do not consider it a helpful introduction, but rather a "bit" part. There are also many vague elements of the plot. Some examples: Why the main character rejects its oldest son? Why does his little boy drive his head in the train? He does not explain anything which says this for a "sucker" beta. Obviously a painter does not know the definition of betting a sucker. This image is not worth the rent in my opinion. Save your money and watch it free on tv when you think it needs to be seen.
