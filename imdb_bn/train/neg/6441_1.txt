When I saw WrestleMania's match card this year, I was very stoned and unable to control myself because I was excited. <br /> <br /> It starts and ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry at hell because I wanted my money back. I mean, you'll see WrestleMania 22 (one of my favorites) which will come down as a classic and then you expect the same and then each one of them has to get the average garbage. The whole event was a moment that destroyed it for me when I had to tap the HBO! JOB CENA is the very moment that HBK lost !!!!!!!!!! John Senna is such a harmful / poser. It often destroys WrestleMania 22 when he defeats Trip H.! I could not see WWE after Wrestlemania 23. I started to see it again (fortunately). I believe in WWE again WrestleMania 24 (the best ever I ever saw) that was a pure classic WrestleMania. This is definitely made for 'Mania 23' and has given us many memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you have seen such a WrestleMania before, as it turns you back to fans (WrestleMania turns 20) I am in a fan, please do not see this and do the same mistakes I made and leave behind the WWE. And if you look at it and get angry, then start seeing it again and see WrestleMania 24, it's absolutely classic.
