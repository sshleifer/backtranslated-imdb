This Chinese college has become a civilian filmmaker among students, although I saw it until it was broadcast on Channel 4, UK. <br /> <br /> Filling the fans of the Anthony Goddess, the plot is medium and illogical; 'Spirit' wants to show that how independent artists resist the movement of the music industry and maintain their 'purity of artistic spirit' and not 'sell themselves for dirty money'. That is really giddy and superficial; Diologue is mainly compassionate. Acting poor sceenplay art full of pretention. It's a fantasy movie for kids and all that <br /> <br />
