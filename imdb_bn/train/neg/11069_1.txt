I really felt cheated to see this picture. Looks like I did not sit down to watch 101 minutes of this movie. I do not understand what they thought when they made it. It rarely goes to Jeffrey Dahre's murder and it does not end there. They thought that they were leaving the movie open for this movie. It was good to watch a television episode of Sprintos. It suddenly ended, and you know that next week is going to be another episode. It felt like I saw only one part in two parts. There are many possibilities for what's wrong here; They became lazy, they went out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to create a Dahmor 2. After watching this movie, they all hear the sound very correct. I was walking Jeffrey Dahmar through the jungle. Suddenly, I heard this song, then the text comes to the screen and how Dahmor works in his 2-year sentence, and a fellow prisoner imprisonment and dies at the age of 34. Wow, he goes for a walk to jail for his death in prison. How does he show up getting there? How Dahmor's trial is being shown. How to show more details. I can not explain what happened to this movie because it has gone everywhere. I actually deny myself, "That's the end, the end?" I would like to conclude this review by saying I have been making a good Dahmer movie yet. I want to say to filmmakers, if you are going to do this, then fix it.
