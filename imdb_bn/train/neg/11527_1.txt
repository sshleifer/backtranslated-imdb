<br /> <br /> The movie starts as a common comic-hero-movie. It's about the boy selected, there is no father and school # 1 loves the girl is crazy There are no surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can not guess coming to the movie. Tobi McGuay shows us that he is not a good actor or an actor in the world can not save such a script. Ten-year-olds may enjoy this movie, but it is fierce for the youngest. You can not think of movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. Those titles are all good. I went out for about 20 minutes! One thing that might have been good, though, was computer-dimension, but it is not that Christmas-tricks can not be done! So my recommendation: you can not see this movie even if you pay for it!
