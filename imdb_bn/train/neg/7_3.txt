It's really a new low on entertainment. Although there are many bad movies. <br /> <br /> There is a strong story in the genre of Gangster / Drug Station (not the movies, ie the objectives of the Sebastian can not be for example) far fetched and worn clich√©.) Then you are believable that setting the relationship of the characters (this movie does not .) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Confirm that Tristan pulled away from his family but why was he again? What does her father mean again that she should allow her to go to her age? Interesting photos to ask about the lack of rebellious behavior and needs of children in the upper class family. But this movie is not in this direction. Even possible random trials will be judged by backflash. He was not before and out, why did he do it again? <br /> <br /> Here are some interesting questions that are brought here for a very serious social critic drama (but again, this film is not due to focus on "cool" production strategy and special effects, a moment to reflect characters And force the story to the most stories where they want and breathing stories and not naturally to develop. <br /> <br /> It does not want to glorify substance and abuse of violence (this would be a political mistake on this day), but on the other hand it is not much more than a cheap action movie (as there are many). Actor and a Vini Jones, who is always doing what is left behind by his fame, is managing to not completely destroy what is left. <br /> <br /> So I recommend to everyone ... I can not t. <Br /> <br /> 1 Winnie and 2 for editing.
