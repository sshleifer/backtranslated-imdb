A bad written script with no likable characters. As a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It is about 2 hateful friends who hate women who are very bed-ridden with them (no sexual scenes) and other friends (those who are semi-annoying weird) who are sometimes considered to be mainly considered as scams. 3 friends meet and read the same woman (Amanda Peet) separately. Somehow this is really done without any romance. 3 friends separately close friends as his date. They scammed women because they scammed them out of their friendship. - A bad movie
