It was not really a very good movie. There were many unlikely and anticipated things that happened during the movie ... but I think most critics do not want to enjoy the wider viewers of this film are absent. This movie was produced by Magic Johnson! Check out this film is not enough to inspire us all? A film produced by a former NBA star does not come along every day, you know. Being slashed by wielding a axis axo in a large house nicely stupid kids. Every clich√© trotted out for us groan on. Teen sex and it's all produced by Magic Johnson! I can not say enough about this movie! Use of Tin Drug! College Hugins! And it's all produced by Magic Johnson! Yippeeee!
