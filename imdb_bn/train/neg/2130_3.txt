I think I'm coming late to party. I saw the 1995 edition of By By B birdy on this Sky TV. I did not exist in it and I was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when it turned on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I'm thinking about producing an amateur because I think it's so much fun to do. I was not impressed with this new version. It was not just fun enough. It was not colorful. It was the lack of fertility of the youth. The light was bad. Someone mentioned this truth. It's not a Moody musical, it's brighter and beat up. The decision to negotiate was a perfect creative choice. <br /> <br /> By a bye by a Frenchman, a comedy of errors. I got any ideas of this version. The light was awful and it dulled overall performance. Dance numbers appear as well as animic. We have music videos this day. At least dance scores should be measured somewhat or how best we can measure in Broadway. The character wheel was asleep asleep. <br /> <br /> Although all actors were extremely gifted, some really loved the casting of bad. Vanessa Williams is not Latin and there are many talented Latin actors, it was not even more correct to throw one of them into the role of Rashid. Vanessa African American, lovely and talented, but bad cast. Jason Alexander's efforts were astonishing, he always worked intelligent, but he was not just Albert. She was wrong and I think it is clear to most people to see this version. <br /> <br /> Not the medium of stage of the film. There must be translation from one medium to another. Must be translated from stage musical excitement and flash film. It is being printed when there is no merit on the script being trusted at a level. The soul, the production will be raised to the best. The production of Bai Bardi Bird in 1963 was bright and vibrant, when the 1995 film was a talk and was lazy like a dance number. It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by really talented people.
