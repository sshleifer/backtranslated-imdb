A bunch of kids set up to have a night-night horror movie marathon in a theater. Anyway, it goes out at night, some of them kill each other. Who is it ... and why? I saw this in theaters back in 1991. I was waiting to see it - but boy! It does not work at all. Premiere is a good one, they have some very interesting young cast and some professionals like De de Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. Half of this story gets half (which can be due to some huge editing before the film's release), the killings are relatively bloodless (how an R rating was out of my way), and ultimately the killer's unmasked was annoying. And stupid <br /> <br /> This is really bad - this movie was potential. With a good script it can be a great awful film. It mostly stands forgotten and cast while feeling embarrassed by itself (I do not have to talk about this one in the Stone). I give it a 3 and that's just for throwing.
