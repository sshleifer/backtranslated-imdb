I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the name of John Huston, Rackel Welch, Mae West and Farah Fount I see the title of Brazil very strange, but I decided to look forward to seeing a fun comedy, perhaps "switch". But the non-conception story is terrible and it is difficult to describe. Mayan Breinridge (Rex Reid) has submitted to Surgon for her sexual transformation in Copenhagen, and she returns to Hollywood and says she wants to be Mother Breaking (Rackel Welch) and claims her half of her uncle Bach Loner (John Houston). In the days, mothers and her arrogant Mayran ruined a young couple of his uncle Academy with strange sexuality. At a particular moment, the dirty screenplay is so confusing that I believe the whole story is only a mind-set of Mayan inspired by the accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Rackel Welch and Farah Founty is not enough to hold this glimpse. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homeme and Mulre et seito Ponto" ("Man and Woman to Point")
