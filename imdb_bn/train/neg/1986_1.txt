Other critics will have to agree with. This has been the greatest movie, I've seen the West sometimes. Horror acting, split and bifurcated conversation (to be completely inappropriate for being allowed in the 1800s) and oh, did I mention a battery pack significantly in one part of the letter? I was waiting for a blurred Mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And end? At least I can say that it was consistent with the rest of the film ... totally awkward. And yes, every cliche of the book is empty, ridiculous in the street walking on the road "Let's remember" shot when a main character dies. Thankfully I saw this free tv this. Do not waste your time.
