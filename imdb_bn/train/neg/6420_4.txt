Okay, I'll admit, it was very fun and started well, but then it was reduced, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle could read the script in the movie about 5 minutes later, I was just sitting in the whole movie, I'm nude at the twist I wanted to see, and my surprise, well, people I can not tell you if there was one there, because the last confused you And then played the role of credit, I was hell? This did not deserve a theater run, I'm sorry, but I mean it was not awesome, only reaso because I gave it a 4 because it was a few shocking parts ... it! You can see it, I'm not saying to you, Hey you might even like it or even love it! But if you hate, do not say I warn you!
