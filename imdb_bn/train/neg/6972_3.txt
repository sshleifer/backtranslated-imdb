When I first saw the lid of this film (a giant bug behind some nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey" I knew that I was not for a big Hollywood movie. I was surprised to see Steve RailSack of this cheese-ball flick, who has always done a good job for any role that played ... FX is pretty cool, the plot is not very much, and I still have this movie called Blue Bani Why not make sure, because there is nothing to do with the monkey in this movie. But come to the people, what do you expect? It looks really not bad .... If you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies, it is basically an updated version, updated without special FX
