I have heard about this novel long ago, many of my friends suggested that I read it. I search it everywhere and finally it is available. This is a book that every human should read, because it is due to talent and its outlook. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about movies and could not wait to see it. Finally, when I was very disappointed, there are not many books in the book (I do not think it's a mockery) that does not make the film logical ... Michael Radford may be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as a book recipient. The film is not dark, the text is really bad, the only good, even the cool, the acting. John Hart was an amazing actor and I could only see myself as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> Am I the most aggressive in IMDB, who is known as "Best Adaptation" after reading this book? ! Or to know something about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brightness of the story by reading the book, do not consider it as an alternative. As a book fan, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I went to play the points I gave for this movie.
