I saw more bad movies, but bec bec maybe I'm so awake by filling this bad horror movie. The killer monster thing is really really bad, basically it's a kind of green body suit in a guy. B-movies are doing far worse, but do not worry for the second second. It was not a star, Hell. It was actually a plot with substance, but was still quite stupid. Basically it's a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it is not as bad as the theoretical, that sucks the ball in the movie, this one sucks. Blood looks really fake in this movie I have a complaint about the new millennium, all the horrors of low grade Gore, are stupid. Really a stupid death scene with fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a beautiful shower scene
