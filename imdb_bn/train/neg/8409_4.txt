Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor ??? Allan Arkin and Jimon Hausu can be insulted. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can work) walks through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> <br /> that was played ??? <br /> <br /> This movie compares the comparison with CHICAGO or any other recent music. <br /> <br /> If it was not for Jennifer Hodgson's great singer and acting, I could have given it a zero. <br /> <br /> And I did not see any game play, so I'm not making it usually Broadway vs. Hollywood Rap.
