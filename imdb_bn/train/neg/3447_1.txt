This is one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Any other things suggested in the outline of the plot are not scary. This movie was slow and I was annoyed for about 98 minutes. Even though acting is mediating, the biggest problem is the script, which is written in a written form, slowly written, slowed down and pladded. Sometimes an eerie mood is set to break only by vain lines or events. I am not surprised that the whole cast was ill and was shot in the shots, after which they tried after a terrible script and digested it. As a huge fan of good horror movies, I am always annoying that something that is annoying. Protect yourself 98 minutes you will not get back.
