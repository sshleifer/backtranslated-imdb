When I came out of this, many kids were brown about it. I think I was too old to be very excited and I was a fan of actual martial arts films and it always got some cheesy. <br /> <br /> In the early 90's, we were drowned with such programs that kids might fight and be equal to these kids in a Power Rangers or three disassembly. I think the parents and the filmmakers eventually got sick because we were really all that had to tear and kill the kids. <br /> <br /> There are some big films in the movie that they are trying to do and it's nice to see and get messages for your kids, there is no message in it ... it absorbs millions of differences in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Any great visual attributes but one would expect it? Acting is pretty bad. Victor Wang was a cool actor but was shy to see him here. The small, fat, eye-catching old bird was a strong ninja that was just sunny. Children played a lot more and the littleest ninja you probably saw the worst child actor. <br /> <br /> The movie is a plot that nobody knows, even before reading the review. 3 Nija ... Yes, you know they will fight with a lot of bad guys and obviously win ... I need to say more. Sorry if I waste it for someone. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is intended for kids and only children can enjoy it. If you do not want your kids to watch movies about this war kids, it's a good movie for them to watch. If you do not have any relationship with your children's full martial arts, real acting or reality time, your kids do not permit to see the complete rubbish but you have found a movie for your kids ... I say to the kids because I think girls like it too ... I remember all the girls putting on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 of the 10 reasons I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults. This movie is a great time to lose it. Not unique or nothing and I do not see my child to see it ... The Kung Fu TV series is on DVD and there are lots of Shadows Brothers. .. why not show your children something that really will entertain them and go astray, perhaps teach them some steps and do not walk on their feet, as Dada decides three ... ... no no ... kicks a man on the legs No ... sometimes .. so much annoyance.
