It was scary before last year's rewards session, why did they get them out after the end of the election, but whatever the reason for the least exposure, the film was a slow mess. Sure, some parts were funny in the way of a black humor, but no letters felt very real to me. There was not a person with whom I could connect, and I think it failed for me. Sure, this plot is somewhat funny and very annoying towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea ... Let's see if that has already been mined in the futility point. Discussion, casting, horrible visual effects from screenplay (which can be considered deliberate, I can say, and so everyone can smile at you). However, I hope it will create it to sell in DVD, I do not want a project that many people must make a lot of effort to become completely unconscious. But it is tripe in both ways. That boring threesome.
