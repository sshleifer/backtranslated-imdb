When I bought this DVD, I said: "It seems that there is a wonderful light comedy about the love and relationship of Portuguese standards?" I was totally wrong! What a frustrating movie! First, it is not a comedy; This is a cheap drama that can be much better that it is much worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so annoying, and leads somewhere ?? Is it any structure, it just flows on one or the other, like the wind ?? Production is bad! Sound mix is ​​horrible, because sometimes the voice is isolated. It reminds me of some old Portuguese cinema for 80 years? Should have been acting very well ?? Well, collectively, this is not a movie that will improve the Portuguese movie! In fact, in the past few years it has been found that this is the worst Portuguese movie! Bad argument, bad acting, bad production ?? I had no high expectations for this movie, but I've never imagined it worse! Forget it
