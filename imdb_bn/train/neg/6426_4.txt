I found to be a fairly interesting documentary documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out Control. There are four "mini" documentaries in the documentary about four interesting people. Each of these men was very involved with her job, she showed perfect love and enjoyment for her work. <br /> <br /> Sadly, I must say that these people have done / studied the topics. They were interesting for about five minutes, later became annoying and became long lasting longer. <br /> <br /> The video was very creatively illustrated. I enjoy a film with another thing with a voice dub too. It coincided nicely with excellent acting and music.
