Spoilers Curious people with generous taste have been reviewing this film. Allow me to add balance indicating the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Awesome. Tom and Dan wanted to know each other by "boring about movies", this statement is clearly a person, and I suspect that the director was the one who used to use intelligent intelligent words carefully. At one point, Dan asks, "Did you hear HIV virus?" And as it is natural ask, "Have you contacted the Native Tribe nation?" <br /> Acting: White teeth and a skinny face is not a sensitive performer. I suppose that Speedman did enough with what he gave, I think, but Mercedes was terrible - a helpless, incredible, and cruel mischief and reminder of his captivity. There is a void for his performance (see Interstate 60). <br /> Plot: Leave me! The half-escape moment was thrilling but not boring and weak. Trying to close the door to Maraden and then pretends to throw them: "They do not work, man!" Tee-Hee And beware of semi-black-white-white flashbacks starting with some strange words taken from the CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important, the most dangerous, the evil and the objectionable, HumanFobia (external or internal, you are deciding) is a movie where HIV is considered as a weapon. Tom said that Dan had either stopped the condom or did not use it completely - excuse me, where was Tom? Generally there is villainizing some of the entrant partners which comes as a villainizing of gay men <br /> <br /> Sum: Beware!
