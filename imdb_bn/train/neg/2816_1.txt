This is a movie that you see in the video store which you can only get because it only looks very badly. And indeed, we can not take it the most. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, CRIPES. I've never seen a single scene in a movie (I'm estimating forty or more). And I do not have so much laughter in my life. You see, Englund has these things for showing off its shorts. I have seen this photo a few months ago, but I can not laugh while typing. However, the scene is a montage of the shots - England robs the underwear of the girl, runs naked naked horses, and some mysterious women fall on the head of a snake. This is the absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.
