My first exposure to Templarius and not good. I was excited to find this title in the Anchor Bay video, which brought us another classical classic as "Spider Baby". Print quality is excellent, but this image is deadly dull that can not actually be hidden. There is an exciting opening sequence in which villagers decide a terrible revenge on the Templars (and keep the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, scholar and ultimately unfinished. The injury adds insult: As promised in the video jacket, the movie is subtitled, dubbed.
