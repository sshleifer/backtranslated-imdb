*** Warning! Spinner involved here! *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Madonna has no challenge in this role, and it shows. He played Madonna Madonna, and she will not get fit. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "You know what Madonna really is, you've never seen him!" Correct, I do not, but we all think "true or daring", are we not? I know Kevin Coster. <br /> <br /> You think, in 2002, Madonna may have learned some way, one way or another from "crossover" women, who put their way into silver screen. For love, did Madonna not see "glyter"? Mariah Carey movie showed how it happened !!! Mary's beauty, talent, screen appearance, charisma, characterization, kicks you trashy butt of the mat in the name of it! What we see from the glance in the Madonna world is that she is the only one. <br /> <br /> If one thing can be said for Madonna, then she is consistent. When he was an MTV darling, he established the world's fashion world for 20 years. Now, in the film, he has defined the role of women in films and society for 20 years, by glamorizing all the hateful, terrible, repugnant, unreasonable qualities, women have become famous for their locking, trying so hard to prove that they are not actually owned. <br /> <br /> *** The speakers are here !!! If you do not want to know, but can not read any more *** *** <br /> <br /> I would say good about this movie, and I was really impressed by it. They do not go for "The End of Hollywood" - Madonna's character lives. Generally, on the end of Happy Hollywood, Madonna's character on the island died and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband finally lived a happily, decent woman, a woman who is exactly opposite her dead wife, and they both happily afterwards. But in this very sad conclusion, he is rescued, and once more, the husband's affair will again get involved with his wife's monster, and his life will be turned into a living hell. <br /> <br / *** *** Spinners end here ***
