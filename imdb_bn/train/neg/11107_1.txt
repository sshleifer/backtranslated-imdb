It was a terrible film. Whatever the story line was there. To stop it all, when they can not explain blood and gore (only good part) ... they throw in a few alien! I hate the director (or whatever) to run ideas and then blame the alien! If you want to see this film. But do not say I warned you. Two things: when Winnie can not say "welcome" without a tongue? His sad Mr. Jones did not have a big role. The second thing that baked me, why did we show the bottle of Vinnie Jones and cut them and insert them into the blue fluid, then they have no other role. Why not I do not like to show anything and there is nothing to do in the story line. In a nutshell. Bad story I will not waste my time - if I wish I saw the mirror.
