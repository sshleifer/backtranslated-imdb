When Stanwick's husband was murdered on the eve of marriage, he returned to the hillside, where he burst on a hill and was rescued by a wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, resulting in a clearly unilateral marriage, which is spent in Chicago (which surrounds the mountains!). Stenwieck was tempted by pushing cartridge, but eventually returned to Morgan, in the resolution of very low and weird stories. <br /> <br /> This picture contains a great cast (especially Morgan is my darling) and is a great director, but the script is mad and seems pointless from time to time. I was ready to enjoy this movie but in the end I was frustrated. Cast is still valuable, and it is good for someone who likes movies of 1930.
