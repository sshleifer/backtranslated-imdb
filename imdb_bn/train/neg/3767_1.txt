Budget, decent actor ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste your time in this piece of junk. The effect is shit. The acting is cone. This is the only thing that can make it even durable, it was a little cheaper at T & A and it got broken in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Even remotely redemming the quality of this movie is a very painful prejudice. They could not find only 7 people on the planet who never had a curse before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The only way for a bigfoot is to dodge it to be a good one for a big budget and for some actors who do not come from frogballs community theater.
