What is the point of reviewing a movie like this? It's painful and embarrassingly bad, in any way that lets you make it fun. <br /> <br /> "Little Man" movies make me sad. They represent its most disposable film. This film was made for the 18-24 year old Dips * Freyat boys, who had hoped for the studio and saw how it was bad that the film could get better at night before it ran out of the word. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />
