Warning: Possible Speech Reports (You do not have to take care of. Also, sorry for the caps.) <br /> <br /> Starting an unnecessary dramatic voice that is the most annoying for nonsense, it's running with meaningless and unnecessary plays. . It is bad but kept right. <br /> We know space travel is a risky initiative. There are many potentially complex systems for harmful, radiation, stress related signs, etc. and unexpected things are largely forced to occur in unknown environments. They knew the stuff could go wrong. Actually, the staff has gone wrong. It is called learning. Imagine, Ajolo 11 was not safe in today's standard and there was political pressure, but overall performance of the technology in the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> I did not even see the wrong / comment: <br /> <br /> 1) After making a mistake, Nixon prepared a lecture. Good duh That's what I need to do. It was the top of the campaign's campaign. <br /> <br /> Apollo 11 probably wandered though NASA gives a light glow. (This is "only" inherent, though.) Yes, that is why they allow people to keep the clock and the clock in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Capsule ejection will not work. As it works a chimp it was not during the time. That survival is one? It launches a test and explodes the rocket, the capsule accelerates and landing with a parachute. It has a video, maybe you can find it on YouTube or at least see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> 4) In an interview, a blast was to remove a fair part of Florida. I can only assume that it is meant as a hyperbole, 'If not because, I just got aghast how it could get so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was primitive compared to today's standards. Indeed, relatively primitive software and hardware are still used today, as it should not crash. This is worse for spacecraft, because their computers should be made relatively bigger, which is not sensitive for radiation. (And can be manually run manually), so a complex steering system like B2 will not work.) Instead of "computer screen", how do they use "TV screen"? It's the same amazing technology. Actually TV surveillance is produced and significantly higher definitions. <br /> <br /> 6) "If that object is not part of the rocket, then it can be just one thing." We see where this is going. In addition to this statement, who said it is not a rocket part? At least one interview clears that if something is flying and you do not know it, it's a definition of an unknown flying object. <br /> <br /> Looks like a voice-over and some misconceptions, the lander's radiation foil was actually for it's fork. Which will make it slim than the space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) I can appreciate the earliest death footage of blue armstrong during exercise flight; I have not seen it before. As I said, any part of the manifest technology may be wrong, especially if it has not been tested enough, you know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) Trajectory isolation of low-level landers (due to which the concentration of the Moon density) was not severely lethal. "Fifteen seconds was not left to the fuel", in fact, "fifteen seconds of fuel was left before" to cancel the mission and return to the command module. "<br /> 10) The chain of a disaster incidents is" usually the result of the crash. I do not really know how to make it any easier. This, though, is a major example of using Rattricks. 11 <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of an astronaut, "walking can now be revealed" because of this weird behavior that tells us that following a brief voice, walking nonsensically and hopping like a perfect child. Moving around, he walks on a walk and walks. Ridiculous thing <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that all communications lost during re-entry. It is a completely natural phenomenon and it was known at that time as it is impossible to interrupt contemporary technology. Again, its gravity is perfect, but very deliberately. <br /> <br /> 13) No shuttle has ever been lost in space, when Voice-on represents this "true" and proves that Apollo 11 was a stack of shit. Apollo 13 had a near loss, but two actual disasters occurred during liftoff and re-entry respectively. In any case, shutters in Saturday's rocket are compared ... OK, all right, just plain fool. Even ignoring it, successful shuttle missions do not seem to be interested in the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) What does the UFO have? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. As long as you have created it for recreational purposes, it seems that specific viewers (which seem to be included in the history, science, or people who are in the side of a miracle). <br /> <br /> Even the point of the film is a bit unclear. Catch-phrases are "covered up so far", "publicly released for the first time", come, but the film does not blame or offer any lessons or offers that can be so emotionally completed in a movie. In the old tradition of excitement, there are many interview shots and recording pieces which often do not know anything except in the context or with the people "NASA scientist". Wow, so the astronaut was very nervous before the effort? That's fancy What does this movie have to do with the dot again? Oh yes, that's the point. <br /> <br /> In addition to a deliberate, deliberate or useless mistake, it is not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentary; This picture is not funny, malicious, diverse, it's nothing.
