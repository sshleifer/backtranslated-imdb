His brain's friend "IQ" (Phillip Bolden's voice) and always hungry "scooter" (David Gore) with "NAT" (voice by Trevor Gagnon), with big dreams, kids. They want to be the first fly in space. And how their dreams are waiting for their historic journey to launch the first spacecraft on the Moon, Apollo 11, three launch launches at the Launch Pad near three hangouts. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the film's animation. I've done it very well. It had depth in the scene, because the distance was actually behind the scenes of the scene. I did not see the 3D movie, because it was broadcasted on HBO. However, I can see that there was no such scenario that in the end the characters took advantage of 3D effects without fighting. I was not really impressed with the character design. To me, they do not see something similar to a fly, especially in color. The flies were an unusual blue-gray, which was confusing to me. <br /> <br /> Cast performance was not bad, but it was not good. Many times I was more focused on my computer than the story. The writing was essentially written for young viewers, comedic moments that forced little kids to laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, Jokes says that they will get five to understand the meaning of adults. <br /> <br /> History is not followed in this movie. Actually, I think it was completely ignored, because the main focus was the fly. While popping up on a well-known astronaut screen, I hated and explained that the story of the fishes in the film was a work of imagination and Apollo 11 did not have a torch. I said how he thanked the men and women for sacrificing their life for Space Explorer <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not created for the whole family. This course is certainly for kids. But, save it for one day of rain.
