The movie sucked, it was not funny, it was not exciting. They tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. And this is a great way to choose this movie, next to the hip, the only reason for this movie to be successful ... <br /> <br /> At the moment, 10 out of 10 voted for 50% of the vote. This movie looks good about me, the film Being insane to the public or this vote is unrealistic, which can be numerous factors and should deal with it. However it is less than the average movie in which the average movie faces through advertising. This success can only be described as marketing surprise.
