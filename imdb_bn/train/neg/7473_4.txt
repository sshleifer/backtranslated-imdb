My husband and I were curious by the spectacular - a powerful deliberate southern lady with a dirty personal life resolved the crime for the LAPD. The first season was for us to watch the TV. Unfortunately, in the second season, his personal life stories have become so strong and defiant that we stopped watching the strong character. <br /> <br /> My husband and I are frustrated by this episode where he tries to hide from him. Mother that she is shacked up But breaking the deal was an incident where he hid potential pregnancy from his boyfriend, but told his boss. Why is a strong, middle-aged woman who will do things? Answer he will not be. In addition, my husband and I almost find the bad guy with perfect accuracy. It is almost always introduced in a white male or female assassination scene or camo in an ideal family. Can the script writer do some original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer visitors. We like to show that characters do not betray and insult our intelligence.
