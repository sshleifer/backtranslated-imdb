The tag says "laughter is the state of mind" and I do not hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What is he thinking about making "toys"? When he saw the shock, did he see, successful, funny fantasy? If so, he is working on a different plane than me. This is an extraordinary figure, in which the product design is 90% of the thing (and even cartoon colors are frustrating). Robin Williams and (most notably) Joan Cusack are humiliated as a toy mogul brother and sister, who are being deported as the heirs of the factory in the death of their father. There is nothing remote (mockery or slapstick-wise) for display here. It's one of the biggest "big" films ever scrambled, ugly, and ever made. **** No Star
