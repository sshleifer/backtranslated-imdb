Usually I like low budget budget movies, but Darkman III is so dishonorable that I do not think anything but humiliation for it. <br /> <br /> It looks like and is a TV show, and one that's especially incognito. The sets are vague, light flats, scores and effects disconnected, and the camerawork is Film School 101. There is no plot to speak, Character is one dimensional, and Actor sleeping clock. Most casts seem like they are doing soft-core porn ... In fact, I got the only prize from this mess. Roxon Biggues-Dawson (Star Trek from Velena: Viagra) without her cleansing bumpy head makeup. Nearly two shade lighter than in its skin tone Voyager; He has bleached down for this role, or blacked up for the Voyager. Very weird way
