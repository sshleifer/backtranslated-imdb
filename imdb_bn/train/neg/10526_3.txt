Tired girls-at-reform school school, something that looks like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) stuck there after escaping from his abusive father. Once in jail, he was raped by his fellow female "prisoners". <br /> <br /> Overlapping (even more than 98 minutes), with a complete stupid ending, that seems to be the whole movie is stupid. <Br> <br /> 15-year-old Linda Blair tries her best to show her body during the rally, but during the shower show a nipple shot slip. <br /> <br /> * *** *
