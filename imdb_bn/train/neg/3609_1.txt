This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember it was a few years ago when the video started and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like a fool, I was released once the DVD was bought ... no sad mistake! I would not even be bothered to go to the plot because it is so transparent that you can see it through it. I'm a fan of Herschelle Gordon Lewis so I accustomed to the effect of Chesie Gore and the bad acting but these people take this to a completely different level. It is almost as if they were deliberately trying to make humanitarian potential the worst movie ... If their goal was, they had been successful. If they want to create a movie that scares you or you are able to believe in any form, shape or form, they failed ... Egypt! Avoid this movie ... Read the summary of the plot and you watched it!
