Probably encouraged by his much better "Orlando" supporter, here Potter has distributed one of the worst cars here: He wrote, directs, they co-write with music, and indeed, a song that contains a damned love song. The film strongly resembles a teenager similar to a high school or college project that thinks its own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are attractive to us as her. But Potter's character is disrespectful because the content of his romantic feelings is unlikely, and the entire film is an embarrassing demonstration of the act of celebrating the Tanner. Perhaps he can work if he does not throw himself. She just can not play, play or not. Inspired, high-ambitious, dull, and silly.
