Awesome! Avoid like plague. I will rate this in the top 10 worst movies. Special effects, acting, mood, words, etc. are being done by day care students ... wait, I saw these programs well. With a fuzzy naked woman doing a shower scene opens like a soft porn show then gets worse from then. Good nude scene, but that's it. The sound and light problem was running throughout the movie. Occasionally I swear I heard the cameras roar loudly. Dad! I would like to see another movie in this story, but done by different people. This batch of actors and crew plays more role and requires reading lessons in the movie. Got 10 votes
