Really? Really ???? I know that if you create a political war film then you will notice but this movie was just a junk. In every sense horrible Terribly wrong in many ways The President's objection to the United States, easy time for me to fly a jet fighter and shoot aliens. It was easy to note a few things that were right. When I read my jaw, I saw that the movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was overacted, seemingly stupid plot hesitation, and at times was questionable cinematography. <br /> <br /> X Box, YouTube, ACUPAT Utility ?? None of these things existed in 2004? It was just five years ago when you did not have to do extensive research, coming out of this movie. I'm a veteran of Iraq war and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad you will understand how the BS This is the movie. Platoon or Save Private Ryan is ridiculous to compare this. Why do not you throw commands and red don in there; I think those who can be more correct <br /> <br /> If you can see incredible plot, historical and real repercussions for some reason, this movie is fine. not so more. If you're listening to "Oscar buzz", and you need to add your own Pope review, go ahead. For me, I'm writing to the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
