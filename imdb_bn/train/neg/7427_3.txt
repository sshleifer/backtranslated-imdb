When a friend told me a 12 "wonderful Scifi / Horn movie!" Gave a box set. I was a little cautious to understand. However, the item was a gift, so I did not really really give my usual sense of knowledge. After all .... Movies for Free! So if they are a little bucket. After many considerations, Alien Interscored was the first of these films. Wickedly, it was the first choice because it saw the best of the bunch. I can say that if this is the best among them, then I think what the other people think. <br /> <br /> There were some good things on the surface. Four (Count!) Actors That I Was Familiar Billy de Williams, Tracy Skogins, Maxwell Colluffeld and Jeff Conway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy have some goodies (Star Wars and Babylon 5), so they can not sign up for a turkey so Max is an old Soap actor who has never been able to break the film. ... But it's not a very funny actor. Jeff ... well ... he has done good and bad so far as films and television goes. "I soon discovered that Q for the presentation of his film "ugly" decided to add. <br /> <br /> The first formula was in the early scenes. Jeff finally mugs his way with gusto through a "I'm Crazy" scene before finally killing himself. A fun camio performance, really. Unfortunately it is, without excessive overcrowdance, highlighting the film. <br/> <br /> Thereafter, our mission is Captain (Williams) who is sending Jeff and his crew to see what has happened. Criminal elements But this store is not so much like the Duntie Dozen - more unauthorized foursome. Then, a computer hacker is working on a laptop computer on his computer. Is not a killer slammer a bit like running a gun shop? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the annoying 8-year-old man was dropped from his AirPixel Kit. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. On the way to where Jeff's ship disappears, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by giving them virtual reality weekends, where they include their male fantasies. All well and good, and the use of the scenery from their imagination "Alien Menes" acts as a role that starts to appear there. But did they pull so much for Suuve Luoyounang? Alien intruder? Allen birring, better. <br /> <br /> Finally, they make it in the G-sector and the last appearance only makes the fight against each other until the good old Mac remains. The finished, really hopeful garbage vein film, indicating at a sequel - if! There is also a character created in this movie that I would call "Suitdriad". She was supposed to be an Android, but apparently that make-up crew, lost in lost opportunities with sweaty features in any of the opportunities. But do not worry, in the end he is there to create the number of body count. <br /> <br /> Williams and Skogins, to be truthful, work very little in this movie. They should only stay awake, let alone work. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff makes the first trip to the storm, so his modest film does not allow much light. Max tried her best as one of her best customs members, but the film was honestly unreasonable, honest. <br /> <br /> This film is one and only half the fantasy thing that suggests the ship naming convention. They are named after all musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is soft and stupid. <br /> <br /> Created in 1992, I thought, initially it had 80 straight video video work. It seems that they have made movies in the 90's well. <br /> <br /> This is best avoided. Even as a beer ni chip movie, this movie is frustrating, but at least you can move it fast, I think.
