Why watch this? Just one reason and it is for the glory of John Saxon. I love her acting By her, my favorite favorite is Elm Street 1,3, and 7 a police as Nancy's father, the police as Black Christmas and again from Dus Til Don, as a police nightmare. When I was rummaging through my local music video outlet, I came across the Zombie Death House film and I quickly worked it behind it but before I go ahead I noticed that John Saxon was not the only actor of this film, but I heard that a manager for the first time. It has excited me (also cheap $ 9.00 price tag) and I and I have it. After coming home, I realized that this film did not even have another act of Saxon acting as well as its acting, which was confused by the pressure of joining the order. But not only is he acting in other actors. It seems like they dragged everyone from the latest porn shots and now I'm saying that you must work. The film even shows obscene values ​​of 80. I can not believe strongly that this film offers intermediate visitors, but if you are an intimate fan of 80, the culture that was born in the era of the era, or was worse than the fan culture of bad films. You also if I dig John Saxon.
