This picture is a very funny picture. Violence is bad, acting ... well Danny, singing or screaming or whatever you usually do it. Very rarely, random children have to catch sexually-stricken groups. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. Stories and characters can be very good, if directed, actors and other small things are made better. But the film is very bad, for the only reason it is crying like this guy because it has vane. This picture is probably the worst B rated film. And, believe that it is difficult to achieve, especially when you are competing against deaf-by temptation and unnecessary excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm a CoF fan, and so I just see it as another junk movie ... a really bad one. If Danny made it as a comedy, going well with him. Have done very well. Even more, I lost it less because it is incompleteness. See when you are in happy, happy, joy and joy mode so that you can laugh at all or if you are high on different types of medicines.
