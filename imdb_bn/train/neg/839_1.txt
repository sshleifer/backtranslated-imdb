The only redemption part of this movie was the price I paid. At least I've lost $ 3.00 and this time sitting through the bombs. The crew member in charge of continuation missed the boat. The female lead and the FBI went to the killers position, Mr FBI gave the woman a revolver. When the accused killer comes out on the door, the revolver becomes wizardically transformed automatically. Can anyone think that an FBP agent will supply weapons to a civilian? I do not think so. Mrs. Xavier looks like a very attractive woman. It is very bad that the R rating can not be seen much of it. It seemed as if a film editor could cut off the best parts of the film.
