I had high expectations of being perused up many thumbs up this indie reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> My extra 'two cents' here have already been posted, excellent 'lost translation' review. Prizecy: Morgan is stuck in a dusty small town where he fits a lovely scarlet in the local supermarkets. Can Morgan help her trailer raise high profile scarlet from the trash life? <br /> <br /> realistic dialogue? No Find out how shopping is that about First, Freeman looked inside the target so he went to the Harrods. Then, he bowled on the T-shirt rack that he sure did not go to any of the finest scarlet stores. The reality of Morgan Scarlett has been disconnected from any and all aspects of his life and his ignorance and scarlet life as portrayed as pleasurable. <br /> <br /> One critique needed to attack his former hubbie physically, a car in this example, where his survival, where he enjoyed the scenes of Smurlet and ex-swing fight. Freeman does not run his defense .... He is unable to deal with creeping in disbelief and to deal with a silent aspect of his very real, sad life. <br /> <br /> The key to Freeman's character is the key to car wash and the interview of new publisher, tight-fitting Blouse Scarlett. Another sign that is Freeman Clayes. Freeman's endless 'stage talk', where Freeman's experience is frustrating that all aspects of the reality of Scarlett are related to one or more stages. <br /> <br /> Freeman insists that scarlet young people on their own future and then easily ignore the interior walls of bricks: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, very bad, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem . Scarlett can learn such lifestyle from Freeman: Some people pay $ 100 for T-shirts and an open blouse can open doors instead of lack of education and white collar skills. Eventually Freeman offers a little more scarlet than a strange starter with a 'star', returns to his unchanged life in a city that does not even pay for the death of Scarlett's night even for gas, which Freeman does not know.
