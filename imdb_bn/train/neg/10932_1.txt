It is a sad fact that it has to work with the highest budget "Holistic Entertainment". All involved should be fine for welding since they are good for nothing more than filling all the celluloid trash deprived. Writing is not only cruel and humorous, but camera work and film quality are the best amateur. Soundtrack sounds like it was built on some laptops PCs. The worst part of all is that I actually sit through the whole thing. I think because I could not believe I actually bought a ticket and the theater I saw was actually agreed to show "film".
