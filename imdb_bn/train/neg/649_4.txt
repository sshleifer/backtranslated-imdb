Well this movie has been created for one reason and one reason is to earn money !! The producers obviously were not concerned about killing the classic horror movie. I knew that this movie is going to be a PG-13 as soon as possible, how many pH-13 slash movies have become good? Thats ask how many women are there on the moon? No answer !! The Promote Night 1980 is not a great work, but it must be recognized as a film that holds true in its style and does not try to do even more. <br /> <br /> The problem with my Proming Night 2008 is that it manages the killer and I have 3 big problems with him ..................... < <br /> 1) She escapes through the way she escape, she locks up in a psychological institute and she gets an air conditioner vents !! What a bad situation Why would they be an air conditioner in the patient's room? Do they want to be comfortable during their stay or doing something? 2) His intention is somewhat uncertain that the killer wants family and friends of all the main families to be killed, so that he can keep all of them with himself, he says he loves him but in the next minute he tries to kill him, so what he wants to kill, Her love or just raped her ?? 3) The killer is very good, how does he develop all his skills? He was a teacher, so in this scenario, he killed the boyfriend of the main victim and smiled mostly on sleeping and he did not notice that it was 10 big stars, two big stars from a stupid, stupid attempt. Horror movie
