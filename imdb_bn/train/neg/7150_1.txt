After watching the preview, I felt that this film is going to be a good improvement over the fast and furious series. So, I'm already expecting it to be a story tale, but at least this time it will not load a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not say that I did not like to take my base baseball bat like others). Not only did the story exist, but the action was a crap. I think the director thought that they could only throw a woman and a pair of exotic cars and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the film where the person hit the nose button and its Lamborghini jumped into the air and could win the SLR McLaren. And after some time Eddie Grafin engaged in a fight with her "girls" (in this case the Imam's comments will work) the girl asks to pull and come out of PLANE, and of course they are in the middle of the desert. After this amazing scene I could not take it anymore. So, I just got to see half this half. This was the first movie I ever walked out of. Then, to kill some of the malicious brain cells, I had to stop some drinks. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 because 0 is not an option. You're going to the local car show and the good way off at a strip joint on the way home. I will keep all the visitors in my prayers.
