Extreme amateur Camera work especially overwrought - Documentary camera operators do not always spin around. <br /> <br /> The script is really inactive, and the acting is even worse. Above that, the story is distraught and confusing - with some reasonable holes. At one point, the leader wants to return to prison for suspending suspected al-Mada operators and thus interviews with Osama. I found completely incredible as a result of so many errors in the story. The "film-maker" / lead role really portrays a strip, stupid frat boy. Really the only item of interest, filmmakers did not actually film in position. It's really embarrassing that they spoiled their opportunity to make something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who was shocked?
