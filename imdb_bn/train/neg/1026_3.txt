How nice. I do not think that with such a big actor I've seen a movie that was an important role. Justin Timberlake is probably the single bad actor, who played a major role in a movie, and behind it was Edison as well as money. <br /> <br /> His performance was free. The story was perfect and all other characters were professional actors, Heck and even the LG Cool J race, because there are many small parts to cut his teeth. Timberlake is understood to be the director and movie company for this role. There is no way to understand. <br /> <br /> Whenever its character is on the screen, it destroys its whole character, you really corrupt the police to cap his sad ass, and he can be a hero ... I will not waste this money in the theater or in the video. If you have an HBO and do not have anything to do on Saturday night and you are drunk and rocky, it might be right. <br /> <br /> The role 'Frog' in a Hollywood blockbuster, not just works, is to see Timberlake in this role.
