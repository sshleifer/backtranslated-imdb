Frustrating film. Actor acting weak The set could have been fine, well. The story is weak. The sequence of war is horrific. The sound and sound quality is trashy. Kazak said the history of the people was very bad. In leading roles, this film was supposed to include more Kazakh actors. And also have to have Kazakh language. Kune Baker and J. Hernandez Hispanic sources. I do not get it. As Hispanic people play Turkish-Mongolian people. This movie is a shame in the Kazakh movie. Rustam Ibragimbabhov disappointed me. She is one of the best film makers in the world. Risky director is forgiven, because he is not cruel, he does not know the true spirit and psychological history.
