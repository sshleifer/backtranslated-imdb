Because of the "Rou Force" extra kungfu fights, white slave slaves, energetic zombies and a completely shy performance, a very lazy and perverted version of love love. This picture was not included in the recently released "Greenhouse Experience 20 Movie Box Set". It is getting exploitation fanatics everything is getting, combining a completely incoherent and seemingly improvised script! Manufacturing costs are extremely poor and technical aspects are unfortunate, but immense violence and sexuality can be very rarely described. The film is opened in a tropical sunny place called Warriors Island, where a bunch of beggars raises the dead without any apparent reason to convert them into Kung Fu fighters. The beggars also bought sexy slaves from Hitler's similar merchants, perhaps it seems that women's meat provides the necessary energy to increase their muscle. A three-martial arts warrior, a woman LA police and a rebel, but gradually a fleet of cruise ships attack Hitler's gangsters among the whole group of women because they plan to travel to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat floats the island, and the beggars challenge the survivors to fight with their jambs. Okay, how is that crazy midnight horror movie that sounds for a mess? This is not yet finished because the "Rou Force" includes another embarrassing role of Piranah, Wild Fleet, Cameron Mitchell and 70 exploitative Dashes Camilla Keton ("I spit on your grave"). Fog has missing cattle loads, including fog spots and decimation, hammy joke and bad taste romance. The trash-value of this movie will literally leave you stupid. The background of the evil beggars is ultimately vague, and they are not even punished for their suspicious hobbies. Maybe that's why "the movie" continues to "with the change". The sequel has never come, unless it's a vague IMDB listed on it.
