This will be the top top animated show ever made. And yes, I have even shown "the end of Evangelion" and that still has hated it more to me. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think of the psychological and philosophy of obstacles, but Evangelion does not eat anything else in the cage! Characters began to be very interesting. Come on, Missto and Pen-Pen are the only interesting ones. As for the other, most of the others had a bunch of Victims of Venus Cribia. They must go to a skeletic center without piloting giant robots against the "Angels" aliens. <br /> <br /> Even May Cha and alien battles did not help. Something like this goes: <br /> <br /> "This is a robot, and they are really cool because when they get hit (!) When they get hit, they are not really fools, but they take the angels, so sometimes They become insane and the affected pilots do not do what they want, and they should be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend anyone's promotion, anime otakus Or not For those who love this series, you deserve this opinion, I respect you. But it seemed that "feeling from your heart" thinks that everyone will love this series, you're even more arrogant. <br /> <br /> I like "Macros", "Mospida", "Run" - Deep "and" Robot Tayakwan V "himself.
