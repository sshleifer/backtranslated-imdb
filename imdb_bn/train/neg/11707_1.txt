It was made for TV in 2003, it was naturally featured in a women's channel. As a human, why do I try to see it? I do not know, but I should check my head. And director and writer Simon Gurney should be ashamed to be ashamed of himself. He removes any strength and firmness, which can lead to most boring women. One is named as the wife of Joses Hessar. I could not wait to release him. His revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing by most of the movies. The other woman was Petal Nicole Hilitz, about the coldest person you ever want to meet. His face was not so warrant that our leading people would not go to the vault and his performance was so obvious, only a fool could miss. Definitely a damaged. Tempie lock was very good, but she persuaded her own husband to play as a slut gradually, and played like a man of David Dilus. The victims are stranded outside of our cast, acting as a boss who can make Anthony Denison mad at our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or I would say the victim, that was not good. At first I thought he was a bad actor, but later I believe. He was not getting off part of the ground and was repetitive all the time. However, as a human being, when I took away two women, I became angry. Men, be careful of this channel which pushes men and women even kill them. LMAN channel. Be careful Note: This is the second time I've seen it wrong, I'm convinced in my initial thoughts. Especially the author / director Simon Gurney I still believe the male species disgraced and the horse should be whipped. Only mercy is stored in Tempti Lock, there is no chance to show her talents with the terrible acting of Junkins, Heser, Hilts, and Deluge around this movie. Plus fool plot that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and its zero stars. Please do not show this trite again in LMN.
