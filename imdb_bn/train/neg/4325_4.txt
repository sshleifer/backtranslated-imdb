The second in the Vacation series is easily one of the most enjoyable, Clark Griswold won the whole family to travel to Europe. <br /> <br /> Belly is a delicious person who has done so well for the first time. Here is virtually undefined. This error is certainly with the director of Hacking, Herling, who is very close to director, like Herod Rodis, and very unreliable scripts that often have several decent lines spread. <br /> <br /> They can do that; Chivy Chase gives injection of some kind of life in the proceedings, but it is not enough just enough and very funny Eric Idle is destroyed in a small land like unfortunate English. Some potential sunny moments are not played from their full potential and most of the viewers leave aggravated. All illustrations of Europeans are not one-dimensional and almost universally funny (eg how good English is.) <br /> <br /> There is not a smile in the scene as well as a few scenes in the scene, one in the whole slapstick. But if you can see the movie of the Chawi Chase fan (like me), then nothing more than that.
