You can say the best thing about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sony Chiba, then this movie gives you a lot of it. Chibo lectures; Chewing gum; Chibo Sunny! The camera is burning in the chest; Chiba nuts living nuts out of the whole bunch of naughty; Chibo sits around the parade and chair and looks thoughtful / indifferent; Chibda drives her car ... <br /> <br /> I enjoy the cheeses as actors and as a martial artist ... but for Chibba fan, there may be a little more Sony Chiba in this film. It's probably something of a vanity vehicle for her. And no, I will not put "street fighters" in the same class because he plays a cruel, moral hero in "SF" and he shares camera friends and enemies with a playful cast. Here, he rolled in front of the front and center almost all the time, and he tried to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee one. Toshiro Mifun and Chou Yun Fat could not stop it for the length of the whole film, and Sony welcomed him. At least once he could have changed from his case. <br /> <br /> This movie has been made completely worse by the inefficient and poorly-executed sequence (apparently for the American version of the movie front) and a fool's cheer "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !! ) That's the start of things on the wrong foot. Some surprisingly amateur and inappropriate dubbing - Sony (or its usual English stand-in) can not be disturbed for the voice of the American version, apparently because they are totally different and smooth voices and some poor spec in the dialect of "Street Fighter" we all know and Coming from the face of love is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Even with all these bugs and overspores it may still be classic, but camera work and battle scenes frustratingly chess. I am convinced that the carat is actually amazing as the character of Chiba, but it works, but the director and cameraman printed the fight scenes with a weed hacker and hedge their bits so that you can not actually see it going on most of the time. It's not all bad: there are some decent shots and compositions, and at least a memorable one and night when bad people appear in the client's bedroom in a truly innovative way. <br /> <br /> and forget about the actual plot. For a "bodyguard", Chiba's character is something stupid. The screenplay is based on its errands and oversights that repeatedly put him (and his "client") in dangerous situations so that he could come out of them and after 30 minutes, it would even be the best believable verdict to remember this guy to be good Is supposed to be. (Also, if her character was really to destroy the Japanese drug business, she took her client to the plaque on a 10-minute screen and her tooth was pressed like a stain until her tiny secret was concealed! And a complete pointless death and The clash has been avoided.) <br /> <br /> Still, this movie is completely a long way from the bottom of the barrels. It's still Sony Chiba, and she's still fun to see. I've given a profit to stop the DVD Rack in a local Mega Mart, and I think it was once worth a visit.
