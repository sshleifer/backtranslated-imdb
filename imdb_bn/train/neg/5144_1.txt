Orange tone from everything was just lucky. Oh yes, the main character lives in orange-colored people with all orange gates. Meanwhile, in order to escape psychologically from this tragic poverty of the body, he plays a full-immersive video game (does not follow any rules and does not follow any logic gameplay). He obviously earns an income in the game but he is revealed to be the company's employee of the game? After the non-commentary break most of the stories are slowly sinking. He uses an unexpected orange computer interface which is an unexpected interface which is apparently annoying and I suspect only a Microsoft future release. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I ask the audience, basically why is he ruining his precious time in some serious game when he rarely needs life? Oh yes, playing games fun, but what are the points when you are almost starving? Even though he is making his life shy, even more orange-colored links full-immersive video game closes his dog (perhaps looking for a master who takes a moment to pay attention to him and regularly feeds it) stolen from a woman. (When he is ignoring the reality of his shy orange color). <br /> <br /> He is disturbed by some play, his play-team has lost all the weird movies. to yawn. So she wants to be the best of the best, get her Ash Catchem (all of us got bore). The lane, this main character is hungry like a human being and has no benefit from its physical beauty (which is some way that he can escape from its deleterious poverty). <br /> <br /> She is not sent to the "real" level and it sucks, at least, terrifying and she is mentally sent to kill a former Comatose classmate living in the "real" level. Finally, the colorful orange color film is not a tiring curiosity to look at, but the main characters are trapped in fictitious computer-generated poverty, and they are really in the real world. "Perhaps he will kill and live in the real world. Kills and he goes to the digital effect, what a great fool thanks to you, you suck so much Drink, director. <br /> <br /> The director here had a chance to release himself a little bit by killing this lousy fur madly cruddy movie with a philosophical twist. <br /> <Director said, "There is real world and if you live in it And contribute to make it even better, but it will not be a weird orange-colored poor land. "This sticky film is a trick to send a slow gradient to the basic citizen pride The way (1% of the viewers who do not really find anything to entertain at this moment or movie-makocist). <br /> <br /> The Director, to have some ugly digital effects and destroy all the possibilities of release for this horrific comedy. All this had to be screwed during the time of making, which was waste of money, waste time and visitors' trust. After <br />, it ends. Good radiance I hope the director chokes it. I put this hack on the "avoid all costs" list for any other films associated with my name.
