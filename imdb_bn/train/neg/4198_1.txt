I caught this Cuban film at an Arthouse Film Club. In 1935, after the magistrate Silly Symphony cartoon, it was shown where the Isle of Symphony got together with Isle of Jazz. Recently, late Rubee Gonzalez pipe through this old movie-balloon speaker and a Cuban flank hanging from the Peeling Stuuko Rokyalol motifs, the scene was set to celebrate the recording of filming involving the film, and hedging was synchronized to the statues of Helms-Burton. But then the film started. And the film's peeling paint has gradually become more attractive than screen awake screen. <br /> <br /> The story of Nada has promised many promises. An indifferent tweep-stampor at the Carla Cubber post office Converting and reprinting his only adoption letters from the existence of a whole hemorrhoid, converting basic interpersonal books into breathless emotional Brentian blasts. Numerous shots of photonsic cube of the lungs with joy, sorrow, sorrow, terrorism and similarity. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the film is fatal in film-school artillery, endless trips to Latino character. Marx's brothers are even sticky and even - especially when performing great edits - celluloid scratching of School's Skin Differences on a character's face. <br /> <br /> Lots of countless characters. Post office Basu, Kunda, a humorous dominatrix-nosferatu. His boss-eye colleague, punch, different fingers, eavesdrops and screeches points. Sealer, Metalhead dolt and romantic interest, Carla demonstrates the secret of secret writing while leaving for Miami. A Chase scene (Oh-so-sunny fast forward) is cast for good measurements. All of this will be good at a mortar and filename comic strip, but the black-white zero-fx hits with brilliant preference. <br /> <br /> Nada is trying to stretch the style somewhere, 'Amelie's Quikir-Heroin-Millmax-unknown' and Il Postino's 'Poem-as-great-redeemer' theme. Like Amelie, his hero is a strange single white woman, who tries to bring magic to strangers, to fight against the upcoming Spinsterdom. And like Il Postino, poetry in the film does not flinch from recitals continuously and a postman takes a romantic lead to a postman. Unfortunately, Nada month failed to catch the brightness and enthusiasm of the film. <br /> <br /> There are two things to watch this movie on the TV show late in the night. The first is the open overhead curtain in Karla, a checker-tiled floor, which is the Crossword Puzzle. The second is to show Nada Mas as a warning: Our post Bu√©n Vista Social Club can often take a draw because of the obscurity with the Cuban artist, which combines the soundtrack with a Bongo. The film could not be released worldwide - such as the Waiting List and Guantanamo films have successfully added many regional areas.
