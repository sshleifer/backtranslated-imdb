I looked at a few times, looking forward to a huge positive quote (with a small name) and wondering if I had lost something. The other night it was in one of the movie channels, and I did tune. I missed nothing. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I only saw the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie later became a comedy gold. In the first 30 minutes, I am deeply skeptical of the complete lack of sunshine speed and laughter. <br /> <br /> "I do not know how to start my movie" in the classic genre. , With a long, tired relationship with how he wants to suits. It's not funny. It's not even remote fun. Others commented on "San Francisco" bit; Well, he said a little little chocolate. Then he swallowed the ground, laughing laughing laughing at the camera. Get yourself Actually, I think the reason for talking about the camera bit was that I immediately dislike the film. Do not guess the contact with your audience. Contacts _earned_, like many honors. <br /> <br /> There's basically a fat whiny guy to talk about his lazy life as a temp in a very cheerful way. I do not understand the Jews; It is a ugly call to Jewish troupe to call this "Jewish humor". It's just strange humor. The reason you are Jewish is not only to mean you have a punch for the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, is a good job of self-analytical laughter than this man, so it's not obviously about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If I saw the bit done one thing, I could get stuck around. But some schlub he's going to talk about how he loves the name he works with women, then their list of five minutes, is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a clear attempt to make a capital market on the "Office Space" popularity. Do not let yourself be the target of marketing the goal. Do not just say "haiku tunnel".
