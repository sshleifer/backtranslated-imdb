I hired this by mistake. I thought, after a finite examination of the box, it was a time-travel / science-story. Instead, it is a "Christian" story, and I think fairly typical examples. If you have sold the message, perhaps you will ignore the oddity of plot / performance / etc, but I think it is painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am disturbed by the replay of history in this story. In the 1890s, family values ​​and morals are represented in heaven as some kind of heaven (a character is incredibly 5% of the marriage is ending in marriage!), But it ignores the strict aspects of the "very moral" society (strict racist, sexual, and social discrimination Was broad, for example). And at one point the protagonist complains to the clothing shop owner who is no different than the allegations of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in the recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought, if you like this type of thing, then it's a favorite thing and it's great ...
