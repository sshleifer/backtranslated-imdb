Richie's first two films were graduate, stylish entertainment. Here, he hijacked two recent classic ?? 'General suspect' and 'fight club' ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway ...) and a 'Fight Club' tries to circulate which is a real character and that internal expression, the film struggles to maintain its second half interest. The last third, you know that you are taking a blind lane down, and slowly that is slowly. <br /> <br /> Cons, chess and game theory are all great things, but Richie spills too much among them and uses the ingredients in much more repetitive. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) worth watching, with Ricci's bold view and Morris-Jones's dynamic camera. If Richie gets trapped in a more contentious plot, and tends to rigid performance, then there is no reason why he could not make another enjoyable gangster keeper. <br /> <br /> Like Revolver your time is wasted. Ignorance profundity is not equal. If you want to see a great movie that does not have a logical sense, it creates a quality (and, incidentally, that involves unreasonable roles from single prisons), see 'Lost Highway'.
