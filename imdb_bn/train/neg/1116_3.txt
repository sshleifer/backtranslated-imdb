This movie appears to have been in the job training exercise for the Coppola family. It does not seem to be "A" or "B" western. I mean, Hero is called Hollang cassidy for God. William Boyd will tremble in his grave. <br /> <br /> All "B" Western Clive is here. At White Hat, two guns of pistol hero Atheist staid ("Siemens Thunder"), black colored arches, heroine of distress, dashing in trouble, cowardly sheriff, bad guys at the top etc. <br /> <br /> Acting, with some exceptions, strictly Yakima From the Canon School of Acting. Like Chris Lybbert (who?) Hero and Louie Schwartt (who?), Wilell thinks that they would have been more at home in the poverty line 30's. Veteran actor Martin Shane, Robert Caradin, Cloze Gulzar and Will Hutchins's cast also helped little, but they were not given enough amount to rescue them. <br /> <br /> Martyn Shane / Robert Carrenine is gradually increasing? Do we believe that Shane was the ghost character? What was the purpose of black gloves? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Besides heroes and chief villains, other characters are seen as authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were going to revive the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they originally thought of writing it in writing. With a chip on her shoulder handed her hand a hole in her head, and the part of Lee Marvin turned out to be nice. <br /> <br /> I say big but what else can I say in Thunder?
