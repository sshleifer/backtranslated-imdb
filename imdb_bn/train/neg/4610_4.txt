I saw this movie because I noticed that it was the image of Curry Wuhaar. I have kept a theory about him for a long time that he is a talented actress, but it does not appear to be proven because he is always in the low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to work on top of those unfortunate elements in her. This is no different. The film is often ugly and annoying, but that does not make it good. George played against Wendt's type, and it was so bad that he recognized his role. Another note about Miss WÃ¼rer. I saw her last, her breasts seem to have definitely narrow. Perhaps a decreased surgery, or (more likely) removal of the implant. This is not a bad thing. She looks great yet. I want him to see a good movie.
