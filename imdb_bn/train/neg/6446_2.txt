Western society is a poor country with ideas about India. Movies like this make only those who believe strong. Such examples make Indians more difficult to take abroad. Poor and homeless in India, but if there are no successful people, there is no representation of educated people. <br /> <br /> <br /> I painted Patrick Soze as another Mother Teresa. According to me, the film has shown India in a very bad light by giving a false idea. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Why do people ask me, "When we go to India, we can hire an elephant outside the airport, so we do not have to walk on the street like our throat and snake?" <br /> <br /> Those who want second opinion on contemporary Indian society will see "seasonal marriage".
