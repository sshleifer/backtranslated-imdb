Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-boy for the television station UBC (the United Broadcasting Corporation). He is not going anywhere in the workplace, offering ridiculous projects to studio officials like "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor" - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming Director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilby's) wisely rejected Mr. Russell's proposal, but there is no idea of ​​picking a hit TV show. His editor, Heather North (Jennifer Scott), who doubled as Russell's girlfriend, is a chimpanzee who wants to watch Russell's Hack TV. Closed, monkeys can watch all popular shows, and easily hit hits. Russell discovered the talent of the chip and used him to advance his career.

A look through the cast will be transparently identifying the TV actor's fascination and try to make the place. In the honor of Rafael's beer-gazing, the actors guess and you can play a drink where you saw them before. Here's a start - Hey, "Jelly I dream" from "Do not Below"? Good Creator! <br /> <br /> Bairfut Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Cart Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
