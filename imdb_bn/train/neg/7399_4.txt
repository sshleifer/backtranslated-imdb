It has been rated as the most expensive movie in Finland's history, "Dark Flores" is a horror film with a very Lynchyan narrative which refers to the growing series of "floor" (maliciously enough) in a abandoned hospital, which is a trap in our character. Under the leadership of the autistic daughter and her father, she lacked the lack of medical development of her daughters, and decided to lift the hospital debate with nurses about the issue. Collective with a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly drunken tram, soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone. Finland-born Piet Risky, better known for his television work, "Dark Flores" is mainly portrayed in the film using English actor, but notable among the most controversial Filmmaker groups "Library" (2006 Eurovision Song Contest Winners). In their own stages, inexperienced clothing, as opposed to the movie, yet there is a failure in production for these razors where the audience's determination is most needed. <br /> <br /> The term "very cool" by any film that uses their main character has already led to a suspicious path, and this mess does not break the mess of the lord. For all the good ideas cast into the mix, a little cliché and as well as the worst things that are really fun is destroyed. The concept of deteriorating basins is primarily extremely harmful and it gives the feeling of inevitable destruction because the audience is aware that people trapped in hospital may be able to make further progress in Maya. However, due to an unknown fear, the atmosphere is not created enough to scare and scare the audience, the viewer is aware that the journey will become more dangerous because the levels are shining from white to black, but I do not think it is enough aware of the characters for threats. . Also, it's basically its own bubble which takes place in the whole film, again very nice touch, a concept that is not often used in a horror style, but the characters do not face enough fear and horrible conditions when they fall apart. True, they are very easy to understand the concept of the audience, and without much real concern about their business. These initially good ideas are left to waste, such as if the director and / or Mr. Lord (among whom most of the ideas used in the movie) had these ideas but could not agree or decide how to use them. And lose their intentions and points. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of comedy for all frustration, but not for the expectations that the creators expected. Much more is clichéd, too much is recycled and too ridiculous to just too much. Although the lead is played by Noah Huntley, the character is simply cardboard cut out which is stuck in the stories of other movies. We have an intelligent person who can protect her daughter along with interest in a well-developed love affair. Traditional token black people as "hard-nassed security guards" with infinite clips for our sideminds "couple" and with an incredible unbeliever trader looking for themselves. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Lord's threshold is known as nightmare, which harms our mad band, but not for them. What is fearful of viewers is contextualising a scary film fear. "Burning" is horrible because it is owned by your own family member of "Don of the Dawn", it is the ownership of each other and the jammy of lethal cancerism and irrational thoughts, the fear of "Allian" is explained, animal is reasonable and "dark floors" there Not there. Perhaps it is not wrong to compare this type of singularity to this requirement, but when you show it, it is significantly affected and it does not seem to be much more aggressive than the default clonons, where you can wear clothing without much wear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The movie" has become slower as "Hollywood", in the same way as George at the beginning of Romeo , But it is not always implemented. I've enjoyed the movie and do not think I was sitting in ninety minutes, but I felt completely enjoying the hollow level, as if it seems that no incident happened to me or influenced me self-confident, emotionally or critically. I felt almost the Lynchyan narrative was a permanent plus point, but it was wiped out. Why did it happen? What does that mean? Will they go through all this again? It's annoying to try to become an artist even in addition to even the slightest insight into what the film will be like. Was the whole sequence of real events or was it just a dream sequence? The autistic girl watched the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest and the pressure on her was a very annoying nightmare? Who knows? And unfortunately I even fail to work on the energy to care for care. "Dark Flores" is a scary experience which, ultimately, shallow hemarchs appear to be possible and at the very least, the creative forces of Lord Lord, who probably want to do solo work to fully develop their own ideas. This is something that a group or folks might follow, but you may feel hidden because there is not enough light on the situation.
