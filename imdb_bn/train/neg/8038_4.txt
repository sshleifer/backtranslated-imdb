** Spirris ** Slashar film does radiculis that does not give any idea to a black-out wardrobe and an assassin that looks like a rubber mask of Peter Lauer. At the beginning of the film it was said, the first scene, the young Beth Morgan was rehabilitated for heavy drug use after the murder of his boyfriend in a tennis collage a year ago. <br /> <br /> It has also been brought out which was falsified by FBI agent Sakar (Jeff Convay), who was wrong to catch the killer, also killed at Tenson at the same time. Before the movie "Do You Win Zone A Secret", it can not be explained that after one year after the assassination of Connecticut, about half a dozen collage students were killed in Florida? Another killer, at least in Beth's boyfriend's murder, wore the same stupid Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The computer gaik Brad Clayton, along with Chad Allen, has been involved with this massacre even with the police chief Gavin, Jack McGee There is nothing to do with targeted students, it has become open to open with them. <br /> <br /> Masked killer rescues Beth at the end of this wonderful event in a lonely church like Florida Everglades. Then finally he revealed that his prisoners and his purpose made more sense as much as the movie. All the movies trying to scare the viewer are confusing and it is also in the view of many strong believing slashes. Victim Oz Washington, Tom J Jones, the most effective person, has kept at least three attempts in his life and was a hero in the film together with Agent Saker. <br /> <br /> Oz was a sticky cut from a large isolation of glass, which cut almost half of it and kidnapped him, but later he miraculously restored, he was not grateful after being arrested for murder, in reality he was with the killers He could not have spent two more times until he was a little lazy on his walk! Why did Ojha and Beth go to arrest and kill the killer instead of calling the police themselves, did they understand that by any cell phone they were owed? <br /> <br /> Bett's boyfriend, who has lost his head in John Howard, Joseph Lawrence, is also very upset and upset with two daughters of the sea beach. Together they are being victimized with Beth Oz, and then disappeared from sight! For a moment you did not know that they were actually killed or that there was some confusion in the oz or local police. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Started walking. It seemed that Bett has made her boyfriend worse!
