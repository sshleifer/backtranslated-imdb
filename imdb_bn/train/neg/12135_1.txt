Although it has been 2 years old, I still think of the complete waste which includes the whole plot of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and selected it while browsing through a new publication in Blockbuster. We decided to choose the film because we all did not see it and it seems to be enjoyable. Although I spent quite a bit of time watching the film, I still lacked the plot (seriously no true plot) and waste the entire waste of time spent watching it. If you are in the video store and this film keeps your eye on, look for the better movie. I understand your pain if you finish this movie :)
