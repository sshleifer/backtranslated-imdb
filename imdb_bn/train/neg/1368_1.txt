I could have given the highest rating to this movie without allowing zero and negative numbers to be considered. Pee Yew, a very disconnected B-list artist who has done a lot of good work, has written and driven some people with a twelve-year-old mentality, a pointless mess of a movie, who fools in the sunny and giggles, and pop and fert jokes. For example, the character of Jean Staplton (Ding-Bat of All In the Family) tells the character of Marilou Hannan that she has sex "in both ways" with sex, there was an inexpensive endeavor for a gentle indication of the general lamnist in the film ... you want good, ridiculous humor? Animal House Rental, American Pie (only a part), Old School or Office Space.
