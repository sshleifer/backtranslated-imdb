This Columba movie script was pulled directly from the 1980s soap opera. Deeply character driven films are great, but only if the characters are compulsory. And the only thing I wanted to do was to change the channel in this movie. The villain's dialogue seems to be the romance novelist's text. Great le Colombo itself is not a place near his famous, loving, self-faulted, crushed soul; And the victim of the bride / kidnapping victim is a radioactive, one-dimensional daughter-cowers (she counts fearfully from a small scale scale held in the hands of her kidnapper - let me touch her out of the scale and she knows what you kicked in 2 seconds) . In any sense of reality, this character will try to struggle or fight at least a little bit. And speaking the truth ... the story is about the abduction of the police which works and solves the police. Police ?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes every kidnapping case. It was not a Colombo, but we knew it. Only a shallow and completely expected criminal drama with Columba was written and expanded 2 hours.
