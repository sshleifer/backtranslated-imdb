The ridiculous / sci-fi is interesting as it is ridiculous. F / X is pretty good ... which you manage to look at. Made for a TV thriller which is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Kumbs has played a great role, though confused scientist that manipulates human DNA with stamp-cell tampers and a hammerhead shark with research. The horrific consequences give birth to a hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forcith and Hunter Tilo were invited to the remote island to test a bright new test. Of course, after laughing and frustration ... the creation of the kubbs, his own son is hammer, and his father's colleagues to hit one after the other. Revenge is not always fruitful. Also in Cast: LC Mueller, G. More. Johnson, Arthur Roberts, and Valiezar Bennov.
