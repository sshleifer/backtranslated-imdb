I saw Dwarf-movie first and sometimes I had a little fun watching it. Many famous TVs / comedy appearances appear in the first part and in the fantasy dresses, in the usual little episodes of their stand-up program and the problem with the second film is exactly the same. Everything was there ... nothing new was achieved. You are often the most annoying and stupid "Jokes" most familiar and you think that their goal should be kept in the comedies of the last decade, who want to go back to the stage. Nothing about the story is important: Rummelstritscin's general fairytale story story, without any importance. I hope something like that but I can not complain about it. I am really complaining about lazy story writers who had full background stories; Their only business got many jokes and parodies inside but they did not even get it. Without the total waste of help and time of money, this bad word is omitted. (If you do not like her, then delete 2 points of my assessment). If you want to save your money and want to get a bad joke, check it every Friday evening on a wide cast on SAT1 or RTL. I'm certain you would recognize some "laugthers" I saw the movie last night.
