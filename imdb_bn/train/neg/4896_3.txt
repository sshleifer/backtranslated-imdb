I'll start with what I like. <br /> <br /> I like the songs, everything was good about them, dresses, songs, songs (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything <br /> <br /> I saw cabin scenes and cooking scenes Like <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> too much. Much more silence (it was interesting for one hour, but two hours of hearing action and shouting from time to time, really ...), too much annoyance (no movie should ever be annoying, how deep it is!), Too much porn As the scene (I really got it, I realize that they were filming a porn movie there, but actually, really, really much more) I really think, This is certainly no way to see inemati should be, and that can not be. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the song.
