To quote the film, "It does not know well, it's good to forget well, to give up all is good." Oh, satire <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technological refinements of a horror movie, but horribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel that being promoted by you <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Writer's growing character dialogue can be summarized by bad police TV and Jerry Springer show. For a film such as Hitchcher, maybe Russia's set is not a terrible movie. As a result, a potentially great setting and some potentially desperate cattle scenes are destroyed and simply become stupid, neither fearful nor meaningful.
