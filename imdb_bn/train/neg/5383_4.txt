I think I would like to start this work that almost any type of work can be entertaining. I gave equal titles for this review to see if the true test is better than starting from the beginning. Many of us will agree - even like me who enjoy reading many blogs - blogs can not compare with writing a good novel for many reasons. Likewise, fame can not be compared to making good films for several reasons and I believe it is a poor example of independent film. From the beginning to the end, the fem seems like a vlog together together. (Hack, even myspace gets some pumping.) I want to see one hour of lonelygirl15 - I do not - I'm going to see it. In the fame, although the predicted media bubble gum is certainly great compared to the atmosphere, it is private without it being a personal story. It seems to be the life-span of life, which I think most agree will be very naturally annoying. And yet the fair makers want to congratulate us, their most modern film for making a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that I'm interested in taking time to write this review. It's not bad at the fame, because it's not; It's a few moments in which I smile or think - OK - something of interest is going to happen. It's just that it's just ... mediator. <br /> <br /> I hope filmmakers / actors will be out of debt from their efforts. I hope this is suitable for an oximon. They probably need it when one of them goes out and goes away with life. <br /> <br /> If you have time to waste and see what you want to do, check out this movie; Otherwise, do not worry that it's passed by, and you've missed some great, talent to explore. You really do not
