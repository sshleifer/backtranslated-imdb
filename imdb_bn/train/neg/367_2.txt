A young boy comes in a lot of money and starts to live in it soon. Unfortunately, the person whose meaning is really it will be very bad. She wants her loot. When he discovered who is the money, he started to try to get it back. She tries out of this young boy, who is lucky enough to fall into the hands of only the wicked. Known sound, I bet. Very predictable, not all interesting. Get something different, okay?
