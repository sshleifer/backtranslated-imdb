Mark Hamill should be ashamed of the Karvat Summer! During this time, he uses a new kind of "power" to get back his possession of a dream, a bright red Vette. It looks like another naughty young man walks in the first half hour and the U-turn in the head for the wrong. Writing and guidance work is done horribly, you can rarely take a few views. You are expecting to happen anyway, and you are softened to the end of the 70's. A former new comer just like Annie Pots will steal the show easily and save this poor movie from repo creeps! His unrealistic but delightful personality holds on to your interest for the best, and the best opportunity to see him in a swimsuit. Hurry for anne! Sorry, Mark! I guess this was not the force with you during this time.
