I saw the advertising of this movie when I was very excited because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. Movies, however, do not meet my expectations. After reading the book recently when stories are translated, it often prepares me for the big happenings. The letter does not seem to fit very well with books. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was a real connection with the audience about what was happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what is happening. It just seemed slapped together and ran through and ran through I was very disappointed with the movie. I think that if you do not read the book, it may be okay. At the very least, it can motivate you to read the book, which you will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
