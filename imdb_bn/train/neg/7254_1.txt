Wrote two or three brilliant reviews, who were involved in making this film, the word was used lazyly, or it was rolled up in the bank, and the case should be later, I want my seven dollars back! Actors, the word is used tirelessly, is terrible, in fact most of them have never done something that is a relief. This screams about scenery and everything, 7 dollars for working with us and there was a day to do it. Was it somebody back? Everything says about the project, low budget. The best actor was the D list. Do not waste your time until you want to take it back and try to get back the rent. The lead bad guy looks at that punk from the 70th show that the marriage ended with his grandmother Dumami Moore. My local blockbuster video store combines the movie with the most tragic comments. Combine these dusting dust as even a 99th cents. Someone really will have to owe some party. This is a super stinker and I give it 10 turds.
