The main character for this film is William Ras TV. He left his family behind and started to stop paying back his loan. But he tried to stay away from his family. Peter Falk (Colombo) came where Thets played different roles, to convince him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they are actually able to get a former star (Peter Faw) and use him a fairly nice degree But William Russell was not really a star. However, his acting seems to be okay still. <br /> <br /> I found out how to deliver everything in the forecast and stories too fat. Actually, in the last 20 minutes I can point the word for the word. A good movie should never be such a thing. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a sub-par movie. A letter grading system, it will get a "D".
