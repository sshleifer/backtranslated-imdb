During the separation between three minutes and twenty minutes, "Salam-e-Ishq" is an excellent but sponsored comic soap opera from India which affects us with six different romantic love stories (which is, at least four stories in my conjecture). <br /> <br /> An MTV music video and super-bold beer commercially portrayed in crossroads, the film's exterior settings, dazzling colors, sexy shovels, high-speed music-and-dance numbers, dreams and fantasy sequences, vinking character acids, Koni Dialogs and Weaver-Over-The-Top Comic Performance - When most Bollywood events occur these days, most stand-alone staffs This is a tiring trick that simply tries to dance directly to all the characters, as they privatize their path through dance, life and incredible tales. <br /> <br /> The audience here has to care for her lot - at least all the drops of dead deadly women - but she needs patience to get her all the way through.
