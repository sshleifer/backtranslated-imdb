... although for a film that is trying to market itself as a terrible market, there is a distinct lack of blood. <br /> <br /> Proficient guidance, acting, editing, and script-writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London I saw one of the most terrible performances - like her madness "malstormum in disturbed" madness is self-aware and tedious. Look at him! Hey, he got strong spirits! Oh, look at her, raise her head high, her head is in a crazy corner! Oh, look at her strange, stylish dark hair! Hey, listen to his very sunny voice! He must be the oppressed artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, come out poet shirts - this is another boy who thinks that Byron (Or PO.) Oh for love ... Does anyone give a person a manual about how "this person can do a good job" or they drag him away from a cardboard box, the closure is a small plastic toy prize dior-bin grain brand . All right, that was a stupid line - but the performance of London has ruined my brain with its horrors. <br /> <br /> Catherine Higgel is beautiful, and very horse-pink, but the film still has increased in her shoes - she retained her lines, as she was retained, in fact, her entire performance was very woody, her As the line went tough - who knows, maybe he was just reacting, and Jeremy tried to neutralize London's whirlpool. The supernatural, but in that case, he took away too much. <br /> <br /> Notable as Arie Verveen Poe - when her character's role is confused, she supplies the piece's best performance. She looks quite simply, but more than that - she has some depth, I believe that the remaining characters of her life have life beyond two-dimensional values. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Pok√©, and thus my mind can enter and invent when it was on screen - however, the reason for its interest was otherwise absent. <br /> <br /> The remaining letters are a vague blur - all have normal caricatures: Perky blonde is a bit of a floozy who is best friends; The ant is a bit of a dork who is the local police; Our heroine is a protective elder who may have very unpopular interests; The old witch of the plan, etc. etc., Javan, Javan. <br /> <br /> As a "distinct lack of blood for horror films", they do not refer to any theme (and referring to the character of London - so slowly - through his attack in the writings of Po). Another critic said - It was possible: murder, turmoil, genuinely frustrating, but instead they skirt away from this problem and move away from violence (jumping through the air in an air - closing its prey - then - - Black cut! This is a silly traditional horror thing, it is expected, and it is taken delightfully when it happened - it's a Favorite conference, especially when with fake playing bolt and acute saxie eye makeup - but 'successors' it comes just as weird or the editor gets qui in the last minute and can spend.) It may be a very psychological thriller - Palingenesis / delusion / madness The horrors of - or a simple (and funny) slasher movie: It tries to be both, not (something new and exciting!), But the way it's seamless Is not ashamed. The only horrific element in this movie is the atrocity of the epic. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if anyone) has been drunk, then he will spend this thing - there is a strange prediction on the scene; Scenes appear to be out of view (but that might just be poor script). Likewise, director and filmmaker - there was some strange shot and framing to pay tribute to Hitkoc or Browning, but at the end I looked stupid (again, was silent, but it was trying to do something else. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, unfortunately, for me the couch I settled down, reduced the lights, myself With the crazy intention of fools - this is a very poor film, and I'm afraid that I can not recommend it to humans, even <br /> <br />, do not waste your time or money - a real horror Borrow / Thriller Movies, or find a copy of your own fabulous story, you can expect to achieve with this garbage, a lot more enjoyable than Guy and be afraid at night.
