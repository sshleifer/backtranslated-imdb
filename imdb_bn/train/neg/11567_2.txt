I decided to watch this series after seeing endless advertisements for it in BBC a few weeks before I started. Alan Hollinghurst wrote that despite the fact that I do not like the kind of seductive kind of stuff I've seen (sorry for his fans but I think there is a case of Emperor's new clothes about the work of this author). Acting is wonderful, it has been shot nicely and entertained by me - but - I saw that the story was extremely thin and after three episodes it was very unhappy with this empty product. The 'clear' gay sex that has spread in the media has been done before on TV - several times - so it was not very frustrating. I'm scared. Full marks for production quality but less than I am afraid for the story / content.
