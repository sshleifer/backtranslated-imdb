I saw this movie when I was full of a little baby hormone and it was like any movie that I have ever seen-or had ever seen It may not have been a great movie. I guess it was not. I really do not think a lot about it to speak the truth. I only remember sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. Unbelievably Sexy Kathy This woman did not do this for me in a movie. In the 70's I saw this for the first time on TV and I do not think I want to see it again, since I'm sure it will be frustrating-my hormones are not angry and I've been jaded for years. Still, I felt still back to how well I can still remember when I thought back to the shower scenes. <br /> <br /> Later added: After watching the movie again, I discovered that the house is dangerous to go again. Once it was erotic, now it is quite a joke. The old man and young man still works for me, as soon as it did once, probably because I'm not 12 years old. The old age is smaller than I am now. Also, the dynamism of the whole thing was not realized by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better to not repeat the past.
