In my eyes this is the perfect example of Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new King Kong film. Superman deserves to be treated with respect to the original super hero and honor while she wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst Superman I ever seen, from the beginning of the movie you just want to snatch a part of the cryptite down his throat. She just seems silly to wear dresses. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for Lois Lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and expected (WOW, he was actually the son of supermans, who would never have thought ....) and was terrible acting. This is a good thing for this movie, and its name is Kevin Spacy. Lex Luther was his screenplay bright but he could not save the film. What was needed for this film was "Loose and Clark" (of course Kevin Spacy) and a different story. After watching "The Hills Have Eyes" I saw this movie and I wanted to know that there were more bad movies.
