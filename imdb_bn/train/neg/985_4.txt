'Dead Letter Office' is a low budget movie about some employees of the Australian Postal Service, struggling to rebuild their lost life. Unfortunately, the performance is poor and character ludicrous and links between current psychology are presented as weird and characteristic. However, the most frustrating thing is to illustrate the film's title office: There is no mechanism and it is impossible to confirm what a worker is doing for a living. The supposed, part of the plot is threatened with the closure of the office, but such an office must be closed in the 1930s, if it really exists. This is shameful, because the overall tune of the film is furious and polite, and the scene has some promises: but few details are satisfied. Overall, it feels like a person's work that actually did not gain much experience in real life; A student film with an idea and an outline, but sadly anything else.
