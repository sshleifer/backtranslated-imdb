This happened on a copy. Not mine, and if I used to spend my own money on this, I am responsible and want to get it back! I can say it's a terrible student film. There is no understanding of the film medium. Acting God is awful, the story has been rejected as the non-verbally and the hair from the series of the original Twilight Zone, and the reaction of the ghost character is a laughable change in the reaction of 'voodoo' to vowel vowel. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that this photo is from 'burning' reviews to friends and family. I'm afraid it's not too humiliating. <br /> <br /> extreme amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
