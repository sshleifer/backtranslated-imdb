- Mite spoiler holds ... but I believe, this movie spoils itself from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I went into this movie with high expectations. It was my own fault. I have kept a lot of stocks in Steve Carroll's record. 40 year old virgin ... little Miss Sunshine ... office. And I made the mistake of coming to IMDB and saw 7.5 user ratings before going to the movie. It has always been a very good predictor in the past, but some are definitely closed. Lastly I felt embarrassed and seeing so much pain in a movie theater "blue steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The script was flunky material. Horror writings around. "Love killer"? "A power of love"? Anyone who wrote this shit was suffering from the same suffering that hit the author of the American beauty (s) ... making it very difficult. The whole of Flickr was drunk with the three companies' moments as scary and narrow shower scenes. Or dot / confusing aerobic view Or awful laundry room view. When you think of some serious and / or real events, they just toss into one of these horrible moments. And it happens again over again over again. <br /> <br /> And what is the character of Carroll? Does the person fill in some bookstore in a bookstore and suddenly head over the love heels? Let's tackle it. Their conversation sucked. They should both say after a few minutes of their goodbye. Unfortunately, when you watch the movie, focus on the initial conversation .... Carroll's character is trying to say something that is absolutely random and non-funny (I think the correct line was "This time I was a kid" ... it's seriously ), But both are laughing so much that coffee is going out of their nostrils. The actors themselves saw that they were getting hurt, why they were directed to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Return to the IMDb thing ... There is a way to tell you to keep a movie promotional team off of this site. I know it's impossible, but it's sadly the first 20 ratings or reviews were posted 12 years ago, or by Flankie, renting in the studio. See the rating of Family Stone ... If it is in the middle of 5, then this will be just 2 ... and it's pushing it.
