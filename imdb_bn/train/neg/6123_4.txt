When I first saw this movie, I think it's one of the best movies ever made. Of course, this is because of Bo Derek and the various state-of-the-art clothing. However, now I'm big, I can honestly say that this picture is awful. You think Bo Dearek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and he and husband-director John Derek have confirmed that you are watching him a lot. But when you take that view outside of the film, it becomes a big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he seems like all the muscular you should think, but when he is Jane (that is, of course, certainly, for the first time), he did not know what to think. As soon as this breast appears intensely, Bo shows a wet-looking shirt. Tarjan will be the only primitive man in the world who will face this problem. If you are looking for a movie slobber on a beautiful nude body then this ticket may be met. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and valuable film, go elsewhere ... that almost anywhere else !!!
