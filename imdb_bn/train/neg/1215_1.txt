I do not often give a star review, but the computer does not give me negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The first opening title tells us deep water. Although it is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producer credits. No <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the story, abusive husband Kenneth came to a high-powered Gated Community near his family. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), is running the day with Amok. <br /> <br /> OK. We're already in deep water. Mrs Basinghe's age is 55 years after the film came out. Oh, this is her child or granddaughter? It's Christmas Eve Moving towards the della malle, a long scene can be cut. In order to increase the concept of male aggression in the universe, he plays the old soccer player on Christmas Eve in the whole uniform. Of course. For a bonus he sees with a tied deer tied to it with a deaf. <br /> <br /> Although we get some real mystery of the driving scene. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we try to drive and smell Della at the same time. Then Della drives on her mobile phone and tries to talk at the same time, at one point the phone revolves around to return to the charger. <br /> <br /> An old friend of college went to sleep in the mall, tried to buy stuff, but his credit card was rejected - maybe his husband is annoying because he is breaking, but to follow the script, it is very complicated. <br /> <br /> At the park, he runs the most ridiculous gang of afoul in film history. A white boy (Lucas is seeing his career going to the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine a company as you move people towards bad and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Though they have guns, they show their attitude. Police in a mall came to investigate hypocrisy and they shot more than once, fired on their head. Parking lots can be as common as people, people everywhere, and nobody gives notice. <br /> <br /> The fleece escapes to her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-illuminated safe area, she goes to a construction site, where <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Walk on Checks on the kids, goes down, and when her husband gently asks how she got him, shows him a gun and shoots him in an empty area. <br /> <br /> Experience with the four lunatics was supposedly personal empowerment results for the lace. Instead, we know that his child will probably spend Christmas in Foster Care or Community, because he answers the assassination of the state and the state collects them. Four punks can be classified as genuine homicide in self-help. Husband, a different story. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see it on the wire. If I saw it in a theater (is it a release?) I'm mad. Like I have found a lot of sadness in seeing Mrs Basinghe's talent and Mr. Hash himself has done such trash. <br /> <br /> is a very good thing, though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Miss Montford did not receive any other writing or credit instruction after passing this title. There is justice in the world.
