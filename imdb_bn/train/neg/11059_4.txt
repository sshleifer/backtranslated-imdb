"Dahmara" is an interesting movie although I will not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrayed serial killer Jeffrey Dahmar, who has been killed, murdered and murdered by his male. The film is based on the relationship between Darmma and "Rodney", played well by Artel Cairo. Rodney is one of the more attractive characters: Dahmer's fool and once she escaped from the attack, she returned to Damman for sex and survived the second attack. <br /> <br /> I think this picture is nothing short of reflecting Dahamhar's creative years, because the events have shown the human giant on the screen and Dahmor's belief does not give any insight that he can make sex of his victim alive. <br /> <br /> Role played well but the story is thin.
