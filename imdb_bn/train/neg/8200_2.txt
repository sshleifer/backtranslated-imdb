The movie could not determine what it wants to be. There were some sub-plots for a short time that you think these items will come together at the end ... but they did not. If you want the story of "Aliens in frozen waste," stick with the 1950 version of Things (it's not hateful, which is focused in the Goro-o-view after 20+ years). <br /> <br /> "Alien" did not seem to be reused mostly from the day of the Independence. <br /> <br /> "Minimum minimum" sets would have been more effective if they hired actors who could actually work and carry motivated mood. <br /> <br /> A lot of chewing lots with a little salary
