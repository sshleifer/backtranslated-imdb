This is a amateur movie shot on the video, not the "electrifying drama" as it is falsely dubbed DVD liner notes. I saw many good things from descending film students. Most of the events occurred in the story about an alright tight journey around Jakarta. This movie can be created using a single video camera, but there are several sections where two cameras were used and then the content was packed together. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit is probably done with two cameras, instead of retaining the content in place of the appropriate editor. Perhaps what they did in the taxis? English subtitles are not theoretical in English, such as, "Where are you now?" Wrote. Blare Witch is saying generous on the quality of a generous production. If you still are not scared, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort with a very spectacular and awful picture across Jakarta.
