OK. For starters, taxi drivers are amazing. This, this is not taxi driver or amazing. Is it bad But I thought it was funny, which means that it had some redemption qualities. Like dialogue ... wow There was no plot at all, the letters were stupid, and the film was publicized. I think the movie was somewhat of a taxi driver due to the type of violence that would make the message more difficult at the end of the mobile phone. I can not believe that 20 people saw this movie. Yes, if you are really annoyed then it is valuable and you want to make any movie, or at least try to make sure that.
