In Chile, Rebecca West's book about the captain of the returning officer from WWIIII made her misuse of the book (now there is a real idea!). It seems that he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife Julie Christie, which is enough to set some emotional sparks. Alan Bridges and co-actor Jackson, Christie, Anne-Margaret and Ian Holm together bring together this great actor Alan Bates, but the burners are all low. There are several good scenes (especially when Jackson is on-screen), but Bridges's pensing is lazy lazy and the decorated-out color of the film is increasing. Long on the shell, this "soldier" left well forgotten. * **** to 1/2
