Ladies and Gentleman, please do not be fooled by the "A Stanley Kubrick" movie tag. This is a very bad movie which, unfortunately, has been called as one of the most deadly horror movies ever made. Horror movies can create fear that people should cool their heart while thinking about a real horror movie at night. There is no shock in the blazing fire, but instead of finding what we find, there is only a useless, stupid attempt to create a frustration. Everyone knows how much they try if they are different from reality. What is good in the film is the view of the ice valley. The hotel where most of the actors are well represented is filed. A sound about the actor Jack Nicholson feels like a lost, lazy soul, which is not really sure what he is supposed to do. There is not much to say about a lip, colorful actor who is busy busy with a child actor most of the time. There is no need to blame bad weather for a tragedy. Because the film is made, it can not be avoided and the weak Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
