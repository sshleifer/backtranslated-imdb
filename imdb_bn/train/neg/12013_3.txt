I used to think that the movie is not going to be good for Poltartist lady. It actually starts right, but during the first kill scene you see that the movie you are watching is a movie inside a movie. This guy is sitting in the movie theater. One of the viewers is so annoying that I used to travel around him. Bit is weird, but far from good.
