I just finished watching it on TV and what I can say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed from Melbourne, where the image was created. Impressive acting, amateur makeup effect and a really bad soundtrack. As Plot, well, even more stupid! I felt a bit sad about the scene. They have a reason to keep such movies on late night TV - because they are stupid! To avoid all costs.
