Where will start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I would say it was Fannn-Tastic! Unfortunately, for me, and someone else will have to free time and a piece (remember that the price I paid from Wal-Mart) was thought to be thriller. The only THRILL I got was watching the lousy representation of Anne Wilkes from Kirkland's Misery Sans Snowy Field area. If you want to do something good, with some friends on Friday night, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to see at least half good, do not even bother. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the films of a cupalli, mostly bad. But wow! I'm out !! The only person in the whole film that did not ruin, little boy Vincent Berry had played. The only reason I gave even three stars because it gave me something.
