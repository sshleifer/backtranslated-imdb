Regardless of this, it is an amateur, exhibition movie - or an effort - which is as interesting and bold as the book of the full Moody High School Student of Death "Poetry". To be sure, it will disturb the viewers who are annoyed to the hell, but the success will not be because of the director. Indeed some of the skin needs sensitivity, discipline, technique and talents, as well as an eye and ear under the skin. This image contains a developer image which is still shown (and also used in video areas), but there is no progress or development beyond that. If the director watched, he would see it as a possible starting point for a movie - that is, a movie.
