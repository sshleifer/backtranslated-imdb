This film disapproves of the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and even do not believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes I was good at real Indians, and Americans kept their spot under the League, but it was still consistent.) However, I love the first major league, prefer the second, and always going forward to the third, the series of Indians will go to the end. You can not tell me that it was not planned after the completion of the second movie. what happened? However, if the real fans of your main major benefit themselves and do not see this junket.
