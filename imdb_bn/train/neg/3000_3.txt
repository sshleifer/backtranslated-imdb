The school is disarmed by a group of unarmed Marty (Simon Squadmore) classmates and then a lab explosion (set by them) where his face is scarred by acids. Year after all jerks get invited back to high school (off of) for a reunion. Did they not know that they were inviting Marty to kill them? Then the storm starts, they are locked in the school and Marty started taking revenge. <br /> <br /> Very stupid. The killers are inventive and intelligent and the desert school has some strange atmospheric shots - but this is about it. Depressed humiliation over the schooner is more cruel (she scattered, her head dunked and burned in a toilet) and they are uncomfortable to see. Shortly after this release Skidador's suicide took place, almost impossible to see. Also this movie goes out of its way to nudity. The full frontal of the schoolroom (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to go alone ... afterwards they know that a killer is walking around them! And then have couple sex there. Such films where the killer can know where everyone will be and they can be teleported to them. It ends up in a wrap, which makes me cry and rolls in my eyes, then another twist that wanted to throw me something heavier on the TV! Acting portable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is this very She is a beautiful woman but not an actress. <br /> <br /> It gets 3 for some effective surgery and atmosphere. Otherwise it runs in mill and is forgettable. Skudmore's tragic suicide gave more attention than this picture.
