This picture is really incredible. I have seen so much trash-cinema, especially many 'flower mons' images, but 'dolls' are really difficult. So much that comes together: funny stories, the actor is always on the verge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! This is a really bad movie, but one of the fun. If you are a fan of bad movie to laugh, you will see it. And do not miss the 'Dollar vs Demonic Toys'. It's really funnier and bad.
