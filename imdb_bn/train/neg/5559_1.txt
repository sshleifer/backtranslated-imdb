This is the worst movie I ever seen. This suspicious honor of the Evengers? But no more. Acting in "Jill the Ripper" was terrible and only acceptable through the plot. This movie is intelligent stimulant as Teetubby. It does not know if it wants to be a S & M flick or a really bad thriller. Only under extreme narcotics or if you need to bed and a skin-clad protruding in bed. This script should be reviewed in an obscene manner, it will not take much effort and it will be a long life. A pornographic, even a bad porn, how does the film damage Dolph Lundgren's career?
