This film seems completely timeless. There is no such reason that something like this will happen, as if it was written by a small child, who was half-hearted and thought, "How do I wrap it?". And what are you thinking about Jared Harris and Christopher Walken? Do they have it for a bit? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not sure that most francs can happen, but if it is not registered. Jared and his bird fall under the stairs after going to Ireland, as you are doing. They went to a house in a very annoying little girl in a house, who was found to have been an old woman who saved Pitt who met Christopher Walken. She continued to give her life to someone other than continuing the story and immediately expressed her gratitude by frozing him. Since then it all gets a bit silly. I want a few hours of my life back!
