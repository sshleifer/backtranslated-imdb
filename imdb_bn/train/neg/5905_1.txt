Do not see this. This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Sometimes it's hard to be in Mormon when there's a movie like this. Mormon life is a sad look. If you have seen this movie, then I can tell you that it is not like this in a single ward. If I do not think I have made it with It is very bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of gaques who do not have anything to do. The acting is so bad that my wife and I just made it through. I think you can say that it was all signs of a B movie. Or is there c movie? Anyway ... I just sucked this movie and was full of cheese. I wish some Mormons will start making some quality movies.
