Now I have never seen bad films in my years, but what does the physical meaning of the song contain in the movie? WOW looks at some demented Pok√©mon and they multiply I can get a sealed from this. Anime is in vain, it's ruthless to the manufacturers. It shows a big marketing project to be used only in songs and they will get a good rating because I think that if this movie is fined, it will be fine if you see all Pokemon episodes. Understand what's going on and it's not a movie. This video should have only one animation. <br /> <br /> I will give it 1 because I got only 5 rupees, I could not give half because there is no half.
