<br /> <br /> Get your brewks and enjoy this flawed step Flickr. Speakman's remarkable Kempo skills (nice spin kicks, poor couch with a stick - poor sofa!) Is the only release quality of a movie that only cries bad acting. The plot is not half bad; Just very badly executed. But if you see this film for any movie other than martial arts, then you have completely lost the boat. And a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown, way too little Korean actor (even extra).
