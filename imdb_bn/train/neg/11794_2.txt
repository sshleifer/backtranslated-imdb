The main picture of a middle-class Saifee channel. A little squirmish, but not much. Atomic submarine USS Jimmy Carter is in deep mission under thick thick snow near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric yell. The crew member (Simone Z. MacKinnon) thinks that he has created a way to communicate with the monsters, but there is not much chance for the obscure reasons. Also in the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Shan Whalen. This movie might be a bit better if Eels / Monsters are not so cartoonish.
