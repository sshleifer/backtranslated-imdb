I was very disappointed by this picture for a few reasons. In the first half hour it's actually quite decent. Although the acting is not good anymore, you find that in a rap video, its fun and production costs do not seem to be half bad. Actually I almost felt almost as good as Piccolo Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which was much better than my expectations. The film's plot revolves not only about the husband being deceived but also about how women are seen and treated in Dominican society, especially in the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, I do not think the filmmakers have a good movie about how you treat your subject, and they have omitted their pretending catheters before. The role of men and women in about 30 minutes of the movie is reversed after the main character played a spell on her due to her opposite habit. What this transit does not happen will have to be overcome, space age, CGI effects that I guess will be like 70, but the whole plot will just move below the drain. The rest of the movie is left but sugar is predictable in situations, and the clever one liners are. To stop it all (and I guess you should now be warned by ** Spirir's alert **) It might all be a dream. Oh, do not you see me coming? Oh people I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. Well after an hour, I started thinking, "Hmmm, a word does not look right on the track, but what can it be?" ?? And then it hit me half of the music and took a video game from the Kingdom Kingfend 95 of the movie. <br /> <br /> When we give a film to Ora you, we can do a work of art?!?! Perhaps there was a comedy with France's Amelie, or an action flick with Oong-Buck in Thailand, an animation like Akira Japan, a serious crime thriller like the Leisure Cake England, or a social awakening like Watching Life. States <br /> <br /> ... I can give it 1 but I have found out worse than DR, search Los Jodedores and you know what I mean.
