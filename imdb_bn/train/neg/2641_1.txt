The story of almost every plot in this movie is irrational and impossible. It carries an actual human story, dead and dull, no similar. This is a parody of Hollywood that reminds you of the diesel Washington movie, Wobbly camera shot and focusing, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and gestures of famous people in sporting clothing and clothing catalogs. It is made for the fulfillment of vitamins for biologists whose life means the names of celebrities being seen. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and fanny songs with it. I feel like a donkey to visit this, save myself.
