Wow, I've done a lot of love and respect that David Lynch did. However, this film is the first filmmaker's effort to create a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> <br /> You can give some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch was usually a visual film maker, but this was a little visible artistic material (empty wall, "up shot" with a roof in the background) <br /> 2. David Lynch is generally very proud of the audio, however, in it you hear the video camera hoom. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to think that there was no relationship with this movie. Unless <br /> <br /> ... This is a joke on David, forcing fans to search only for his website (for hours). I hope so, at least that idea is fun.
