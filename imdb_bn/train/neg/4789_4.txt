The "Fantasia" of 1979 was a very atmospheric, horrific, scary and very original horror flick, and in one word, it was religious. The first section of 1988 was glorious, malicious, action-packed and very entertaining. After the first signal, the creator of "Fantas" Don Koskalli apparently lacked new ideas. The 1994 "Fantas III - Lord of the Dead" is definitely not a complete failure, it is also quite entertaining, but there is no more fundamentality and the great efforts to bring something new are sometimes annoying, which is somewhat frustrating than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> - Spokillers - <br /> <br /> At the beginning, hidden mysteries were discovered behind several mysterious incognito spheres. Then, many unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Team, a "Home Alone" - Stylish little child, who became awesome in shooting, a rocky, difficult and extremely dancer-swinging black chick with a crew cut.). The film has his qualities - Regi bancaster is again very quiet like a lame-tail, playing a guitar rage. Angus scream is still quite surprising as tole man, but Tall Man discusses much more in this movie, he removes some of his laziness. Mike's character is again at Activated by Michael Ballwin (he was replaced by James Legrus in the second part), in my opinion, it does not make a difference. Gore's film also looks attractive enough, but it is still frustrating, especially because it is quite boring to try to create ideas for lack of ideas. <br /> <br /> All things are considered, "Fantas III" is an acceptable time-consuming fan, but it is clearly frustrating than the predecessors. Supporters of the first two "Fantas" films can try it, but I suggest not to set your expectations too much.
