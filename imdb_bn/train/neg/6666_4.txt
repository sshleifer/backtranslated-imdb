I really wanted to like this picture, but the story laughs. I do not want to spoil this movie, - Do not think right from the beginning that you know something that's going to be bad - but here's the example of how much the film has been inserted here. Cowboy and "Twig" ridge up riding. Cowboy has a handle bar torch. Cowboy and "Twig" get out of a shooting and get in the half way down the rage. Clean crown through the rest of the rest of the cobbing film. During the gun battle and going down the mountain, there was time for the cowboy to shave the horse back in the dark. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to play four main characters to be beautiful.
