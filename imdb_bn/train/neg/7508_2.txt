I want Spike Lee to choose a different title for her film. The "Summer Sam" movie gives an idea about infamous serial killer David Barrowvitt. It's not that it's a great, earthy portrait of NYC street life in the hot summer of '77. When Barrowvitt terrorized the city. <br /> <br /> This image follows several young fairytale characters from Italian-American neighborhoods and their reactions to Sam's son threatened. Winnie and his wife have Diena; Richie and Ruby, and many other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this character is not desired. They are regularly annoying, and intolerable at times. Lee is then filled with his high strength, chaotic life, which is angry, passion, and general turmoil. Winnie and his wife, ornamented disco dance scenes, have at least two long battle scenes in countless gabfests ... Over over I am surprised: Where is the film editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with the bulk, the film gives the opportunity to express any real feeling of fear or fear created by Sam San Menace, which is very much in the background. Lee has been more successful in showing more serious types of deadly problems, which originated from nearby Viigilant groups. <br /> <br /> The acting is equally good. Combined with 70 disco music, and deep attention to the design and design design, you really feel like the Italian American area of ​​New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> The atmospheric authenticity of the film is not enough to offset an angry, overblown scripts about the life of roughly annoying people.
