This book-based movie is really awful, and a big disappointment. We have been waiting for this step for a month. Many film critics were optimistic for it. Also on newspaper and TV, it is made in great sense. On April 29th, many people have noticed with sadness that the movie is really awful. Why? The first of all the stories was so monotone. It has been a lot of uncertain scenes, sometimes it's hard to understand what's going on. The actresses of Hulia Absar were not compatible with their role, especially Vilan Atesaver. He did a better job in comedy movies, in this movie, a play, he could not settle his previous role. And finally the movie is very small, just 66 minutes.
