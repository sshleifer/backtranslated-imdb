I am 10p.m. I have seen the look and I must say that this movie was not something special. Although I did not want to return my time in the theater (although I did not actually pay for movies) I really could not find a freedom fighter. <br /> <br /> There were several lines I was shiny, but in most of the films, young people seemed to be involved in the fan fans of the super fans (this film seems to be more than men as a rate) male audience. Fan service takes place and rather well misleading. I know you want to hear Samuel Elk, tell his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's totally popular to pay a lot less. The only real part of the film was the Cgi, which is very digitalized and not well jailed with live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a reasonable person, I'm going to the theater. I did not know I was going to see "Casablanca" and I am least thankful that this film is original (Albatin) concept and some rebuilding or franchise spin is not closed. But to be honest, if you are not a part of religion then you might be able to stop spending your money elsewhere, and in a few weeks, see the movie in the second week of the drama or rent it within a few months.
