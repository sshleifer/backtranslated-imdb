I just bought this shop at 99 cents today, and still think I'm leaking. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty annoying and unrealistic gymnast drama and very expensive for $ 1, expensive. This picture is probably notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keonu Reeves. And 2. It is managed by Paul Lynch, who made a promo knight. Now onto the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who is injured in a car accident, who spent her father's life. So the accident prevented him from competing in the gymnastics tournament, he was often picked up in his class and finally he met Tommy (written by Keanu) some wild child named Robin, when he did not train, he worked part time with his mother. And stepmaster, at a laundromat owned by his classmate stepfather. Finally he was selected in the competition. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu alone and a few interesting 80 touches me this 1 star, and it's not one of the worst movies yet, but still very good. The DVD itself does not get a medal, because it is sources from an old VHS and at the end, the word goes out of sync and it becomes black when the end credits end, although the word may still be heard. So this could possibly be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork does not give any idea that it is similar to the recent photos of Quneu and Olivia, and there is nothing to do with the background movie because it's not even in the movie, so the cover must have been photographed. In any case, avoid all costs, until you're a Keanu fanatic. I probably will not be hanging it longer. I'm probably going to give a movie snub, who is a great YT reviewer btw. Hey, if you have any pornographic films that they do not want in their eyes, then donate to continue its program.
