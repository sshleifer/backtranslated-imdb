The film has spread badly, without the name of some known old Hollywood. Other performances by unknown names (eg, Jennifer Gabriel) are unclear. I saw other films by this director, unfortunately it is his worst one. Perhaps this is a screenplay reflection? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Basingers and Pat Murita's performance protected this movie from the wonders. I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to watch, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Van's
