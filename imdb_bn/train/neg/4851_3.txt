A group of bomb blast experts in Iraq count their time before moving around. <br /> <br /> It seems boring itself. Every time the small caption came, it was time to tell us how long we had gone, it was only created without a plot to drag the film. Hurry up and finish your time so that we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I'll lose some. If I do well then I am the best actor of war. This was "Jarhead" Syndrome. The picture that was sometimes shot nicely, but the cinematography does not prevent it from being completely neutral and pointless. <br /> <br /> And already "cartridges evacuated from the gun" slow pace. They could save money and got stock footage from any film with gun. <br /> <br /> There was no sympathy for me in the main person, I was constantly optimistic that his helplessness would have led him to death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and thought that those who were in the Armed Forces did not like it and others loved it. I was never in the army, and I'm with them. It's pretentious drivel. 3 They are for cinematography.
