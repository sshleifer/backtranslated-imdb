This movie is so stupid that only goes near the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to see "Darkness Fouls" and thought that it was the movie. Boy, what's wrong! As soon as possible I will be able to move forward and not be released from a boring moment. I only envy people playing to play or work in this movie. They are actually paid for this bullshit. That's not amazing? I think a man dies in this movie, and he cuts a piece of bloody pieces in a wooden container and after a few minutes mother and baby do nothing and drink coffee and calmly speak in the table. Please! Come on! Who pays for this kind of bad movie? Oh, and there was a "toothpaste" hair. Feeling scary at all and it was clear that wearing a badly made make-up was a tired stuntman.
