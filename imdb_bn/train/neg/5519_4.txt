All right, so the previews of this movie just tell you that a rebel young girl is going to live with the summer to be straight for the summer. This is not really! This is about a young rebel 17-year-old girl, who reveals secrets and believes that she is telling her true words to her mother. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the idea of ​​this movie. Love / hate relationship between mother and girls was a really good plot and really a good theme. But I'm not happy to play Lindsay Lohan. Indeed, if this film was another, perhaps a good actress, then they became wild. The character of Rachel (iron) is very sexual aggressive and it reminds us of the true Lindsay so that it is far from the film. <br /> <br /> I think that if you are one side of Lindsay, you will enjoy these pictures. The end is pretty fantastic (and sad).
