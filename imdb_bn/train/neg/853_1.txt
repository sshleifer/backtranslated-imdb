All right, I honestly do not see why everyone thinks this is great. It's not really that. Two good things to come from this movie were 1. Jack's performance, she was very good I could hit my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. It is then quite stupid then that any other. And, what was the idea of ​​Shelly Draft as Stanley Kubrick Vendi? She was so bad. Every time he becomes scared look the same. The problem of this movie was ending. Kubrick would have ended it differently if I had more respect for it. And, all the movies were just stupid. The problem of the film is that the book was so good. So do not watch the movie read the book and you will be better. 3/10.
