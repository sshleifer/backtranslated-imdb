Wow, what can I say about this picture? It's a lousy piece of crap. I am surprised that it got rated as high as possible. Is this photo wrong? Here's a good question: There is no mistake with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is just shit and cliche. Here's a lot about it ... Some silly kids are picked up with a friend, they are killed, and come back as a ghost for revenge. The "all" perfect film is packed in 86 minutes. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time while watching it. Also, the second is not the best, so do not be bothered ... I gave three ratings to this movie because I like the outfit of SquareCro, because there was nothing good about the movie. I think you get the picture.
