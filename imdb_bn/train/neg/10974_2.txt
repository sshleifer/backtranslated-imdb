I'm Irish and I live in Denmark for a while so I'll go home last week so that I could see the intermissions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not standing there with other Irish films like Cometments, I Wait Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> But the film itself is shot entirely wrong. Zoom-out tries to make the film a radioactive version by jumping into the camera and constant zoom-in, as it was a great drama. But it's not. It should be shot as an Irish lock, stock and two smoking barrels and like this. It should be the next subsequent smooth movement from a shot. The picture looks just gentle and thrown together. <br /> <br /> Actually okay, given terrible scripts. A friend of mine told me that they just followed Colin Ferrell around Dublin for weeks. She does a decent display as a Dublin Dartbug, but it's a minor report, no way compared to her performance in Tigerland or Phone Booth. Best Actor Deirdre O'Neill, who played a sexually active middle-aged woman, who dumped her bank manager's husband for a young woman. I think he will leave his god-fearing stand-up and give more attention to his performance. <br /> <br /> Not everyone lives by the Irish press or in expectations expected, sometimes it will be considered as one of the best Irish movies. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting a response from these comments because most people said that I said it was cool. But before you answer, ask yourself: If you are set in England or the United States, what's so much about this movie?
