I saw this movie a long time ... Luckily it was free. I have to be twenty people who have seen this movie in the theater. I do not remember a whole bunch of it, but I think I was incredibly bored, no ideas of conspiracy and I was the only thing to come out of the theater at least now I know the worst movie I do. Ever seen I was incredibly disturbed by one thing: if they can make temperatures because they can reach enough for the living sun for the people, why can not they turn it into a comfortable temperature instead of hot and sweat? Do they think we are stupid?
