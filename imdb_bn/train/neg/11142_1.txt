This is the worst piece of shit I had ever seen - actually it was so bad that I had to see it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is so bad it's fun! It does not even have a shiite CGI animation, it is so bad, the rate is low ... <br /> <br /> I am surprised that some distribution companies have borrowed money for the release, but I guess they Get more money, 'It can not cost more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so awful that kindergarten classes can make it. <br /> <br /> See it and smile!
