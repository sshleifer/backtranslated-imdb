High school (I think) the kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, dance, enjoy graffiti and try to be DJ in rx - or anything. I have forgotten so much to be completely honest! Even those who love this song have played extremely well in this movie and - as a drama - have failed to discontent. We are supposed to find these kids favorite and beautiful. I found them bland and annoying. One that I really hate was Ramon. She graffes in subway trains and is seen as great. please forgive? He is not defacing the public property that is starting with him. Also these "great" kids tapped into the electricity of the city so that they can hold a large dance party in a abandoned building. Ohhhh So we should find a bunch of law enforcers and funny law enforcement agencies. <br /> <br /> I could not stand the hip hop if I had a good song. The songs were - the best - the medieval and they were nonstop! They are always playing! It reached such a stage that I was fast moving through a number of endless music numbers. (Cut music and have a 30-minute movie - maybe there are some fantastic numbers - subway dance wars, a really fun Santa's number and climate roxy show. You love hip hop here your movie. But you're looking for good drama to mix it - forget it Also how did this get a PG rating? This oath has an incredible amount.
