When I really wanted to make a comedy, people actually tried to make it fun. This is a movie that you can sit but there is nothing special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was OK. It was not annoying to see, but the audience laughs no laugh. Entertainment means you are actually an O.K. Get something more than The story The movie wanted to be "Tutsi", but instead it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave 1 out of 10.
