Calling a film about homeless ghosts for the revenge of the miserable ghosts and seamless crosses can be very ironic, but here's the indefinable combination of Gossight (1939 and 1944) through the LES Diabiliges (1954); Although it is still seen in itself, it is very difficult to stimulate chocolate instead of intentional cold. However, by the end of the 1970's, due to the horrific stratum of the British film industry itself, even a middle script like this is 10 star names - Cliffer Robertson (husband's husband), Gene Simmons (title role), Jenny Agutter (Robertson's Artist Half-sister), Simon Ward (as mysterious Chaufiire), Ron Moody (as a sick doctor), Michael Genton (business part of Robertson As David), Judy Geosan (Simmons' best friend and wife of Joystown), Flora Rhodeson (as a housekeeper), David Tomminson (as Simone's with no notes) and perhaps Jack Warner (like an astronaut sculpture) - though most of them are actually some There is no part, I'm sorry to say!
