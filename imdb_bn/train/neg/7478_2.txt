When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it might be a fool, but it would be fun. Well I was wrong. Although the conservatives went somewhere deep, there was an interesting message to tell parents that they were alone and to re-evaluate their lives, the way they tried to give the message was terrible. The folly of the first fifty times occurred in some couples was relatively funny. But to the end, I can almost predict that a stupid accident is going to happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie I probably liked five lines of dialogue and everything else was the best medieval, which is still more than I can say for myself in the movie.
