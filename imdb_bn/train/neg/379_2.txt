TV Guide This movie calls a mystery. What is a mystery to me is that a culture that can create such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematician can not create a film that will rise above the condemned trash level so perfectly represented by this movie. This Bollywood is at its best / bad times, I can not honestly say the difference. Annoying sweet, kitschy clich√©s, each level, story-line, circumstance, dialogue, music and danceography. Make it bluntly, you will be a retard to enjoy it. I saw it satisfying my cultural curiosity, but many times I had to walk from here, because I could not take it anymore. The only release of the film is the beauty of leading actresses. <br /> <br />
