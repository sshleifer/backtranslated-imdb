I do not really want to see this one. It seemed to be an old royal film, which I hate to see, because I do not consider him as a film maker even as an intermediary. This is the only reason I released Shah Rukh Khan's view in this film. I did not know what the film really was because I was sure it would be a simple fairy tale. So I just imagined a love story between Shashirukh Khan and Devi Bharati, with a significant role of Rishi Kapoor that I thought his father or uncle would play. And my whole shock, Rishi Kapoor is actually hero! He romances the young Diva! I wanted to know that there was no element of Shah Rukh and he too is in the second part of the picture. <br /> <br /> Just let me repeat the question: why 17 years? The old lovely diva has fallen for Rishi Kapoor like 40-plus long-haired, melted, dried puglet? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed to take this part; The only thing he is ridiculing himself is that he is ridiculing himself. She romance a girl who can logically be smaller than her own daughter and worse - she works like a teenager in her pocket. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As long as they make a treacherous couple, there There will be no problem. Indeed, leading actors have always played opposite young girls (Amitabh Bachchan - Sridevi, Mithun Chakraborty - Madhuri Dixit, Shahrukh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan - Snha Ullal). Also, I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor, I think he is a good actor and his performance in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart, but it is not that he has seen this picture, such as Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan or Amir Khan's look Today <br /> <br /> <br /> This is frustrating. Oh, and because of the fact that everyone saw this picture, Shahrukh Khan has done well. He excelled into his part very little in him. Deviwati Devi Bharati also made a promising debut. If you want to watch this movie, just go for the second half. Personally, I do not even have that.
