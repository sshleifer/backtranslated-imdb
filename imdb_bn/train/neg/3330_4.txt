This movie is an O.K. Feature score and by David Muair. Bad performance as Hackenstein. The beginning and the end credits mostly show with the actor and "special effects", which is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you can not find in other crazy scientist, horror / comedy, or low budget movies. No nude scene is not particularly for buffs or bad movie lovers. This movie is just here There is nothing to be excited as well as Ana Ramsey and Phyllis Dealer. If you are curious and can actually find it, you will realize the truth of a line summary.
