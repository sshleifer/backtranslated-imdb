As a writer, I found a complete loophole in front of producing this bad movie. Talk about insulting. In the 8th grade I was writing a good story. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directions and all together added results and total failure. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ Who will write something so light on the green light? It's artistic, cute, smart, suspicious, mysterious, scary, dramatic-nothing. <br /> <br /> Characters are flat and annoying without any development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum cans. They had led some very well known actors who would have to be quite disappointed for the job, or hoping for less budget-independent films to become the next "Pope Fiction". This script is not a movie, a bird cage line should be used. <br /> <br /> Oh and last but not least, a 520 105-pound woman must have the power to kill men and women in double form and hit them one by one. <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as it will infect an STD.
