I have never been in Paris, but after watching "Paris, J.T.Im" I was crazy to visit this city! I went to New York several times and I love the city and its cities. I was hoping to touch this film, it seemed like I jumped on a plane and flew from there, but see, I'm busy with time and money. There are no love stories between people or people and the city. Many inconvenient meetings and relationships or those who know each other and it does not work fine. Maybe it reflects a feature of the city, where thousands of people are living themselves. Can not find love in New York?
