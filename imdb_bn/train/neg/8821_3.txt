Why, oh, why do they not learn? When you got a beautiful, juicy sucker hostage, use it! Do not go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> There was a child. So, Harry is covered with Christmas, and finally, when his confusion becomes too big, he goes swimmingly, and provides the city with toys to small children, and he kills anyone who thinks he is a naughty person. <br /> <br /> Easy enough, and not a bad place to start. (Lastly, how many holiday-based horror flick uses the same scintic?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be "Santa, a serial killer portraiture" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when I was ready to buy the premiere while opening the opening, two-thirds of the movie was spent. You know that a slasher film is in trouble when you are calling yourself to take the murderer already with it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry could have been able to be a handsome man, capable of being madness, but alas, we got some people named Luis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. This scene is firmly visible in the scene, we can know where we are and what we are seeing without creating actors' shots or clear scenes. <br /> <br /> Even once the film is rolling, we still treat Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior for hiping. Awful more than depressed, one to avoid Christmas Eve.
