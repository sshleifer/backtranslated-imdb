"They Are Among Us" Best Poorer Science Fiction Mediocre acting bogs down this film. A lot of plot holes The aliens came to Earth in any satellite and have been hidden among us for over 100 years, but they need plastic surgeons to create human appearance. In their alien form, they think Exo-Schlatten (they require plastic surgery) but when you see them, their tooth and fingertips occur. After the closure of Project Blue Book, the heroine's father "disappeared", but it was an F-16 pilot supposedly. It seemed to be there. If you want to see a foreign attack movie then choose "Attack of Physical Graduation" and see how it has been completed.
