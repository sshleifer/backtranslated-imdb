A fancy wrapper from the world's Nepitia's Capitol comes in another junk flick. "Seuo" tells a wool, a disguised mess of a story that is a little more than a blemish character cluster, a child, and straight male Davis is trying to create a fool Saif-fi flick. I do not remember because someone does not want to spend time in this ludicrous attempt to make films. (D)
