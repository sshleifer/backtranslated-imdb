How nice! This film is really awful. I can read this badly written script and can not imagine how it could fall into the green light. The cast is virtually identical with the second rate of some really awesome performance from all cast. The story is divided, isolated and incomprehensible. Speak, lead and expected. No intelligence, no charm, no ridiculous Not least sexy. The characters remain as flat as a proverbial pancake. Although the film continues, stomach continues to be hard to stomach as it is still strong. When your lead (Carrell) unfunny and unappealing is uphill from it. Although its fountains revolve around where love for love wins, I was let off with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this passes for humor and social commentary, we must be condemning it.
