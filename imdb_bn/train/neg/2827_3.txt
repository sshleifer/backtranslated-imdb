The story is interesting in the beginning: from West Africa to Arab Middle East (late) 20th century slavery. The problem is deliberately the favorite enemies of two director Richard Fischer: Arab and Germans. For us to believe that very Arab-looking men will be able to travel around and catch the churches of West Africa, just as it is credible for hunting slaves in the "root". Clearly both businesses are managed / managed by locals and (D) includes a much more sophisticated network. Although Arab countries are satisfied with today's children and sex slave trade, Amnesty International estimates that Israel is one of the worst violators. Why not just point out Arab and then choose Germany as the only European buyer? It is by the Jewish director who bias and hatred of people. <br /> <br /> The average of acting is more, especially Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (owner). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is always as good as ever.
