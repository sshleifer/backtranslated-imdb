The horror film about a rich man (John Caranine) was dying and all four of his children had left, and his servants were divided equally. One condition - they have to spend a week in his estate to get the money. And if one of them dies, others get more. Guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> I saw this photo on a new canola cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The servants are called Igar and Elga - Come! Some sound recordings were so bad that I could not create the conversation (I'm not sure of any major damage); The hole was spar and very badly done; Other killings were simply annoying, stupid or impossible, and this movie has some really horrendous acting - so bad you just look at the screen of mistrust. Even Professor Jeff Morrow was terrible! Only fairly good acting troupe was Feth Damper (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks here painful and old). Although I must admit - the last line of this movie is a jewel! <br /> <br /> Why was it named "heir of blood" outside of me - another 1978 horror movie with this name! <<br /> <br /> Whatever its name, it's a bad movie. All costs will be avoided.
