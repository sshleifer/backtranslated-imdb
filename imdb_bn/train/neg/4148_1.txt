I picked up this movie with the intention to get a bad zombie movie. But I did not have any ideas that I got myself. <br /> <br /> I started the film and soon I was dragged into the world of torture and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what the hell is like. It is this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. It was not even a plot. Stuff is running in every scene but there is no overall explanation for any event. Instead of looking at this movie, I suggest that you line up the earliest blender with oil and try as much bullet as you can and stuff it. You can You will find far more fun results than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even see it. Do not see it even worse. I request you If you see it, then they mean to win.
