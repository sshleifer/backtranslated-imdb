Cassavetes had bold new ideas about making a cute, sensitive people film clearly. He wanted to break away from the limitations of the system and become an auteur to bring a new reality to American cinema. For him, I congratulate him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as a member of his audience, I can not congratulate a woman under influential. Cassavetes took what could be a fascinating subject (an insane woman) and managed to run a dull film, filled with a tall, ad libbed ranting and drawn out scene. It seems as if he got a gift in the picture to keep the life's most awful moments, and it often seems like he just launched his family's camera and allowed him to drive and run. Cassavetes are some destructively real - or even a kernel can even be practical if this technique is acceptable if it touches the heart of ways a conventional film could not. Still, I have received performances, especially Ronalds, to be artificial. I did not believe for a moment that he was really mad. I've met people who are really mentally disturbed, yet I've never seen none of them ever act like a Rhodeland weighed in under a woman. She played it a lot like a very unreasonable, unmarried woman and even became confused because we saw her drink only once, but she became drunk for the rest of the film. In some moments he taps into something real, but those moments are less and far away; She fails to maintain a seamless mentally disturbed character. Again, I appreciate his efforts, but there is no effort alone to make the rug ring true. <br /> <br /> Those who happen to be on this movie and see their high IMDB ratings, there is no doubt that they are forced to love it and at a very high rate, they prove that it 'get it.' But for yourself it will not be brainwashed by the judge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> He could not have imagined that he was present at the treacherous and oppressed self-beloved to others. But Woody Allen has at least demonstrated a gift for the audience - he knows that creating a compelling story for a movie and a good level of humor are essential. Cassavetes had employed some self-discipline (and a sharp pair of performing shears!), A woman under the influence could have stood an opportunity. But what is the point of making the only 'realistic' film, if the only person who can sit, are art-house fans and movie students who worship the cavatates as an anti-god? Without dumbing anything down, I believe Cassavetes can make a woman more accessible, with the speed of running a real plot instead of presenting the string in the 30-minute long view of Ad-Libid arguments. You only create movies for yourself and for some fans, but you've just converted. Watch this movie with your own eyes and make your own decision about it. You are really moved and fascinated, good for you.
