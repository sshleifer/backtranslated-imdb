As bad as a film should be withdrawn from all stores worldwide. So, with the annoying, neutral, unknown characters and such an annoying attitude and the sound of a character with a dry voice, always giving voice to the action, this film has the record of the most challenging movie I've ever seen. Because I paid for it to be its owner, so I was responsible to see it, and how do I express regret. My head hit horrible inferior characters and because of their vain, intrigue less life. A bunch of kids that have zero knowledge about anything, all are frustrating and worst, terrible dialogue all over, trying to get a date with the girl as the main character. Annoying, so my friend was shaking with hate and I was shocked with shame that I would throw 6 pounds away. The DVD was eBay the next day, and I did not return a lot to my money. Avoid like plague.
