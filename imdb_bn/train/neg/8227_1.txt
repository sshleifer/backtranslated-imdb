I will keep this quick and sweet On the way home from a soccer game, five girls decided to take a 'short cut' which would throw them on the road of their solitary forest-road. Of course the best things can happen to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> All right, they are not. Soon they are being hunted by a scary chick who has some serious mental problems and 90 minutes of inferior annoyance happened. <br /> <br /> I will never see an actor in this film. Their shouting, scary voices hurt me, and the script is so poorly written that it includes many repetitive phrases and unconscious violent screams. Above all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen ... and I've seen so many.
