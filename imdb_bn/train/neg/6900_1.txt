I was just sitting in a lackless theater like hell, I wanted to go halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 remnants of Samoan boys wedding. So they get a date so that they get into marriage. Young <br /> <br /> The thing that most mocked me was the so-called funny humorist ... they were very unwanted, pulled and thrown in your face so that you can already go into absolute movies. The acting was below average and I think this movie is just going on and there is almost nothing but weird joke and a bunch of prospective plot. <br /> <br /> Everyone, the bad movie I saw, is one of them. 2006, unreasonable, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Thank you, a friend shouted to me. Avoid <br /> <br />
