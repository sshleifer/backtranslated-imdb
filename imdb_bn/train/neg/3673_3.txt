William Heart Scuba Diving Scientist ??? US agents are investigating abroad? The sick man is behind the back 20 feet feet behind and escapes? Sniper missing and not strikes (only injured) but second "kill" shot dead? Time waste Fall down as other critics are ridiculous to compare this to. Oh and at the end of the film, they decided to kill "evil" agents and Hurt with "virus handshake", but decided to start wearing gloves on their hands. What? BTWM ... When did the IMDB need 10 lines? I'm just babbling here Do you just delete the content of the reviews if you need the x line amount?
