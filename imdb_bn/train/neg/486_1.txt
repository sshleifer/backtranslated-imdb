This flick was a blow for me. I think that little girls have wanted to be more than swimwear models, home builders or mistresses, since all that since they seem to be portrayed in any way. It is really tragic for an artist to misinterpret his work and life so wrongly. Strangely (or perhaps it should have been expected), the whole character of Artemisia and what has stood for it is that Halowood has reduced to female character; A cruel, physically flawless, helpless little creature, which does not show any of the characteristics of the character, which in reality is its place in history which is getting separated here. Saddar is still to see, a large part of the audience was badly educated in understanding the unbelievable gap between movies and reality messages. To portray the artist as a love for her real-life rapist, whom she actually accused of raping her during the course of torture, just plain me stopped me. There is nothing significant if a director should refrain from the basis of his story in the real story.
