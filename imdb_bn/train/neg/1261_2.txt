I was a John Harlow fan because they had star quality. I do not think his movies are good and I do not think he is a good actress, but he is certainly a great comedy. Every bit comedy from Murray to The Gerl√© is very good. But this movie is probably more like a love story. Gin Harrow is amazing in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performance does not bring anything new. Harlow's beautiful body always influences me a lot to feel like a sick woman. Well, she looks beautiful in this movie.
