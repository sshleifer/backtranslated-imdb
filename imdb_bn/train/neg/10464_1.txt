This movie is not based on biblical. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show pride or coming second in Christ. Let's talk about it alone. It does not quote from the scriptures. The last time called the Great Clash. The movie does not even look bad times. His structure was changed in the 15-second press casting of seven bowl, seven villa and seven trumpet seas. In the catastrophe, anti-Christendom was killed for 3 1/2 years and thus the film ended. The only part they got right was two prophets. Of course, the name was not used because it is very close to the truth of scripture. It's the worst part I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take strangers to it. I think the movie is bad. It's just a fake like everything in Satan. I hope that it will not be far away from upcoming movies based on left-hand books. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it is bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I've seen Miami Vice good episodes.
