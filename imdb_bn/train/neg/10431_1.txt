I like the first season. The quality of the second season went down, but it was a great middle (Pagasas!). The third season was fairly rough and original and was right. The fourth season started moving at a very fast pace, because they did not give us any explanation, because now we really started to need them. What was the plan of silon? Why was the two Silenon group? What was the angle-angle point to take in the devastating earth-1? What was the past in the last five slon and how did they survive, or were they reborn? There is no question everywhere, no answer. <br /> <br /> and then finish. Earth-2 (our world) in the past That's okay. But the destruction of the cat?! Providing technology and leaving any kind of urban life, and spreading thousands of people all over the world? It is not only anti-science, it is anti-causal and anti-life. And then the vision of the ceremony seems to mean that the ever-changing nature of humanity in the ongoing cycle of nature, destroying the destructive Ai is destructive capitalist society. Destroy everything that is. It is without hope of a greater future for humanity, without any vision, and it is the opposite of true science fiction. Even I did not even start with the angels! The worst kind of religious clap! The final frustration !! <br /> <br /> The whole "It all happened and will happen again" object should be related to the previous avatar of the series, not just in the world. The genuine has its specific strokes to create a consistent new show with the old. Frakkin shame <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
