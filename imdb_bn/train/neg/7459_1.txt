Please save your money and go see something else. This movie was such a piece of punk. I do not want to go, but I think I want to laugh at least once, NOPE. Not a single smile, it was awesome! Chris Kattan never gets such a good comedy role and "Roxbury night." This film is completely clear, it does not have any smart humor and is repeated only over and over again. Listen to me, you'll be far away from this movie!
