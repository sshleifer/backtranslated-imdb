This film really got a great start off. It was a really heartfelt, romantic love story that turned into paintings, which recorded love between long, poetic and miraculous scenes between "Harlan" and "Toba". It really did not need to do more than that, and for a moment I was surprised that someone was finally making a nice film for himself, another timeless classic, a modern fictional story. Why, oh why, then does it create another psychology (Norton) and get involved in half? Maybe I'm missing the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? Or to illustrate the ill-natured nature of this humane nature of Hollywood, is it necessary to give more general mural of this film industry? For a moment there, I'm going to create a mental note for the director's name; Now I feel indifferent. At least it should be added to the film's defense that all actors are investing in their roles. Also, Ivan Rachel Wood is a good actress with really nice and potential lot to watch.
