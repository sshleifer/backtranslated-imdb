A 1957 (yes, the exact date) is with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hide White. Arthur Rank production; It will be a debris comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful.

But what was he doing in this film? Diana Doors are also here, providing oh-courageous shots for use in previews. His acting level is not bad, but he has the film to give leer to anyone. Well, during this photo there will be something to do next to the neck. This image is now sold in V-S by people in e-bay. Except yourself and time without waste. A comedy without a smile A musical without a memorable song or dance.
