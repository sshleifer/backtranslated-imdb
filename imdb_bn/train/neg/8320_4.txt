While conscious, I arrived at a conclusion: Director and Screenwriter, Jr. Harold was aware of the purpose of laughter to the audience, because it is generally associated with ridiculous elements. Aka has a lot of plot holes and it is completely irrational and ridiculous (for example, the hospital uniform used the original character's spirit ... did a doctor's ghost put him on the floor?). The idea behind this movie is somewhat impressive but all the plot holes and weird things make this stupid and unclear film. Except for the great Lena Olin, all the actors came with bad performance. Hydeen Christensen has zero expression and is also similar to Jessica Alba. Terrence Howard, a great actor, was severely destroyed on her. Introduction. Aayek creates a smile on the audience. It is very ridiculous and irrelevant that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation: Skip this vague movie.
