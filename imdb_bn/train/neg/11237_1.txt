I went to see this picture with less hope, but the film hoped to be impressive in my home town. Sadly, I got all that. The story covers the familiar zones (high school reunion), but the plot slowly and supernaturally adds a little bit of this good-theme theme. Although the quality of the film was good overall, the film's content was frustrating. The film sex was surprising - until women did not get married, until they were traditionally or both, seemingly incomplete (although they met as a feminist preference). Even worse was the racist Jewish mother, black people who still live in the house - and immature cruelty (tortures the class in Gik). If these characters seem to represent the residents of Kalamazu, then we should be ashamed and educators should be educated for bringing such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
