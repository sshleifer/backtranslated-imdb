This movie offers one of the most talked about casual conversations. In fact, I could not have imagined that no film was meaningless, how the dialogue could be synthesized one hour ago, but then again I saw this video. In a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, one wants to see at least good acting and tasteful conversations and even some comedies, but this film lacks all of them. You've heard it's all their lack. I do not like any single point in this movie, no one else. I hate it I'm sure nobody will do that. The name aims to give visitors some ideas of nudity and stuff to the targeted audience, yet nudity is even failing. I do not know, but I was brave to see this thing for an hour or more, and I definitely recommend you do that. The worst movie I ever saw in my life. If someone offers to visit you, then your liiiiiiiiife saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
