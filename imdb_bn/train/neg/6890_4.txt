... without John Hedder. This guy screwed the entire movie. The son of a 29 year old slacker (Heder) still lives with the widowed mother (Keaton) who will meet a new love (Daniel). Slacker's boy is jealous of losing his comfortable life and trying to rob and relieve the relationship. He also fulfilled a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked Daniel's performance and especially the performance of Faris, but whoever played Hadar, it is better to sell hot dogs at sea beaches. Heder's performance is boring, because he plays a boring guy, it's a good thing, the problem is to trouble an actor in order to reduce this actor to end the problem. In the end you still want to punch the guy facing you and wish you're upset about the end. In the future, every movie will not go with me for this guy!
