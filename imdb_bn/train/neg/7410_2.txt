I liked such horrific movies that "real silent hills" (which I thought was quite good, but still some were missing) reveal a true amount of mystery and the movies that you guessed, I was one of these movies. Firstly the film starts with a really good mystery and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then it only sinks down the hill and from there it is faster and faster. For the first reason I mentioned the silent mountain because I can see many "steals" themes from this movie here. Let's all say, look instead of the silent mountain, better than that, it's even more awful, it has a lot of mystery and the end is much better. And above all, I do not seem to like it. This is just one of them. "I love that movie so I will recreate it in my own bad version." Movie ... Oh and many things ... Lord .. In a horror movie ... He is trying to fear a child with such a careful beer, The person who hugged me "and I love you forever" wrote on the stomach.
