The first Azimi movie can be denied because it was not a commercial product; It was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast young, interesting actors and certainly lacked the budget division. Yet what it was more than entertainment, and I could not deny that I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> The lack of "Azumi 2" is so impossible that everything is amazing. The first thing that should ring the alarm bells is the absence of the fantastic ryuhei Kitamura helm. He did not just take his views and movements with him, but his style, beauty and most importantly his heart. Although the first was a simple "hitlist" plot, it was a story of a corkscreen friction, and many neutral characters exaggerated the possibility of many sympathy or deviation by stuck each other. Effective interplay between lead characters; Azumi and her classmates are often debunking a bunch of stroppy teenagers in a forest. Characters have non-existent; If anyone sees who really takes the life and who dies, I will be frustrated. The same applies to villains here. Final War - In fact all war - absolutely free of any kind of tension. They are the weakest dancer and erroneously guided - some of them are not mentioned far and far - they made a deviation by their own continuousness. Villains try very hard to stay in their camps, and even if they all meet, they do not really come within a country of Joe Agagiri's stomach Burnsian Antix. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Oo Uto tries his best, and he also guides his hair to keep the film in good condition. Azumi is now completely a killer killer, which means he can wave his sword in slow motion; Unfortunately, now the character is inspired by one type of mysteriousness with a name style, the Uyu model becomes even more inappropriate. I know that this is considered to be the point, but if all else of the film's ineffectiveness, the stupidity of the plot and the ambiguity of ordinary movies in general, it is impossible to return to its character right now. . Kuriaama's performance is good about "remembering the bill from less memories" about Chiaki; It's good to say "turn" from bad to worse, as sufficiently napalm as fine as it is. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was just a big disappointment. No qualification has been ten times better than the first film. A lazy, dissatisfied - and usually biting annoying - mess.
