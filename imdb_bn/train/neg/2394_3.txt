This movie was weird ... I saw this while eating a quarter psilcybe cubensis (mushroom). It was really weird. I'm sure it is supposed to see you high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not laugh ... maybe LSD would work. The film is a bunch of things transformed into other things and dance. It's really impressive for today's standards but when it was released I was certain that it was good ... one kind. I can see how well some people think of this movie, but I do not think it was very interesting and I was in mushrooms at that time. If you are a party or something and all the bbbys being pretty lit, you will find it a few laughs pop.
