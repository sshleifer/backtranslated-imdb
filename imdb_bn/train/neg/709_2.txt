This movie was so badly written, directed and played that it was believed by the beggar. It should be remade with a good script, director and casting service. Acting on the worst problem. You have Jennifer Belles on one side, who is polished, professional, and completely trustworthy, and on the other hand, Richard, who has been involved in this particular piece of evil with evil. The slave owner (and keeping) Peter Glagher and Jenny Levine as the couple are just awful, although both usually work fine. Actors (and directors) should not try to pronounce them - they are incompatible and incredible. Very good to focus on doing good work in real English. Casting ridiculous Why children of a "African" businessman (thus less consciously wished for Jens De Kullu's society) are cast with very pale-skinned actors, when the supposedly socially-oriented Marcel officially expresses African characteristics, of which there is a clear color "fro"? Casting directors may not be bothered to read the copyright they are throwing and choose the appropriate actors from a large pool of highly talented and physically challenged actors. It's just weird! It can be a great movie and should be rebuilt, but with those who respect the content and the appropriate and skilled actors may like. There are a lot of actors and it will be interesting to see what Jennifer Bells, Daniel Sunshata and Gloria Ruben do with proper cast, good script and what's decent.
