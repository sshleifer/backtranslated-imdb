Just what we need! Another rebuilding of Vintage Hollywood movie again with Eddie Murphy again for the second time after Madina Professor (1996)! It shows why we are going out of the special idea to create a quality movie, lady and lady! It has some signs of human preference and hope of a lovely painting that can work with people and talk. Thing can only get worse, just unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sex references kill this piece of "family" funfare immediately. Even parents and children saw trailer advertisements on The Family Channel, which sums up and hates in the movie theater. Sadly, this is a progressive pre-millennium era, but it enjoys if it continues' because things can get worse over time. All went wrong with the new DR. DOLITTLE. It's absolutely flat, totally plotted. I hate that annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! If we want to announce bankruptcy, we need more talented voice-over than a bunch of extra paid celebrities. In my local newspaper, I would agree to give it to one of the top five movies of 1998. Then again, the original version was no better. Murphy's next project may be patine if he is not alert!
