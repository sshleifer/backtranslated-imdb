I saw this at the 2006 International Film Festival of Vancouver. The festival guide's summary seems to be great, so we decided to check it out. I'm sorry to be sorry. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad writing, it was annoying. I could not do much with this bad script, because I will not take away from the actors. <br /> <br /> The first bite was not to be shocked, except for the top appealing top priority. Hunt Hey went on with a campy horror feeling that the movie has been good. Instead he took himself seriously and this resulted in an annoying film. I can not recommend this photo. It felt very long and all just slightly weak.
