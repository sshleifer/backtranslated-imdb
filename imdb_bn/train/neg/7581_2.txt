I saw this movie the other day in a film school, and I did not see an alomodovar film before but hope it would be good. Unfortunately, it has become an uninterrupted film, which has only a few hours of sunny mix. High heels are only a collection of random scenes that work on their own separate film but do not combine with any meaningful content together. <br /> <br /> or did I think. Then, the next day, my film professor Doug Rani spent a whole class explaining the secret of all the films about how the statue that depicts the stereotypical Flamenco dancer in the background shows a little detail about the lack of captions. Spain as a nation has improved under the fascist regime. Apparently, the whole movie is full of shiny little visual tricks and full chocolate by references. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to create a good film - you have to give a reason to pay attention to the audience, something that is enough to take care of the audience, which is enough to care for all the fine tricks. High Hill gives us weird, off-bit characters, but most movies reuse it from other movies, and Almodora does not seem to use it in any way. For example, what is the significance of the release of Hitkovian's wonderful character? Why is that even there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> is a funny scene to work with a broadcast. And that's it, that's just the recreational moment. The rest of the film is only available for us to show nonsensical filmic references and visual signals that are only available in Padro Almodova. But my film professor says that no matter what, it takes more than spontaneous jokes for the film.
