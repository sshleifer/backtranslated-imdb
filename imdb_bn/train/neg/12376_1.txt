This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking I would really enjoy some good battles. People sucked this! A quick burst, a very annoying speaker, and their deadly battles have been widely edited and shortened (I'm especially thinking about the legend of Jiz Le's legend and Jackie Chan's drunken master). <Br /> <br /> And what is the dispute with street fighters? What is that so "cool" about that? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead, buy these movies to buy these movies and fight their ineffective glory!
