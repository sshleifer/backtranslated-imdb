This movie appears to many people, it seems to be the greatest atrocity of all time. Just after seeing it, I can say that it does not depend on those demands. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is really submerged. But overall, execution was not all cringe. Even the ultimate scene (eyeball thing) is not really that nasty. I was hoping for some crazy things, instead it was a lot less violent in low budget than the lesser quality. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see the real movie will be disappointed, because there is no story (however Surely most people know this). Gore's fans will be frustrated, in contrast to belief, here blood and void are low and far away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> avoid it.
