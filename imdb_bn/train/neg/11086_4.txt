As far as Spaghetti is going to Westerns, I can not die beside this map. This movie is not particularly bad, but I have seen that some other SWs lack the brightness and flash. The Guy Madison lead role is its best, but it lacks charisma on the screen to pull it off. With a significant exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is unknown and provides very little moment that I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is otherwise one bright spot in the middle film. Unfortunately, its screen is limited to 15 minutes less. (Note: The IMDB page for this man is not a mistake Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, instead she is a melanin character. I'm not sure how anyone can make a mistake for a person named John Barth, I am not sure about the IMDB credits for the film. Listed.)
