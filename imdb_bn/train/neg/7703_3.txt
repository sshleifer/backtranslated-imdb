A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she killed him and ran away when an old lady gets a heart attack. Name of the female killer Sawa. He is still going to school and is working with him for a rogue criminal, Akai. One day he found out Sawa and killed his parents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore Fest. There's "Kite" style, but it's still trash. The strange plot to kill a man like killing a teenager at the same time scary and tried to touch, which just flattered in the face of the story. One of the highlights is an action which falls together with a bodyguard from a building that produces a good / bad heroine, but the dramatic form is often not good orchested and the strange and unusual animation of the faces of director Yasmumi Umssur is awful. Not only that, the sequence of intercourse is simply unclear. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
