I've heard an upcoming rumor that "Leonard Dimes show Blu-ray discs". It will be interesting to see that from the stadium-cam to CGI the franchise can be re-reviewed with the progress of the past 25 years. I hope that this will help me remove the bad face by Fiasco of my full demonstration protests. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Neimay shows Beatmax VCR" is an outstanding milestone in the history of entertainment. "Leonard Dimes show compact cassettes" and continuously show "Leonard Dimming 8-track tape", which expects such glorious pieces? I just thought about this now crying.
