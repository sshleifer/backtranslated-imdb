A friend and I went to a stage (several) a few years ago to select the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. V. cheap). <br /> <br /> Cheap Cinthth Soundtrack is a classic of its time and style. There are some very funny scenes. One of those scenes in which a man is being attacked and saved with many possessions, it makes me laugh at that time (you do not seem to be very funny in the past but you go there). <br /> <br /> It's a total bat, in addition to it you think. But perhaps if you like movies like "Shopping Mall" then a watch price. Yes, I also saw that.
