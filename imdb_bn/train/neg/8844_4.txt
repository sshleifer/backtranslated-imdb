I saw this movie after seeing other comments on IMDB, even my wife believes that this is a "unique horror movie". I wanted to like this movie, but could not do it. <br /> <br /> "Love story" was good, but the horror was bad. If the story is about a young person who loves parasomaniya girl, it can be a good movie. <br /> <br /> The care center exceeded the limits exceeding the limit was pretty ridiculous. Doctors gladly disregard privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse visits a dangerous patient (without a safety companion) in a room to eat the routine, and for some reason shakes shivering and goes out of the house. Forensic patients (and archers in the film) standing in a fully dressed position - apparently for years? <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was also some of the actors I loved like spies, but I still can not recommend this movie.
