No, it was not among ten of the ten worst films of 1980, but it definitely skirt below 100. The film was kept in the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How do you explain the pre-dating special effects of "An American Wearoff" in London, Disco still looks cool and Ronald Reagan is the 40th President of the United States? When we are in it, we do not ignore those hairstyles in the 1970s and 1960s. I've seen more than "Happy Day" and "Loves and Sheryl" here. <br /> <br /> A woman who passed the film "so bad, it's good", great Elizabeth Hartman, but only barely. Miss Montgomery, the mafari high school teacher who became a sex addict, is stereotype for death and is still slower by Hollywood, but as a "hot chick" he also retains his musical qualities. This proof of his call for help. She looks better as Miss Vim "Beauty salaries seven taka, shot in hell." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, Hartman. Incidentally, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. It was better than "teen wolf too", and that was not so good. <br /> <br />
