After looking at the 1996 remake, I think the crew de bill was the most fun way to punish animal torture for its skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and my view is better than one of the animated ones. But there was indeed no need for a second. After all, if Krulah is coming back, do not cure him and maden him again. Just make a break from that and put a break in it. I was not very funny at that. It is only supposed to come back to an original pup. I was hoping that it would be lucky, because he was the most interesting and along with Roger and Anita also came back. However, they have a complete recasting and really decided to add one hundred, even one hundred two, but only three puppies, and a parrot think that he is a dog (cute). Gerard Depardieu's part was vain. Finally, Krulah suffers so much, very abusive and very true too over-exaggerated. She gets baked inside a giant cake. The first physical smile was a great effort, trying to imitate the same impact from the first effect. That just does not work. It was too much above, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.
