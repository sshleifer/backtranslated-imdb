In order to protect his wife from death, an old man will naturally take his position (at least Peter Greenway film): He and his son extend their house for eight and a half years (no legs) to increase women and their families. Turn on a Sexual Audi. This is a greenway film, there is a lot of persuasive and unwanted blabbering, and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact the father and son shared a bed asleep in the nude. Gross Besides, old people who want to see the old man? For those who are not in the Homo-boyfriend scene, they prefer to do a nasty job of a woman's horse. There is no story - a random collection of dull scenes.
