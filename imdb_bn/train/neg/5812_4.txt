"This story is devoted to women," according to the introduction, "Those who are fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve began to fall on leaves." When "politics" was drawn, the nineteenth century amendment, ensuring the right to vote for women, is just a decade old. And, the film related to the development of political power by women as a voting group. Prohibition of protest, and stop lecture, was a major concern for women at the time. <br /> <br /> The beautiful nature of Marie Dresler (as Hatti Barnes) has become politically active, a young woman was shot dead. A speakeasy's. He wants joints to sell alcohol; And, after giving a strong speech to a women rally, a mayor is drafted into the run. Mrs. Dresler is supported by her hired, best friend Polly Maran (as Ivy Higgs) and her disappointed husband Roscoe Atse (as Peter Higgins). Mayor of Lake City Mayor Dresler runs a dispute between men in the city; Therefore, Dresla ordered women to continue the strike, denying everything "deniers, bedrooms and baths". <br /> <br /> The film feels much better than it is. Ridiculous, frankly, not very good; And, it contains some unreasonable and moderate offensive situations ("you look like a queen of madam" refers to an Amos and Andy characters). And, shooting and slopstick mixing does not mix well. Producers might have considered the film more dramatic, especially Dessler and FÃ©lix Boyle (focusing on Ben Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Marble Barnes). <br /> <br /> Politics (7/25/31) Charles Risner ~ Mary Dresler, Polly Maran, Rosco Etas
