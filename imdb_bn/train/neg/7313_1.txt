I was disappointed to see this painful movie 5.75, so I want to know some things: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie the dog was divided into half, the disease was nothing to do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> Why was Hermit running around the jungle that strangers were asked to help him when he was his relative, Hog's lady. Asked to move to the hospital? <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? When a thing starts to get worse, a dude has trouble walking to town for help, are they really lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if a man threatens Paul thirst / shotgun! Wife, Paul could only send Jeff or Bart back home for help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He did not go back home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was also necessary for the plot that Peet, why they had pole in half the river. Not because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> To make Limondad in water, the nut is a dirty leaf and it bugs. Why two kids can not just use tap water, it was very contaminated, so stupid finishes will still work.
