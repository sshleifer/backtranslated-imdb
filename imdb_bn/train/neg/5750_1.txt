Actually, it was pretty funny ... a "god, how the film has been created" in a way that way. If you live in a fun way of filming ... whatever I do ... go ahead and see it ... but if you actually think "Is this a good movie?" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've never seen the worst movie in this movie that is very visible at the very beginning .... It usually takes five minutes to "understand that this movie "But no, you know right from the bat. This movie talked about Adler Allen Poe ... though did not try to explain it, who did not remember the life story of Poe ... so I do not know that any word is true. <br /> <br /> This movie has Hookin with the author "Ethan Poe" with his cousin "N" .... are they both descendants of Adger Allan Poe? Or they?!? Apparently, people give what their ancestors do. This guy Ethan Poe is actually Ethan "Ehhar", who is the successor of the story "Ishaar Ghar" which was written by Adger Alen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes looks to try to rape her ... Ann's one street, being stalked by three different people on the same street (serious, three ... and just like he did behind her glaring her). The end of the attempt to save the characters that are being killed ... but they can not. In the end, Ethan shot Ethan while trying to kill his best friend. Of course, before he shoots him he "never again!" You have to scream. This movie should no longer see!
