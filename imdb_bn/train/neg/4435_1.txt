God, I did not see this movie a terrible time in a long time. Could not be 'The New Guy' or Freddy Prince Jr. of various films. Yes, it's astonishingly awkward. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting must of course be inspired by Freddie. The staging of the movie was weird (like a game, and the feeling of imprisonment does not work well in the film). Actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her pronunciation was awful and her sexual appeal was unavoidable, so it was difficult to see 'seducing' her other character and they were 'fallen' for it. And what was with a live audience occacialal shot on the lawn chair? Meaningless! I had to close the DVD player, it could be a self-inflammatory pain to finish this movie.
