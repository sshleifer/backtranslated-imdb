It was perhaps the intention of the growing slow director of the film to reveal how a village in China is growing as a teenager. However, I found glossary gradually a combination of 'plots' and general filming styles, so to be completely disconnected, especially to Western audiences. Occasionally I am troubled to tell some characters differently, as it was illustrated from such distance. Two hours and I was careful past. Someone who is not interested in music, but also in China's history and culture (and there is no stranger in China's film) too much, I could not join the single character and found nothing to get my teeth. It asks: If I like it, who will like it on earth? Give me Jhang Yimu, give me a kiss. Let me work on any other Chinese director that I've ever seen. This sorry attempt is not just measuring at all. I'm sorry to try Chinese movie against this benchmark.
