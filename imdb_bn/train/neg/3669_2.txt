I really do not think it's good to talk about this movie ... not a single thing. The script is a nightmare .. The author seems to understand the blurs and differences in the lines between chemical and biological properties. You think they will get at least a technical advisor. The performance was mostly bad by the cast ... although I do not really blame them. The material really stinks. The edit was equally bad .. I'll stop now .. Its all bad 2/10
