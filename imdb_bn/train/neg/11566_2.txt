Probably I can not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: Close. Clearly, the default is off. When the last credit roll started, I could not believe it. Like our poor, but beautiful drama, I used to feel dirty, cheaper ... <br /> <br /> The letters grabbed a very wide stroke and the disrespect for the author's wealthy Thatcher was clear. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat," but I will realize a few more benefits. <br /> <br /> The problem can be with me. I think many people in this movie find some money or messages. Alas, I do not. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving it "1" is a nice scene, people and plants.
