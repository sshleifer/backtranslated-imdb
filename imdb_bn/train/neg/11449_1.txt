Seeing a movie as stupid as 'hot rod', one must come back, relax, and change one's intellectual ability in the same situation? Which, in this case, a state has been wrong for the comedy in some way dimmed enough to withstand the idiotic drill. With a short runtime of 88 minutes, this film was pulled out long ago and buried itself under a bundle of repetitive jokes ?? The joke that came at a minority and was not even fun in the first place. The original element of 'Hot Rod' is the topology and irrelevant of the 'Napoleonic Dynamite' of the 2004 civilization, though it comes with more transformed and cheerful. Actually, the vague disappointment of the movie compared with 'Napoleonic Dynamite' is jealous and objectionable, and instead of bothering me, I have survived. <br /> <br /> If the movie is compelled to make such a call, for example, the intent of jumping to twenty-five buses (more than one by its statue, called by Rod) and raising $ 50,000 for it, Announced Stantman Rod Kimble. Heart failure of grandfather's survival; Everything so that he can fight with his father, can be rescued once and achieve his honor ?? Because to achieve your respect, first you have to fight with them. is not it? Anyway. Not every character is more attractive than Rod's stick-on mush, and his ridiculous conclusion from the opening joke of the film, each scene played as an indecent, and horribly absurd, SNL skit? As soon as adding additional 85 minutes, it is sure that 'hot rod' is what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> movie star, Andy Sambergh, contributed an effort on the screen which eventually ended his comedy drops dropping to the end. Unfortunately ?? Rather, actually ?? His ridiculous talent is not more than a five-year old regeneration of his own exhausting mockery, where there are innocent crude enemies and pay-per-gags. And if it is frustrating, drag a chair, hide your face in your hands, and save yourself for the actual injuries: he is the comedy of the film! To protect them from their death, I will flush out the role of Volunteer Sambar's co-stars, and will go ahead with Lenley Island's second quarter director, Director Akwa Shafar, as the director of his existence? Or a comedian. Basically, a crash-course comedy can be more trumple than each thing could possibly be perfectly illustrated here; And so proudly, such film will be that way funnier. Believe in yourself the single smile in betrayal, or treat yourself in another movie? No other movie
