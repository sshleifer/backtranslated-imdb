I wanted to see this movie because of Elisa Dushku, but there are only a small part of it, and her character is not very favorite. However, the main character played by Melissa Sajmiller is very nice and a perfect joy to watch throughout the film. This is nothing really without a showcase for his looks and talents. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself, facing it, is quite unknown. After a car accident, some friends are probably dead, but their previous lives are alive, even though all such mysterious things happen. Some bad guys have them, but we can never find them. They probably (probably they were in another vehicle, but we certainly can not hear them). Final scenes, especially filmmakers seem ambitious, but I can not think of it as coherent. Opening scene, where bad boys (who wear some strange masks) cut a wrist from a blonde girl and her blood is not explained or followed. Unless the bad guys try to drag the Casey (Sizzmila) from the dead, surgeons should not be represented ... but no, it does not seem to work. Bad guys are just bad boys; They mess up a story that could be really interesting otherwise In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who needs bad people? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
