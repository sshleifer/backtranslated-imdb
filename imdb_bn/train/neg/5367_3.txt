I saw every episode off this spin. I think it was a good effort considering the gradual success of the first season, considering Gray's Anatomy. So I have continued to watch. I fear that in the second season there is a lack of charm, chemistry and its ancestor Gray's anatomic drama. Feel the relationship and feel so played. There is intelligence and humorous intelligence in the writings of intelligence. There is a formula that does not originate but does not originate, and unfortunately PP is not the same. I like the presence of Kate Walsh in the gate. I'm afraid that the life of KA Walsh LA is not only interesting.
