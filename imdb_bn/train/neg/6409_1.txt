I saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. One star that will give it to be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a BFi fan of the first order, but when I see it I know whip. At each level, this picture is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even in one scene, it makes crazy crazy craze for any reason. Whatever the reason for the cinema, Mankind is completely devoted to trickery and it is only a struggle to be emotional about being confusing. There is a cheap way to reveal the "atmosphere" to throw a red-throat look into your movie. I ran out of patience for the last job long ago, but making fun with MST3K riffs to stop it with my friends. Since Buffy left, even if the SMG 2 was a successful movie, you could also listed "Scooby Doo" on your resume. Gloria's actress, but she (or her agent) is definitely not finding a car for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have a problem paying your mortgage, but if you promise to not be present in the movie then I will send you some bonuses! (Also, the case for the settlement of the estate of the pacific clay will be sued!)
