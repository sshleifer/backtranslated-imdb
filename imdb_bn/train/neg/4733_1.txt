I can not believe I'm really sitting on the whole thing. A brief outline of this plot: The movie starts with Joso and another chick is sitting around the beach, the skinny blonde-haired beach "junk" looks like Jim does not have one day in his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. Oh oh! Here the competition comes! The stereotypical "hot chick" and his good friend who ride a ugly pink car. We soon found Jojo's mother a lifetime of Australian jobs, which means that JÃ³jo will have to leave his best friend (oh no, I think I'm crying). A huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. Somehow, due to any apparent reason, little chick falls into the pool, and is facing face to face, you estimate it a MERMAID! This is where "stories" really takes place. Basically, they want to love the mermaid with "Hong Kong" <br /> <br /> It's a print flick with great acting, it's the look of the 80s, like the top of Oscar-worthy performance. This movie is possible for all the closures ... Best friend, "Hank" Everyone wants, "hot" bad girl and her mischievous friend, awful old man ... you name it, it's there. I took one for many people by watching this. Please consider a sacrifice for my hour and 40 minutes. Please do not see this movie. So I did not enjoy terrible so much.
