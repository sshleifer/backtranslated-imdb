The Antononii movie is well-groomed. It is always astonishing that the characters and situations without a precarious plastic beauty have a neutral and educational "psychology". Keep in mind, for example, the conversation between Mastroanyani and "the evil capitalist", which makes the guests laugh at the "La Tite" or "La Aventura" train flirting, or imagining to take away the factorial ink, at the end of the same movie. <br /> <br /> I reviewed yesterday's "Zaborky Point". This film features a lot of great and wide shots on Rod Taylor's office, street roads and highways, promotional advertisements, and desert, which show the charm of the writer on his American journey.
