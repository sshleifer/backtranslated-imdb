I read some comments about this film and guess that only some people can be easily entertained. This movie has nothing to do. It is very badly written, operated and played that makes it barely an impression. The characters speak in cliche-ridden conversations and the circumstances are completely incredible. Although it can make this camp and make fun, everything is not shameless because the film becomes soft. Lee Lez decided to write a play about a woman fighting with his sexuality, but then the story of the Studio Executive did not allow the story of real life or to reach the Kojonos. This movie can be called the standard-issue bad Lifetime TV movie in Enclopedia.
