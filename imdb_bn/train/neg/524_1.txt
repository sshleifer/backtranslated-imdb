"The 40-year-old Virgin" is in a world that I do not understand. In a world where an electronics store employee can "f *** close" on his phone and spread the video of his whole naked ass video and could not be frustrated. A world where drunk driving is really fun to break and break into other people's cars. A world where its spring seems to be okay for a boss to harass sexual harassment. A world full of aggressive and aggressive stereootypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without a fun joke! I am absolutely disappointed with the enthusiastic chorus of viewers who love this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - to start is not very funny, and stretches beyond all reasonable thoughts. The chest-screwing scene has gone ahead. <br /> <br /> The character beside the carpal was completely a note. And the romantic elements were completely transformed, especially in the scene where the careers in the car's apartment were indecent. That was just hair. <br /> <br /> I got the series "Aquarium" completely annoying and overwhelming. This hatred hate hatred!
