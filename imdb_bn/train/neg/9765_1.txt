I often do not interfere "more", but if there is a movie that qualifies for such attention, then it is "gas!" It is self-artificial shit that has reached for some environmental aspects of M * A * H and it completely flattens in effort. <br /> <br /> I see what was going on for Common - Melcolm Marmastine and Eliot Gold attempted to reproduce the role of the death of Gould with the same plot in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​(film "Whiff" - it's IMDB See here, http://www.imdb.com/ title / tt0073891 / for more information) <br /> <br /> <br /> with Marmastine and the "Goff" Bronze Ring Came! But do not get quite there. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what not? Someone really came closer to acting at a level in upper junior high school theater. Production quality stink Here someone else mentioned the regenerating regenerating headlights on a farewell car, and there are details that detail the lack of attention. This image is not supposed to be done in any way, its nothing works and neither is it concerned. <br /> <br /> "gas!" Actually let me sleep. It's not a sure remedy for insomnia, but really close. Cinematic sleep induction scale, "gas!" Despite the unknown idea of ​​studio's idea of ​​maintaining the attention of the audience by the explicit execution of the studio, which fell somewhere in the rebuild of "Clowns last year" and George Clonier's "Solaris" (which also seemed more boring than Mosfilm) <br /> < The orderly edit is "gas!" Who will reduce! About twenty minutes The result is useless, but nothing more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they have an attractive quality that makes them worth any cost. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even amusingly bad.
