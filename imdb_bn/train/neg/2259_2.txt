For my life, I do not understand why they want to make a movie about "Jerry Springer Show". It is so incredibly trashy In some ways, sadly it is a guilty pleasure. We all have admitted that we have seen at least one episode. This is part of our pop culture. I recently saw this in the US. It's pretty bad. I must admit that. What Mr Zari meant as acting does seem to be an awesome act. Or something like this It's in Jamie Pressel. She is basically playing herself. He needed his boyfriend boy, Kid Rock. It is then perfected. So, I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just see "Jerry Springer Show" It's more enjoyable than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
