I saw this picture at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Depending on the novel by science-fiction writer Brian Eladis, this film tries to tell the stories of Tom and Barry Haw, who are robbed from their families who have been robbed from their families for constructing a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately damned, the film is more than half clever (if you forgive the penalty). Mixing genres, styles, and moods, the director (whose previous movie was a great documentary in the Lost In La Mann) quickly lost his way. I was not sure whether it was meant to take it all seriously or not. Flashbacks, sequence of dreams, it was just a bit more. Plus, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. During Headvig and Agri Inch, I had a little more reminiscing, I saw a movie that was real and moving. But in this case, the tracks were not good and the original characters were not sympathetic. A more hostile comparison would be similar to the disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
