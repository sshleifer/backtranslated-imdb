This "cute" movie was originally a Japanese movie. And when I think that the original movie was bad, American-International films hacked the film into pieces and inserted American made parts to fool the viewers. Until now your audience is created by the total fools, it has been painful to see that it has been done - and has been working with little skill or care with the final product. The bottom line is that you have mostly clear Japanese scenes and then there are definitely American scenes where the film is quite different. Alongside, American scenes are really meaningless and in the meeting, a group of two different groups of gamers are being talked about - evil flying turtles! And even though it is a fire-breathing, flying and destructive monster, but in reality there is no power because I believe the actors feel embarrassed for being in this rogue film - in particular, film director Von Donley and Albert Decker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seeing a giant fanged turtle is ridiculous to recall his head and limbs and start cutting through the air like a missile. On the other hand, this film is naturally creepy model planes, destructive bales buildings and power plants, and it is not surprising. Also included is a weird Japanese giant movie cliché which will disrupt most non-Japanese audience members, and is the "adorable and passionate little boy who loves the monster and believes in him". Yes right Well, like the Smoke Monster and many other movies like the Gadízilla Veraasas, you're delighted with this annoying creep on the giant, even though like the next avatars of Godzilla, Gamma is not a good person and it eventually turns out to be. Just a fool! The silly, unpopular poor special effects that can make seven years old, bad acting, meaningless American clips, and occasionally awful voice dubbing, make it a bad movie. Surprisingly, most of the film (and the foolish child) will hate it, a small and a small number of minority minorities will love these movies and compare them with Bergman and Kurosawa. Do not believe them - this is a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> - Apparently due to his horrific levels, in the 60's and more recent incidents, Gammar was featured in many other films. None of them alters the central truth that the flying turtles of the fire or the movies are really minor.
