This image is notable for three reasons. First, in the capital market on successive successes of two 'Superman', this low budget feature was created and released in theaters, which marked George Reeves and Phillis Kotes. Initial appearance as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. The opening part series is reused. Six miles deep oil outside the city of Silby enters the 'Earth Earth' which allows you to come to the Mole-Man page. Forget about other holes (in the plot). Second, in contrast to the films of the most SF attack in the fifties, heroes manage influential (and controlling) forces in the context of the promotion and application and differences. Against a raging crowd of separatist surveillance. Here is the 'silent Mannirad Reporter'! Clark Kent, the wise and confident, controls the situation across ("I'll handle it!"), Even a bullet-man helps to bullet the hospital to remove bullets! As Superman, he was more flexible than Clive Lloyds, but he was "Nazarene Storm" against the cause and surveillance. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the flyer-like cartoon has not been transferred from 'Live Action' to 'Superman Adventures Adventures' in two serials, from an animated flying flight.
