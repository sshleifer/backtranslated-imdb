Many King fans hate it because it has gone from the book, but the film should be changed while jumping on a different medium and books. However, the film completely fails, but it completely fails in film posts. The people I tell them are the most horrific films ever made. I always follow the question "really ... what exactly are you afraid of?" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally, someone shots the name "wine-juice-shooting-out-of-elevator" in a decent fear (no one ...), You are afraid of what I do not know what you tell, maybe you're afraid. I looked around my eyes to show this G-grade horror ideas in this scolkie, incompatible movie. <br /> <br /> In one place it is separated from the book and it is really rush that Mr. Mr. Just from the point of view of killing Holon! The most cruel member of the audience knew that Jack was waiting behind a column of glass on the way to the Hariri forward. A stupid order to really keep in the picture is a. <br /> <br /> Excellent choice for Stanley and the artwork of Mr. Hallon! Black Light Afro-Niffomaniacs really add a horror movie Mood and character development. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this stupid, stupid movie and folk goddess, but the Kubrick fan-boys are a truly important movie in the ruthlessly created 'bad wishes' Can not describe the idea of ​​working on it with film companies. Congress libraries in front of them. <br /> <br /> Toss in Jack Nicholson's extraordinary additions, the role of an idiot at the moment, and Razzie Shelley nominated Duval's performance and you have a great movie.
