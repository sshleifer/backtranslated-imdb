I fail to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be a scientist). It's really "Let's see how soap works out this week" and oh, slabs are involved in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Ceylon "Bab" which keeps other people cool, it is quite clear that T & A has been added. Every time he pops up, I am surprised that the WTFT seems to be running. And do not even try to bullsh me about "story arcs". <br /> <br /> With a SOG opera throwing some CGI. It is not science fiction as well as the original generation. <br /> <br /> This series is not something that it has worked-up to be. If you want to work on the conventional, lively, dodgy, jumpy, vague editor-on-crack camera, this show might be for you. Since the dances seem to be getting involved in this show, it is a clear indication that vocalists' opinion of Picard has been changed.
