Every time a movie arrives, it will be so horrible that I feel compelled to warn the people. If I work hard all day and I can save a single soul from watching this movie, then I would be happy. <br /> <br /> Where will I start to discuss my pain. For beginners, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character had a stereotype. We swore to people, fatty people, who eat donutas, foreigners, etc. The script seems to think that the film is being shot. The production price was so incredibly low that I felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Director, producer, etc. Have never seen a movie before? Being bad and bad with every new entry in Halestorm The idea for this movie is so funny words. How could you be mistaken with a handful of Gary Coleman and a little legal actor. But when I say it, believe me, something went wrong, very bad.
