This is your only spoiler warning. No sad situation in our movie when such an unusual junk is considered "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I divide the ingredients into three layers. The first stage is the theater. Here the audience stops and the power of presentation in the actor, and most importantly, the author's power. A good playwright is better than a good photographer because he knows the way to sound well. The best plays Ben-Stage can create images that can not show. <br /> <br /> The second-level movie. In this medium, a weak writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting all the time in one place. With the film, it can also take strong poetry in the context and also the qualities of visual poetry and money. In addition, movies can make eternal elements often used to make gods like words and words. <br /> <br /> The final level literary. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated into paper and then re-imagined by the reader. The film can go into a novel much more detail than being imaginative for the studio. <br /> <br /> Adaptations may increase due to this, but never down. Novels are not better than base films (see dime-per-door in your local bookstore), but the film can not reveal the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and Lotto). Movies can rarely be made into plays, and dramas can always be made in movies. <br /> <br /> This failed as 'The Last Picture Show'. This is a film that should be stuck on the stage because the director is stupid to shoot a right. Characters do the same thing and do the same, it's pure futility. Add that unnecessary soundtrack and you have a completely unwatchable film. <br /> <br /> I saw this with about 20 other wannabe thespeans in my high school drama class. The teacher became angry about how sad the teacher was. The sad thing is that how such a steady work is considered to be depressing when the element is appealing. These colors will be considered as a great comedy for the slowdown, the pool party, and the old Hooker scenes. A few years later, what did Lucas do with America's graffiti? <br /> <br /> America will have to start teaching secondary education rather than teaching movies about film. Two visible strong down-movie: The Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Depend on them, this is not. It's 'last' I want to see it. 1 out of 5
