This film should be partnering with negative comments and agree with me that it is considered as one of the worst movies ever made. Indeed, most of the movies based on the work of the Kings are bad, but it goes out of the bad state. There is not a terrible moment in it until you consider the stupidity fool. It is generally not known at the earliest of the King Trash - Prostitution, which is known as Gravitational for PV Playhouse (which, at least, amusementally). It is full of ridiculous moment, which is not least the character of Alice Cr√®ge When he goes on a rampage and starts quipping like an old Batman TV show villain, it's so stupid as to be sick. All of these people (including John Landes) were lucky they still have a career. But the most absurd part is to wear cats at the end, which is like the cheap rubber clothes bought by K-Murray. The best part of the film is the look of some real cats that actually acted in the movie.
