When I saw this "documentary", I was frustrated to see Serbia's publicity campaign again. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the break in Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in the "documentary", which was created by Bogdanovitch, whose name tells us that he is far away from the purpose of Serbian and his film. It is one of the lies that led to Milosevic regime. All others are guilty, only Serbian are right and hunters, although most of Hague's war criminals are in Sergey, even though Serbs are those who are victims of genocide against Bosnians and attack all the independent countries recognized in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. The breakdown of the UN Yugoslavia breakout can not be avoided, because Serbian nationalists did not want to pressure the Federal Yugoslav government, so Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent countries to protect their interests. If you are interested in an intriguing documentary about Yugoslavia breaks, and actually led the documentary this is not. You see "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", discover discovery channels and BBC.
