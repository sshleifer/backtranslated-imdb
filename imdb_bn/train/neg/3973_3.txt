Okay, cool - this would be a supernatural kind of horror story, partly to stop part of our world ... wherever we are. Then in the storm of cat and bird, three dog dogs begin to work - is there any evil force trying to attack directly? Have an evil force trying to attack them - do people really do terrible things? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is a brainchild of eco chambers where the enclosure can reinforce the conflict in the murder? Okay, hold on-- maybe it's a little psychologically misleading "Delbert" -style redneck boy who misses her mom, and K Taylor Taylor is in any kind of shaking like Bates?

The actress can play as straightforward as she speaks, but the reality is, "You have got the bat, sit down!" At least they had enough expertise with the GTF.
