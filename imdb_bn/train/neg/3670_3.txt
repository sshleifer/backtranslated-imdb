For a science scare movie to work well it will be really original or very good retelling. This is not the movie. Of course, there is a pseudo-core clue that man kills man due to toxicity and is not due to a disease, but it is a very small bend. The conspiracy angle of the government, the Crusader playwright whose personal experience is ... <br /> <br /> The real error of this movie is that there is no disease of the polluted people. Although the character has been recorded to be a person who should be frustrated, he is not. Movies without sadness are fools. Other characters so cookie cutter they are ridiculous The subpages are convoluted and annoying. And the most tragic thing is to enjoy the film as a very flat, even ridiculous element. Minimize the movie for 45 minutes and it can be valuable.
