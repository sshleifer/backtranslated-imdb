An interesting idea for a movie, showing the last dragon in the world and showing him and any other evil struggle together. When he was young, when he was hurt in the heart, Bowen (Dennis Kaida) took him to the dark lord, who gave him half his heart. Now it is grown up. Yunan (David Thequilis) is now a selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Drako Dragon (Voice by Sir Shawn Connie) to get awards for dragon "dragon" dragon. But half of half of the Iain's draco, both of them think that one of them is hurt, or killed. Gilbert Pittlethwaite also included Gilbert of Gloucester, Jason Isaac as Lord Falton, Julie Cristie like Queen Islein and John Gilgood as King Arthur. It was nominated for the best visual effects for the Oscars. Watching observers!
