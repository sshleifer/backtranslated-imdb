This is a bad movie, it seems that there are only five police in HK, they do not use guns there and it makes me think of Jackie Chan's movie. All the time they are pointing only to the suspect using their guns. They finally used their guns when they killed each other, what a fun movie. In movies, good boys have died without any reason. <br /> <br /> They suck the story line of the movie, the story jumps here and there and bothers the people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, but I think this is just a good film, I think the zombie film made in the US is more bloody than this.
