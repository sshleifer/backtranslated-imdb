This movie is just shit. Although the directors claim to be part of the I-culture, it is still a very, very bad director. The subject is very interesting and I take a bad performance because they are all amateur and have never played before, but the worst thing about this movie is the dialog and very inexperienced and unkind directions. That movie has no time at all. I think the film's movie (that's their first feature) has gone so far to work, in fact they did not really ask themselves, what stories they wanted to say. I've seen many times Ben (director one) and he is a wonderful and thoughtful guy, but that's not his director. I think the "American History X" clich√©s are full, but in some way a story manages the transportation. "O! Warning" is not full, new or provocative, and (the tragedy for this movie) is far from any ah! -Reason. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the strange but great German movies, Michael Hannek, Christopher Schoenensen, Oskar Roehler, Hans Wingangnera or Oliver Hirchibel, see the movies: <br /> <br /> Beni's video will be played in the fun game Dia Ebberbara Ledger Film Das test Das Weiss Rauschen Maxmenschinstil .. <br /> *** In ten, due to subject matter and photography
