My comment can be a bit of a value to it, what it's worth to do <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stupid The incidental song is frustrating, like hackneyed melody, which literally pops up to comment on the narrative (eg "soul in the sky," for example - oh, I get it!) It is essentially a chest and chang film credible emotions on the audience using his voice alone By inflicting his stodgy English setting and the fantastic ability of Brenda Blethyn. In High Sky Magazine, I literally hear people saying that they got their joly with a huge "stem" that torn the image. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to sell her illegal accessories in a shameful white dress suit in London's streets. Not funny Not original Unwelcome Not a good movie. 7.2 rating results of casting over zealots Do not waste your time ...
