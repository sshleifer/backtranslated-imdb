And that's the only reason I posses this DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis film, but I saw the information here and I said here: What? Why? Alex was the first man in Alex. But then again the first one was set in the future, so maybe this is the new one of the Alex brand and the scientist Alex happened to create the female at this time. Who knows, at least it has not been decided by the film in any way. <br /> <br /> A short summary of the plot here: Alex, still escapes using a child (or how you want, as it was, in the future) with a special time ship with his mother and 80's in Africa. Mummy died there and Alex (case value) grew up in the African community. Then the tribe is killed by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and eventually he assassins of the Cyber. So there. The word is known, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nomination for getting a firm foundation for getting your cybergods head. <br /> <br /> I see, what else? All right, this movie was a small budget flick, but it had special effects for the mid-90s. How would it look okay for a 80's flick? The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the visitors are barely interested. Nimesis 2 is not the most compelling piece of movie I've seen (?) But it's very close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because be honest here: Does anyone expect Oscar-friendly performance here? Oh well ... at least I found that the way of Amazonian warrior found the price of hot sue. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals on all the quality. And despite the very basic plot, it makes little pictures that makes it very little sense. <br /> <br /> Camp movie rating: 4/10 I get laughing occasionally from the worst kind of film, so it's small, it's brilliant.
