The film was waiting for the 'nothing really nothing' action flick hopes, still very frustrated. In the opening scene comedy promises a little step with a tinge. It keeps you hooked for the first half cores until you are now expected for that time for that expectation. Well, nothing like this will happen. Drag the movie and at the end you reach a point that just gets annoyed. Think about what the director is thinking. Make no sense. The film was poor in all respects, there was no real storyline and it was "Rambo", it does not seem to be very hollow, I do not think that she could always help in rating. There is no reason for the movie. Waste is a perfect way to waste your time and money. I have seen sometimes the most annoying movie and I'm sure the others will have the same opinion after tolerating it. Surely for those who have little movie sense, there is no left for them.
