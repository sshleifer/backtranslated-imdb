I really hope I can give it a negative vote, because I think I spent 83 minutes in my life, which is sometimes watching the worst horror movies in the film. Acting was just horrible, I really want to say bad, the dialog was bad, the script was written as if it was written ... I could not remember something terrible to say. And days "outside" and the "inside" shots of the night make you think that the events were taken within a few days. How can everyone be hungry for the poor all through terribly organized, managed, written, etc. Stay away from one at all costs. If my only saving grace is to get out of hell, then it does a good job, it does not tell the world to see this shit. Why is this movie right because horror movies are taken seriously?
