Apparently speaking, this film is stunning. It has some delightful black humorous moments. But overall, the plot is very clean, as its messaging message. If you're a fan of the top violence in mainstream movies in the hostels or viewings, then you would love it. If you're looking for something high to all, run away. I saw it as part of Edinburgh Film Festival 06, and I simply chose it because I'm looking somewhat annoying. Finally, it is not annoying. Only through consuming and unpleasant. If you really want to challenge, go see something like Lost. If you want to profit, or tell your friends about the really dirty uploaded movie, it's for you.
