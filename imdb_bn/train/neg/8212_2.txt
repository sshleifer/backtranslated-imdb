I have read all the comments on this photo. I am the Dalai Lama's <br /> <br />! For example, I read this book on which <br /> <br /> the film was based. The film is truly ugly and abusive imagination. I do not criticize for <br /> <br /> for dramatic purposes change small details or events; <br /> <br /> Not Documentary But the script changes, responds, changes <br /> <br />, and changes each major character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Everything in this movie is false - for amazing photography. /> Without I understand that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
