This membrane reminds me of that hair "loving thriller", I was late and at the age of 13 I saw cinemax. I'll label this flick soft-core because there is no simulated bump and grinder. But there is a ton of nudity - the first scene is in a strip club, we can see the Keane Holder's KeEster (or at least one stunt butt) and then look at the 10-minute gay dance scene in the middle of the film, and the nude women look like they look dressed for Munchhit's clothes. 13 year old boys are happy <br /> <br /> The worst CGI I have seen for several years in the Verrubo conversion scenes. The shot shows video quality resident Evil to quality values ​​like FMV. The interpretation of the wolf is very bad and, despite the door quality poorly, many times the path is shown. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is not in any sense. There are some weird stories about Verruvol and Hybrid -Webovolve - Darkwolf is next but hybrids can do the same thing from what I say - see people, kill people instead of wolf. Darkul is trying to find a companion but can not find the odd partner, but he can soften someone who can touch him. Once again, this skill, Darkwhal, killed many people in the air, did not touch its target, touched its target, fulfilled or even saw what I can say. The mate does not know that he is a Verbol and he is fighting with transformation or something else. <br /> <br /> If you think that it will make a common giant film a bad thing, but good. . The quality of the lower end of the webmag-ask, rented dog soldiers want T and a ton, it's your flick.
