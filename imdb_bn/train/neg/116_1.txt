I can not believe that this film is for the praise of those who do not think of any other movie. I was ready for the possibility that this could be horrible, but the script (or its lack) makes for a film that makes vain. Plus, the skill level of the common level of actor and tech crew is quite efficient, but when you get a seed ear to work with you, you will not be able to make a silk purse. Ben G. fans should be with him in any movie. The supporters of Dorothea should be with the galaxin. Shows and targets of Peter B fans' latest photos. People who seem to be looking at it, should be in the light of the surprisingly awful book of Peter B in the light of the sunny public, at the cost of the Unicon.
