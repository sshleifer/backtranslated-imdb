My God, I have given this movie to three stars for ten of the following reasons. The final order was again managed quite effectively and it was absolutely delightful. For that what it gets three points is Even more, it was oppressive. It was not meant to be funny, which is quite obvious, but the dubbing, the role of dubbed voices, dialogue, said, where often laughing The action takes place, and / or does not take place, also lead to throw lots of laugh and / or screen things. As the whole city is being killed and a small group of people are standing in a balcony like they are watching a cooking glass, or trying to "try" to escape from the church. Bad Mayor: I think something is going on, so you have to go upstairs and see the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: OK <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I will get this little child and he will walk outside and weep weep, because these drunken bodies are not only stricken strangers, but there is no meat, skin or anything, and he will take them away and I will run away! Enter this section. <br /> <br /> Hero (upwards): She is trying to run away, fool, and open the door, she is silly, this is a wonderful scene. <br /> <br /> Where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (bottom): I do not know, I can not see him and he was not out because I could not see him even after coming out. See there and my surroundings and he is standing outside, where can he live on earth? <br /> <br /> Not saying, someone will throw things on the screen after 10 minutes. So, watch the first movie with some friends, drink some drinks, and when you see it, make sure that you are completely drunk and can look at all its stupidity. And even no decent beggar, was not even a shame.
