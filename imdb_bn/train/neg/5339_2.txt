All right, so I like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go to see and see most things, now that multiplex movies are so good (I think the old "flea pit" is a single screen movie and I'm 40 healthy side). This film is released as "Leer" in England, it is a dog. It is also the best waste of celluloid. Only 4/10 for photography and set.
