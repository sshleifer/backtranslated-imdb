Please do not waste your time. This film reshares the worst version of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Ana Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and intelligent biblical references), and blade (high-tech toys). I really liked vampire movies and novels, and there are a lot that are very good. But this is not stinker. Even the soundtrack does not help it, for most of the reason, the movie resorts to ridiculing scary classical music instead of "kick-ass malt". I had to listen to any metal only several times; Mostly it is tortured violiol. Avoid it as garlic and crucified.
