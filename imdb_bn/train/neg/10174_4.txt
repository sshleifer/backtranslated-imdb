I finally saw this back in '94 when released. Apparently because Orion's picture was bankrupt, I think the film was not released a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it for a long time because I'm partly trying to remember the description, but I remember as a very dull movie. I put the debate to walk it out. The store was not all interesting or engaging. A third rate was imitation of America graffiti. <br /> <br /> This is not viewable for any performance. This gave a high rating among the biggest disappointments from the local newspaper critics.
