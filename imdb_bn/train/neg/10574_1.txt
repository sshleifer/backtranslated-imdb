Without family exception, this new season is worse than one of the season. I wonder what they do not think. As a terrible fan, many bears and stupid greatness can endure, but this series gets worse with each outing. I can not imagine how excited the actors and crew should be discouraged every day, hard work to get rid of such bad talk Story! Asked for that too? Character! How can we curse someone in this story about fate? If we are not appointed, will they shake or whatever? Almost every episode ends with the stupid bloodshed, sudden mourning is expressed without any feeling of revelation or conclusion, or why we have been infected with blood pressure for an hour. Even with the efforts of Dante, there was some annoying sex violence in this season and it was flawed in a vain conclusion. Maliciously, the speed of content prices and performance increases, when the content is completely bogus. I have great hopes for Garrett's valerie for the producer of the producer under the stewar, but we can see.
