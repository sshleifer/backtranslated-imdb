I twice saw this movie through the Pantecostal Church, my family joined Nanimo BCC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, I was my brother again. This movie became frightened by my brother's fear and how we saw the world with disbelief. It was not just a movie, but it was also a philosophy that "symbol of the enemy" symbol of the beast, and many "Christians" involved in the wonders. This movie, the church, and the emergence of an unstable neglect, lead to serious Paran√° for the future. For many years, I lived under misguided influences of the church and the fear of forgetting Christ. I'm 40 years old now. The consultation went through years. I once explained this movie and a psychiatrist of church and family belief system. I was pegged with a misleading disorder. I really started to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this civil philosophy actually happened. I am not afraid of future, I fear the members of the church injecting their members. I've taken this experience to fulfill an objective, I am near my license as a psychiatrist for childhood injuries specialist.
