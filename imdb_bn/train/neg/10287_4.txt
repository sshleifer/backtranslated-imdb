It is available in "Drive in Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films, and since I've finished "Barcuda", I also saw it. It is a film that is incredibly ambitious and proved free at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young people in the streets of some foreign cities, but where exactly? They stopped watching the necklace from some Chinese vendors and tried to wear Chinese-style clothes, but then we could see some AJCTs dancers? And all the time, these girls follow two boys, who can finally hide any secret, even though they are not forced to pursue the cities to run wild and they can eventually catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that a throat of women has a coin around her neck, and these people want to find a loot, and where does she get it? So, in the flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know this coin was? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, in their tank, they returned this little boy to the dock of his house, only to get his grandfather out and to ask herbal tea with the old For "young girl" invited. But not everyone drinks tea, today they go back to the boat to check young girls, and then when they stay away from there, the boat flies, and when they return home, their friends disappear mysteriously. Well, it seems that this "kind man" raises their own vegetables but they wait for a spell to leave the meat, and it serves the herbal teas. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd went away. Island, but now, they are coming back, escorted by their prisoners, and since they have there, none of the girls ever showed that, where it was before it was treasure. Someone on the island thinks, and fraud starts mysteriously, one after the other, and there are only three, it does not take long. And even there's even a happy ending, which will leave the rest of the viewers as they leave the rest as the rest. <br /> <br /> Two thugs seem to be freaks in speed with anger problems, and combined with no acting ability they are bound to limit boundaries. Dada Hand Warren, who was present at many films and TV shows, could still be excluded from the performance of mountainous families. The action is confusing, locals are more confusing, and the island looks like South California. <br /> <br /> So what is this? I'm not sure, but you can remember (or say so) if you like to watch once, right? 10 out of 4, very weird.
