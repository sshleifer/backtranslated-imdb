The eyes of the mountain are II and you are expected to do it and something more. Of course this is not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it is pure entertainment only that you can lose yourself for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the notoriously changing mountain areas of the last days of desert training. It is only fighting throughout the film, in which large amounts of violence (which is mostly the whole film), such as blood and vortices, revolve around life and another graphic wrap scene which is undoubtedly thrown into the audience. <br /> <br /> I'll give 4 aj II out of 10 for the recreation of Heels, and that's only Even though I still see myself in the watch as the film continues, because it is really graphic with Gore expressing condolences and condolences to the audience and to make the audience amazed to mourn the audience. Stay awake. Hills Eyes II is just entertainment, if you are bored while spending some time, there is nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
