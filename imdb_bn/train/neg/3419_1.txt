OK, so, Chuck Norris found some way to produce this sequel somehow. I have a question why? Who read this script and said, "Sound is great! Original!" This movie is a shocking rejection that I do not waste my toilet grapes. Of course, it is MIA, Inventive United States, Wakara, Texas Ranger, Delta Force tradition and on the other hand Chuck Norris is a man who can be America from some bad people. She does not even need a gun most of the time. It is stupid patriotic mess that stales mind. The big surprise is that this NORIS movie will be run only by Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris initially worked in all of his father's films and TV shows. Does this strike anyone as a sign that there is a guessing talent in this? Then, he is managing the same people in the same stories as before ... The only difference is the name of the characters. For the United States, I wanted to be patriotic and encouraged, my country is in worse shape than I imagined. Hopefully, Chuck Norris plays the nail on the coffin.
