It focuses on a low-life movie about New Life in New York City and a major character (title name for Brad Pitt), who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson-type musician, he has no genuine talent. <br /> <br /> It's such an interesting fact that until New York City type woman enters the photo of the woman and takes them on the horrific accent. That destroyed the film for me. It should definitely be Catherine Keaneer, who is usually playing hard and rubbish women. <br /> <br /> Stove on Pitt - an exaggeration Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can take pictures of Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: In 1992 (except Woody Allen) it is impossible to hear a movie made with only a mono sound.
