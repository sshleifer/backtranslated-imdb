I really tried to like this film. While watching this, I can remember, "This guy gave me cripps, I got a restrictive order". It calls CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was there really this conversation before making movies? "Let's make a film that puts together two chronically depressed, socially harmless people, deepening their isolation and encouraging them to complain about how bad their lives are!" What I have seen in life is that the last thing in the world is that we consider potential partners interesting, which is patient. <br /> <br /> The movie's mood is definitely 80-ish; brooding and slow. Do not make mistakes, there are moments of film, only a few of them.
