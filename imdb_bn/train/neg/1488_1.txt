I had to register to comment on the horror of this movie only for IMDB ... it is a good story than my cat and stringer ball. I have never seen that the worst act, but if you want to wipe the entire cast of the movie in 5 minutes it may be a bit preferred. There was not a single 'horror' moment in the movie except for watching the movie 'Halloween' in the movie. Around, it seems like it might be a good story, the credit rolling, and the chassis line was a loss in it, because I did not recognize him directly and his view had already ended before 'Oh yes, he is there'. I'm so happy that I saw it in a hotel and did not pay for it, because if I could have hundred centers to show it, I would like a real ticket. I usually like or prefer at least one redemption factor in a movie, but it's an exception. It's too bad that it's not too bad-it's bad ... it's just plain.
