I read Ben Mayerich's novel a few years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this expression. <br /> <br /> Although I read the story for the first time, the difference between the novel and the movie is humongous. A very important element, which makes the whole thing legitimate, is simply written or bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting to you, go and get the novel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
