!!!!! Of course there spinners !!!!! I am sure this project has started as a screen writing workshop to avoid clichés in other movies: female heroine - check the bad things for drug addicts - check heroin is empty - check heroin - villain retrieves the stupidity - check the frame consistently we saw the arc heinine Shivering behind - unfortunately it seems that anyone has this cliché The list has been sent to a studio instead of using it for the class. Dear dear, if London Transport is regularly operated as a click here In fact there are many clinics and it has seen a moment ago that no one can really reveal what is the name of it? Or how many times he killed an underground man. I believe that this is the result of some people's examination and perhaps that night, he does not decide to take revenge on humanity, but all of this is not completely negative as vague, meaningless. I doubt if the producers would think that they would make a movie that was going to remove the Oscars that year and there was always a market for horror movies. Likewise, I suspect that if it produces a lot more and instead of distributing movies, there is a glance in the DVD market and I can say that it is a little better than the 1972 Death line, which is hidden in a London underground secret canal. It just seems like when you have been using all clichés in this film another cliché comes along to raise his ugly head
