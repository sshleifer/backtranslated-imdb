!!!! Possible combined spinner !!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of the first GUITY AS SIN, I could not believe it was made in 1993 because it played as the Jugged Edge / Joe Ezrahaus Clone. 80s It starts with a murder and is left for the audience to say, "Is he guilty or innocent and what will he go to bed with his attorney?", But half of the film gets "legal" gets impressive and stalked by his client "type film Which ends in a ridiculous way, and Guilty AS Assin has an even more humorous end in this respect. <br /> <br /> This is a very poor thriller but almost the most It is managed by Sydney Lumet e ineligible thing the same people who brought us the classic court-room drama 12 ANGRY MEN
