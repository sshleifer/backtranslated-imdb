অবশ্যই NOMAD এর মধ্যে সেরা ঘোড়দৌড়ের দৃশ্য, তলোয়ার, এবং চমত্কার ভূদৃশ্য সিনেম্যাটোগ্রাফি রয়েছে যা আপনি সম্ভবত দেখতে পাবেন, কিন্তু এটি এমন নয় যা কোনও চলচ্চিত্রটিকে ভাল করে তোলে। It helps but the story is shining through the top of these things. And that's where the Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is stilted, giving it a sense that a "cool" movie "looks simple" is simply throwing together. Note that most of the characters do not come from any place in the region (and it is clearly evident with names such as Lee and Hernandez). Jugara Kazakh filmmaker and as a culture, we want to raise, but they are good performer / actress used well. <br /> <br /> যুদ্ধবিগ্রহ, ভবিষ্যদ্বাণী, ভ্রাতৃত্ব প্রেম এবং সম্মান, আমাদের "নায়কদের" আলাদা করে এমন প্রেমের আগ্রহ সবই স্পর্শ করেছে তবে এত অল্প প্রভাব এবং স্ক্রীন সময় যে সর্বাধিক দর্শকরা পরবর্তী যুদ্ধের ক্রম, পরবর্তী পদক্ষেপের ঘোড়া দৃশ্য, বা আড়াআড়িের Brush on one side of them for exciting beauty. <br /> <br /> It is notable that Nomad has made significant changes during his filming, especially the director and filmmaker. Ivan Pasan (Director) was replaced by Sergei badrobha, and ulei Stigar (sinemyatographara) was replaced by Dan lastasena. In this case, Lestusen seems to have a good eye in his eye, because his outlook has made us the final cut here. Of course there is a good thing. However, changing instead of Badrov as a director can not be an advertisement choice. From what I see here, focus is on war, not of the people, which I understand, not from Badrov's eyes and Pasar. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that it can be a really fantastic movie, focusing both character and action. Unfortunately, the higher-ups had clearly decided that the system needed to do and inexpensive (intellectually speaking) took ways. <br /> <br /> Although I can not give a positive rating to this movie, it is only worth seeing for amazing cinematography work. But that's all
