I just can not believe the number of people who compare this favorable comparison with the first movie. It took me to leave this comment! This is a clear effort to cash in on the success of the first movie. The conversation is frustrating and something that is not pure or compulsive like the real movie. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, portraying French police and portraying milestones in mile miles from the first film. <<br> <br /> How many drug dealers think that any goods can be seen inside? The comfort that Doyle finds her guy is just unfortunate. All French police were drinking coffee and some real police work until they returned from America in Washington. What a joke Try to find the largest culprits in a foreign city and travel map and some tourists including pamphlets. Poorly <br /> <br /> A real scary soldier, whoever thinks otherwise, is crazy.
