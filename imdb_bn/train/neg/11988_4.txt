It may be so good that I came away from this movie. A boy's story of survival in the thighs, instead of his story story, it fills Columbia Sportswear advertising as a national geographic documentary. <br /> <br /> The image starts with Brian (Jared Rustton). Prepare for a journey by plane to see his father. His mother unfortunately offered him a strange gift of Hitachi (what's wrong with a rubik's cube?), Just tell him how much time he needs it. Once in the air, the pilot (suffered by a Blink-and-Miss-Need Bitto his camio) suffered a severe heart attack, causing Brian helpless to reduce the plane as a lake. Very lucky walk (or rather swim) will find shelter for virtually unscathed, Brian shelter, food and rescue away. Here is the main problem with the movie starts here. By Brian's solo nature, Jared talks very low lines, and so should the film compensate by the tension of each scene. Instead, he wanders around, walks around, with only minimal feelings of danger As a result, the reliability of parents is very dependent on flashbacks of problematic marriage. These scenes not only add more to the story and especially in the story. Even worse, sometimes jared ?? His face covered with mud - which gives an initial shout or two out, which 'predator' conjures unfortunate parallel. Unfortunately, we saw her towel, but it probably helped keep it warm at night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another disappointment is that Pemela plays a fully functional role as Su Martin's mother. Both him and his father had very little effect on the movie. For example, we never saw how Brian disappears, how they react to how they can organize rescue efforts, etc. Instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian started his journey, filmmakers could do it well to search for it.
