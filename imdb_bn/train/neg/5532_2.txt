The rebellion of zombies is not the worst movie I ever seen, but it is far in the list. After the First World War, when a campaign was sent to Cambodia for the discovery of the zombie technique, the member decided to use knowledge for his own evil accessibility. And he is at least the first, successful. The story of a love triangle is complicated. <br /> <br /> It was really a tiring movie, which was terrible that Junk who played terrible and who was not hard to tell. The dialog was a bit good and the plot was incredible (its part of "romance" rather than its zombie part). And when I'm no cinematography student or expert, the camera work does not seem to help much of the film. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen some movies that are bad, please, it is impossible that anyone It's bad, and a bad-it's not-well-the best way.
