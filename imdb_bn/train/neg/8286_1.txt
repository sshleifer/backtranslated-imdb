== The original and movie version contains spoiler from both = <br /> <br /> I note the demo de Paris musical is a huge fan, I read books this summer and I saw the movie today, in the beginning I was hoping to see a good movie especially When I saw the 6.3 IMDB Point. The first scene was good but I was really waiting for the book's theater scene, but it was normal but Esmeralda gringoire kissed me when I used to feel something wrong. I do not like to kiss, even in musical instruments <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Waiting there was not a phoebus? In this movie, he did nothing but some soldier junk, the makers of Cassimodora created love to show around and even rejected Frolo's love. But the note was dum freelow. His thoughts, he struggled in the love of the movie and the love of the people, we can not find anything like what we have received, some villains who are really bad and kill people who conflict with his thinking .. and the fawas does not mention, Without mentioning love, Froolo, Johann (the brother of the brother's brother) does not mention, Esseldler does not mention mother (perhaps it's OK, story Utrati will cut a lot) did not even mention the real story. (Other PS: Froola did not give any ops or anything, he was really interested in Twitter, he tried to make gold, he was trapped between science and religion) <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie at last, If you see it before reading the book, God has mercy on you. You must read the book immediately. <Br /> <br /> This image is worse than the NoÃ«tre Dame 2 animated movie Hanback. Notre Dame de Paris, while watching the musical instrument .. enough said ..
