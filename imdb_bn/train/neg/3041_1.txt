Yes I rated this image as a star horror. Still, it will be my rolling form of Christmas film. This is really good it's bad. It's another Gordon Murray Product (read: bought a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, it spends zero money in English, and in the mid-1960s it appears in Kidy Macintin.) It is embarrassing that I have delayed it so much that life is certain that " Mood enhancers "This will make an even better experience. I have not said before some critics that many critics have already said that a Christmas movie with Marilyn, the Devil, mechanical wind rocks and most kind-hearted actors, I have never seen anyone in the bar. I plan to run it on Holidays with Calis Grammar's "Christmas Carol". A holiday experience really made in hell. Now if I only find "non-good goodnet (sky slides)" in the DVD, then I have a triple feature that can not be beat. You will see this movie It goes so slowly that I do not touch you fast forward button - especially touching two dance routines! This thing is an expensive blue cheese-like guess that you have to overcome the illness to enjoy the experience. Faliz Navidad Ijo!
