I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. The acting was extremely harmful, the plot was boring, and the pace was slow, sooo slowwwwww The whole time I sat in the theater I wanted to finish the movie. Twenty minutes in a movie and I'm praying for a finish. Sure some of the visuals were beautiful, but guys, I really mean! And there was not much music to talk about a man for a man's magical instrument. There music was boring, and annoying. At the time was very loud noise, who were annoying. Mainly this image has stirred me up, and at the same time I got me out. <br /> <br /> I'm happy about it. I need to see "Tideland" and wash out these bad taste in my mouth.
