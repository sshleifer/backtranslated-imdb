Clearly, many people loved it, but I found it infantilising and reasonably invasive codeaswalp, from the disrespect of Jane Russell and especially from Opener's memories (and there is a dive in the discovery later). I will not go to Monroe - he seems to be playing a fool, he is not a fool, but he just gets stupid. When Russell claims that he was not in gymnasium, he is not quite satisfied, rather rather surprisingly otherwise. People are staggeringly uninteresting, as the plot. It is unreasonable, but it is so patchy that if it is a classic, then God will help us all.
