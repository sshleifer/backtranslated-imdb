A man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife dies from an "accident." His new wife is just released from an institution and is very rich! Suddenly, he began to hear a cry and found a pillar across the place. He's going crazy again or the first wife is coming back from the dead? <br /> <br /> I guess you probably did not make it so I will not spell it. I have seen many times on TV in Saturday afternoon as a child. Then back, I loved it but I was young. It's now seeing I understand how bad it is. This is very bad, badly written, very low (even within an hour) and it has a huge cast of five people (being the director)! Still there are some good things about it. <br /> <br /> Music is making itself beautifully atmospheric with great annoying and huge empty houses and ponds. There are some scary moments (I saw the first pillar when I jumped a little) and a little more effective. It's certainly not a good movie ... but it's not a total disaster. Following is a small worship following it. I give it a 2. Also try to avoid version Elite DVD Drive (it has been associated with "Attack of the Giant Laches"). It is shocking shaped with scratches and shaking on all. This does not look bad on TV!
