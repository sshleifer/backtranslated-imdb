I stopped watching this episode because I thought the death of Ana-Lucia and Libyi was unnecessary and really depressed. Then I found out that they kept the Libby pretty close to just die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. I like this event for the first season, but in the second season it certainly decreased, I think Jack and Lock's little religious enemies are annoying. Rodrigues and Waters were the ultimate straw of death! <br /> <br /> I'm giving this episode 4/10, this is the last great series Elias Kingland J after the end of my novel. J. Abrams I hope its series in future will improve this one.
