Cruel intentions are bloody horror, I mean uber-bad. Can not explain how bad the words are, but whatever I do, whatever it is. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentional 2's plot is similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), kicked from a private school, was forced to go to New York. There he decided to make a new beginning and permanent life and just a life. Unfortunately, he wants to pull him down to deal with his sister-in-law Catherine (Emmy Adams). Sebastain Love Daniel (Sarah Thompson), school principal teacher begins to read innocent daughter. Catherine wants to sleep in Sebastien's entire school, which is described as 'whore house'. Catherine wants to take revenge of Cherry (Kerry Lynn Pratt), who insulted him during school assembly. Catherine wanted to make new films as the biggest whore in the school, the sub-plot similar to the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cruel motives, originally a canceled TV show, turned into a prologue. There are many problems with the film. It is poorly written, unfunny, and played badly. Thankfully, the show that never stopped because of Amy Adams, is now a fairly big actress. Although cruel objectives were a concept of reality and could be set in the real world, cruel intentions were set at 2Citcom Land and as described in amazon.co.uk 'A RANDI version saved by the Bell'. The first film contained some dark themes involving the use of sex and drugs, but tried to make it interesting in Cruel Intensions 2, and the film should not have any idea, like Catherine is related to the teacher. Other ideas do not work like a secret society where all popular children can discuss the fall of other students. The film was also the main problem of 15/16 year-old sex. I know that teenagers are sexually, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or on television, it is treated very seriously. Daniel was an impressive place where a horse had a great sense of encouragement to imitate sex behind a horse Cherie (about 14/15 people who are in the film). The idea of ​​turning into a girl in a whore around 14/15 is very wrong with me, and should not be a matter of comedy. The movie jocus is flat, although it is an oral lip that 'when he sees you, it becomes moist', in that case Sebastian first pushed Kadrin to the mud. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in this movie, which I have no time to go to, but I say it will be avoided. See only creative intents, though not classic, still behave well with a decent movie and subject. <br /> <br /> This film is simply a distorted wet dream, where school kids have sexual intercourse with each other.
