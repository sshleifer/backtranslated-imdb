I only got the luxury to watch this movie when I was rather young, remembering that I was trying to remember the movie. However, I can say that it was not funny as a film named Killer Tomato, and the most memorable thing about this film is that talking to the elderly couple about poor teams and watching the scene. On the other hand, the film is actually a scene of small tomatoes and big tomatoes, and the scene of panic and terrifying behavior about what people should do about this kind of movie. However, just having a very stupid premiere and having an interesting theme song does not make a good comedy. The supposed movie is supposed to be a B movie, but not necessarily acceptable, but you should still be entertaining and try not to stretch the gently gentle generation into a full movie. The elderly couple showed the trailers mentioned above and perhaps a person trying to make a big tomato gun was really good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but they are not actually a full movie, and at a weak one.
