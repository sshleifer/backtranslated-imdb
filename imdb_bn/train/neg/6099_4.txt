It was recently less than exciting little movies seen in features in Turner Classic. Although the film popped out due to very intense technology, the film was not only going on and sometimes the plot looked pretty - as it was intended for classroom use and not attracting the attention of the larger audience. A consideration In particular, I really hated how many times the movie was repeated - as when the characters spoke to him, they usually said "Clara Burton" instead of "mam", "miss burton" or "clara". Plus, a sick confederate soldier said that he was "Johnny Reb, a confederate rebel, ..." - almost like he was a cartoon character from Moorejo Mojo from Powerpuff Girls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yep - it's under that beard him.
