Well, think, Mukuo must accept the truth: I like parody of such a cheap, happy 70. The idea that the huge moon of the killer tomatoes destroy the United States is a great idea, and in spite of this, the movie provides some modest chocolates, giving horrific extra-spectroscopic views away from the awful tomatoes. Along with The Kentucky Fried Movie, this film is one of Spuff's earlier efforts, which became so popular in the 80's and 90's, especially for the aviation! This one, like moost spoofs, is quite poor. Many attempts of humor will be frustrating, and many will cry. But due to the harmful tomatoes' hoard, objectionable "young love" song, and extraordinary helicopter crash scenes, killer tomato attacks offer some of the products, although it is largely due to wrong reasons. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie ... and that's OK, it's hard to explain. Tomato 2 Muawer films, and a return in a cartoon series as enough people will have to enjoy it! Large part of time away from tomatoes is pretty dull. And those 70 dresses thrust, buddy !! ; = 8) This tomato is boiled and sugary, but a shiny or two price; MooCow grab a pizza and say pop in tomatoes !! : ??
