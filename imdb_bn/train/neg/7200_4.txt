I really wanted to like this movie - location shots were mostly painted in Pittsburgh and there were some wonderful trailers for photography. But, even for a painted cartoon, it was a really badly created movie. Both of the continuity and pacing were simply terrible. The best bits of the movie are in the end credits, so it stops it (almost) at the end (though, it takes seamlessly for the last half-hour or more). <br /> <br /> When a movie is played by Andy Dick, you know there is a problem ...
