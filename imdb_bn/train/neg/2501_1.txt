I saw another night on TV ?? Or rather I keep an eye on the competition to monitor the competition in any other channel, when I do not see anymore. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not "bad so good" flat out just bad. How did it get financed? Who was this a good idea? One of my actors has auditioned the friend and he has been told that he was not good enough for a bad guy, but I think his meaning was "Save yourself and run away from this steam follower of @ # $%." I've been given the option to cast the rest of the bet. The fair American actors were difficult to judge because of the horrific American ascents. Shooting was dullllllllllllll The action was weird and stilted. The dialog was unknown. The far saddest thing was to ship. In real life, the interiors ferry is a shake boat and the film does not shrink well. It tries an impossible trick to look like a new crew linear, which brings tensile bits covered around the harmful election, I'm not your child, they can explain the script or even celebrate inhalation. Fool, fool, fool Do not watch this movie, not even joke.
