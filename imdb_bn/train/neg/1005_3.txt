When you go to an open air film on a summer summer night, you are not usually taking care of the movie! The Edison singers-who-be-to-be-actors and again have started really well with some of the great efforts of the great Morgan Freeman ... (In a film, it usually starts to catch viewers, complete, somewhat annoying yet the middle story story is more about characters and action Less about, working, and the third part is really good so you can remember the movie ...) when you're 30 The police officer saw that a man behind a vehicle armed with guns could be shot and killed, but when he killed everyone he still failed to hit him (but 3) and then the man threw out the flames (to kill the remaining 3 ), You realize that the sky filled with Greek summer stars are so confusing by such a movie!
