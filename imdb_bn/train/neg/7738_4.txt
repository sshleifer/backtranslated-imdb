The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, okay. If there is anything else in the theater, it will be kept away. Sad, fast and furious 2 also stunk, but I'd rather see than FF 2. :) If you have an idol for Harrison Ford or other young punk but this will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally, I'll wait for the HBO or Blockbuster.
