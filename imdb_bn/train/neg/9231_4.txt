I thought going to be the next thought I went to this movie, but left feeling left. Humor was weak and the letters were fairly flat. It does not seem to be bad at all, the idea of ​​the grocery store dating service seems to be very fertile, but director Cliveck focused on "save the evil-and-pop store from the evil corporation." I think if he gets stuck with a dating service plot, he will come out with more memorable movies. Now, to judge the film, I came from Rochester area and represented Westster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (Clarke) paid tribute to his city here. Webster, NY checkout is Red Bank, NJ Clarks. Thoroughly throw a date of director Nick Tahu Trust me, as far as Rochester has to work, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky to see this film in Little In Rochester so that everyone knew that the tears of the cities rose up and praised them.
