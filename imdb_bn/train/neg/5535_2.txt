I think some big fails may be annoying. Worse than the bad boring is actually better. There is no breath in these things. It has interesting events to take in Cambodia. In Cambodia, 30 Americans have been created. Nevertheless, there is little trouble to find the conflict. Even the movement of the soldiers is a little confusing. What stops a pounding stags it's love story. Why are not those two guys transfixed so completely on the dippy blonde I transdixed? I thought he would use his dead body (as they are) and he would forget all of them. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcompass, where one of the main characters follows the Cambodian pastor to reach the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) can explain how to make people jumbo. I thought they would not be there. One man took two steps. He stopped. She looks around The other guy hides behind some columns. He took two steps. He stopped. She looks around The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is a short movie. Then there are bad acting and infiltrated dialogue. It is actually patience for B movies. This one is incredible. However, a more appropriate title will be rebuffed hypnotized.
