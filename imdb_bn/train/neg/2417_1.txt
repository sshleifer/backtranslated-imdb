It's the worst thing I've ever spent without any doubt. I feel dirty to rent this movie and to actually see it pay. This does not even have to rate the trash No no This is a juice that is collected after an unusually humid summer, especially under the rare industrial dumpertorrhoe surrounding. Trash to reduce trash everywhere. It was so bad that I thought I wanted to register with IMDB and warned my colleague. This luvahire character claims this movie is great. One reality will be to question his perception. I take some comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a great job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director sees his audience winning every sentence spoken by crinking and Ricky, or at the moment it explodes in uncontrolled laughter, most of the directors want more feedback from their audience, but yes; Ricky did a great job. <br /> <br /> "I am going to take theater in my school as an aspiring actor and I had to make a game where I used to cry and was not easy to be emotional in the scene. I give the props to the actors who will make a mental scene and It can pull off. <br /> <br /> I will certainly give the props to actors who can pull progressive scenes. Luvahire, if you think this chuckleheads pulled it off You may want to see another line of friends, however, you can help you to cry, see only the movie Hector, Hector. Hector. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I continue to continue to be very annoying. I will now hold my associate Mr. Bangabandhu. <br /> <br /> Ha ha ha! If you have continued to read this far, I have approved that you have already seen the movie and you are now looking for two things in this comment: 1) Reduce extra chaos of what you agree to Exceptional Poor Movies 2) Reversing the extra chaos of what you think is a good filming effort that needs to be resisted against such stupid scams like me. If you want to help express your annoying or ammunition to say anything good, it will only disappoint you - so I assure you that there is little possibility of such frustration. Other negative comments on IMDB here have already defined the film's special failure (such as acting, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), but these flaws can be easily, in themselves, and forgiven. For some people these elements will be rented if a film entitled "Load Dead Hood" is required. However, the failure of "Hood" to make a lot of promise of its name was its failure. The "Living Dead Hood" stopped the shelfie in the video store with the creators of a one-fishing device, and a brutally creative assassination. Here's the chance to combine with real life in Gaito with Chasey Gore of the jambi film, for the gangsta-thug jabibis bombings during the innocent life, Rockin 'du-rages, Andy Pump Drivin' their tricked out road is very mortal po-jai. The two style mix can be pleasing. Instead, the film supplies lines to the middle school kids who are acting more horror than they are watching, but can not understand. To avoid the feeling of betrayal in part of their video rental audience, I suggest that the Queiroz brothers again publish the movie with the following new titles: "Living Dead of Hood: What's the Hood Video That We Shot On Us We Yesterday a weekend camcorder with some friends Because we were bored ". Or maybe they could release it as a documentary. "The Day Creator's Death: Despite a lack of relationship with a large motion picture studio, low budget films investigate how intelligent or original thinking can be totally deprived." <br /> <br /> The potential tenant whose interest was not scratched, the blogger behind the video should find: "The quiroz Brothers again proves that you can not easily see what you are doing very interesting."
