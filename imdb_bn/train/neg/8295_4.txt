I tend to love character-driven films. I think Hope Davis works consistently well, so I had high hopes for this movie. These hopes soon dashed. <br /> <br /> The main error of this movie is the direction There are a lot of scenes that reckless order. Dennis Levi uses the character of the film Campbell Scott as a changed ego of character. It does not work for me. It worked as well as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with the plot too. The movie's characters travel and it's important to different places where they start. I do not think the characters in the picture have increased in character. Finally, the edit was not done well. There was a very big piece in the middle of the movie which was very annoying. Except for acting which was consistently firm, the film failed in almost every aspect of the movie.
