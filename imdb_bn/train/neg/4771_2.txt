Do not waste your time in this picture. It might be good, but the last one I've ever seen is the lamest one. How could I figure out how this person was involved in the creation of this picture, thinking, "Yes, now it's over!" And it patted themselves behind me. I thought that they went out of the way! They create final scenes for a cool twist, but instead let the whole build up flat on their face. When the last shot became black and I started the credit music, I was shocked - I could not believe what I saw and someone could finish it. Anyone can do this with the film again to rewrite the best thing and give it some substance. Frankly, I really love anyone who comes home from this room, I want to face them - WTF ?? !!!!
