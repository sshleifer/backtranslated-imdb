How does the garbage like Mad Cow and this Fithy Earth mean when Angels, Duncan and Theo were totally ignored after a few days of writing? I had to sit through another British movie * which poked my head, because why did it get a single penny? Some people might claim that Dead Babbies are based on a superb novel because it is in a built-in market, but this film has been adapted from both the novels of the Earth and MAD COWS and they were unreasonable to sit side by side. <br /> <br /> I read the summary of this plot where a section of high class races goes to a remote palace where they are driven by an internet culture but honestly do not publish the story and no one really hopes on Friday. During the 90-95% of the running time on dining acceptance and sexual conversation, we meet with Shing, desperately frustrated. And they are very hateful characters. None of them likes in any way and within a few minutes you will get nostalgic for Stalin, Mao and Pollock, which hopefully that when someone starts a communist democide, they will succeed in creating proportional utopia. This film will signal the end of the bourgeoisie that the hateful characters of this film can only be welcomed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More things connect with the characters to spoil. There is no doubt that we will have to hurt and we will cry and cry, "O my God, will he fail to realize that he is a wonderful director like our bamboo with his amazing artistic technique and only a vague request that gives God a talent" . I'm sure most people shouted, "How have my projects stopped?" Or "what was the last half hour of this fragmented piece of WTF?" The original source claims to be novel impossible, and it makes the film obsolete. <br /> <br /> * I know IMDB classes as American movies, but DID BBS styles and flaws are uniquely British. Americans may think they found something difficult with Bush, but we got Tony Blair, dead babies, mad cousins ​​and not mentioning this famous world. In the 21st century, everyone is not ashamed to be British
