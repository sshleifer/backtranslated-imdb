At the end of "Dragon Heat", I wondered why I was sitting on the whole thing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But I was never disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee John Wong, Ringo Lam and Cori Eunen's favorite candle can not be retained. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most annoying-directed films ever seen. Lee has unveiled so many packs in his visual style - and I use this term incredibly consistently - he fills the film completely with lazy black-white rock, frame fridge, slow motion, speed, and other visual flaws. I think he made it for a good story or lack of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are not something special and play something like hopped-up music videos without something else. There is little to care for any character - two of which are supposedly professional sniper, who could not hit the side of a barn from the inner side! - Those who have some transactions with some of the most fascinating conversations among one of these Hong Kong workers. <br /> <br /> The plot is free from a packing and turning from the initial setup. Predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to remember the stories behind the characters without getting it for the first time. It is wildly annoying and destructive of amateur writing and filmmaking and the content of Samo Hong, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although, to be extraordinary, I have not had trouble remembering Bihar in a good film directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you really are in the mood of great Hong Kong activist, you are very good at stopping some of the public stops - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Billed" 1992, Ringo Lam's "City On Fire "(1987) - which stole for Quantin Tarantino's" Reservoir Dogs "(1992) - or his" Point Blank "remake (1967)," Flower Context "(1992). Or, even see Yuan's "So Close" (2002), it's a very entertaining, yet diverse, poparoon flick. And always the fearful French police activist, "The Nest" (2002). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < They have the character that we care about and the order of the funeral functions <br /> <br /> "On the other hand," Dragon Heat "is very scary. The problem is that Lee did not do bad work, he made a dull.
