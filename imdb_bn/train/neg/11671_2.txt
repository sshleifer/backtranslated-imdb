I want to say - it's a stinker! (I gave it a rating 2) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie There is no mystery, no deep, shocking secret information is released, there is no threat to the love of the heroine. Some disagreements, raises a little bit of voice - that's quite a lot. The mystery is nothing that can happen to anyone - the last "secret" published in this movie is completely predictable by that point. <br /> <br /> The name of the plot is revolving around a young girl named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who draws a series of serial panels in a huge palace by a huge, rich, old widow, and a growing mother / Female type is rented for the relation of old lady craves with her <br /> <br /> It turns the old woman's daughter, Cassandra, dead. You can mostly piece together pieces. <br /> <br /> Even the mysterious person's view of annoying our heroin does not move at that point where you will not be afraid for his safety. Why he is still hanging for several years after the death of Kashandra. <br /> <br /> There is only one servant in this huge palace, a trusted Butler who believes to do everything. Cooking, cleaning, serving food, door answering etc. Apparently everything is close to the door as well - as one of the characters can just walk in a room where there is faith. <br /> <br /> there is nothing that you can hold your chair arms and move towards the edge of your seat, because there is no "mounting" pull in this movie - only modest, unfortunate statement that can expire from time to time. . <br /> <br />
