I do not really know where to start. The acting of this movie was really terrible, I can not remember many actors in a film that I can not seem to do. Just acting was not bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well <br /> <br /> then there is action. I believe that even children know that blood is involved when someone shoots. But when someone shoots Sankheed in the bar (!!), there is no blood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this image will be number 1 in 100 of the following without doubt.
