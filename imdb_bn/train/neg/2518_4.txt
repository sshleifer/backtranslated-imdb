Think of "power rangers" as a bold version of a children's shoe and you have got this movie "RobotJox" since 1990. A length where you fight with giant robots, two men enter that area and anyone who comes out of the country. The robot looks like a slightly better version than the huge and shown shows, mainly because it is not less colorful but it is not good to see if this movie is not good. I remember these two robots fights, one that ended badly and ended the final showdown. A travesty is way to part in a twist as a traitor is revealed, but ultimately the plot is that you are going to stop with you any time after completing the picture. It looks like these deadly toys, but it's a little fun to see. This movie will create a few other movies with the same plot devices as giant robots and tournaments. So it's worth checking out once, but it's probably not that much.
