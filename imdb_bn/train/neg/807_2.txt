I did not expect much from this TV movie. For any TBS movie of Antonio Sabota Junior, you have to set fewer bars than midget Limbo. Yet it became frustrating, even failing to be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, each person had a dozen films and TV shows from the TV show in a script that deals with a big business plot and cuts and sticks them, he goes back and says, "I have finished". It is obliged to see all cliche, all predictable, and even worse, the performers look like they are taken seriously, (even when the plot is rude to develop). <br /> <br /> Please give yourself a favor. See "X-files" if you are in the pononia mood. They handle it well. Also, just know that anyone is sitting through "deadly errors".
