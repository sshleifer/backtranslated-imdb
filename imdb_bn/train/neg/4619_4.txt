Let me first love the state language and civil war stories. I consider John Ford as an excellent director. John Wayne and William Holden have the same high feelings about their acting abilities. <br /> <br /> I can not remember watching this film for the first time in 1959. I can not remember. Last night I saw it for the first time then <br /> <br /> According to my 4 rating, someone can say that I do not like the movie. <br /> <br /> I will try to fix some of his errors now. <br /> The Screenplay by Harold Sinclair, Writes John Lee Mahin, was a very gifted author and wrote many fine scripts, this script has been poorly written and poorly researched. Anderson denies the worst case of prison, the film is not going on in Andersonville. They also used rifles that were not used. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been filming for more than 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He will be sick while making this. His usual style was missing. It may have been southern and eastern films and not in the Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> was often the stock company of the players used in all of his films, most of the time was missing at this time. At this time only minor cobras, Big Hoot Gibson and Kane Curtis have played the role, and of course Anna has a small role. There were no known faces except 3. (See below) Mr. Ford's stock company made many of its movies classic; <br /> <br /> Now we've come to the main star John Wayne and William Holden. Duke must be sick, he seemed to find the place here. This sort of role usually fit perfectly in its style, he was just adequate here. William Holden did what he could, but he was generally as good as he was. <br /> <br /> There was a need to be an actress in this movie. Here's his first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very nice person, but not really actress, he still plays the role of television. Please tell me and he has a long career, more based on his appearance than his acting talent. Casseo Tennis star Altaia Gibson, like Mrs. Towers Das. I am glad he is stuck in tennis. <br /> <br /> The remaining production credits were far more than the usual high standard of other John Ford movies. Some military type songs are supposedly done by March Caviar, not all good. The action scenes were good but came to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDB 4 (out of 10)
