I picked the time changer because it was like a pretty low budget CC time travel movie and I was in a mood to do something like that. I think the description was to do with some biblical elements and time travel, but I did not expect a fundamentalist Christian film! <br /> <br /> This film had special effects and an attractive compound that could move and it was much more interesting than the end. Our hero, who was a Bible Professor in the 1890s, eventually went ahead in the 2000s and discovered that modern life is filled with the effects of evil - Jesus is not available anywhere. This wonderful technical feat is accomplished with the help of a fellow Bible teacher, anyhow managed to find effective HGH-Wales-Style Time Machine. The film started losing some credibility at this time, which is unfortunate because this movie is very quick. Before that (or perhaps not remember anything immediately after), our hero Professor showed what he was seeing like science science, where he claimed that scientific research could only be verified if it matched the biblical point of view. It should be obvious to somebody that this scientific method is not clear, but filmmakers come to present such an idea that science supports their benefit and is effective only if it is not useful otherwise. <br /> <br /> In any case, that belief is perfectly legitimate and intelligent in relation to the character. So, if we accept the truth of life for these Bible professors, perhaps the professor who went and discovered the time machine was not very convinced because I do not think there is any evidence (and no proposal) during the time of physics travel to the Bible . So there is a problem with mixed messages and credentials immediately, but do not remember ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> case. It was right that it was not pinned for a correct year (like the character is reading a newspaper date itself, a car snaps a horn, and it scares without ending the date: it is only two thousand and .. * * honk *). Some shocks went a bit longer, though. For example, before the car arrived, it was one of them and about two days later she was invited to a church movie night and flew to a van. He threw the head out of the window like a dog, scared headlights and starting engines etc. He stayed for a few days at this point and it seems to be quite busy. Traffic In any case, it's easy to ignore. The rest of the technology was completed well - especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he did not even realize that he saw a child and used it remotely. Unfortunately, our hero predicts that he preaches completely from everyone, just as he is from the past and as an ancient authority over all life and religion. Eventually he took a brief moment in the spotlight where he went to the church where he went on to explain the concept of Christianity to him in his long-standing commentary for consideration being increasingly and insightful, but most of the same. Some husbands in the church begin to get a fun feeling about this man (go to the picture) and investigate his name. They finally decided that he was impersonating a time traveler or this long dead Bible professor and decided to find out what it is. The film frames these unbelievers as bad people to be suspects. <br /> <br /> Just before returning to his own time, he faces two men. To try to avoid being arrested or stuck, he often breaks madness and discipline so that he is coming and how he is a prophet, so that they listen to him. Just in time, he heard the rapture he heard so much if he is far away blurred and the husband is one wonder. <br /> <br /> The irony is that this essentially became a self-proclaimed professor (meaning) and most probably false) to ask the Prophet that idleness was near and he was sent by his fellow biblical professor and that he was a god He had not given the knowledge (which was said or even indicated). <br /> <br /> I understand that, the publication claims that the end time is only to know God and at the end of the film, we try to send a Bible to the inventor Professor (and fail) in the future. The first 2080, then 2070, etc. fades out as the scene. Obviously he is trying to determine the exact date of the last time - which he can not know! Basically, the entire film of the film itself is canceled because it is so strong on their religious beliefs and to know just how much God knows, it means that the first time can not be the machine at any time, because then mankind can find something that only know God Should! The foundation of the whole movie is broken and the whole thing is basically worthless because it ultimately reduces its credibility.
