Although this image appeared as the main method of making the film Dougme and before the digital winner - before the strike. You get points. The masterpiece of 1991 apparently hoped for those developments. Corin Nemec is just outstanding as Ne'er is not the best writer and narrator. Slow motion, but neatly so, because cinematography is so beautiful. Record it on TV the next time, because I guarantee you will not see a Nostalgia Rip Off-TV-TV movie. Direct-to-video is never good!
