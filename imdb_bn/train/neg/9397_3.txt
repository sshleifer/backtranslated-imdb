কিছুদিন আগে স্থানীয় স্টেশনে মধ্যরাতের পরে চলমান "ক্লিফহঞ্জার থিয়েটার" তে কিশোরী হিসাবে আমি আরএমএফটিএমের বেশিরভাগ পর্ব দেখেছি, এবং তারপরে আবার যখন মিস্ট্রি সায়েন্স থিয়েটারটি 90 এর দশকের প্রথম দিকে এটির উপর পড়েছিল। It has not been the kind of time. /> <br /> I have to give a special allowance for the effects <br May, which was the dominant low-budget 50's serial number (IMO Commando Cody flying scenes of his TV show, George Reeves / was better than Superman). And I can create an eaves, "acting", and allowances for the war in the Corridor. Without the guy that the moon plays the ruler ruler. She is incredibly miscast. He does not look like a colleague and a despotic ruler, when he sees and works like a colleague comes to fix your plumbing. Even the voice work is dayalagatio - everyone does their thinking traps, such as "worried" or "antarnihitakarana" at any time or the time constant. As everyone does it, the viewers find it immersed after a while and even until my modern sensitivity, it does not bother much. <br /> <br /> Writing and plot really irritates me. I am the moon, rocket ships, or baking soda, or "Up / Down" and "fast / slow" labeled control a flying suit terrible about not talking about the weather. I end up every section that the cliffhangers resolution is not bothered by the cheesiness of the resolution. I'm talking about that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no combination memory. And since that's a dialogue clip along an Express Train, the plot goes through again and again through the same speed. /> <br /> To dig it <br: Commando Cody and his flock in a secret high-tech science lab, which is a shocking fraud against the alien invasion of Earth (or at least the United States) the protection of the accused. But there are no guards or security checkpoints in his office. They do not even have lock in front door. So the bad guys walk in the right direction and come out of Cody and his staff ... not once (perhaps understandable) but repeatedly. They even tried his second second attempt to kidnap his female assistant. And they do not get any smart. আমার বিন্দু আরও প্রমাণ করার জন্য, আমাকে বোঝাতে দেয় যে কোডি তার উড়ন্ত স্যুটটিতে যেভাবে লাফিয়ে উঠেছে এবং কষ্টের দিকে ঘুরে বেড়ায় এবং আসলে কাউকে ধরতে সফল হয় না। He over and over and this works. His ship flies to the Kodi moon (the female assistant comes to cook), for about 30 seconds and immediately returns and comes back. Cody nuclear rays take up one of the guns ... and quickly lose the bad guys because it can not get bored for locking. <br /> <br /> If you think that Cody's efforts to protect the United States from the moon were so important, then he could ask some soldiers to join the carbine, some helicopters and a few soldiers with the tank. Instead of having two people behind him, local police always work. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like another episode of "gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It's rather harder than the stomach. I am grateful that the manufacturers were restricted to the opportunity of their story by budget and time constraints ... and I am grateful that the codei is actually a reasonably difficult ombre (though he may lose his half box office). But I can not just shout "Door! When the gangsters only walk in their lab or try to blow up the ship and there is no security on the landing site ... even without fence! <br /> <br /> Still, Okay, I saw three republic serials, "Phantom Cripps" was a good plot and more of the "Undersea Kingdom" environment (hah!) And "radar men" Good hero, but it's a perfect time to lose. <br /> <br /> BTW ... Why are "radar" men? They do not use radar, they use atomic rays guns. "Title: From the Moon to the Nuclear Raid Gun Men" Should not be?
