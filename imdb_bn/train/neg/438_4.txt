This is a "mathematician" horror film. It is made up of 4 short stories from Robert Bloch's fiction (who wrote for the strange telescope and was a personal friend on the love of the HP, but it is famous for the original story "Psycho"). The quality of the story was very disrespectful and I was not too scary or horrible. It would be good to do it as a comedy like "comedy comedy". Only the last 4 stories were made in a ridiculous way and it is probably the best (one with Ingrid Pitt). I saw some of the Amicus scriptures and my time was really valuable to Freddie Francis' "Tales of the Crypt". Anthology styles work well for producers, because it means they can rent a bunch of "big names", they can recruit or recruit them for a week, and then bring the next big name. So you pay the movie star for 6 weeks but get 5 or 6 different names in the market. But it's very sad for the audience, because the audience wants to see some scenes with Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. Instead they are stuck in these vignettes by themselves. So, bring them together once. <br /> <br /> In the first story, Angel Eliot, who acts as a terrorist by his own character, does a really commendable job to try to bring glory to his stupid role. . Unfortunately the actor who played the Dominion, the source of fear, Tom Adams, simply looks vague that destroys any possible horror. However, if you want to laugh then there are some ridiculous things, like Dominic Elliott is like a scene that kills psychiatrists. This is a patent scene where the killer slips behind the victim but no one is watching, so the whole audience shouted, "Look at you!" The second story is one with Peter Cushing. God loves that I am so much people Many of his movies are very bad, like this one, quite a lot stink. In the story, he seems to be moving away for long lost love and he saw his candle in a wax museum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you were to laugh again, this bit could have been fun. But instead when we push the child, he becomes scared and surprised when he was surprised. Actress, Cloe Franks, though it was quite good for the "bad seed" role. <br /> <br /> The last story is absolutely ridiculous ... Ingrid Pitt played an actress and John Parroft acted an actor who accidentally played a vampire in Cape that turned him into a real vampire. All the stories that have to offer. I was surprised how bad English Pitt was in English, I guess he was dubbed in some other films. <br /> <br /> No memorable movie or I would recommend but none of the awful completists.
