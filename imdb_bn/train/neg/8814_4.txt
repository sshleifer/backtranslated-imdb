This movie is not interesting except the first ten minutes. Speeding and editing is a perfect role in a ensemble piece, even better than speaking to Gosford Park. Then it undoubtedly diminishes the focus gradually and begins to resemble a traditional French film that starts only to get the focus back on the love relationship between Antonin (Depardieu) and Seychel (Denweiv). In the middle there are many stories and loose last stories, many threads have not started. <br /> <br /> ******* The relationship between Antonio and Seychelle, the main story of Spiere's Avatar. Despite the rebuilding and installation of Moroccan home, he was loyal to her after her relationship with her many years ago. As a builder he now rebuilt his life and restored him with a mask of marriage in Sesame. After this done, he was buried after a panic accident (literally) and became a Comatose. He has awakened the old picture by suggesting that he has met with the past and can start his life together again. ******* The end of the spinners <br /> <br /> It is not clear whether this director wants to see us because there are so many stories: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, often about the overthrow of Radio Iraq's regime Broadcast Seychel's child bites with biceps and dogs (loyalty) when he fills her lover, and the woman she lives on seems to be sick (that?). Her sister enters the relationship with traditional Islamist, and Seshi's husband. It portrays Moroccan as unnecessary retreat, although in spite of all the buildings, a strange colonial aspect that glorifies the past. It pursues Islam and demonstrates the tendency of extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end, it can be best described as adding a Koller locale and Layout Dilde L. <br /> <br /> Daneuve and Depardieu are excellent. They are so familiar with this material that they are able to spin extra in each scene: a eyebrow, body language, distorting pride, illogical behavior The film is frustrating and only guarantees the limited role of French film worldwide. Of course, with some significant exceptions.
