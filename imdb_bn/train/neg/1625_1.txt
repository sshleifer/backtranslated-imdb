When I was in school, I made a movie about the couple around the tree, and I realized in half that it was not just a failed aesthetic technique, but a cliche of the Canadian film: the sodenist's song is empty, married to a metaphor-marriage - a burden on social commentary stabs But whatever the failure of my own movie, it is good to see ... this ... thing. For one thing, I ran 85 minutes in my 20 minutes and had more content: here four points for big bit minutes four, five, six minutes. The male leadership is simply incredible, and the dramatic-class Improv explosions between the philosophical insights of jumping out loud, and lots of space and lots of space to hate us. The confession is that if he is not such a ** hole then the third task will become less sense, because couples can enjoy 'exploitation' pricing remotely and completely inappropriately. But it does not make it easy to see the "Please" Caged Crump Womer while closing until it runs the magazine. Returning what I said about the Ottoman sister, at least she had the courage of her own ill-treatment: this film is the worst Canadian film ever of all time. At least, I really hope so.
