Well, all of this movie has been spoken and while writing reviews I hate it where everyone else has already said what they say. But the thing is, I have seen movies and I am working to write reviews on the movies I have seen. So, I have to write something <br /> <br /> Acting fool. It's really stupid how the news anchor shows its sadness towards the plane crash. Professional Assistant who is nice and nour though comes to take care of the child. Three main killings in the movie are so weak that you are so stupid about the creator of this movie. They do not realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. We do not see how Granpa dies. The dentist and his assistant seem to be deserving of me, you are not sympathetic to them. And in the garage uncle uncle died in a way that could work better. We just hear him scream and we see nothing!
