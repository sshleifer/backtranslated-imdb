Another double silent on a disc from Warner Home Video and a very good part of two movies is Rocco's Greatest 1950 Thriller "Where Danger Loves". It's a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchem, Faith Domerg and Cloud Renaissance. The picture of the black and white picture by Nicholas Musuraq was firmly directed by John Farrow. "Where is Danzer Lives", a main example of the silent style of creating the picture and it will always be remembered for Hollywood's past insatiable craftsmanship - (see my full review). Unfortunately, the above praise can be applied to the second movie of the disc, the unstable MGM 1949 Steiner Tension! This film, directed by Bad Writing (Alan Rivkin) and John Berry, is full of ridiculous character and unlikely. Impossible relationship between gentle man-made and sharp pharmacists - acting brilliantly by Richard Bisihart - and his very wonderful wife (an invisible Audrey Tutter) is completely impossible and disrespectful (how he guesses together at first in the world). Then when he "vaguely" one of his players (Lloyd Goff) called him for our naughty pharmacist, with his new lucky luck, bright and lunar, plots revenge and attempt to kill Gough but in the last minute hen The person killed anyway and our pharmacist was immediately suspected by Homicide detective Barry Sullivan (another Bland performance). Then who killed him? Well, at this stage of the film, you can not really care less because it is so severely executed and ridiculous by director Berry. Mr. Berry Pesing has no idea, and even styling of the item, and even unable to do the injection. He can not keep the camera in front, which will stop you from stopping! The only tennis in this movie is in the rubber band, which is limited to the fingers of Barry Sullivan and is snapped because he gave the opening of the film. So much for that! The most unfortunate effort! C'est La Vie! The best thing about this Turkish is a great morale chromatography of Harry St√§delling, which is an effective score of young Underworld and the first dramatic appearance of beautiful Saeed Charis. Get her dancing shoes. Hey! He could have saved the picture, he gave us a few steps and a few pirouets! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The disc is alone for the Archaeo Mitum Classic!
