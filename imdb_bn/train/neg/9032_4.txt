I did not understand Garbo's appeal. He always came across throughout his films, that could not be all that lucrative, and that boring voice that could drown in the Tuba section. She was a very limited actress, such as Gloria Swanson, in the silent era, much better left. This is his last film, his performance is very average and even unassured. She works hard but it does not matter because the script is worse than her performance. <br /> <br /> One sculptor romcom which is never trustworthy and will never leave the ground (though Melvin Douglas is run, Skying views get airborne, which is really the only ridiculous thing here.) <br /> <br /> But in almost every section the script failed, in which every actor was destroyed. Douglas and Garbo wrote enough chemistry, but this is not a place in NeoTacqua, which I think is very impressive.
