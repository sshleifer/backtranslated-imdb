I want to say that even though this film was Friday 13 th / i was a whole of a plot to steal from Friday movies, but this movie was not bad. Most of the holer movies were released recently, it was not really bad. Although the killings were sometimes very imaginative, in most cases, the original. Cast was moderate, which could be expected from low budget features, but Studio Artisan / Lions Gate is much better than what it has proposed. My only real accusation was not due to the film budget, which should be short, it was "thick". I'm sorry but this picture is bad for me. The end was just stupid and tacked. Earlier I was a little bored, but I actually enjoyed it. 4/10
