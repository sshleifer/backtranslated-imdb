I saw many pictures of Guy Madden and most of them liked, but this literally gave me headache. John Gourdeck's edit is very unbeatable, and in addition to a tour-de-force sequence, except to show a line of heads to look at an object, the actors do not interfere with the ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> Another disgusting thing about this picture was that it appeared to be more cruel than Madden's earlier works - though his films always have dark elements, but his sympathy towards his characters gave these films a sense of humanity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, its facial expression is very good.
