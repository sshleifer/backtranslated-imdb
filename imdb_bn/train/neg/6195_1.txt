Badly made The film was nothing short of uninterrupted silence as the director of horror and appearance that appeared somewhere hesitated. This film is considered for a prize at the Gijon Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came out of the theater had the same opinion - what was the point of creating the film? Iraq's references were weird or not thought out properly. I am surprised that this film has been released - very, very frustrating and my time wasted Sorry, terrible negative reviews but hopefully prevent some people from doing the same mistake. We did not have any questions or questions at the end of the movie - it could be interesting now.
