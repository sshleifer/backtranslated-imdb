Sitting in the bachelor ("Love Wings") to see the 14th season, I knew I would be for "attractive" time. In the last few months I saw the passage of the bachelor; An episode or two observer and the next three or so missing. I have found that Bachelor is often objectionable and curious, although there is a lack of quality and morality. <br /> <br /> Jack's 31-year-old commercial pilot depicts the journey of Dallas in "Love Wings" , Texas, find true love, can find a season-long reality-drama dating show as a love as true. Jake met 25 beautiful girls all over the country. He started to learn a bit of them, but it is mostly sponsor; How well do you know someone in some 5-minute conversation? Jake tries to introduce her true motivation very little, at least to the audience. He noticed that he just does not want love or good time, but he wants a drunk or a wife. We can only assume that he made it clear to women in this competition. If this is the case, it can explain the actions of some women, some women. Women are super competitive. Although they still do not know Jack, they can still win it without any price. <br /> <br /> Women were not rivals, but they were also confident and intelligent. Threats, backstabbing, and warning "see!" All shows that these women were not there for a good time. Jake pointed out that he is not just for sex appeal, but looking for "a connection". However, the girls pulled out all the stops for trying to impress Jakes with sexual appeal. They reached the palace in skimpy dresses ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> One girl, Chaney, mentioned that Jake was a "good man", whom she could be a "naughty girl". He said that Jake could have her "runway any time". The girl got fax from the girls for her provocative statement, which took them under these circumstances. <br /> <br /> So, a reality dating ceremony can not be bad, is not it? In addition to the obvious issues of sex-driven attraction, there are other problems in killing these other objectionable shows. This is the right way to find a partner in the future; Vying for someone's attention by flaunting yourself to the extreme proportion? Unfortunately, America has reduced dating in these days: joy and sex without commitment and little happiness next to it. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment that many girls bind themselves to Jake. Especially some girls started to get too attached. One girl said, "If I do not get the first impression, then it will kill me!" As mentioned earlier, they still can not recognize him and he was talking about a certain rose, to refrain from excluding one in only 15 roses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some things with Jake attachment. It is very noticeable to other girls. After a special mical explosion, Vienna firmly said Michelle had "a psychological breakdown and we are here for only one hour." Michelle got the last roses in the evening before evening ?? Missing the narrowest ?? And it was extremely emotional about me. Other girls said it was easy to laugh. Another girl also started crying, but because it was cut off. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and it was closed from there ?? Reality tv It shows our entertainment interests as a country; If we do not see the shows and give them a good rating then the networks will not continue to do so. The only logical conclusion that can be dragged is that America is hooked enough. One thing is obvious: America (in general) loves the reality TV and its next traping. <br /> <br /> I want to ask: Why do we like reality TV? What about us about it? Is it because we have seen similarities in our own lives, or are we sure that we are more stable and less vulnerable than others? Whatever it attracts us, we should be careful about our media and entertainment that we can fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad; However, I'm saying that we have to evaluate each of us. <br /> <br /> Episode used for criticism: session premiere and episode 2.
