After a series of power-shortage in a remote island zoo, the Stertooth tigers with genetically engineered people lie on the loose and runaway inhabitants of the island. Man, the scientific channel has created some bad "real" movies, but I think it might be the worst of them! This badly written and operated "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientist who thinks of "costly damage" to those killed by the monsters, the characters are walking alone dark halways, brain-dead tin characters which only work on the film A horrible death is killed, etc.), and, vaguely, there is no doubt. Special effects fell? The puppet heads are sturdy enough to look like plush dolls, but CGI ?? in the intimateities of the title animals. Which shows "life-like" to computer-generated dinosaurs to "walk with dinosaurs". Comparing ?? It's just terrible. There are some gore, but mostly it looks quite helpless. Oh, and ultimately the sight of the death of the scientist, which I have seen for many years, is really one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting significance for you? This image borrowed the music signal from the 2003 science-fiction film "Allen Hunter", which was much more than this shit.
