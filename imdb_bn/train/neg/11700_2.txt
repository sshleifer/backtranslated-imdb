I was really looking forward to seeing this picture, but after watching it I was really frustrated. The best bit was when Stephen King was in. Robert John Burke can not work to save his life and nobody else can do it. Some of the performance even smile me out loud! The picture was not as I was, after reading the book, I imagined, I imagined it was dark and a lot of squares. If I were Stephen, then I'd be really crazy! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed last, I thought the end of the book is very good. If you find your daughter killed, will not you let anyone else eat it? <br /> <br /> The book was so good!
