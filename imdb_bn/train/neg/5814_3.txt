That's what the movie did: Show how a young girl interferes with poverty and increases her maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been searched substantially and, in most cases, there is more sophistication than done here. The movie settled on the breasts, which soon became annoying and I lost interest. If this is on TV, I've switched to the latest news of the STAR report. That's how annoying I find this movie.
