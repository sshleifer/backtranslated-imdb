All right, I think in the first one, the boy was kissing. After watching this, I just laughed and said to myself, "Oh boy, another low budget B-movie, I never see this part." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, the part two came. It sucked even more. However, I laughed again, "I have never seen such a part". Then, about 1/2 years later, Part 3 came out. I was stupid to rent that boy, I just slipped after seeing it. God, I did not really understand how many times these films could spin. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. I believe, it's worth every penny.
