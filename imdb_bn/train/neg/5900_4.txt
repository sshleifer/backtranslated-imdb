Young and attractive Japanese people are getting the wrong side of some curses, this time it is included in mobile phones. Many people die until the unhappy soul is discovered behind it, so if you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films, then you can plot this movie with your hand in the dark. <br /> <br /> Here is the highlight of the Tacoma Mike Camera. So far I have been more impressed with the following original works like the City's Lost Souls, but when a missed call was pladded I was interested in dead or alive or other famous pseudo-cranegen style and more famous leaflets in the audition style. Despite the fact that most of his films are empty, there are at least qualifications for them, or there are at least some of your like-minded attention that Johnny Depp, like him, is taken to the captivating impressive spectacular characteristic. There is none in one missed call; There are very few credits: Acting is a soft and average, extremely or suspicious way in a very short (nothing, all truth), and in places it's just boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments where funny comedy like Mick's glacier goes through business; One of the most notably damned subjects is the intention of a TV show of death, and the TV programmer is more concerned about her ratings than the lives of women. But besides this there is nothing to suggest a miri behind the camera; Most notably his usual visual flash disappeared without trace (and his famous Gore included), although this is probably not a motivation for its project and I understand why. A Missed Call Offensive is not bad. It's just the average of frustration. <br /> <br /> Mike definitely loves direction. With his huge annual output he is clear that he is not going to be concerned about 100% of all his projects. But remembering that, Miss Miss Call seems to be paying the bill.
