When I first saw this picture, I thought it was going to be a good Saskatche film. Generally, when you have such movies, there is usually a saskat, but what's in it? Their 7 or 10? Acting was good, the plot was right, I liked the scenes where Saskatchera killed the first few, very good camera work. I had expected it to be a gory film but it was very little. This movie was a better way than the Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channels really have to create more Saskatchev films, that means I liked Sassack Mountain, Abominibal was not good, what I'm reviewing is OK, but the film was not Saskatcheit, but I'm not reviewing it to get me back on track. This movie is good for afternoon afternoon, but not for any other event.
