This documentary film is based on an incomplete consideration of the evidence, among which Brian Fleming might be deliberately failing to mention important evidence for the opposite. Perhaps his most important mistake is the first: his claims about the incompetence of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregarded the main points, such as: ** Some of the sources of the Holy religion exist in Paul's letters. These religions indicate that the central claim of Jesus was often made in the statement of faith, probably within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** The early Christians' testimonies can not be thrown merely as imagination. In fact many people claimed to be the Messiah during that time, but only one of them is: Jesus. Why? Because if anyone believed in the fact that Christ was the Messiah because it was frustrating, and if they knew that he was not resurrected, then he would die for that faith. ** Though the gospels are more generous, we are still talking about Jesus' account which was written in the lifetime of other witnesses, which proved to be false in these Gospels. And there are proof that the gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I am saying is that Fleming's documentary is incredibly biased and self-service, that Hajj poses various arguments and proofs to serve his Christian perspective. Do not be fooled by poor investigation.
