A visual concept vampirism has something with a virus. (But done several times by now) Overall the movie drags too long and a bit. The editing can be difficult. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with credit. Maybe the movie is inserted in the market. The light was very dark in the place. But the worst technical issue is audio. The layer was good enough to listen to the dialogue, but many of the internal files contain echoed sounds for them, which are very confusing. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the mix of words might have been better. Also got through the background too much background. In the martial arts scene, anyone should be able to make sound effects. There was no sound of an epic battle to hit the tinny clunk of the sword struck together. Especially in battle scenes, editing needs to be even more difficult. <br /> <br /> There was also little flatness of the actress. I'm sorry, but when I see the same person in which movie authors and stars see the picture, in my experience it is a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort so I gave it 4.
