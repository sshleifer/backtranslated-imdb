"Washington Square" is a flat, shabbby adaptation of the short novel of Henry James. Actually, the novel is very good, but far away from James's superiority level. Moreover, it seems inappropriate to create a simple, uninterrupted story in a film (although William Wyler gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949 with "The Hesce"). <br /> <br /> However, the film is completely betrayed by the great American writer's soul. In the novel, heroine Catherine is shy, very attractive and not a bit brutal, yet she is an intelligent, intelligent young girl, and she may feel that it is not flexible. Her attachment to her father is honored and honored, with no morbid party. Along with three quarters of the movie, Kathryn (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks mentally disturbed, poor things. At the end, he suddenly (and incredibly) became intelligent, became aware of his status as a woman. <br /> <br /> Director Agnita Holland added two rude scenes in this story. First, when the nervous children have Catherine, well, the problem with her vesica. Second scene, when we see prostitution of an open air in the background, prostitution takes their customers behind the tent and thus There is nothing against Henry James's spirit and artistic ideology. It is notorious that the author was extremely polite and disgraceful for Victorian era criteria. James' I refused to find a curly anywhere on thousands of pages of huge literature production. I was really annoyed by these two scenes. Yes, I know that a director needs a novel screen adaptation to have reasonable freedom. But if a director completely ignores or does not misunderstand the art of a writer (here in Henry James), I do not see the use of his work to create bad films. <br /> <br /> Despite the talent of actors Albert Finney and Maggie Smith, poor and flat, enough for the film. "Washington Square" is definitely a non-recommendable film.
