These were high intellectual pretensions. The main leadership was willing to give a "deep" "meaningful" rendering (naturally with voice for his mind frame) and he was certainly influenced by fifty / sixties "method" - when the script and direction were effective, see the great results (Clift, Newman, Winters ). But the story here is uncomfortable. As you move it slowly, you can edit at least 20 minutes-including non-pointless flashbacks-and plot lines will not change. Occasionally, it is very doubtful that Bruce Daryn believes in his "cousin character" and his screenplay often portrays the parody. An interesting aspect only spreads over: the relation between the little boy / hero - If we accept that the hero himself is a child-when he tells the little boy that he does not allow anybody to harm him, then he has some sincerity. But it gets cracked and only the final scene comes back. Wise: Take Folie's "close range" instead: It's two great actors (Christophe E Waken and Shan Pen together!), this is an offabout film, but it's great, suspicious. Here my point of zero hits towards zero.
