If you want to see a movie that puts style on the body, it's for you. To me, Sona de Maar is beautiful, but precious little material, unless the Makkishi, Malodramatic, Manipulute love twang turns you around. This may be one of the famous' chick flicks who you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We really see about halfway through this incident: Ulice (Jordi Molla) goes out of the sea in search of tuning and does not return, leaving her wife Martina (Leonore Watling)) and the son is trapped for themselves. Then, in a fiery dark six-minute screen, they kill Luis, Martinina gets married again, and her boy grew up in childhood. This quick transition is called at least, and very sloppy: after hanging for about 40 minutes or more, we are suddenly in a full swing mellam with six minutes. <br /> <br /> After five years, Ulises (like the superhuman superhero Ulysses, drink it?), returned to Penelope (Watling) and went to visit her wedding. Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), a strangely rich man (can he afford all those dough?) Who curiously keeps a crocodile as a pet. When Martin expressed fierce anger, he questioned Ules about his absence, telling him that he would ever take him to Sumatera Island and he could understand everything. And here's the thing: he did not take him to Sumatra Island. Reference only scripts die somewhere. He did not really explain where he was, and why he ignored his wife and children for five years. He does not abandon himself as an honorable man, and the film does not fill the plot hole at least half the film for us. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants to fill story lines with our provocative cinematography and disconnected dialogues, proposed mysterious sources (fish, reptiles, ocean). It just does not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Mullah is a good actor, but I could not buy her Ules as any kind of hero. (Which was supposed to be the original Ulysses). With humorous sex, she is about 2,000 times the short poem of Virgil's uniform poem and every time it provokes the explosion of orgasm to each other in Martina. This guy should be paid for rehabilitation of marriage. I'm sure Virgil will be affected. He does not often understand that I understand it. <br /> <br /> This poetic 'instrument' was specially portrayed in the film, and I did not think that it was the famous 'Siren Song' (ie, singing from the seductive songs of beautiful girls) to the sailors who were answered, well , Siron Call). If Bigus Luna is doing this, then you can see the problem - he is making a strong impression in the attempt to rob him of high art. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Even a romantic depth. It is outside of him that he can fall in love with a person who has played the sign of his face (for example), 1960-style oily hair which looks more like sewaid and is one of the 21st century bearded '(you know, four days Increase, no more, no less). He was able to become a dreamer (I think), but his eyes suggested that he might have been suffering from unexpectedly unexpected scripts. <br /> <br /> But do not be frustrated, this film is great for watching. Do not try to attach points to just the red baskets or do not worry too much about what you're listening to in conversation. You can lose fast forwarding (especially within the first 40 minutes) of this movie and you will not really miss a lot.
