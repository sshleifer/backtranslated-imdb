I saw this movie. Finally. And that was not really easy. It is very annoying, played poorly and stolen from "Blair Witch Project" is almost every detail which you can not believe the manufacturers take this serious. Even hard to believe, this "product" how it was made in VHS and DVD. So if you want to see a horror movie, just see "Scrum", but if you want to laugh loud and have a good time, some kids cry each other and showing their disability, through the dark area Running, watch the dark area.
