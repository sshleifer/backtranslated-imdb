I bought this movie for a used CD store for $ 5, and I'm sorry. I said, I'm a huge fan of Chesie horror Flickr. They provide an awesome tacky cheap entertainment. This movie entertains the first half hour, because it was so bad that it can be fun enough in the MST3K Style style. Then it became annoying. <br /> <br /> Acting is the most horrific part of this movie. Until the great acting was expected, it was ridiculously bad and honestly, all entertainment was provided. This movie plus side. The film is really entertaining, entertaining and entertaining in editing. <br /> <br /> This movie provides many ways "%% @ # What's going on?" The moment There are many moments, as it looks strange on the bed of a mother's wedding, and then there is absolutely no consequence in the film. Along with the dinner line, someone decided to charge that it takes fun to eat a modified meal for five minutes every minute while eating the food. During the meal and other inappropriate moments, the scene spread out in the dark dark outside. Then cut back. And not speaking out of darkness, one of the funiest parts of the film is the climate, where apparently it does not have the night until the night. And talking about darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's burning very badly, you can not see it going half way, which is a bit frustrating. In a climactic scene, you can not even tell what you saw it is so frustrating. In <br /> <br /> and climatic scenes, Unhinged is the worst one. I saw people "Wow, that surprised me, and it's good." I can say that great publicity has surprised me, because I did not see it. Because I see it coming because the reason is absolutely no sense made of it. I will not ruin it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I have elaborated a few minutes to find out all the details that I had tested for a good twenty minutes review in different parts of the film, and we had to say more about what we got. It was not possible. Finally, this movie is really fun when you watch the comment tracks that you enjoyed it. I love shit horror movies, but these were too much.
