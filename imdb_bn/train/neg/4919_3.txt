I was like Ali McGroe in this movie, because I was very annoyed by a leading performance. God is boring or what? He said everything in the same tone and horrible, so terrible that in fact, Ryan O'Neal brilliantly. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories. He is rich, he has a lot of sacrifice for the wood, they both love. His father is named by his father, Stonewall Jackson, if you do not notice the two differences between them that they have crossed the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination for this movie indicates that it was a bad year. John Marley is like Wooden's father, but a nominee nominee? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think Catherine Ross played Jennifer, but again, if I have it, then Catherine Ross would have been more in the movie. She is certainly a good actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not cry even when I got sick, even when I felt sad, I did not even come to me. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Tommy Lee Jones as 15 years old, and the score is good. But so far old, it is a mile long, and its sin is not that old, but it seems.
