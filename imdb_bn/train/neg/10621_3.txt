I will not add a plot review, it is not very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Fulton Mac was very good at the Rocket Rock, Keith Baron was good at anything else and he did what Diana Dors did. <br /> <br />? It was free to watch Horror Channel before going on subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
