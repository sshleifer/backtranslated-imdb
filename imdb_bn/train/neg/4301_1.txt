I used to stay in one night and reached approximately noon at around noon, so I flipped nipple through the channel and the hbo. Where this "classic" was playing. At first I was happy to catch something at the beginning, but my happiness movie was submerged for about two minutes. The entire movie was centered around an overwhelming people, who were afraid of women, women of four beautiful but empty minds who acted as waitresses in her uncle's diner and also worked with her lean and very sad cousin. There are some strange twists in this movie which make it a bit interesting, but certainly not valuable. Basically, if you do not have anything in the night or just do not sleep, then do a lot of good work. However, the boys have many skin so it can be fixed without any word, but it can even be annoying
