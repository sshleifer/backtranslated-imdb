Although the film is a playback to critics, even this is a terrible movie. If someone is committed to such things, at least it creates a good joke ... First, I guess Gerard Depardieu of the poor man, in Jerein Krabbe ... Naturally I hate Gerard Depardie, though he was a 'iron mask' One of the three funky one in the very funny. Otherwise he is worse than that of my box office poison and Gerien Krabbé. The box office poison of the poor people ... is not really being economically disenfranchised fair. If the 'fourth person' seems to be critical of the bourgeoisie ... what am I saying? It's not Let's just guess, if it was supposed to be, it was not sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing ... It is not sharp enough, but the joke gets over instead of the viewer ... I think what happened. The story is ending just like a bunch of sad hateful characters that nobody is interested in and not interestingly ..... (See more lucrative BUYUEL movies for more interesting and appropriate applications .... very sharp mockery <br / > <br /> [Possible spoiler alert] <br /> <br /> Really, the blow job in the cemetery is that it works so hard to achieve the character of Jerein Krabbé .... do you even care? What is it funny? Mr Bhoww If Na was considered to be a good filmmaker, I would give him the suspicion and that's some unjustified joke out of control ... even though I think he is in Krab because he is the worst actor and every character he has played An assaulted bourgeoisie ass ... he is unable to do so, so it becomes like a strange caricature. Do you think Mr. Bhowwow This was the purpose? And what is the funniest jeraina kryabebeo butt? I just do not see it, so you understand ...... dilamarata with me, okay? This is the worst film, because he could be a good manager. So there are some kind of dupup involved. I knew 'Patch Adams' were even terrible to see it. The fourth man's fraudulent alluring packaging or Mr. Do not get a reputation as a good director of Vivirov
