Although the film was "true" in the book of Lewis (though the script was originally word-word-word, verbatim), it failed in such a glorious capture that otherwise would be related to the story of this epic. Legendary organisms (Unicorn, Centauri, Gryphins, ghouls, Scratch) are drawn *, and as previously reviewed, the green screen flying sequence was difficult to swallow too. I often smile when I saw humanoid beavers with their giant harsh yarn and wild tooth; When I heard the wolf, I shouted, "How are you?" A man in a gray fawn case loudly shouted loudly loudly and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > All the roles are forcibly forced, especially the little Lucy Penseneti ... I could take so much anger, frustration, and teeth for fourteen hours (as it was felt) to watch this movie. Hosted by playing host Witch, in all his works, it seems that he will do more at home on stage, where a flurry of arms spreads arms, and more of Shakespeare's courageous effort is welcome. <br /> <br /> Sets feel claustrophobic, whether scenes are going out of the house or outside. Internally, the BBC simply can spend $ 100 to build a set, and so it is very small, and all the letters are constantly combined. The White Wight castle is strolling through the Straffofam statues and the English castle filled with bad light. When pennagey children roam around the woods - in fact, * no * scenes in woods - it seems they are just turning around the circle. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems to be suitable for film is Aslan, but you can carry the full budget of the film to make a mechanical cat in BGB. When it's standing and it starts looking good before it starts talking, but once it starts running, you can not help, but please be kind to the poor man who will end up behind the lion's suit. Yes, if you are a hardcore nanny fan then you might want to see this version because it preserves any written word in the lewis - but Louis was certainly not a writer and many conversations were shining on the screen. And it seems weird. Mrs. Beaver's tragedy, "Oh, just one more thing, Derry, and then we'll be ready to go" as the children are ready to flee from the wolf and are ready to flee from the wolf, "cry together and sighs and moans", Mrs. Beaver, please! " - Comic Relief scenes, so incompatible (They seem to be suffering from imminent danger, do not think the sewing machine is packed), the scene can not be otherwise. In fact, the whole film is drunk by directing these types of wrong passes. <br /> <br /> I would recommend looking at New Narrians (Disney 2005). New movie, updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great time around and a fantastic and scenes-stolen white witch (who opposes a respected bansia, takes part in all the fine temples of a basic politician) from Louise's real perspective (I think) to at least Grandma and the Greatness of the World Without Neutralization of Bit. There is nothing with Lucy's many curiosity (no wild teeth, yes!), Such as Beaver (and the size of reality), and Brachi Admand's divine, extremely hungry-acceptable-uncertain-and-angusting -un-infarri√®re-complex admand that is new Disney Edition Front <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this film to anyone unless you have fun in campi movies.
