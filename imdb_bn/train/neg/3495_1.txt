I saw an episode. Yes, I'm sitting through a whole unfortunate experience, and I have to say, this comedy brand will give you the worst. Imagine Peter Grafin of Family Guy Fame Imagine Peter Grafin now (except for the thin and glass subtlety in disguise), he now has nothing that makes him ridiculous. Peter Griffin is a fool, but he does not know he is a fool. Sarah is no real character, she has no ability to stop her character. Perhaps his comedy, formual joke, which can draw his comedy less than his character, can accept it by himself. Maybe it lacks credible foils. His insensitive, intelligent personality can appeal to progressive people, which is not like the public appeal that Stephen Colbert has an insensitive, fascinating character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. There is a lack of it for the continuation of adultery, which is only for comedy's entire world. What lacks Sarah Silverman, her noticeable. And when you do not believe it and recognize it with it, it's no longer fun.
