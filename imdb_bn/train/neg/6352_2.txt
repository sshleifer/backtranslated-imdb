I was always a great fan of Woody Allen and I will always be there for what I used to do in the past, but only blind blind lover can ignore how neutral, pointless, proactive, and most horrific it played in this movie. An empty mental masturbation based on continuous basis. And the artificially produced "Actor Allen-Clone" is a disastrous idea, what Allen should do in Pharrell's face, 30-year-olds in Will Fellell's face and gestures. The result was probably ridiculous. And not to talk about the conversation ... philosophical reflections have become an unwritten maqa of intellectual thought, unaware of its ridiculous effect. Sad ...
