The real bad movie, the story is very simple and poor performance as expected and complementary. <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen this predatory hunter story so far, Derek Bliss (John Bon Jovi) in Mexico, in search of some bleakers, he uses some interesting weapons. (But nothing is more than a blade), and some Van Helsig is part of the hunter net of Vampire?, OK, but he worked alone. She is following a strong queen of the Vampire, who starts a black crucible search that will help her to be ineligible for sunlight (a series of almost people (1998), directed by John Carpenter and represented by James Woods). Derek began looking for the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad acting) outside of a teenage experience, Father Rodrigo (Christian de la Fuen) is a Catholic priest, Joe (Natasha Wagner), a special vampire and Ray Collins Darius McCreater) Another expert vampire hunter. So clearly he is not alone in this adventure. <br /> <br /> You can feel how you viewed this movie as its main actor (John Forest Jovi); There is a huge difference between acting quality compared to James Woods and then, if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this section), you will be involved in the simplest stories, completely expected, terrible acting, really bad special effects and intrinsic events! <br /> <br /> I deeply recommend not seeing this film !, rent another movie, watch other channels, go out with your friends etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
