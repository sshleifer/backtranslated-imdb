I am sitting in this movie in the evening, although I was never worried about any of my characters or what happened to them, because Gird Phillip and Mitchell Morgan were their main movie stars and I was not. They wanted to see them "a little different", which was obviously this. They both gave fine performance, but distasteful characters. In fact, the whole movie lives almost identical characters in a shabby little town of Mexico (doctors, of course, major exceptions). Mitchell Morgan, who never saw Philip falling in love with him, could never be explained. <br /> <br /> This is based on a work in Gene-Paul Sartre. I could remember that if Sara's work is not something like this movie, it would have to be an extreme effort to imitate Cameros's brutal novel The Plague, which took a plague from North Africa. <br /> <br /> Good acting but unintentional movie.
