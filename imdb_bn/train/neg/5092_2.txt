<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw Jury Guggarin alive. He was sincere, neutral and kind, he was comfortable and looked like a well educated and intellectual person. I saw a shirt in this movie! The actor looks like a dummy with gesture and imitation affecting. They made a cartoon! The real gagarin was someone else! Do not believe this movie! <br /> <br /> I read this book "Timing of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the book "Rockets and People", after reading the book "Crohnov: Myths" and "Corollav: Myths" and the incident "by Golovanov I'm tiring. Scene, poor acting and producer, and was amazed by the many failures of "Space Race". <br /> <br /> This movie is well-known sophisticated representation in Russian history. For example, in 1945, Corleve was not already arrested (released in 1944) and in 1940 he was not in gold mine in the Colaima jail, but he was in the special prison design bureau, and he was the designer of the prison bureau. And he was not buried in the dead prisoners, but since 1940, Kerol worked as a grave digger (because the district The sole is on the shoulder strap). Aiemaeicao, film writers do not have deep knowledge about this part of history, and they can not make interesting movies.
