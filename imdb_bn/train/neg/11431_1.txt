It should not be insulted by the lack of logic or general knowledge and those with "gray matter" will agree that this film does not work. <br /> <br /> Problems between problems, selection in character building and lack of depth. I hope to laugh while using these words when the word was very difficult to say in comedy. Let's look at the issue of scripts / scripts. <br /> <br /> Both brothers and sisters feel good combination between 30 and 30. They meet a whole newborn in a park and heather Graham goes to the character and asks the closest questions that half the people will go on the other side or at least scream for the police officer. Then he curiously walks over and makes some stupid statements and he falls for him. Then one day they all go out together, she falls in love with him and in one week decided to get married in Vegas ???? Hello anybody still feel stupid? She went out with thousands of women and she met this person who said 10 words that we see on the screen and she wants to marry her. It was not just chemistry that just does not know it. Sure it is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the side makes it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather falls head over the heels with her and when Heather Graham and Brigitte Mannahan (very shallow character) kisses or more points it may have chemistry that never sloppiest kissing. I found it irresistible and lazy and many people say Heather can not work, I think the reality is obviously the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was my first role as a director and it was too much for me to chew it. It will take many cures to create this film and IMHO it can be done with better author and casting and directions.
