Ever wanted to eat worm? Here's how a 'documentary' is shown to you! Yeah ... the child eats alive worms! And it's about the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This critique of this movie is very good as well as annoying. I'm fully contracted here. The film does not just go anywhere ... unless you like to eat insects! This is a movie that is almost impossible, because it can write a spoiler .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now from the technical side: They were supposed to cut a baby a hair. Trying to meet someone ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost ridiculous ... I often asked him to turn into a bad dog or something. <br /> <br /> and above; The child was hungry too hungry! He should keep away from junk food a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> Everyone, this movie almost gave me sleeping. And my children can manage about 15 minutes before leaving the scene to see more interesting things. <br /> <br /> I would accept in the scene that the scenes were very impressive. And there was a decent story to go with her, it could be a hit. <br /> <br /> It seems safe enough for kids to see: Bear view and 'weird' eyes were very weak, most children were scared, and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave it a very generous 3.
