My roommate got a note on the note, the knit soundtrack tape, and went ahead to listen to non-stop. Finally after making it fully intelligent to submit to me, I think the songs are awesome, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... but because of the ambiguity of the soundtrack, I had no idea what the film was about . So the other day I saw a copy of it in the video store and I hired it as a long lost version of the movie. I thought it was going to be great, because the soundtrack was very nice. Unfortunately, most of the songs I liked did not show up in the video. Now I have never seen the 1930s musical version, but this version was frustrating because there were very few songs played and virtually no dance and side by side was really bad and you can not understand what people are saying a lot of time. The only highlight of this film was the 1940's inconsistent fashion. Nannet spits this crazy cap with two birds that looks like a rabbit ear and Kansas kitty keeps the wretched feathers loose, which he holds his forehead and then covers himself in this net square. One dancing sequence is a little weird, with Nanite being the peculiar ballet staff topped with pin-up girl imagery. Actually, this film was another glittering spot artist Gilcep who dreamed of being a fine artist, but has now condemned the painting of girls for money. How do I keep Gillisp in an old school, and Nainte has a wonderful piece, which is broken into pieces to make his career, selling it to Nana and selling for $ 5250. Did he realize that the piece was his immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with your feather ear hare your hat. When do you learn Why add man to take away work before he is not just pencil in a cigarette?
