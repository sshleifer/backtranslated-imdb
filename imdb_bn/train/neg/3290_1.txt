This movie sucked! They took something from my childhood, and raped it in an outhouse! This movie was so bad that I go home and keep my "Dukes" DVD and cry in a corner. Throwing was terrible! It was not "Dukes", it was driving Stefler and Jacques. When was Bose Hog bad? When was Roscoau difficult? They never were! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco had an ass. When is Jesse a pot of smoke? He never did Now do not make me wrong, I am very generous and there is nothing wrong with Chibba, but there is no place in this movie! The only thing for this movie was the movie and the trailer before the last credit. It was money time and air waste. To Avoid All Costs !!!!!!!!
