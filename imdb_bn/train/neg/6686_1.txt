There is no entertainment in this whole movie. There is not a scary, funny, and even interesting scene in this movie. It advertises itself as a horror, then it goes away to a comedy call itself. It's not even ridiculous at ATMEMPT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not have any criteria for this moment even if you see it, you also like a little bit. It is a difficult time for me to try to understand the filmmakers trying to accomplish this task. It's not funny, scary, disgusting, or provocative. So what was it supposed to be a drama? Because it was not really dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not see yourself and see this movie. Life is worth losing 90 minutes to see it.
