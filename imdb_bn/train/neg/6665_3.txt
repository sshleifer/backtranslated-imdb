Okay, the story - life has become an annoying greedy young girl and her younger brother's life has become disturbed by the annoyance and their lives are being lost - lightly attractive. However, there is nothing to think (everyone has ...) - the death penalty is everything. <br /> <br /> This torment disturbed me. And it did not bother me too much. The rhythm (direction, editing) was slow, the speed was unequal and the height was expected. We saw that, the dispersion highway five, six, seven times why? Knorton's character problems are seen as children's play, not enough to understand his problem / spirit / Blaye and rooted on or on behalf of him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a cruel? The references to "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary, and of course, this is not for the flickr (or on behalf of the EN). <br /> <br /> and IMHO, it is ultimately executed horribly. In Central America somewhere cheap psychological techniques for teenager lovers This man must kill the child, blame his father, create a real ruins. Or the child finally wanted to kill the father, but no, we ended the chess where the children felt frustrated, the parents themselves were confused about their own lives and their relations and disappointments certainly died. The happy unhappy family is uninterrupted with the constant, safe and happy, so we can enjoy our pop-up, incredible. <br /> <br /> And the scene where greedy movie enters, O my God, I will think of something stupider than the long and hard to find! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Perhaps the makers of that movie thought that it was a good idea but it was annoying. Again, if you are not a 16-year-old girl in Kansas or somewhere and you double dream about a sexual relationship with a crazy person, okay, you can enjoy this movie and its "message".
