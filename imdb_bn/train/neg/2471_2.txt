When I went to the camp when I was little back, remember back and we will campout under it. There was always someone who talked about the wood surrounding us and they always torn me. Well, when WinDig is found in the library, I check it out that one should be one of those movies, which hunts for supernatural people more than just stories in camps. Well, a lot of my frustration, I was far from the truth. Wendigo really bad. The story begins when a family of three is driving their winter cabin, which looks like your natural suburbs and nothing like a wooden cabin, and they go to the deer. Well, it seems that the local Rednex is actually hunting this particular deer and is annoying the city's man. Rather than reaching the point of the film, the film spends a lot of time after family day-to-day activities. For the last 15 minutes we did not have any steps involved in "Wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay away from this film too. It's you want to return to your hours and a half.
