If you really enjoy the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you will not see it instead of just less than 2 hours. I can not believe that this film has made a comment that it is simply a cheap rock. First, a "special" commando force is a unique defense of a facility with a computer matrix that has an AI and a holographic projection. And this "Hive" is a series of rip-offs that have a one-off clash in one series at the same time. Code names also have a chess reference that was in dialogue with RE. There is no zombie, but the generosity of the "rock" film is somewhat biologically, which refers to the nervous tissue as a lot of color, which is a super mutant in RE with many cyborg components. So, to claim any credit for this story, Mr. Richard Taylor a finger point <br /> <br /> They are not the same movie, but the writer resides in the minds of the resident Evil. .
