It's a movie about animal cruelty. Under the formation of a marathon nation, we see imagery of extreme animal abuse, with the help of the death of the horse gradually. The person who did this, then his horse cleared up with the burial of the horse / fire, which is certainly tortured in the dead. This is a sick, slimest movie that I never liked to see. As the Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their diving animals, we were convinced to praise the people for completing the nation. I want to put producers and directors in a marathon race; They will decide when they are finished, perhaps about 20 minutes after breathing.
