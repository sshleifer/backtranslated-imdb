Or for that matter, listen. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not the worst gay movie I've ever seen (it will be related to delivery), but it is very close to the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing drags and drags and drags This plot is not impossible - it can work in the hands of a good writer. . . It certainly can be much more entertaining. There is not a plot point for 10 miles down the road. Dialog flat. Jokes are old. To add humiliation to injury, it is full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Anything in this movie did not believe that the situation or relationship of two leads was possible, much less practical. There was no chemistry, there was no dynamic, why does Lead love each other? . . We just said they're love. Difficult to identify when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do they like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad at all, but the pensing is extremely slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch-Slow, but without the quality of Jarmusch. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch films, avoid this one.
