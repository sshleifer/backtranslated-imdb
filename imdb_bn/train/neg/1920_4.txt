I'm not saying that the Burwari was horrible in the night, but it was far too far. Mediocre at the absolute best Although it seems that every time a movie is released, one second must be the same time. (Think of the Armageddon and the Deep Impact, Volcano and Danta Peak) Twists are really bad in the night and the twister except the special effects of Twister. <br /> <br /> There is nothing against my actor actors, even if they were not great, it was very strange to explain film, direction, special effects, the whole story. A series of tornadoes strikes a town and basically tries to find out the family and friends of the movie and try to deal with the losses. I do not know why it was almost simultaneously in sync with each other like disorder films, but this one bill has been good with Paxton and Helen Hunt.
