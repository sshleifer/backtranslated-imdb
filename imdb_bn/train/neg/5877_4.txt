Wade through the pronunciation of Williamson is difficult. She speaks incredibly quickly, she is in a horror to get through the line. When he told to speak to himself, he was talking to a person, then he worked during Salilquizi. All that and its cold spot just bothered me. She was too old for this role. To read Williamson's other accounts, perhaps he got this role because he was crazy and the director decided to act in some life-imitation-industry or compulsory way. Actor Hamlet announced the crazy when you believe it! Marianne could botch the role of a stunning beauty and Ophelia and could still get a pass. The set is bold and predictable, but it is an original castle, especially the view of the tunnels / corridors where the great King of the sky shows the bright scene as a great light.
