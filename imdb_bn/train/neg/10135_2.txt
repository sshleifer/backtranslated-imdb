I just saw this movie starz. Let me go through some things that I could think of; Acting, writing, direction, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. It also seemed that writers had no idea that it was done with the movie. In 2007, when the dollar was strong, you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could completely disappear for $ 75 million. Now these things are worth about $ 3 billion and they can not disappear. Apparently you can fly to the Middle East from an hour in the US. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not think, but it would look like more people like the lame to see it. The camera will randomly ignore the zoom and random scenes of the actors. Oh yes, this is a Steven Seagull movie, it's expected as hell. I put everyone on the plane with the snake on the right.
