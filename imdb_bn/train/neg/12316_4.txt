Director Jonathan Lynn has created some underrated comedy in the past, such as 'greedy' and 'clue'. This is not one of them. More like his 'Police Academy' film than his inspiration, it is the role of an army sergeant from the old Phil Silvers as well as Steve Martins dragged scams under the greatest nose of all time. But Bilco's lazy life and his lazy platoon seemed to be seen that an old enemy visited the foundations to catch the evil. Nothing, really It's all quite dull. It's not too funny. Martin, Dan Ikrod and Phil Hartman aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly shouted out loud.
