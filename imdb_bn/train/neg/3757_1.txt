How does this ever exist? I usually like movies / movies like Fees / Bigfoot. . But I still hope this will be written without quite a lot of cheese as this. The effect was sad, the line was sadder. To avoid all costs. I finally hired it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for a Sassouach movie with Lance Henriquesen - I have not seen it yet). The idea of ​​the film is really good. There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. I just do not understand how to end something like this. Talk to students interested in film / art / English high school students and you will find people who can write a good script.
