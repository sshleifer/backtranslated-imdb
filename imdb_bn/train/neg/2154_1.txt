Let me confess I used this video and bought it because its underwear on Gutenberg's jacket looked so sexy. But there was another story inside. The film was originally a parody of the special effects (very visible strings and other similar elements) of the "invisible-male" genre, yet the script was not a chance - in fact it went from its way - insulting all insults - WASP race and real- Or imaginary gay The respect of the script's individual target was both homophobic or racist or both. It starts cone on your nervous, frankly-camera style photography and melodramatic stories. However, there is nothing to be surprised at last. But while you reach there, you are less care less. Too bad, it can be a reasonably good movie.
