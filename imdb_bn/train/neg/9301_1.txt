If you want to call them, then go ahead ... <br /> <br /> I'll recommend this movie almost so that people can really see 1/10. Where to start, we will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> Story: Do not believe the accused - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and what is the secret of people's mysterious events. It's a dive, basic, no intensity or "effort" to go to cabin movies. Screenplay: I usually give credit to the script writers, when you start, it's a tough job ... but it's shit. The story is flat - it makes you feel full of the movie. The dialogue is very weak and anticipated proud line "Woah, you have completely stabbed me" and "I was wondering if you wanted ... if you wanted, you would come to me in the cabin?" It wants to leak out all my hair, one by one shaking and giving it to yourself. <br /> <br /> Characters: Holly Cap !!!! Some have described the letter as flat, I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse letter arc. They actually start the parallel universe and start acting backwards. <br /> <br />: The characters are worse than characters. They already took the letters written in poor and added horror high school drama. "Woah you're completely freaked out" is called so monotone and slow - it was fooling down. I can complain to actors alone for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Technology: Light: The eight-year-old will be disappointed in the light of this film. Very galleys in the area, very bleached among others. The director will not be used as a passion for learning until the director learns how to properly organize a basic scene. Baby steps! Sound: How many words do people take for creating really shot sounding movies? 9. That should make these amazing words with many word guys but happened quite aversion. Especially there is a scene which has really jumped up, these people are driving cars and every camera in the car's camera is changing with the angle .... Okay! Cameras: Learn how to use it <br /> <br /> However, I'm going out of complain ... Rent - I dare you ... Learn to rent it and learn from here ... It's a day Ratings .. It deserves. <br /> <br /> Sign in ... Amanda Christmas
