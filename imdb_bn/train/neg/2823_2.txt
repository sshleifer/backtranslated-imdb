Well, Tivo Angelina Jolie has recorded it. It was 2.5 stars. It seemed to be promising. It went fast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more pressure from Angelina. He is 20 years old and is 16 years old. There are three letters that are supposed to be Italian Everyone else is Italian-American. Local Italian pronunciation was good, I thought. The young male lead is beautiful, my wife says. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even men <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick van Patten was cast as a rogue doctor, it was a bad sign. Two couples are chasing their kids around, like four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife does not have to go remote. Hope she did not accept makeup, costume or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of disgusting and poor. It was secret. <br /> <br /> Closing my left ventricle was not enough to hurt the viewing of this movie. If this movie shows on your TV, do yourself a favor on the TV screen instead of you and press the RAM You will be glad you The only movie that I have ever seen was worse than this "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "deadly friend".
