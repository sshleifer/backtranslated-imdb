I say at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. For the most part, acting is not good (I think Sky has only shown a promise) and you feel uneasy to see it. Scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, as when Ng comes to his parents. Sky's shoulder kanji tattoos, women's fridge crews and sets of terrible decorations ... and music ... and clothes etc. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point, "I'm gay, not pure." And not aware. Even the commentary was awful, after I discussed ng how I was weird to play a gay turned it off.
