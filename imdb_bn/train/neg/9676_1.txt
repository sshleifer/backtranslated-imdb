Movies have allowed me to sleep before, but never did a movie twice, so to finish it, I took three items. The dialog was bad. The women spoke down and men had caricatures. And the supposed Japanese women knew two Chinese, the Chinese name was and clearly speaking with Chinese accent. I'm still trying to understand why Etimenthol's men have sex with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 is equal to a solid choice: Can I give this movie a rating? Or two? <br /> <br /> Movies have allowed me to sleep before, but never did a movie twice, so to finish it, I took three items. The dialog was bad. The women spoke down and men had caricatures.
