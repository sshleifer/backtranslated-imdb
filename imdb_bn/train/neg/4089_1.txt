Caution: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressive is bad. Note I said, "almost". It's nothing more than a random scene combining in a loose attempt in a story. Plays (you can not call them "heroes") shoot innocent opponents for their food and loot similarly for the same reason. There are tons of homeopark eczema, which was a cyclone for me. (Speaker: It seems that Vilnessi (who is not as naked and naked as the demand of other claims) died before, but miraculously restored, adding more 70 minutes to the audience-repression.) I can not reduce the feeling of abuse, this cinematic hatred is much more Times happened. If you are in the MSST 3K mood you can find this watchable, but in most cases you can forget it. Instead of renting the original Canaan DVD.
