Mac was V-8, trace (his last and only hero's wheel) is a jet engine behind his car, which lets him face the strange ridicule, because he runs almost half-a-lonely landslide rockets. Wondered as Mad Max 2 (Ur the Road Warrior) and split as a new movie despite being portrayed in a neutral manner with bad actors and Lausanne Stunts. <br /> <br /> Why WoF after the geological landing? Simple, the road was warrior! Indeed a question can be answered: this was the way Warrior was on the road! In addition to the original 60 film mutant actors, Time Machine produces a camomo look for the film to give some irrational steps to chew visitors for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The 80's fashion, all cars powered by bad cars, explode into a huge explosion or explode into a little bumpy. Inevitably all cars will happen around sticky, convenient steep sides and the cars will inevitably fall off on them. This is the conventional misogyny used in this style of cheap film along with the cinematic wild journey of the 80's. Generally I waited for the rocket-driven vehicle of Trace so that the fire could fire and fire so that its face could be more intense, its face became blurred, which could make it more difficult. Bad acting dancer with bad acting makes this film a true syncer. The value of unreasonable humor also leads to thin wear. <br /> <br /> <br />: The night of terror is higher by Bruno Mati. And that's saying in itself and many! According to this calculation, the best artist like a movie compared to the 2020 Texas Gladiators Wheel of Fire. Knock off a poor road Warrior film that is enough enough to have cheese cheese factorable. <br /> <br />
