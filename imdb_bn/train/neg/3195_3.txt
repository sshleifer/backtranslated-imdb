Two qualifiers in front of the right: I think Joe Dawn Baker is the right material and the right director ("Cape Fier" remake, "Goldene", a small role in "Walking Tall") can be good or even fancy. And I like Baker in "Mitchell" because he's playing anti-hero, who is able to be irrelevant. Yes, the coverage of the MST3 was pleasing, but they took many cheap shots of unemployed - which they did not deserve - to keep things alive and entertaining - he was well suited for film level and tunes, and he was the best part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Final Judge" seems to be similar, but despite the foreign location and the "Cowboys border justice" theme, it is much worse than "Mitchell" . . And the main reason being that the character of the unemployed is a fool in writing. The film is a cause of frustration because the unemployed old style borders embody machismo, he challenges his opponents old style mano-a-mano quick draw competition. And he is so tough and hit because he always gets hurt, even injured, wounded, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It is very probable (it works for Gary Cooper), even if it condemned the movie "B" movie situation. But the unemployed is so stupid and brutal that he challenges the citizens of the public to challenge the triplets of poor people for the public rally. He could have shadowed them only in the headquarters of the worst person (for that reason he followed them in the first place) and they never noticed. Or he could get a drop on them and be forced to surrender, and the gunmen can take them to a gunpoint headquarters. But not him, be a Bush League hot dog and a macho blockhead, and so he gets accepted as a hostage in an upcoming shootout! <br /> <br /> Is this man our praise? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most supportive actors are good enough (hechenmen) to be good (the main guy and his father, the two well-known European actors - they just go through the speed, but they are professional and even hamming it). But by doing so, the character of the unemployed is stupid, overwhelming stants and mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people and can make some bad people alive without using deadly forces. Positive, because 90% of the movies have been set in Malta or the Mediterranean, so you will see many beautiful scenes and plenty of great looking and exotic looking. And indeed, the unemployed may be heavy and slightly uncomfortable, but it's not bad ... Surely this tube and lord that these movie critics do not think (including their lovely coverage with Mike and Bots). <br /> <br /> <br /> As a child, this video is good for video wallpaper, but the audience will not have to pay any attention to this.
