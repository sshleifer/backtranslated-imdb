I've just visited this TV show on our TV channel Russian forum. Well ... 99% active Russian listeners disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts about achieving our place in this movie. But the authors thought something else ... :( We are great and beautiful country with intelligent people living here, we are proud of our dream of space, in this case, the real success and on the other side are science, so I want to ask the author: Where is our Lunhod? Where else, is our Mirror station? Ah? I'm sure, Longhude events were long before the Armstrong's "walk on the moon" Bang on numerous technical and science wrong - I really do not have the time and enough space!
