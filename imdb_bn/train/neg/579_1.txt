When I was watching the film, I was suspected that the director's speech is certain to hear: This is a film that wants to play in making a movie. This plot is a kind of thing that confuses the child when they "write a book / screenplay / award winning sitcom". There is a fun idea of ​​burial (perhaps it is a continuation of someone's film) but it is completely buried under an underlying, poorly executed, and ridiculously non-worried script. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible, and the performance is compelling, though again, I'm interested in blaming a manager. He does not seem to consult the actors with what he needs, but rather sloppy the script in their hands, pressing their cameras and asking them to go with them. Who knows with little coaching, these actors can make themselves ruthlessly (tell what you like for the musicians in movies, John Bon Jovi was even better than the acceptability of your boat and line man). <br /> <br /> It stands, whatever chestnut cast there is. A classic opportunity to use classic sex and parallel parallelism in the vampiresy parrot, when a sick co-hunter is given a transformation in order to infect the character of the forest, in transfusion of blood to the bloodstream. She should stick to him. You think, they will show a very strange interest to each other in the rest of the film. The only real moment of sexual excitement between the two female leaders, the admirers themselves are admitted. He originally wanted to use this continuous sequence as an excuse for more uninterrupted plot expositions - so, I think the last product may have been worse. But not too much <br /> <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, movies are bad, stupid and forgotten. Go to trashy movies even as it's not sexy enough or entertaining enough enough to go poor. It can be a fun and bloody little ramshakhi, but the director has gone through a comedy due to all the wrong reasons.
