This curiosity of new Doris Day collection does not need to be included in the film for less than 30 minutes. What he does, however, is when he is shining on the screen. Just about an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players in less movie days less near the movement. JANCIE RULE shows commitment and it is not a shame she becomes a big star. Ruth Roman manages the role of "go-getter". If this color was as good as it was Some rear projection works well in the performance of the air ball base. There are some wonderful musical interludes of what's best about the movie. If you enjoy your Lucky Star and Hollywood Canteen you would like it.
