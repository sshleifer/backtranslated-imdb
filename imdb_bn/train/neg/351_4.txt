First look at 2/16/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? Many thrilling plots twists / thrillers. Despite the very talented cast, this film is very hypothetical and only neutral by the audience of guesses under. The public is not fooled during the movie and I hope they will not fill some big pockets despite what they are involved. We believe that this film seems to have something to do against the capital punishment at the beginning of the capital punishment, but it is nothing but a standard, on the request of the audience, to run the match, it can never cross, the thriller. We dragged every uninterrupted switch of character, because we were portrayed for the sake of the story and we are ready to enjoy this item more before we finish it. Yes, there are some good performances, especially in the psycho-supporting role of Blair Underwood, Fishburn and Ed Harris, but the story does not work until the very long anticipated ending from the beginning.
