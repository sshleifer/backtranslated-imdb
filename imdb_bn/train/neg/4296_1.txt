I said that this is the worst gay-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say that if I have ever seen a series of films. <br /> <br /> You know, which movie is to be troublesome when starting with a "personal note" from the director, for the first time the director asks for "understanding" of viewers to show "many challenges". The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow dialogue and it's from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor scripts, all of the bad acting, all add up to this "film" unwanted. I did not make it through the bad end after several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD I bought the speechless I am sure there is a lot of challenges for the first time. However, do not try to pump off this lame effort as a finished product. I see from IMDb's account that it is not only the first instructional effort in Richard Natale but it is the only one. A positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
