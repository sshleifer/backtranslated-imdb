Although 11 years of Catholic school is studying in Catholic school for 11 years, except for the wedding and funeral, 35 years of age do not seem to have been mass education. And I did. . . For the first two-thirds of the movie. It was all staff stuff - school education, harsh sexuality, etc. in strict criticism. But then, suddenly, the movie becomes an average. Really mean Now you think, I saw this pedophilia scandals before hitting. . . And if I could learn about those hateful things (such as a Catholic word!) And coverups, I would not have been very disheartened in such disgusting, disgusting digests of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> This is a few years after I rented the video, and I will not be able to rent again with the new rent again. It just left my face such a messy, ugly, ugly taste. . . I wonder what all actors have experienced with the Church, because they * really * hate it, or they whored themselves for the paycheck. This is an incredibly Catholic film, objectionable to glamor of respecting Catholic teachings. Which I still do because there is no good teacher in the '50s. Those Nana who did what they did, taught me to read and write English language. They remind us. (How many children today can do simple mathematical work in their heads?) Indeed, there is nothing else for success in America. Can you read? Can add / subtract / multiply / split? Great. You can get any advanced degree that you want. And the discipline of Catholic education is not like your study, but for the rest of your life, we do not even think about the Catholic "mythological story", just as it was to learn. <Br / <br /> <br /> Such a big cast, such as a weird, rotten script. I'm feeling really bad (and not, it's not "bad" - trust me for the author and the manager, and uns teaches me better). <br /> <br /> I thought there was mixed feelings in my Catholic school. But if the participants of this project are voluntarily involved in making this movie then they must have bad (ie, stupid) children who sit behind the house.
