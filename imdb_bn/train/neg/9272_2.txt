I recently decided to repeat The Woman Trilogy so that {{there is a monster music involved}} is a fourth place. I did not expect much from it, and that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you are watching bad movies for laughing it can only be a movie for you. Oh, where do we start? <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, the appearance and feel of the movie "Made for TV" was clear. The music is often matched exactly to what is happening in the film and hence (well) is confusing. This script was a mystery of the imagination of the 8-year-old imagination. But one thing must be said that the unscrupulous script matches with an extraordinary performance. Many scenes remind me that it was a script or a source of ridiculous acting. <br /> <br /> The story is very thin, focusing on all the crazy antics of Damian Thorn's daughter. By doing wrong and doing badly by acting nuns. There have been many instances of mysterious and deceitful deaths that personally reveal me as "drama" and throw the third party investigator into the whole matter. Later, through some medical events, Damien Thorn is born of Genre. And that pretty much plots up wraps up. Since the film is a neutral and / or ridiculous scenario, the whole thing is rather effectively implemented with a lack of suspension. <br /> <br /> Was there a lot of WTF ?! At the moment that provides unexpected comedy relief. For example, when the movie scratches in the face, what is the main reaction to the beginning of the movie? Very rarely a 360 degree-head turning omen. I laughed at the reaction on baptism. The baby tears, and everyone looks very anxious. The sad mother takes place outside the church and left the very dangerous when the priest crosses himself. is not it? Then there is a new old grandmother who has a blueprint on the cart to express alternative spirituality of 8 years old. When I laughed, laughing, when grandmother advised to bring the distressed Daly to a psychiatric girl, only then, to meet Honeymoon's friends and mother put her on her shoulder. "Yes, that glove, fill this strange mysterious 8-year-old girl with these mysterious things, that's good, I do not have to stay there." Of course this would be expected from a mother who would allow her daughter to take up the fully raised rootweller on the street, which might surprise the young girl as a sack. The whole scene of the psychological fair is frustrating like a riddle, from the terrible reactionary Straus in the heart of the brain near the brain, later to the volcano. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a "strange accident" Here we have a religious initiative, (which is described as part of a religion), who is playing in a whirling full hole, to prove that God's glory will protect them. He runs them and prevents snakes and bites it several times. Suddenly a strange accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The snake vs snake scene was not the only ridiculous death. A slow car accident caused the school parking lot to be reduced. Then the slow destroy explosion ball is directly led to the detective. I believe I have gone and made a coffee, when the slow pace again comes to see the "related" intelligence to wander towards the group. Then there is hostility that snatches shot-shots, where a gun is closed and both fear that they would shoot for a few seconds while exchanging scary eyesight. Then someone who was genuinely victims went tumbling down the stairs. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit weird and vain. He runs around to look at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this pretty painful, he finally collapsed, clutching his chest and getting killed. Apparently something is happening demonic, as is what this music had to offer. Ummm. OK. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that others have reviewed this image and, as a "fit series", especially. Non-sensic scripts, unrealistic, and inappropriate musical scores are hard to find. The film lacks a mystery, which provides tremendous sense of horror over Delia's "geological determination", which became boring after a little while. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is a bad movie that is unlikely to be a comedy with only the release feature.
