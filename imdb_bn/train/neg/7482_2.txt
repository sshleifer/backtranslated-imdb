This movie is not so funny - big big waste, who forget about themselves that they forget. Just like the hotel manager, you are wearing a jail housemaid, who is wearing hello helles, mink coats and danny hats when you dance to "bad girls" in Donna summer when almost out of your chair with helpless laughter. Rest: Forgive it!
