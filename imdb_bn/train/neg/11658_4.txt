The scary movie 2 is certainly the worst of four movies, because it does not have any plots, bad acting, quite tiring and some really impressive jokes. But then And it's a big but, a good actor, a good repetition joke, and a good start. Good actor Tim Curry, a good repetitive joke, frustrating, weird hammer, which always screams, but ridicules the right thing. And the good start is the spoof of the Excorist. <br /> <br /> The scary movie 2 plot is invited to stay at the host's main character from the original and a host of new characters along the way to the old palace, but will they survive the night? This image is not very good but if you bored you can see it!
