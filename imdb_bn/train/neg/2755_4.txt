It is a collection of clich√©s, united in straight lines, no visible plot or I have assembled without any suitable way of acting for a long time. Canabalize the scenes of Star Wars, Fire of Rhine, Godzilla, Link of the Ring and Harry Potter, it went on a full battle about viewers' intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie! <br /> <br /> Even if it is not less fun and gets the status of a culture as a comedy then the movie laughs. The trick is to establish a copy of the context regarding their real films. Gandalf fun conversations can be Korean, Basilisk snake sunny if looking like you compare with a kitten and can provide many back switch between evil hechchman solar and zaza-bing, or whatever its name. <br /> The following line: No pleasure from this movie is a director / writer, but completely dependent on the viewer's addiction and imagination. Bean, bean!
