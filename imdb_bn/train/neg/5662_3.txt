When I read most of the other comments, I think they were too light for this movie. I found it old Zatoichi movie after the spark was completely lost and after only the long absence from the screen that it is proven, it is good to be just things often. I agree with Star Trek's parable from other critics who compare the first Star Trek movie with the original series - millions of fans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the show and have been forced to see a soft and disinfection. Estimates of the roots <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not think of everything in blood (Especially truncated nose and shrinking head scenes). In addition, the time was not good for Ichir - he feels a broken and sad people in this picture (many, much more than usual) - and some fans of this series really do not want to see. <br /> <br /> Very sorry for this Jyotichi. If you are not like me and want to see every Jyotichi movie, it will not be missed at all. Check out one of the earlier versions or the 2003 all-new version.
