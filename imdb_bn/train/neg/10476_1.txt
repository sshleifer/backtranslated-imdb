I am a Christian. I have always been suspicious about movies made by Christians, however. As a rule, they are "know-nothingings" when they come to movie production. I appreciate TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did it a horrible job. Acting was terrible, and if someone is not familiar with the bible in some fashion, no one can understand what the film is trying to overcome. The film was not created terribly, but even some of those who made it were wrong. However, in this "criticism", those events are obsolete and delve in very deep. In short, I've seen the Omega Code as the greatest film of all time, and I would not recommend it to anyone other than the daily curiosity.
