I generally do not think about the huge amount of violence, or philosophy, symbolism or psychology in movies. This is very good with me and the film brings a lot to us. Especially the lake and nature, there is a good setting of characters, beautiful pictures in a good direction. This image can be voted as a good film. However, it has been lost for two reasons, and for both reasons, this image makes it annoying only. <br /> <br /> Firstly, violence has been used against living creatures to create this film. Not movie violence, I'm talking about real violence. If this envy is not fair and can be the number two reason; There was no neutrality about the intimate relation between movie message managers. That we do not have some real twists with all the women. (Men respectively). But the end of the movie destroys it all. Our heroine "finally dies" (If I think rightly here, I saw this movie years ago and it made me mad, now the man has brought a new movie magician. Must not be seen) and now it is more explicit that the ghost of nature, especially the nature of its sexual relationship, its tendency to nature .. Of course it is the director who "Kill" the heroine. Women will be killed, especially if men are drawn by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion of the final. ** End spoiler * Well <br /> <br /> Well, if my director myself will keep his vision well that would be better with me. But the big picture, the art instructions, for the use of cruelty of living creatures, only men can scare women and cruel to men and women. That's just not enough. When I watched this movie, I knew it would be "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and would get good critics for any method. But this picture is completely deadly to me.
