Greenchurch Thief How Christmas is a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone can easily enjoy, I've never seen the reason for a remake. A remix made with humans is not mentioned, the cartoon was perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But Jim Carrie looked somewhat unusual from the Greenwich. I mean, he's a great comedy actor, but like him? It just does not have any sense to me. Her performance was slightly up and unintentionally funny at the moment. Some of the Yoga Dialogue was not to mention a small child and enjoyable. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou ended and did not need to be. They really destroyed the story, the period. <br /> <br /> Everyone who is in the whistle is preparing for their best Christmas season, where everything will go completely. But Cindy Lou is bizarre and worried about Grinch and lives on them and he will not go as good as Christmas for others. He took him out and decided that he did not want Christmas this year, and actually he would have to steal Christmas together to show his version of Christmas what he had published. But soon he realized who knew that it was slightly more than the material version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> What was the need for Greenchurch's Christmas and a little more at the top. I really recommend that you stick to the cartoon with the simple fact that this is a pretty annoying version, at least in my opinion. The whole film was created and presented just a little more, how not to mention how Greenwich Christmas was stolen! Jim Kerber was meant more as a cartoon rather than a version of acting. But at least this version makes you grateful for every Christmas Christmas starring the Boris Karloff version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
