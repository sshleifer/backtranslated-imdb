Unfortunately I'd like to agree with the critics written by Halo's. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, dress, set, sound, editing and everything else is very good for a small film. It may seem surprising in the beginning but I was told that it includes tech crew professionals, so the quality should be expected. As a problem, as usual, the story lives within itself. <br /> <br /> Things are, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or movie case, show a story) you need plots and conflicts. You need the thing that happens to be dramatic: events. This is happening because the drama wants something and for some reason, he can not get it. Team Watcher has no problem or goal. He is a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind. That's it. So what we have here is a pure exposition. Instead of showing a story, we're just learning something about this Tim Wired personal. Of course, considering the timeless nature of Tim Walker and the film, it is difficult to give a sufficient background, so the movie resorts to voice-over-narration. In this case it is the information which is used in the worst sense, which is otherwise we never grill. In fact, if it is not for vor, we think the character was just looking at a fool, intelligent person. It also explains what is happening on the Vio screen to make it even worse! The pictures we see are only equipped for the text we hear. <br /> <br /> I can say that this little film will create a good video for the band or anything, but the images' stand on their own. It is impossible to say it. The measurement of the measurement of the technical skills of the crew is obviously worthless (incredible, but not good), but at least entertainment, entertainment, thriller or very few fail to show a story.
