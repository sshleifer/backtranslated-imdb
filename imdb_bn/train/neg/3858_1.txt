What horrible, horror, movie! I saw the worst movie in my life. I usually love these movies, all "a guy meets a warm woman whom he likes, but he can already be involved with someone who is not right for him ...." I expected something expected and I do not think so. Movies always entertain the right amount of romance with the comedy, but this is not the one! Every single comedy falls flat and "romance" wants to vomit me. The title character is the most "Please kill me" character that I have ever seen on my television, "Warm Woman" is not very radioactive, more radioactive and annoying. "Anyone else" is the most reasonable, mature person in this movie, but it can also be annoying. This movie sucks out of the plane, there is no way around, do not waste your time.
