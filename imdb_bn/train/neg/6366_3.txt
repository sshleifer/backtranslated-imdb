There was no single redemption factor in this movie. Girlfriend and I love both action films. Fight scenes in particular (Blood and kickboxer was horrible), but this movie was not entertaining. 20 minutes to talk about five minutes of activity and expression of "angry" face. The main hero is forced to see a boring character who has seen war and thus severely constipation all the time. The army hampered its intestinal movement to perfect its war strategy. Music is not good. They fight with street ropes and hip-hop styles, because these guys mock. Normal background sound of the remaining soundtracks of low budget dramas <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B-Style. Actors give their lines as they are sent from their coup cards, and the lines should be set in fire and some should be left in torn Hollywood allways. The film was called "Honor", but there was no respect for the film's creation. It was just a waste of money, and wisely spent what I think is honorable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> War scenes and situations are more realistic.
