This picture really has a good story kernel. Coast Guard men and women work, especially in the North Pacific region, heroes and legends. This film is related to three endings (not quite satisfied), some uninterrupted and pointless bar fights, and two alleged "romantic" relationships, which are much more spectacular than the dead campfire. The rescue scene is great - even if the computer generation is a hockey and the scene is quite outstanding - but backstory long and frustrating. Costner is well - especially played his hand (watch for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female character is one dimensional. One of the best female Coast Guard crew at the rescue center, and she is in the camera for about two minutes in the whole film. It can be a nice film - and costner needs one!
