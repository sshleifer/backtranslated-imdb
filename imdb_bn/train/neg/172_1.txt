Back to the cabin by the lake, in any way, stand up to the root. The only major character to return for the signal (Stanley), this movie is not even 2 hours of your time even valuable. I was a great fan of the first film, story line and acting was really good, but it's a movie I will not see anymore. It is basically equal to the urban legend and the sort of like Blair Witch, but with so many bad performances. I personally saw good acting in soap operas, it is very sad that you just have to laugh. I, by no means, recommend this movie to anyone, seeing this, it will only be reduced from the beginning.
