I saw recently created landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I could paint a photo as a photographer because I was a fan and a fan of Boutiniski. Although I believe the movie has received a good message from its message but I could not help but it seemed that it was created after the complete restoration of the photographs and the next popular book of BarTini's. One of the reasons obviously is the extensive use of photos involving juices and pans across them. This is a good effect when used economically, although I think the movie of 75% still remains from the book of Bertin≈Ñski (which I already own). It's probably a hug, but I felt how. If you are the owner of the book or you are familiar with its work, you can stop avoiding it.
