The Italian film of the 70's is not in the class with dog terrible, The Hawling, even the terrible American Werewolf in Paris, but ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching act actress, a stunning blonde, amok running in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity ... it is clear that he is a real blonde ... Huma Hama Hama !! The story is a hoot, SFX child-friendly, and acting (in the most part) stinks. The only release price for this movie is nudity and all of sex scenes (and there is a lot). Tame by HBO Standard, but still fun when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. Okay ... Spirir is here ... There is no heresy (except for the first scene of the heroine (??), the girl just thinks she's a Verbol ... In other words, a clinical leakantrop.
