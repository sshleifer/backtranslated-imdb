I was upset with the 10 minutes of this movie, for 30 minutes I had a blink of my toes - I just could not believe: The movie is really awful. Actually it was so awful that, I was just to see it all to be sure (!). At this time, I realized that it reminded me of a bunch of Danish so-called comedies in the 60's and 70's. The pattern is as follows: Take a very popular comedian, place this comedian in unusual circumstances as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners) and spice it with some beautiful young girls - that film, and you have a success! I do not know whether this movie is successful, but in contrast to the silent death of Danish tradition (think, some great comedians), there seems to be such a movie market in the United States.
