The lack of content of this movie surprised me. First of all though I'm going to compare that to people on that rock! But I really surprised myself that Rock On is worse than that! The story is so horrific fantasy Ajay Devban Salman Khan and jaming with Asin I have to be fun. The song was just fine, the movie track was bad! Vipul Shah still does not learn from Singh, the comedy of the critics of King King. Now Asin .. She came to be sorry for Asin's fan but she played badly in the movie badly, she does not look good in all the last stages of makeup! Go to watch Aladin with your family instead of ruining your time here in my final judgment.
