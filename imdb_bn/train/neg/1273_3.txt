I have two good things to say about this movie: The scene is beautiful and Peter Fawck gives a good performance (considering what he does with his conversations and directions). However, that said, I found this film extremely exhausting. The paint has become more entertaining to see the dry. It takes more than 97 minutes. At the beginning of the surplus sequence, where everyone is talking to each other and Paul Reyzer is repeating what the phone said, the film is annoying. The film is filled with clich√©s and shatiks for not mentioning the fakt events of Fakk's audience. Also, the director seems to have difficulty in determining whether to target smiles or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but they are all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, emotional, and "tricky" appeal to you, you love it. But if you expect something more for a substance, watch a different movie.
