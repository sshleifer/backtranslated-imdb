It seems to run exactly the form, that any movie starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know that the hole full story, or the dolph is such a bad actor. No spoiler here, he seems to push this movie and shoving and grabbing and touching things is overdue. In my opinion, it is a wonderful fact that in some of these projects, venture capital can be found in projects and theater.
