Oh Allah This was awesome. If there is bad, then this was. This movie makes no sense. It runs on all maps and it is not clear what it says. Music like it was trying to be like Batman 'Edison' is not a real city, it is taken away. As I live in Vancouver, I see this movie and it has become intolerable because of recognizing these places. Why are they not a real city? The only text was honest 'Tilman' which John Hared did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role and did not have the top and the camp. John Harrard was really shy to see a great bad guy, including many screen times, and smoking the film. very bad. Hope someone can see it important and at least give the Harold credits where the credit will be liable, and will recruit him as a bad person, where he may be. A list is over.
