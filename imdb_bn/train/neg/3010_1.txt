Holy Shaw * This was terrible God. I was sitting in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I was going to make my eyes harder at Manor opeepus rex. Dear God This movie is worth more than the middle school film buffer doing anything. Save your money, this movie can give you nothing. Until you enjoy leaning and sleeping in the movie theater. You know, H3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. You will be the only one there anyway.

It's sad
