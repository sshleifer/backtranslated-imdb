After watching the "Public Soldier" franchisee lower-budget shital versions, I hope and Van Dam is asked to re-establish his role as Luke Diorox in a second Unisol film. Well, I think this prayer has been answered, but I do not hope. Universal Soldier 2 is as intense as reading your local library poems. No, even that would be more playful. The sequence of battles is the top-genuine, Bruce Lee quality, which is the only release factor for this totally unfortunate excuse for a motion picture. That and the former WCW solid people legend playing "Goldberg" villain. However, as a lieutenant, he wanted to make Goldberg better. <br /> <br /> We were fascinated that the movie itself was that. It's like some film school students slapped together. The plot is bigger than the eagerness of the West, which is what the film really did. For example: Hilary, the daughter of Luke, feels at least 11-13 years old and the first film was only pictured seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me that! The partner of Luke was killed and the unissoyed piece was again strange! You want to tell me that at the beginning of the film there was an experimental Unison in the naked open at the foundation of the Research Complex. Come on. The director could spend more time with the film like the first movie, and all the plans were closed. But oh oh! <br /> <br /> <br /> plot, IT succes! Compared to the first film, Universal Soldier 2 plates down and watered vainly. United wonders about the tragedy of his desert where he remembers the last memories of a supermarket wreck? At the dawn of this Millennium, if you attract more to viewers, then it happened in the case of a Dosstepia / Orwellian future suspicion. The description of this sad, sad, sad sequel of Corny is defined accurately. <br /> <br /> From what I saw: Double Impact, Seed 2, Robocop 3, and even the cheap-ass / no class terminator in hell is more entertaining than non-off "Class of 1999"!
