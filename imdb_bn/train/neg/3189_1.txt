I went to prove that Joe Dawn would do something for a piece of unemployed. Starting with the concept of film was not very good. There is so much bad stuff about this movie where I do not know how to get started. Acting awesome Cinematography at the best time. The soundtrack was quite bad. Score terrible. This film ended in the mystery science theater at the end of 3000. I voted before writing it, and I can not believe that 9 people really think this "film" is excellent. They will have to choose two go-go dancers. They will lock the sticks in the movie vault outside of Wikilear to finalize and nobody will see it again! Out of 10 ratings, 1 is much better than this qualification.
