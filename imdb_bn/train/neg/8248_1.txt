There are more interesting Polish documentaries in spawning cultivation, brail_ !! Competition (insect farming) was a good plot and more interesting characters. I was physically ill after watching this movie. The deceptive husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. The poor Jennifer really needed work, and what was with the pronunciation !! Location and random meetings remind me of a high school, and show the 10-year-old humility in the cooking class. It was bad that I think "I'm not calling it a lazy" signals. Thank you for listening to it was a great weight to my consciousness.
