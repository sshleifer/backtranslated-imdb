A man like to know how to run a camera is the same as telling another story in a long line. Within 15 minutes, the entire courtyard was placed in just a few lines, so there is no mystery, which omits the whole aspect of this mystery. The only semi-hit actors have been killed for 10 minutes in the film, so we have left fooled things with the almost foolish character. Less budget movies can not bear costly special effects, so CGI parts are vaguely vague, but at least one valid attempt was made. The animal suite is awesome, as it falls on the sidewalk, and the director keeps the eye on the eye, which is not even the red color shown on mirror shots. The conversation is weird and uninspired, with some lines alien or terminator memorable. The last program is held in a police station, also a hide-off from the terminator, hidden in any of the glass-lined offices in the darkwall. Finally, the girl calls the protagonist "a good guardian", but she killed her partner, the real guardian, and at least three civilians, not to mention a dozen police, without a terrorist shot. Despite a surgery in Silver Bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the real clean-up for the bad writing: When they were holding red strips of red, they killed the animal at the beginning. Instead, they took custody ?!
