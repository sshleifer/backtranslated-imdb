There is no use only to try to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was straight up in the trash. In a very short period of time, you might think that you are in a visible stunning piece of cinematography ... and then you're hit with a big burlap of failure! The war is teetering only on martial, acting side edges, and the music description is not worth it. There are enough stories to create an excuse to create this movie. The decisions that make up the letters and how they deal with the situation are weak, and nothing disappoint me. I think this was the only reason for this film being used as a bit of fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
