I saw this movie of 2000's most annoying movie! Music fails to make doubt especially when people suddenly disappear. Martial law is also not treated with the necessary requirements. The story itself is in trouble: The UN can not only take power worldwide, because the United States will not only allow it but countries like China, Russia, Japan etc. will not be there. It will play against anyone trying to take over the world as Nikola Carpathy. This James Bond movie reminds me, only those who have more action! Naturally the movie is made for Christians and only for Christians and they can enjoy it. Since I can not count myself as a Christian, I think the whole idea is ridiculous. This prophecy seems to be more true, if it is believed to be true, by the cults for the end of the world, other prophecies are dangerously close. Why fear of such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth
