The movie is basically a Russian prostitute returning to his village village for funeral of a sister / friend. There are several other minor story lines which can be more interesting than actually being taken, but it is not fully searched. The main part of the movie is the future funeral of a community of Croon, awake and later controversy, which sells dolls and sells them for vodka, but has now lost their artists who can market their puppets. Apparently, the movie is unedited. From the city to village prostitution, an unreasonable train journey and trump with mud Perhaps that the integrity of the Russian landscape is supposed to print us out. Like a village, it is a descendant of the widow and a man, a dead girl's classmate. Dolls are problematic for all involved in running the business and are finally seemingly impossible. Most movies are shot with a handheld camera that can cause vomiting. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not include songs and lamps of cronies. If you are not honest in Russian, then do not go to this movie.
