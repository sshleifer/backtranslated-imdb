My thoughts in the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, there was nothing good. Apparently, it was great. I was pleased with the pensing, camera angle, etc., however, the characters? Oh, kinda soft. Plot? Sucked it <br /> <br /> This movie looked more stiff than a new age than anything else. Organized religion is presented as terrible and horrible. Science is not well-illustrated. It creates a giant weapon that kills everything ... but the power of "soul" is to destroy the monster and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my ass a little more. Here we have a CGI film ... made with science ... and they are using us to use this message that science will save us while destroying the world when it preaches the idea? At least they had the ability to ask a letter, <br /> <br /> "OK, so what now?" (Or something similar). I did not hear very well due to the sudden rise in the crowd and a break for the exit. It's a "OK ... it was just enough fun to sit here for the whole movie but now as soon as possible come out of here!" Exit type <br /> <br /> This is not a movie where you do not want to enjoy it, you can not think. Just look at the visual and nicely bow down to your head. Any thoughts, "What's that point?" You will suck out of disbelief and you will make exit marks with temptation. <br /> <br /> Okay ... Follow the Spokane. So, basically, a scientist "machine" is capable of creating another, intelligent, robotic life. The evil people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist understands that he also blamed. She gave her intelligence to the machine, but it did not give her heart. <br /> <br /> The machine goes to Skynet with the collaboration of humanity and the whole life on Earth disappears, eventually it gets stiff. However, scientists manage to survive and make walking sock-puppets. Each one, the scientist is holding a piece of spirit. <br /> <br /> The last # 9, wake up knowing something about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and it takes up. He met with another like himself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, the # 2 machine is captured by the last surviving robot. # 9 likes more of yourself and sets to rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> they succeeded <br /> <br /> # 9 gives notice that there is a composite hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserted it and the machine returned to life ... the process dragged the # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The film tries to resume its autobiographical homeland with the performance scene # 9. <br /> <br /> They finally succeeded and destroyed the machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go into the clouds. Then there is rain and we see life back to life. <br /> <br /> Hun ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not make any sense Not everything. Why the Hack Scientist Want To Split His Spirit 9 Homes? What did this achieve? Are they made to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine died! Why bothered ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why not create second intellectual machine, but fight with a "spirit" first. At least it seemed that it was a reasonable opportunity for success. <br /> <br /> Why did the machines suck their souls by machines and then release the soul to destroy the machine and then bring life back to life? Why do not just wait for the power of the machine and do not bring the rest of life without the madness?
