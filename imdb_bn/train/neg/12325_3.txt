I think that show. I still remember the fun song "America's Most Modest Man". In truth, it should have been heading America's hair or unreasonable or cruel hateful people. Dave could not save this show and the replacement hosts for Bob Sget or AFV did not come later. Jackalop's sections were lovely and yes Dave was better than Bob's of some good voice. But this event went to hell due to the language videos submitted to the people. It was also developed as part of the show with Lamson Twin Lum Guest Stars. As well as the AFV winner, it was chief of the children before the sin began to pick up the ugly drooling as children. Do I mention hateful videos and lam? But still rock the theme song!
