The battle scenes are slowly playing like Jackie Chan, and intelligence efforts are unfortunate (most often the worst punishment: "What do you think? I heard you this time"). A starring pair of stars: Brandon Lee, despite telling the horrific lines, he really showed signs of charisma and screen - which is totally free from Dolf Lundgren (at least in this movie) Note to the director: In the future, please stay away from the scenes in any love, especially when your main actress will not make any nudity and rely on your body twice as much.
