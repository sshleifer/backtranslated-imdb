In the light of the recent and well-baton bold and bold, now the mistake in Batman's life has been fatal. Being a huge fan since Team Burton's first resurgence 20 years ago, I was able to accept different types of tanneries in character, darkness or camp. This one is not credible: too much influence, poor intrigues and so few questions. What is remarkable about Batman, his expertise and diversity of aspects of his personality: intelligence, crime-fighters, players, charity etc. Batman shows him only in his Karate days. And anyway, how is the penguin able to do such virtuosity when jumping into the air regardless of its corpulence? And look at the Joker, the Street Fighter 2 blancker mix and a stereotypical rage, the Batman fan can accept such a rebellion? I'm not anyway Batman is much better than "article" in front of his name.
