I've rented a "new best friend" for a movie like "Gossip" and "The Cover", such as the weird Teen Thrillers. Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In View", where there is no thrill and the act is incredibly horrible. "New best friend" is annoying, and during filming the event is the same. Skip this movie ... it's time to waste.
