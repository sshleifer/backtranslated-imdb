We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have "rebel teenage girl", adopted white baby, and cute little baby. And we have a neglected housewife, is there a show house? Do we have a bunch of Brady bunch up? Yes! When it came out first, I thought it was really cool because I was mostly young. The music was bad. Raps were so bad and they were too g rated. All his raps were about his family and friends and problems. Like a dad "Danny to the flower house" like a father Always advised. But he was not a clean crack. There was a housekeeper for them. remember? Plot basically Lil 'Romeo was in some kind of trouble, not ... it's not. Oh and probably some print plays. Yes that thing is good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But nicodeplan can do better.
