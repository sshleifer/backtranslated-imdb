I was surprised to see this trailer on TV. In May 2008, I was on the Six Flags in New Jersey and it was shown by a 4-D attraction (you know, the attractions that move seats are transferred). I found that the version is a shortened version (15 minutes) and has been rebuilt to add motion effect. It was an intelligent movie ... but it was there. It was informed about the educational and the first mission, but a CGI spaceshow seems to be the last ... well ... trite I was not very fond of the movie, but I would recommend this movie that any parent would want to inform their first child in a fun way. I would say, character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves tricked So everyone, I would say, if you want to bring young kids ... go for it. But if you want to take your older kids away, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
