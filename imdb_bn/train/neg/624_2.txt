Director Behind-the-Season said in the feature that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he also dedicates this film to Dario Argante as well as other notable directors like Georges Romero and Tov Hooper. Originally dedicating this film to these great directors is a part of your mother's sh * t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. People can do that law. Also, do not throw a 40-year-old man wrongly about the misunderstanding, for 18 years of rewards. All right, he has been in high school for 22 years. When people see their boyfriend, their reactions become leakage in their hearts. Or in one part when a person tears into the ear with the ear (he gets it), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh .. my .. God?" Scarecrow himself is quite a character. <br/> <br /> This movie has a redemption factor ... Oh wait, do not it <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is more than just watching the Rock and Roll trailer in the DVD. It has a cover about everything and a really gnarly song dude.
