I thought before it could be a good one before starting with this movie, but when I started with it I found it really terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think that 95% of the film shoots India. You can see Indian made cars. You can drink Hindi Bislari (an Indian water brand) written on the street, you can see the temple in Afghanistan * Ha * It's really fun and much more proves that it is not shot in Afghanistan. I think it should not waste his time while watching this movie .. Pure time wasted .. I would suggest something else instead of watching this movie, or maybe it seems that the heart is a good idea but does not waste time
