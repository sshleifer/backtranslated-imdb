This was to be one of the worst movies ever. Kate looks and watches with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping ... So Hollywood. There was another bad scene when Kate was running her hand on her legs, and she seemed to be testing the texture of the pavilion. Andy's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not communicate with them or feel the love for each other. But the other two women were very good and were underhanded Andy. However this was such a camping movie. I usually like these films but I could not enter this movie. A much more promising situation and Andy's acting did not help the film. Also, he is all anus. Lancome looks glamorous in commercials because of its makeup with a clay knife.
