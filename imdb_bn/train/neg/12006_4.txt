Well, director love love is actually waiting for his second half after the director Nikhil Advani is released with KNNAH <br /> <br /> He creates 3:30 hours of film which gets lost with patience, time. 3 hours sleeping on this picture <br /> <br /> Okay, they had 6 stories so why was it necessary? 6 stories <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have an anil-eyed story but do not show the story of annoying TV serials? <br /> <br /> Govinda-Shannon's story is funny and works well with us. <br /> <br /> Our Akshay-Ayesha story is rea reliable but soon gets annoying and focuses more on comedy and That's a very tedious boring comedy <br /> <br /> Our Salman - Priyanka Story is the worst, not just the acting conditions, it's all at all <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Sohel-Isha story tells us to make you laugh Most of the story is set by the senior Bong Thank you. <br /> <br /> We have a good story in all public life stories <br /> <br /> But at the time, all the stories are broken into pieces, the viewers are disturbed and sleepy even if Climax is not appealed. Especially Salman's climax- Priyanka's story is the place for the management of Nikhil Advani, some stories are well managed, but poor places (SELs) are good, but many songs are cinematography. Each story is given a different look, a texture, and it works <br /> <br /> After the dismissal of actor Govinda, Bibi, he really laughs at you and loves him in this film despite his age and weight, Although Anil Kapoor does his good work. He looks in shape and tired John part of his part, Akshay Khanna overacts for a change <br /> <br /> Sohel Khan is too up and Isha has fired Anjana Suknani for nothing to do ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, a model you feel like throwing something on her, she ends up well, Buddha is good, good joha chawla is okay Shannon is okay!
