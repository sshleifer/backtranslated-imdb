There is some sadness to see something that tries to do something very good ... and ends up being medium. I was thinking about playing Jordan to baseball, but it is also applicable to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie has been well-played and directed, but the script is a stinger. Martin has done a great job in adapting a classic story in a comedy of "Roxanne", but Victorian drama in the contemporary scene throws this effort directly into the wall of impossibility. If you want to see an old story updated with some style, "great expectation" is the best of the rent.
