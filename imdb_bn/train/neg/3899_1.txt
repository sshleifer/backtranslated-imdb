Where do I start? I hope some details according to the title of this movie, I finally left it. This story is based on some real life characters, not the story of Lull Anderson or song Lily Marlin, but it's a Hollywood (or choose your hobby for film making) story. When I played the role of German in German, I heard a heavy English accent when I had a source! Blood was the second tone of the red text (title, artist). The story line is enclosed (not to be cheated by Rolph Laborman's parents in Switzerland, Liberman has no information that helped steal the Jews of Germany, the original song was not recorded outside the control of the NS regime, when under control, the record was not in Vietnam Time stays in the stadium, when there was a lecture there, etc. etc.) Clothing is poor and inaccurate (the SS black uniform used in the staff positions from the border guards, used everywhere, they used to go away from the day after the start of the fight, etc.), the characters were stereo type (they were out of power once a club's SA bullies). Do not waste your time.
