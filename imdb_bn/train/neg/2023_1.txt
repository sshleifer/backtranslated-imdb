As a summary, you only made an unconscious comment that I've ever heard at an RPG. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you bothered If you go to save your best friend and someone decides from the goodness of his heart to help you, you are in serious debt to that person. Lavitz was a good man, and every time he helped each other and they were closer to their friends. They were not gay buffs like you bitching about. And let you know what is set to play in a medieval period. Nevertheless, men fought only men's food. Even you know your history? How do you know the acceptance of women in the army this day? There are many realities in this game, though it can be detected very slowly and in order to explain the story, you have to find some difficult evidence rather than some unknown concepts based on your confusing task.
