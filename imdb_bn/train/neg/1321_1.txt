Richard Dreyfas is not a star here. He is about 20 20 seconds in Kyoma and Jean Barry is doing this movie? No idea, the director is probably his brother! This makes any sense in a movie. Inactive writer / director (same father) has pronounced everyone's talents with his terrible work ... job. I can not complain so I got the DVD for a penny! But it is weird! And it makes you feel weird and not well. It was 70 and it seems that the director wanted to feel a bad acid trip and everyone wanted to be inside his head. It has a slightly interesting and controversial idea, but like an annoying record, it keeps on fast folly. It has a fold of "acid mansion family". <br /> <br /> I do not know how I got all of these critics from this movie? Maybe they work it back when? At any rate, prepare to reduce your life by 80+ minutes, you will never come back. Yes, it's awful!
