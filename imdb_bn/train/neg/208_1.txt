Ramones are awesome films with bit bits. Compared to the 1980s 80/80 comedy format, your bad schools take the school with some scary plans. This movie is terrible. In this plot there is a girl who hates the school to fight against Ramones and their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and if you want an entertainment B movie then see guitar wolf acting something like wild Zero. Horror act, horror writing, terrible plot with Ramon's approval stamps, who probably needed some money, said yes in this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think of because the movie hits it.
