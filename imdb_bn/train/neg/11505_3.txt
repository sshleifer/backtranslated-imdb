This picture reminds me of Kenith, "The Admirable Criton" from 1957 onwards, "He was a servant above the boat and returned to work after the island became a master." Madonna decided to do some pictures but this is not a picture. This shows that Madonna can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure whether it is a fine copy of "Criton Critical" but it seems definitely It is like this and if that was the case, then Hollywood was going out of the ideas and it is tragic, providing a platform to improve their career profile for the actors and it only fails in every corner and detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose and The actress is mediator.This place should have been done through the scripter before the transfer. Condemned Madonna to do so, I thought I was in the movie "A Lee League of the Custom", which is very good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" is showing a curiosity of Madonna's style is not shown in front or behind. Other Madonna movies are not enjoyable And I liked seeing the Madonna Animation series with the character of Halo the Girl. I like music from these two films, but "moving" is broken into pieces and it remains here. <br /> <br /> Everyone has bombs?
