Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. He croons so well, so well dances, and throws himself in the part so it just seems to him all the more awesome. At her more cutesy moments (with the girl at the train station, with Rosie final number), I could not close her eyes. She was so annoying. You're hoping to leave the job of a nice guy and start graduation. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. However, if you see a movie of Stage Musical, 1963 film and this 1995 movie, you will see three editions which are more amplified (different songs, different characters and same songs given in different situations) I have never seen musical instruments compared to any other.
