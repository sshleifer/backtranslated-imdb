When you have already invested an hour in it, a movie is completely different from the end when I absolutely hate it. And that happened with this film. I was plotting by the fact that his actor and material wrote his source stories. I'm not going to read that story, but I can not imagine that this movie is over. Fortunately, I did not pay or pay good for rent because my library was in it. Oh, such a waste of excellent work (especially the wife was so perfect). But Milio O'Sha as a Jew? !!!! Now that's funny. I researched her creation but acted as director, her morph was lost or 3/4 people died through the film. Before that point, was developing a story and letter, there were several clear plot points and not too much time was lost. But oh that last 1/2 hours- if it was not the most screwiest, most worthless denouement I've ever seen, I do not know what. I hate when one's belief is so overwhelming; It seems like a work of violence.
