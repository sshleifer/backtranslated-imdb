Death will happen in many wildlife. Do not worry that you will be the rocket scientist! But would it be a nature documentary focus? What is the estuary with horrible death? Do we really see an adult elephant cut with a pack of hungry lions? Or, a leopard grabbing a gazelle, by slowing down, not less! I thought it was going to be a family-friendly film! <br /> <br /> And why, do not you have the courage to show the horror of the brave movie trailer? <br /> <br /> In general, in comic refresh fashion we see the celebration of the great bird-paradise with the most annoying and foolish descriptions of mankind. It was too much! It seems that the filmmakers believed that they were only traveling to the first and second grade schools! How nice! <br /> <br /> <br /> If any future documentary filmmaker is waiting for filmmakers to read this film review, then why not focus: Animals actually compile; Giving birth; Lay eggs; Bathing; Sleeping Cleaning each other; Socialization; Playing; Psychological display without fear and anger; Unusual behavior, like brooding face; Migration; Problem solving skills; Culture (yes, many animal species have human call culture); Communication skills; Parents, healing powers, etc. In other words, stop paying attention to violence or spoil the beauty, and why should it not be more round - instead focus on joy and inspiration?
