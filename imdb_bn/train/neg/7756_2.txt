When I remember watching ATTACK it came first and recently caught it again. Science fan channel runs bad, but not by many. Jurassic Park's shameful RIFF replaces Sabbatoth Cats for ATTACK dinosaurs. And they are loosened, devouring as soon as possible as possible. CGI is quite bad, and prosthetic cat head closeups are ridiculous. We get some gore, which helps a little. Until you see the mad scientist who got this whole mess started. Too few work, except for Robert Carradine, Cast unknown. Apparently this Fiji is shot. Excellent job you can get it. Those low budget monster STVs who are popular in the 80s and 90s remind me.
