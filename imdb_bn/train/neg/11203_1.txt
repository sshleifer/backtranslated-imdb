The screen writer weakly tried to recreate "Exorcist". But some blah-baho love stories that make you sick instead of being involved with you. There is no substance in this whole film. It is likely to be something special. But some do not show a person, so nobody thinks about it. Very annoying, when I was leaving the theater, I had to bear the pain of the movie so the movie ticket was expensive. <br/> <br /> They use computer graphics here which instead of carrying me (as I would like, hate CGII) simply destroyed the movie. Some people say that the movie has done terrible things in the theater, because it was "thought-provoking" and "slow-minded-because it was an intelligent movie". The story is essentially when cute or thoughtful beautiful boy who has a love interest in those lasers as a priest and violates his religion? Feel like an uninspired concept. There are some mumbo jumbo about oh and "sin-eater" (the movie is going to be titled "sin-eating"). The concept of lam but the film has taken the "sin-eating" issue very seriously, it has become confusing and confusing about how dark and intelligent the film was. Yes, I know that in the medieval times there was a real sinful person, but this movie makes it just delicious. <br /> <br /> Nothing has been done properly in the film and I have forgotten why I am also bored to watch this movie. If you really want deeper movies then see any one of Rosemary's children, The Tenant, Necked Blood, Society, Canyon Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Woman, or Romero "Dead Trilogy" movies. Nonsense dialogue intelligence is not equal to people, mainstream filmmakers think that even though (similar people think that a ridiculous film like Haq is the best creation of a movie). If you want mind-numbingly annoying horror, see the order. This movie church seems like a roller coaster ride.
