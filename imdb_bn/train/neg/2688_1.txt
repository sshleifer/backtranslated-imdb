To avoid confusion, let me clarify several things: I am not a red neck. I'm not even a moderate, a conservative. On the contrary, I am a fundamentalist: a Libertarian. I am not a Wasp, I am not even born in the state. <br /> <br /> George Lewis Borges said that there are some people who do not feel poetry and these sad people usually earn their living teaching poems. This movie was made for people who do not feel poetry, for the rally and for them; And I say, for people who do not feel impartial or respect the life or death of another person (especially when most of the victims are considered 'bloody imperialists' on Yankee soil). Find the 11th episode, the 11th episode of the 11th episode, and the main marketing concept of 11 episodes of a frame, mainly as harmful and annoying. Just plain horror Why did not they allocate many dollars in this competition, because people were brutally murdered in this attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between sheer stupidity and lazy fascism. Anyone who is serious about filmmaking (and serious about life and death), should be denied denial to participate in this flirtation of non-violent and non-series. With two exceptions: Burkina Faso's episode - almost funny -, and one from India - whose claim is a story based on the story of a person who was related to the attack and was investigated unfairly, then 'did not come back home and he was an American Muslim (And the truth is said, when the events were known that he was honored as a hero). All other nine episodes, indispensable and extremely annoying and emotional, can be listed in two categories: <br /> First: 'I'm not worried about thousands of victims: Americans, foreigners, children, young people, adults, old Timer ... 'and the lack of pure annoyance and emotion can be started again. Machamffe (Iran); Of Lelouch (France) ?? I'm afraid that I'm going to do a heresy from Lilouch, but perhaps his episode can be made with the idea that can be considered as the main; Tanvic (Bosnia-Herzegovina); Gonzalez Inatra (Mexico); Gitai (Israel); Pennies (United States) <br /> <br /> Second: 'bloody yankee deserves it'. And may be restarted in despair and hatred. Chahain (Egypt) has committed suicide bombings; Considering the illogical attack of 9/11, the Chilean dictatorship, led by Syrian killer Augusto Pinocch, was punished for hardlinest support in the United States, in fact, someone should be told that the victims of Pinochet were not al-Qaeda and Chile was a South America's only country which should have been ignored Mr. bin Laden It must also be told that the American government's ban against Chile's dictatorship was more difficult than any other country; And, Imamura (Japan) said in the air that WWII is related to the attack of WTC. Imamur was at least consistent with: The link to the effect of the reasonable reasons is completely helpless, which plays well with his episode, of which it is considered to be a snake. It's going to be unclear. This, instead, quite ridiculous <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The censorship of the censorship. Nothing else from the truth: this movie was not shown on the US screen because it was totally embarrassing. A fiasco of horror kind Even Buenos Aires, where the other forms of perineism and fascism are the closest and the most loved of the heart of a large number of people and the American anti-American progressive, the film was shown in the living room in the early theaters, and was praised by a very selective public: Some of the sad sad Those rules Other equally critical of their "vague" lends glossy. Macdonald's fast food restaurant's perspective or patchage, an elderly Jew, is being burned.
