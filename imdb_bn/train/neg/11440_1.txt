Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and I mean never. In 10 minutes, both my wife and I became annoyed with our mind. Not to mention annoying, it's completely incredible. Women (non-lesbian) do not bath together - nor do they kiss "accidentally". Brothers and sisters do not live well together in the 30's, and together they dance together and are involved in the footsteps of the central park. The men kissed the night before marriage and did not find their wives and sisters, and then did not discuss the wife. Absolutely ridiculous <br /> <br /> Haider Graham is perhaps the worst actress in the film. She should cry and should be opposite to her when she smiles. The only movie he has performed in Bugi Nights - and that is why he is not acting. <br /> <br /> I can not control how bad this film was.
