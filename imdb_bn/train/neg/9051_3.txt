When I discovered it was found, I was very excited! I could not wait to see it What a waste of energy! This is the kind of annoying CD that you find behind the rack of your local music store with your favorite band. Having a hard-core fan was sure you had a valuable invention of it. But once you've heard it, why did the dog ever make it onto a real album. This DVD is recommended only for 'endorses' who completed everything from Lynch. "Six men getting sick" is somewhat interesting but brief and repetitive visual. The lack of next job in Lynch, this "Grandmother" is simply an amazing act. It's tiring and looks like a student film. But it was 70's ... it's only interesting if you hope to mona psychanalyze director. But you can briefly see some of its trademark images and seeds of words. "Alpahabata" forgot (no fact! I can not remember it completely!) "The Ampute" is meaningless. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is just plain savvy. The "Lumiere" bunch is the only one suitable. Without the dialogue, Lynch tells a boring story comparable to his best work. I had to watch this one on multiple occasions. But it runs less than 2 minutes. The problem of hiring or buying DVD is rarely worth it.
