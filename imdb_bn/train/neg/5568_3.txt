Dolf Lundgren is a former police / bomber-like star who discovered a strange view of Boston, who killed his brother, who had thought well in this community, even though how he learned how his brother enjoyed strange sexuality and how the serial killer blames him. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, on the basis of his performance, here the role of fame associated with the activities of Landgren will be forgotten. The material that does not give anything to work with Lundgren, in fact, Lundgren completely drips in a drary thriller, which is both expected and unconscious. Co-star Daniel Brett is also good, in fact the movie did the best work at the heart of chemistry at Landgren and Brett, in fact the film took the time to explore their relationship, but the film was fairly good. However, the film is unthinkable, the action is not existent, but the plot is not enough to investigate (more boring BS in the investigation of his brother's employer's Lundgren), and the film is unreasonably ridiculous and ridiculous. Again, Lundgren is really good (as new adventurous Daniel Brett), but the film simply comes down from a sequence, which makes the film particularly frustrating. Although something else, it shows how Underground, as Lundgren as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out 4- (poor)
