When hen arnold! I came to the air in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episode started to show again, so I was tired of waiting for the new episode and stopped watching it. I was surprised when I heard about Harry Arnard! As it seems to be popular as one of the niklodian cartoons such as Spaniobb Skinnerpants. However, there is nothing to do, I went to watch movies anyway. I'm going to the theater, I was not expecting much. I was just expecting a movie version of a children's cartoon movie as expected. I guess I guess what I got. It was a stupid Kiddie movie and something more. There were some good parts here and there, but in most cases, the movie was a stinker. Just for kids.
