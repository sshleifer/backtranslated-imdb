Promotion Night 2 is a great movie, but Prime Night is better, and in 1957, queen Mary Lou died by her lover, and returned 30 years after revenge for the movie. Best Actor in this movie, Michael Innersaide, and the film star, other actresses and actress Justin Louie (I), Wondi Leon, Lisa Skeze and Richard Montt (I) actress. And Mary Lou is trying to hide her locker that girl Mary Lou, while gathering lockers in some good gore scenes, and how to be a student on the computer and Mary Lou gave him the death penalty. All these are a good / good horror film and my rating is 4 out of 10.
