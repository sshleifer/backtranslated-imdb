I'm not usually saying that watching a movie is not worth it, but it's definitely a wonderful situation. The only true source of this movie is Cornellia Sharpe, rather interesting, and this film is really short. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is incredibly annoying and almost never goes anywhere between film. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why Shan Connery has agreed to do this film on earth, but he must have surely passed this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Howard Shawn Connery fan and simply want to see everything he done. Save this one for the last <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was done. Thanks for reading.
