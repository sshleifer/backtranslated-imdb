* Spears * If you have not seen this movie then do not read again <br /> <br /> Stand up after depression "Phantasm II" has ended; Tall man kidnaps Mike, when the rugged and new baby team tries to bring him back to the majority of movies and does not end up being slaves in the Tall Man's "Red Planet". This one really gets stupid: the thieves in bright pink toilets were only for comic relief, and black karate chick (her name could not be remembered) was so annoying her character could not wait to see if I killed the man. This often shows that it is going to be the character of the team, who has been late and finally the hero, but ... it does not work as such. At the end of this story, Lease's killer has been titled by midgets, Mike gets a silver sphere transformed on his forehead, the spheres get reggae, and the dunes gets the team, and there is no one to stop the collision man. The bad guy has won - how does it end up surprisingly now? <br /> <br /> It was illustrated in 1993 and was exempted until '95, and in the end it was time to end and although it was frustrating and anticlimactic it was a suitable and suitable end for this strange little series. But the fourth changes this finishing and adds nothing more, but also adds worse jokes, even worse and more nonsensical finishes ... <br /> <br /> * ****
