I saw this picture yesterday night, but really was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> Other than 'combo' I thought the performance was poor and the story was limited. It came across like a 'made for TV' drama. <br /> <br /> I felt that this movie was very surprised. Initially, the entire setup of hammering (yes, we understand that these 80 Britons - you can stop now) was tedious and highlighted the way in Britain's 80s decade of life - juxtaposed with poverty, war royalty, Margaret Thatcher, yet Nothing in between? In fact, there were medieval people who were present - a common wage and a common man with mortgages. Falklands clips seem to have been randomly added in the end, for the 'dramatic effect', I think. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events has been broken down, because the characters have taken one after the other, we have seen how their psychologists can change so rapidly. <br /> <br /> There was a relationship between 'Shawn' and 'Smell', to-curling. I could not even see snogging during the scene. I believe it is very difficult that he attracted a boy who was not very young, but was too young. I know there was only four years among them, but once you reach your twenty years four years after nothing is nothing, yet it is a huge difference in your terra! In my experience, the difference in age of such teenage occurs only when the girl is small, because the girls get very mature and the boys of the age group are more than the wavelength. Sorry, but I bought it - unnecessary plot points made for shock quality. <br /> <br /> The last few was a sudden and again, it was added. If the phenomenon of flapping the flag is considered iconic, then my eyes have diminished. <br /> <br /> It makes me wonder that British films are concerned only with high class or poverty-pitch. Do not make me wrong, I like trainings, and there are four weddings in his fine, but can not we create Brights with anything else? Why is our movie hanging on the class system always? I was born in 1973, so in 1983, 'Shaw' was not much different than the age. I grew up in single-parent families, in the Free State Council of a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were different for filmmakers - I also did not remember the problem of racism (although I'm not saying it did not exist). 'Is it England?' I have no experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I think this film was lacking in the material, and I was completely annoyed and completely incomplete.
