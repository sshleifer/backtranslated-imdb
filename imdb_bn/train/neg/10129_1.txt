I could just find the words to utter utterly horrific release of this picture. I was sold to Segal and Stilth Biman for the commitment to work, which usually creates a recreational action film. I can honestly say that instead of looking at this picture I would like to raise my eyes with a cocktail stick. It was almost funny that the acting was so terrible. The story was very weak, the holes in the plot were so deep that you could fly an F117 through them. The script was so poor, if I knew that the 10-year-old wrote it but should not be surprised at least. So in the direction and production of amateur, I will not even hire this person to shoot my worst enemy wedding video. Lift dryer. Those responsible for the making of this film have made the industry cheaper, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segel will never again show his face, I can not imagine that he has agreed with this star, which I saw the worst movie of my whole life.
