Al Pacino? Kim Basing? Tea Lenny? Ryan Onel? Richard Shiff? I had water in my mouth. I just dropped everything to watch this movie. I was having problems while awakening in 30 minutes. 60 minutes and I hit the record button and fell asleep. The next morning it ended watching. Should not be disturbed. An interesting story of "The In The Life ..." which is a great cast and what is the dissipation of an idea? If you have it and see this movie then cure your insomnia. I guarantee you at least one hour and uninterrupted sleep. The dialog is awesome Endless existence The camera work Super 8 was completed with a hand held and looked good. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
