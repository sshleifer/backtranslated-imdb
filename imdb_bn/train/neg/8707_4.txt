This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I rent it as a joke, expect to get a giggle from the first few scenes, and just tell me I'm not so hard at my life. One of the most incredible fun stupid action movie moments in my life was the first scene where Ninjas popped out of the air randomly and started to fight a huge and ridiculous fire. It's not a dinosaur movie, but a movie that makes fun of action (and does not mean). I have not seen the first two, but I'm thinking of the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed a lot. If you want to see a great movie with six packs or any bodily remedies, then I hired this movie and come back and see 100 years of progress in the film and return to the trash and get a shot from Kornosaur
