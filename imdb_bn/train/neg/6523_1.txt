Please take a minute to read my complete review. I'm not copying the film itself - only DVD versions are currently available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really want to give this picture even two stars. I mean, how could it possibly get only 1 in 10 places? <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's how to historically accurately fight scenes of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace", an adaptation of the epic film, courtesy of Red Army, and the scenic scene of the novel, but it will be difficult for seven hours. Should be sitting within - if you were watching what you saw <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem you do not see is the film - as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I am trying to see the RusCiCo DVD version - the best version of its box from the box box has been widely considered and restores deleted scenes from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> However, it is one of the worst movie prints to be moved to DVD. The film is foggy and inappropriate, often strobing. If you have cracked your brightness, color and photo level, it is almost tolerant. But the problem does not end. <br /> <br /> The word is incompatible, it is unreasonable for others to aloud with others like light. For <br /> and languages, this is a big problem for English speakers - there are some good actors in the dubbed option, and some horror people who are played and parts of the movie are not only dubbed, Russian and French slipping back even randomly . <br /> <br /> Subtitle option is not very good. Subtitles do not appear under the picture, but on top of it - some beauty of beauty (or the rest of it) is hidden. Furthermore, subtitles are often a bad translation (shame that the script suffers to write to the actual words of the script), and the subtitles also seem to be only drop out in the parts. So, if you maximize color, brightness and image settings and start the volume system and choose subtitles * and * English dobbed, you're still going to get a movie that looks boring and can hear. <br /> <br /> What could be the benefit of doing so? It could be possible, but for seven hours - who could stand for this long period? Maybe somebody will come together and recover it - and maybe I can see a wonderful composition - but for now, I can not just give more than one star which I can stand in first 12% philosophy I have been.
