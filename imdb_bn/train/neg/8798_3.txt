I have a vestige in a movie which is at least a story. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes with no solidarity. <br /> <br /> There is a view of a pineapple canad collector. A woman with a blonde wig does not remove her sun glasses. At the beginning of this movie, this woman shot other people and we could not find why. He disappears completely after about 30 minutes. Another Coca-Cola woman who is constantly cleaning a person's apartment. The Fast Food era has endless scenes where Mamaas and Papas 'California Dreaming' are exaggerated (I liked the song). The dialogue is most concerned about food (pineapple, chef salad and drinks to order?). I think most actors have earned weight during this movie because many fast food was eaten. <br /> <br /> There is no emotion in this film because there is no story. It's completely romance - it's not that kind of thing. I'm surprised why I did not hit forward fast. I keep waiting for something important to happen ?? It's not Perhaps the only comfort in this movie has moved so rapidly in the scene that it seems to be fanatic that it was for the disclosure of all the confidentiality.
