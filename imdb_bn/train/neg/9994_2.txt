Hmmm, a sports team plane crashed into a snowy mountain, and faced with difficult decisions to eat their dead companions to survive. Anyone known? I mentioned "Alive" since 1993. Of course, the only big difference here is that a large, white, drunken scary of pilgrim shows several times to drag the dead. I think it is better than Yak than the people. Fool: The man in the first scene does not have any reliable firearms during the pilgrimage, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> Flat Crash Full Cats. It exploded in the air, when it hit or detached the ground. People could not survive, but hey, it's science-fi. <br /> <br /> Fools: They survived, and they cold.
