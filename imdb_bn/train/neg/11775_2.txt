When I was watching "Croco" I liked to leave the movie for the first time in my life. I would not recommend seeing this movie: Flat main characters - Not really any development. The Croco characterally maintains an extreme metaphor for the German problem, with which there is no possibility of significant involvement. Uninspired actors, non-developing plot I think the film has tried to conduct an environmental survey but did not succeed: cone appeared instead of being sent to the camera. The pictures are low - contrast, gray and dark - I'm definitely deliberately but the elements were not connected to the firm belief of social milion. While the story was potentially possible, it could create a good little story.
