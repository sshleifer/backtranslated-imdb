This is the only enjoyable thing about this extremely funny movie that "guess" location is playing. The Toronto Landmarks stand for American / International positions. <br /> <br /> Who knew that anti-Christian would be Russian? Obviously he can not be American because we need yank for saving the day - oh bok ... you tell us all the truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way out of the building to get their way to the nasty opposition christers. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Believing they are not enough to expect such another! We will not be praying.
