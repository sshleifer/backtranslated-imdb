I understand that I've reviewed the picture I've reviewed. I have realized almost all the nudity and cows from this film, in this way it is completely neutral. Seeing names like Anger Lynn and Jena James, I knew that I'm not going to get a terrific classic, but very rarely I hope to expose boobies and bloodhedhed. But no, it could be the most harmful modern horror movie, I mean that in some scenes it is easier to say anything more, 'but they suddenly cut off, or the scene ended just like the beginning. How to screw up a cannibals' and porn stars? I mean it to a winning source, because if the director sleeps with some executive wife or something, it literally surprised how amazing it has been cut from. A few years ago it was able to read Fangoriya, I was excited, it looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately the true movie is locked in a vault anywhere, and we must bear the Evil Bread to recover this seed. Hopefully, one day the Android cut will be released, as I think there is a good movie in this problem, but unless you have taken twelve packs of Buddy, you can make it through this movie.
