Alienator set up an interesting premiere for the first 20 minutes or so (I'm not sure how long I actually watched so I was seeing it in PS2). I do not think I saw a slasher movie like a splinter from another planet. However, interest soon becomes unbelievable because you realize that 'Alien' is a huge bodybuilder of a steel bikini. Yes, the alienator is slowly ridiculous. I do not think I'm against it. In the shock-awful world, patently humorous can often be a good sign. However, all the movie's stupid stupidity is really going on for it. Funny as the alienator's heck, but it's the highest order is a shambolic suckfest. In failed attempts, the performer Happy, the possible genius lines of the Pure Cheese dialogue are frustrated with the inefficiency of the incompetent, and the side fails to add even one or two decent set pieces. At the end of the film, you can only see the original idea that it is fairly consistent with Tipp. <br /> <br /> Add that the 'alliance' kills people just as evaporates, as opposed to a 'slashing' and good ideas to you are the great ideas that are thrown out on the street. You laugh at the alienator, but not with it. If this is your thing then go ahead and check it out.
