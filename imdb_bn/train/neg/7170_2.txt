Yikes do not blow this movie. The letters were weak, the plot weakened. I think it can be very bad because it has Christopher Walken, hello. He did this because he needed to bored and money. The letters were supposed to be Irish but nobody had an Irish accent. I'm strictly trying to find out something about this, but I can not take Waken along with doing a good job with the wooden character. Look for something to read or watch, never see this movie.
