(Supremo domination) Russian imagination "worker" (and I'm using a short word) that I've been trying to look for more than a year. I finally got to the end and now I do not want to try again and again. <br /> <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life, I'll tell you a plot - a man who has a long blade from his own hand. The ability to return to his mother. After being beaten by an old girl friend Mafia lover, she became ugly. She brings the girl home when she takes revenge. The boys send their man to the mafia mother's revenge, the police also tried to find him. <br /> <br /> Very rarely called. Any explanation is really given for something (as they lock the ID girlfriend in an asylum) and the most part of the action is all off the screen. The film is basically a person who looks sharp and does not say anything, killing people (screen closure-most of the activity screen closes). It looks good, has been played well and there was a good reason for what was going on in it. Hell, I liked some ideas for the development of real character or back story (we all know that the boy was selected as a child). The movie runs good part of two hours and it seems like six. If they were not going to tell us anything, but at least speed it seemed that it was running very fast. Instead we get the hero on a boat. Hero of a bus, walking the hero, watching the hero bothered. Hero with her girl. This really bothered me because I think it could be a good film if they could do something only or somebody else would rather say something rather than pointing to "get this guy". <br /> <br /> About four hours (my efforts to see all of this) I will not get back. For those who just want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little steps
