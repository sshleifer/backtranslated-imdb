This movie I saw is the second worst movie (the first being Ghost Rider). There is no other big story needed to illustrate any stories, measurements, conflicts, or any stories. This 'film' is basically another excuse to show Toby Keith as well as the 'real tough guy'. I completely waste my time watching this film. The best part will be the last credit. If I were an aber or a copper, I would have cut my fingers and threw it to the producers. Whoever gives Tobi Keith an opportunity to play a feature film in their true mind, perhaps at the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste time watching this movie, perhaps it could be the only favorite topic.
