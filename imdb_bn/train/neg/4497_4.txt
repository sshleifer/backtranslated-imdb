I had planned to write something to explain about what I love about this movie, but I'm going to be more difficult than I think. Honestly, I can not think a lot about it. I just saw it three days ago and it did not make any impression about me. It's usually a real stinker's sign. The only thing I think it was most incredibly lacking. The novelty of Humphrey Bougert is seen as the detective quickly switched off. If he can work, he will be different, but he is a note entertainer. Assassination scenes were conducted in a nonprofit manner and there is no doubt about them. If you can not spot the killer in five minutes in the movie, you will see more euro horror. Casting killers are a dead giveaway identity.
