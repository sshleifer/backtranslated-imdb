No, there's nothing in this fairy tale with crocodile coaches, fairy media and glass chapters, but if I was faded in detail, then it would hurt me for you, which I would not do. But do not let curiosity make you better, because this movie is not great. This is one of those movies which started with a scary tactic and a insightful story, committed before betraying the audience. And that's real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (Ji-Won) and Hyun-Soo (Shin Se-King) are your ideal mother and daughter. A successful plastic surgeon, the other is your kind, compelling and beautiful teenage girl. Their relationship handles are handy, so you feel more like brothers and sisters instead of their parents. But things start to go wrong (not always) when Hunu-Sohe friends are run by Jeune-Hei, they start going to Biscay. <br /> <br /> It is probably a warning for the visitors, and going under the knife for them, while Koreans are believed to be women who do not bat a petals, report reports. The scenes of plastic surgery are really the only horror moments, although I think Kim Kim-Duck's time actually surrendered and described what was happening during surgery. <br /> <br /> This is a story two-half, the attempt to shock the audience with a mental facetting technique, which I admit, is now available to me and later. However, in the second half, this movie has become a stupid mumbo-jumbo melodymatic, and it is very surprised to strengthen its ideas under your neck. Some things do not begin to understand, and the efforts are always presented to explain, but you probably will not buy it, or it's logical to start horror movies. <br /> <br /> There is a distinct lack of male presence without all the beautiful, and naked-looking police role. But hey, I'm not complaining, even though the storyline can be greatly improved. I recommend you to visit it, only if you are a fearsome fan of the intermediate Korean but on the VCD. Off-Isha Momenta face!
