Total dogs in this movie. I did not find anything to laugh at myself, so I do not think that I completely ruined my money - and my time. Writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It is frustrating that it does not depend on Hell Storm movie standards. <br /> <br /> They could save money to get de-list actors like Fred Wilde and Gary Coleman, and spend money till the script is managed. It was right. Even Gary Coleman was not used properly for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you amazed that what was the point of the most conspiracy - with the subplot. After watching this movie, I think that the producers expected a bit of humor like Napoleonic Dynamite, where there are no lines of character and delivery. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver lines, letters, or humor lines. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
