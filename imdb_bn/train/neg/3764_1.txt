It's certainly the worst dumb movie I've ever seen and most likely the worst movie ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were horrific and it seems that they are trying hard to understand their roles, dark boys, jerk, everyone, etc. And Bigfoot itself was terrible. It seems to be eight and images of Intellectuals made on a few days computer. At the end of the movie at the end of the movie, a Saskatchete army trooped behind, the other survived, fired and it looked like a poor man's ass to run! And got hit by a bullet and the blood that came from it was just terrible animations. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Over the whole film, too much music on the street (Scriptural score or what you are saying). It does not end. Oh yes, movies are very annoying. One of the worst movies I've ever seen I highly appreciate your $ 3 or whatever they charge for this movie rent and gas c gallon or a standard menu cost. really!
