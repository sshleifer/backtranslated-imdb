I like Boyle's performance, but what I can say is only the positive thing. Everything was overdone stupid point. Most actors said that the 9-year-old nephew does not wait to speak, if he claims to be a witch, a stone-hearted police, or a very bad villain. Raspy voice-over took me amateurish. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and buy freaking out of the good opening music. And what is the whole torture of police in 1984? It was completely essential and there was nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox's Bazar has added a lot of things, in fact, he apparently feels that he will be really cool, but he has nothing to do with the story. This is a big disappointment because of one of the reasons that makes Borges's stories so good - they are tightly bound without any necessary information. This movie is just opposite. Linoret is asking the man of Jaitung in Yedis, after seeing the scene, I could not stop. I lost 4 dollars for this rent, but at least I could get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully prevent others from doing the same mistake.
