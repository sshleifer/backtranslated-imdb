Believe me or not, this "movie" has its own DVD copy that I bought for a huge dollar in the walin. I'm still not sure whether it's a dollar well spent or a dollar is fooled. <br /> <br /> Beautiful amazing set design and clothing. Apparently many thoughts and efforts went into making them. The style of set design is very Mexican. I like them a lot. And Santa is impressive. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing the main intention and the purpose of this movie was a little enthusiastic and delightful for the children's audience. But, somehow, it comes across quite annoying. Actually, I was amazed at how surprised I was. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's an English dubbing which makes it so grim and bizarre. One of the reasons I love to enjoy movies in the original language and the use of English subtitles often gives strange curiosities like dubbing. Children's voices were dubbed at least with the voices of little kids, since the women made their very bad, very weird baby procession. <br /> <br /> Do you know that the demons of hell spend time on their free time? Their ballet in Longjohn? Do not you I did not see this movie until I did. Someone can learn new things every day. <br /> <br /> What is this movie really worth? Now, that's a tossup. I can not recommend a good conscience because it is very annoying in its own malicious way. Nevertheless, its unknowingly fluttering makes it valuable. Define what you're going to do I'm submerged ... I feel uncomfortable for my own sake, moving in the night crying baby. Now, it's wrong ...
