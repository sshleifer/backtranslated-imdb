I was aware that in the early 1990's, Davy University (or was it IT Tech?) Included a wonderful wonderful film from the Tech Degree Program. Well, this movie may be the product of Blade Validicorian. My friend and I rented my Netflix original 1980 Boogeyman and this movie was on DVD flip towards. Do not waste your time with this movie. Terrible horror terrible. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker added two main characters, one woman and her therapist. The woman is dreaming about the first picture from Bugman and her hunting dreams. Stocks from more than 50% of the movie's original movie. One of the characters in the movie is her bad character, when the drone on her therapist narrator. These scenes are filtered with a filter so that the letters are bright. They show Angela Lansbury a 25-year-old look So, recap, horror. Do not watch this movie.
