When this movie was released, it was one of the best capsule movie reviews: Spinx Stein It is, but a mesmerizing sort of way. Welding silent, starting at the top: Frank Langela and Sir John Gilgood as Egyptian? There is not enough makeup in Cairo, at least this picture is not being created. But it's rather fun to try them out. In the performance of the mummy-like (sorry, obvious observation) towels are run with very little stop. Lesley-Anne Down Character It seems that he does not find Egypt in a map, much less explanation about his archaeological heritage. It is at least a part of the bad writing, which is one of the curses that will be watched by every audience of this movie. This is my opinion that can draw their foundations from movies related to any curse or from anything that is mysterious, such as Egyptians, uninspired, overwhelmed conversation, ripe for them. It is not frustrating, and synthesis is a double whammy proof. The plot has a driving source of dramatic excitement: can it be figs and less credible? Answer, generally, yes. Location shots are beautiful, and the set design is usually very good, only consistent reminder that it was not producing some low budget. And there are many well-known faces doing this so-called unexpected laugher service. Cheap, no; Sugar, yes
