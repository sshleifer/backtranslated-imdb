<br /> <br /> While watching "Bang" on TV one night, I was bored by myself, a nonsensical, random plot that was going on the screen. In the filmmaker's part, the whole film seems nothing but meaningless, lazy-French selfishness. Directors / writers only make this section of obscurity stronger by a name called Monika. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in Indie Flicke will be better than writing something well and I want to say, more entertainment from this whole waste.
