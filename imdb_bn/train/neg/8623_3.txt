This film is trying to catch a superintendent of police (Ching Waien Lau), a very clever thief (Icon Cheng), who blackmail an insurance company under the leadership of Kelly Lynn. Basically, trying to steal a cop by trying to steal them in any way they already know. This film is not really a material covered by lovely lead actors, beautiful lead actresses and a good camera shot from Hong Kong scenes. It's all flash, and the flash becomes very dust very quickly. I have lost all the interest in film one third of the way, and after that there is no quality of release, except cinematography, which looks good. If you can get rid of this, just consider this movie. Also, consider discontinuing the 20-minute film showing the film because it's the same as the end: BORING. 6/10
