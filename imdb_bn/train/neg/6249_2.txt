(R # 97) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What you can do about this poor Pokémon is a good thing. For the young-fans anime TV show-usable-user-oops-e-average, any brutally dubbed Japanese word will be the best theme song. Unfortunately the opening theme was needed to add some sort of show afterwards. And they are not just loud enough to say more loud than the cards of other cards. Freud will be on a field day, unfortunately I do not want to sit down with a children's program, in which during the five minutes, thousands of monkeys are 98% of the time running during dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Your pyramid Diamond Elizabeth will accept the only strike in my Uber-Fantasy Dummed Collector of Ultimate Doom! Do not you see that you have no chance to win this war, you are a fool HahahaHahaha! " <br /> <br /> Look at this: I'm going to use my Destruction Force Delta Times pie card that will remove everyone from your power losses and your Uber-Fantasy Destroyer will destroy the ruins of Ultimate Dooms. No bet! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, what they did in this program is all about Although other bad kids are seen on the show, such as the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (pet pigeon of every footballer), at least the monsters were occasionally muted to the absolute mute, "U-G-Oh", just in quiet words of a clockwork review of Roger Ebert , "Simple talk and annoying". Long winds are not mentioned (I understand that I'm hypnotized considering the sentence I wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes away forever. I do not know if there is any plot, and static monsters have no character to Pokemon. Even when compared to my fave cartoon as my baby, this shows sucks. It's weirdly funny, but not enough fun to be able to see. Goodbye bye, sleeping, wet dream dreams
