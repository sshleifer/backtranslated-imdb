If you want to see the intelligent, humanistic potential and the philosophical discussion of possible, see the "awakened life" which is bright. "What $ # * we know!" Is the place for all its focus, poorly operated, badly written, poorly played, completely annoying and totally annoying from an industry altogether. It was not thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The film, which included the Ramdhunoo freak "Ramathe", is reason enough to avoid it. It is not strange that these filmmakers look at the fact that this woman worshiped some 2,000-year-old Atlantian gods or something? What is the old chick is a flake, and this movie was a total waste of my time and money. People responsible for this movie should not be allowed to make another movie again.
