The "true" story of three girls who go to the wild areas of Connecticut and eventually hunt a comet in the jungle. This is a kind of movie that played mixed with thirty-two-hour accolade in drive insides across America. The film does not specifically deal with mixed results in its low budget. The movie is viewable but not all scary (some scenes of attack on him). This is a kind of movie that you forget about it almost once. The strange thing is that you will never see it if it does not transfer to you and "see it here", which happened to me. If you transfer a copy it must be returned, it is not worth trying to watch the movie to watch it.
