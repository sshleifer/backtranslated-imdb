It was not for bad dialogue and scripts. I mean, the point really is to contact the subject. Actors are doing well to bring their characters to life. But to the end, the thing that was really missing was a difficult script to hold all the pieces together. I would highly recommend not to see this. As long as you are passionate about Al Pacino, I will look at what he is playing and everything he is playing. Even if the result is rather poor. After S1m0ne, there was a second bad movie for this actor who once knew how to select the roles.
