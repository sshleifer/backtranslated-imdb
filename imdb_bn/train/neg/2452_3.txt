Recently seeing it again, I was happy to see the way to try to bring the book to the screen, even the sensible budget and the inevitable failure of the hammy actors meant. It was a disaster by any motive measure, but it was easy to imagine if the Lord of the Rings would love to be made wisely - and how good it would be to use the most talented artists and script writers to use. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, this will not be possible for a long time. Seeing this movie, I think with this budget, this story can not be stuffed only. The imagination provides just a lot of opportunities for making an interesting film. There were so many moments in this movie that Peter Jackson was even more attractive, though you must use your imagination because of poor execution. For example, from Frodo's perspective, Wraith is the way to show the world. Or what the Galadriel showed to Sam was what happened behind the house for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really appreciate in this version - the silent moments. There were moments when conversation with a background music against a background. Compare Jackson's movies to the Grandjav swiveling cameras, and the innumerable scores we saw were designed to strengthen how we saw each station. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, it was calm and more modest. <br /> <br /> <br /> At least $ 9 million worth of production costs more than $ 270 million to jackson and marketing. , A huge tax break from the NZ government, and huge savings from filming in New York in the US. However, despite the marketing demand, there was no intention of being faithful. This is well documented. As Filippo Voices said in an interview, she did not read the books deliberately before writing the script. Jackson also said that he originally wanted to create a fantasy film like the owner of the rings, and what he really wanted to do was the Return of the King, because he had many wars but no character developed. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, this image tried to be more true. Of course, many things were wrong, the act was awful and most of the things got burnt, and the speed was very fast. Naturally they spend lots and adapt to other scenes, and for that they deserve credit. Jackson adds scenes of many steps, which do not execute a plot purpose, spend bakshi book scenes, which did nothing to advance the plot advance. Actually there is a strange similarity between Jackson and Bakshi's film structure - since they have alienated from both main books - but some of these events can happen. <br /> <br /> This was not a good movie, but it was possible. Bongshi said, in an interview given to Ion AV Club, it could only be the judge of the animation ring. Her version did the job, but she could be right.
