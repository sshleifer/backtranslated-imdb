If you expect to see much of Altioklar's Gosle, it is committed by the tag line, but you will find that there is nothing in this movie, but the popular style of Altikollar is sex, the most famous topics related to marriage, and cheating. Many nudities, which are not seen from anywhere, and nothing in any connection or plot proves that Altitoklar failed to "try something new" as its quotation. Most sexually-focused jokes show that Alcatelar has fallen for the famous saying that "sell sex". I was hoping to see very good stories called with a very good narration strategy. But at the end I was sitting for 90 minutes myself and the Altitoklar's experimental test still paid more attention to popularism.
