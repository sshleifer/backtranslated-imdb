I rent on DVD and I feel very bad because Dawson and Luigi are extremely sincere about it in DVD comments. This is not a bad movie, but it is a film that wants to make a deeper comment on the nature of human beings, although its story is not really a genre. Plus, this is a little simpler about the problem in many ways, and character behavior often prevents beliefs. I'll tell you a film that if you do not have many films / TV / Literature / Life then you will find something (to be honest, I've often seen the same story in the horror comics). Otherwise, its point has been done more and more artfully before. And that gets bigger issues, in addition to which it does not really have a lot of cinematic interest. It ended up as a fairly lovely movie, which overall invested everything in the idea that the basic story could be frustrating and engaging, and it does not really pay out.
