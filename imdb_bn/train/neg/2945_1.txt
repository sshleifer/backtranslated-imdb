I watched this movie while hosting Motion for Joe Bob Briggs TNT. Even he can not make this movie enjoyable. Lastly I saw it because I taught video production and I am sure that my students have never done this bad thing ... but all my intestinal frailty though they can sit through it. Your 15-year-old son seems to be flirting with your grandmother. <br /> <br /> If you take the actual movie, throw it in paint, it will be more entertaining. Seriously <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see this movie as S-Mart Burgin Bin, then go away from it like it is a Ratlancake.
