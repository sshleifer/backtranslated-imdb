All right, so probably PPL thought it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> Please be kind to the fools I still think of ... his whole garbage <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is right. Ridiculous Characters are weird caricatures - but this picture is not meant to satirise, I'm not sure it is meant to be a serious drama? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their part. People say Dean is very good in this film, and well, maybe he's probably done his part as well. Its character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But when he was making this picture, Dean was a 24-year-old man. He looks like a little tint like a 4-year-old boy ... his <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It sets a bad example for the film ... and for the rest, you feel like crunching at all times with these bad things. <br /> <br /> It was good for her time, but, really, her drivel. <br /> <br /> It certainly has overen the reputation of this photo that has been hype about Dean's death.
