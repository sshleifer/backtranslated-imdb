Say nothing but wow! Has anyone really torn them on open ground? Well this movie happened almost 25 times (obviously the manager's favorite scary technique). In the first scene, smooth conversation / hot shot producer should go back to the seat so that the camera can sit in front of the photo. Shortly after reaching the field, five contestants were shown, and although it was clearly clear at 2pm, they all are sure that the sun sets a minute. After about 30 minutes of bubbles trash, we got privilege with the flashbacks of Clown's history, in which we saw some of the previous ones. If you see this movie, check the women's chest. His ribs are going all around his neck, it becomes disgusting. Most of the horror films take place at night, but chaos without night vision camera is forced to happen. It seems that some night shots of making it in the movie have seen random shots from the Blair Witch project or the smuggler. The film was finally released until it was a matrix, which we saw as the resurrected and shining smile. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you ever stop it. In an open field. <br /> <br /> Sign in, reply
