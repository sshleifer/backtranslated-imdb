"Bat People" is a really bad movie that is entitled to treat MSST 3 and other films like "The Cropping Terror". In <br /> <br />, we are full of bats in some mountainous terrain. We see a lot of things happening, such as batting and flying and stuff, station wagon cheeses, emergency room accidents, and more! All of this, as well as the 1970's Chasey mediocrity (Hey, think "Mitchell" here!), "Bat People" making is actually one of the best in the latest "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes made in Syria! Moviewise, it's terrible. Until Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you, it should be avoided like the plague. <br /> <br /> "Bat man" - more bad people !!!!! LOL <br /> <br /> course 1/10 !!!!!
