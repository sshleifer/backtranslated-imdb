SA film industry insult! I saw good SA films. The comments I read about the hijacked stories do not say that it is desperate for ten people to be ten. A movie rating does not depend on .. "Oh, a movie from a developing country. Boot their art by saying their inferiority about their art, even worse." We have the skills to make good movies. Do not judge the film industry about how to tell hijacked stories how they think. We can tell the great story as Kai's favorite country and Shock Zulu. Cry out to my favorite country, I will donate nine out of 10. Darrell's great direction, acting by two great old actors, whatever it is from there. Hijack Story .., I'll give 1 out of 10. It will only give people who are highly involved in the project to score high. If I used to do the same thing in my movie.
