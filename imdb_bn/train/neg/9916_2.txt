Justin goes to live with his hard, hard working police intelligence father, but it seems that the father has turned into three temporary apartments, each of whom has a different tenant resident. Straight-laded ideologue Justin Spiegel put in the world of murder, underwheck drinking and other destructive things. Hu-Hume <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same picture that almost all the critics watched here ??? Shiny, engaging, original, intense, cute, talent ???? !!? I'm no witness to that thing. What I saw was a spontaneous, colorful, intense, very small thriller that was uncertain and there was no excitement at least because the sooner the teaser was captured in the film, he told her solidarity / debate / discussion. And where is this ridiculous laughing out loud? I do not have so much time like chocolate, probably because I was too busy not to sleep by the film. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: audio commentary director Dave Campfield; Second commentary with different contributors as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featured (set, set, 4 in a cell, and inside the black circle); Interview with Falisa Rose, Desieri Gold, and Rain Brown; Alternative view; bloopers; A music video for 'addictive'; A trailer for this movie; And trailer of "Shock-o-Ram", "Chess Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacteria", "Animals from Hilbigi Lagoons" and "Millennium Crisis"
