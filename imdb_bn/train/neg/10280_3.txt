Did Heidian really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close Dust, joy and lack of imagination and heart completely. I was surprised to see this movie and I saw that Carole Pope could lead this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a complete unmatched performance. Baransky was great as usual and the whole thing provided interesting only modicum. Perhaps the only reason to get involved with this project was green light. Maybe I'm hoping to play Christmas for Lifetime 15 days from Christmas but I thought about this matter that a different director and an actress JJ could give a sympathy to an actress, it could be a pretty tricky movie.
