Maria Bello does not seem to take care of what role the movie feels about her choice. Again he does not like to choose a very difficult and popular movie. Probably he can stop these films from Sugar Leopa (Lawyer "Hollywood") and then (Quiet Agni and certainly Mummy 3). <Br> <br /> If I fail to achieve what I think (I will not loot it), Maria Ballo is as big as her other independent / small films, as well as bigger. This is its performance which improves it to the movie. Combining with this strange thing almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to ignore some errors like bad flaws and dramaticness), the film is still quite long
