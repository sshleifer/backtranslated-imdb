I've just had proof that I'm sure of my suspicion. A bunch of children, 14 to 22 art mega screens, home entertainment type contracts put on the superb state "Titanic" DVD. Only two of them actually saw this. But they all saw the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion that many of them thought they saw the whole movie. Shortly after the epic, they became anxious, many of them asked, "Call us when the ice comes to us". In this movie, only two and a half hours, only two girls who had previously seen the movie were still there. They started crying: ice, ice Following a stamped, they all came to see the sinking of the Titanic. They came out with open headheads, oh and distance. So, when I first saw the scene of the film exploded, I thought. what is this? The bloody thing is waiting for half an hour to sink, but waiting for the rest of it. For example, Dr. Ziaggio also got similar time running, but think about how much the film will be performed at the same time. "Titanic" teaches Leo Kate to spit. At the ship's first-class dining room, look at the face and hand at the creme de la creme. See historical details, if you can find them. The story is so thin that guns and fired on their ship sinking ships. Here is the real dinking film standard. All efforts are special effects and the focus of the opening week is to focus. The film has become the greatest achievement of all time, so what do I know?
