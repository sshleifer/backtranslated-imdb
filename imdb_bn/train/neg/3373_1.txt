I was in my city when I was lucky enough to see a chorus line .. I was small .. but it's a nice game .. so someone please tell me why their name in the sky is to make a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas? ?? He did not accept this role ... this movie has really been a big time !!! <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to not rent this movie .. "Cat" save your money to do something good ....
