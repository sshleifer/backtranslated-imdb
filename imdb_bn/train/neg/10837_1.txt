I can not tell you how angry you were after sewing this movie. Characters are not least bit interesting, and the plot non-existent. So after waiting for the life of these characters to influence each other, the last half an hour is becoming some notable finish, what can we get ??? Frogs are a storm Now yes, I have understood the references and references to the underlying theme, but firstly it has not been presented with absolutely no resolution, and the second one will be lost to anyone who does not read the Bible (part of a significant population) or Charles Fortress (still a greater part ). As a good reader, I thought the film was a spontaneous poor imitation of a Sinfield episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It should be read well ... <br /> <br /> ... something good to be honest
