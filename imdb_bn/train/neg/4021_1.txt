Perhaps this is probably the worst movie that is related to Roger's order. I could understand the less budget of his budget but nowadays there is no excuse for this birth! I am disturbed a "B" movie and all the flicks I like from the point of view of some people are kept aside by "regular visitors", but let me talk about this, Vampire Club is hard to imagine at the top of the list of my worst list, without any trap, the vampires , The music score is not entirely out of place, the sound effects are not effective and finally Mr. Savage thinks that he is very bad in a magical movie because he did not "bad" his career. I have to inform you that when I do not like this movie, I am strict for this reason, I would like to forget about the good part of it.
