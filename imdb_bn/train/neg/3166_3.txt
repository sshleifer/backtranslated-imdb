I have admitted quite an uncomfortable feeling about the ghost movie, and when I enjoy this enjoyment sometimes while being scary, but in the case of jokes it will be crazy to be funny. 'Over the Dead Dead Body' seems to have taken life very seriously later, and my opinion failed in almost any aspect. The story is absolutely incredible, and it did not succeed in believing in comic or sensitive articles. The main actors' choice was horrific. Even though Paul Rudd looks like a man who is at least handsome and beautiful, the taste of women in his character is felt necessary for a serious development. Eva Longoria feels very old for him, and Lake Bell feels very unusual. Without a good reason for romance, due to failure from beginning a romantic story. Jason Biggues and Lindsay were really good at the Sloane but they only supported the role. The rest is disrespectless and unclear, with flat cinematography taken from outstanding TV comedies and cheaper gags. Nothing is really worth watching, nothing to remember.
