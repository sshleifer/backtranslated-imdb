It was Jon Pertwee who "very easy to be funny but too easy to be stupid". Well, if this case is "very easy" pasty fascia. David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his cast seems to be under the impression that the comedy stole impressive and style like locked stock and higher britaks. Using fully supported scripts and speaking with speed too quickly is not saying. Very loud voice Alan McQuefre is particularly suffused with this kind of performance, but the film is not enough to destroy because it does not have enough destructive films. <br /> <br /> Pastey Faces are especially scary all over the front like scripts. I did not understand why it ended, it was very sudden and stupid. Oh and other great flaws is that you need a visa to go to the United States and a green card to work there - this movie will convince you that you can stop a plane and start a new life without having any approval in America - that you Still donated to donate blood in America - who I know in America and By giving blood, give me a few years ago, provides for the payment of money - and no weapons you can buy from the gun shop. As far as I know, gun laws in the US are different from state to state but in a gun shop counters do not sell gun guns. So we've got a very terrific view of America from the very unreasonable and arrogant movies. Perhaps a very Hollywood scene for this retaliation of Bravo? Most likely, but this does not stop the pasty mouth from being a shit comedy
