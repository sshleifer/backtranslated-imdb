I usually have no problem walking away from a bad movie, but this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I was actually sitting around the whole thing, it would take time for the film for more than one and a half minutes, which was wasted. I was cruelly frustrated saying it was not. A group of college friends is set to celebrate a holiday in a beach house, this movie is not worthy of seeing it suffering from many problems. First, there are sparkling plot holes. Secondly, very few of the C-lists (I do not dare to say their B) actors can do very bad, so potentially the scenes fail miserably. Thirdly, the film rate is very difficult and weird, most often the suspense building is seen to make it harder, which leads to very less surprises for viewers. Fourth and most importantly, the whole partially partially eliminates the climate (setting / kills the killer) and partially the dialog is just tyrannical. To credit movies, this is the only movie I'll ever say that I've seen the worst movie and I've seen a lot of things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to know any secret, next time someone asks you, you do not shout, you Do not actually drive in the opposite direction.
