This movie makes Canadians and Brits outdoors, stupid fools to make out. Men get the stone / drunk, and then they hit each other / hit each other in almost every scene. The story is irrelevant to women ?? I do not understand what they have? They spend each scene in a scene, or worse, resulting in conformity around the cemetery like cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either quarreling hippies or hanging hippies. This is the standard fake-up girlfriend, his harmful lover and the humorous of his wicked mom that we have seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is a child, child style. They do not mention that they all looked to need a shower! And what kind of idea meant sex with George Wendt ?? Quarrel ?? Enough to stop anyone! I saw the movie because Samuel was in the West ?? But I do not understand why he took such a role. Probably he needed money. Ian Tracy is an outstanding actor - only the faintest freedom fighter moment, but his talents are destroyed here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot? Three imbeciles try to get them back to their dumps ?? Javan - or Carl ?? Who has died, but who is behind the back of the mind of the character? (What's the best writing of Alfred Hitakkake?) Although I am not ashamed of these two movies, why bother? Carl is so pained that you can feel the joy of his death. <br /> <br /> At the end of this bad picture, I thought that they were all going with him in the boat!
