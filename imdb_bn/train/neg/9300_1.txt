Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever produced. Perhaps Ed Wood style (without heart). Lightning horror Music is very bad (piano and arguments ... come!). Acting ... not good acting! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spend <br /> <br /> <br /> The murderer is a lean, unintended garlic that can not leave a turtle <br /> <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is stupid and a filmmaker Keeping the clutch without any effort. <br /> <br /> The end was so stupid. Think about it: Like the person (who hewart), his writing skills (he's brain behind this flop), invite his colleague and his two friends to his cabin at the end of the week. He will not return to the office on Monday morning, as nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Heibert has tried to disturb us that it is a family affair which is going on for generations (his uncle is a virgin killer) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
