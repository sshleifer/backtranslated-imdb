MST 3000 will make this movie. This is the worst movie I ever seen. First of all, you find that the shooter does not have any bank accounts, and there is no history after leaving the army in 1993 and its rental carries cash. There is no way of hell that a person should ever be approved by a President who does not mention high profile jobs. Also, Pottas' safety chief would not be so emotional that he would start smoking if the president was shot dead. This movie sucked. I can not publish this movie extremist. Every single actor was terrible. Even the chick at the trailer park. I shove on this garbage. What a waste of time.
