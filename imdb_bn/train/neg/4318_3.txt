I thought it was one of the most depressed holiday films - others Christmas Wife and Jack Frost. All about three movie deaths. If you are totally depressed, look at this movie or any other. In this film, the performance is good and some scenes (with the death of the person) are beautiful. But, I am worried that a clinically depressed person could accidentally see this film and be in himself! Even after finishing a "happy ending", the main part of this film is one of the worst disasters. And, because of some crazy, I watch Christmas movie when I do not want to be frustrated (I know it's crazy people - finally, your eyes are not wasting and do not feel sad how the holidays happen?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
