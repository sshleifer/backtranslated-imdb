There are some good things about cinema. Music and cinematography are great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. They were very lucky to produce because they really gave the film's production value. Johnny Vincent (Shan) and many of the film's guys are not talking that is very nice. Amir is acting for the achievement of the actress why? Brandon Alexander gave a fantastic comedic performance like Clitics Pink. Perhaps the bad thing about the movie is probably James Townsend. He can not work She is not very well scrawny, look at all. His arms are like Spaghetti. Annoying They all have muscle tones. It is not surprising that he made his own film and cast himself into himself. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not as confident as a girlfriend who is even girlfriend with girlfriends. If they wanted the best for the movie, they would throw someone else as a leader. Then again, maybe he wants to use this movie as a car to launch a carrier on a soft-core screen, of course it is not a real act because he will send some acting. Also, anyone who is abusive is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about this movie is probably a skinny Latina cast as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not look like an actress. After all, this movie is soft-core porn and you're not better than what you want to see in a skinmax. I think Alex Wilson, perhaps even the best thing in this movie, is embarrassed by it and does not want to be associated with it. There is no picture on her IMDB page and nothing else is listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name. Plus, I recently entered it in West Hollywood and when I mentioned this movie, he turned around. I understand. If I used to work in this movie, I would feel embarrassed and do not want to be associated with it.
