My wife and I thought with this cast and director, the movie would be worth at least watching. We were wrong. Actually, we leave it after 45 minutes. Crowford, Young and Tone British, but the idea of ​​talking to America was, for me, impossible to get past - it was hard to believe that no one would talk to England. Crowford and others have zero chemistry, and to reflect the previous comment, Cooper and Cropford have been ridiculing the idea that their love will be announced without any reason. There is no reason to care about any characters, so why did we throw half through the floor? I believe it was difficult for Hacks to believe, because none of the actors spoke to Hoxian Rat-A-Tate delivery. So save your time, and leave this one.
