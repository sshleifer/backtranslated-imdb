Oh my, I think it can be the single cheesiest movie that can sometimes be seen. I'm serious, this is one of the final B-movies. The first proof is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's very mainstream for this. I got VHS from a bin from pre-rental videos of my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I could quote the blogger: "In 17th century Japan, there was a samurai, who had set it up, he was the age of Maya, who collected 5,000 missiles from the King of Spain for the epic journey of the whole world. In one violent storm, for their surgery, they consume precious precious stones and live around them. And must fight to secure his favorite Japan's fate. "Then" across three continents in a multi-million-dollar epic adventure set in advance "is saying. <br /> <br /> I certainly saw a different movie. It was not an epic, and it certainly was not a multi million dollar. No, 'Shogun Mayadah' is really the crazy courage of the truly spoken Maaida (Show Kosugi). He's not even a shog, but that's not important. What is important is that he has had a great effect on the true effect of the repetitive Charging of a castle of John Claes' Monty Python and Holly Grill, and being able to escape from the serious scenes of showing samurai mind power. Awesome <br /> <br /> The biggest thing in this movie is the Nigre accent of Show Kosugi. The film can be almost all of the necessities to make a good film, but sometimes the worst-performing accent creates it for some of the most dangerous lines delivered by accents. And honestly, do you really want something else? You could end up with 'Shogun Mayadah' fast, and repeat over the final line of Kosugi over. The tape will probably wear before you get tired of that one line. Nice <br /> <br /> 2/10 - very sugar too.
