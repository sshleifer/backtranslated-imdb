The film is very bad. Just awful Bollywood's bad movies do not end the string! They must be running out of excuses for making such a terrible movie (or not). <br /> <br /> Problems seem to be mainly with managers. There are 2 good actors in this movie who have proven in the past that they have the great ability to perform ... but they were so badly operated. Poor script also does not help. <br /> <br /> This movie's most ridiculous moment and very poor editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first major concert, Ajay Devgan, Om Puri (whom he ran about 30 years ago, spoke again) and all Om Puri seems to be careful Friendship with Salman! What a shit is a load. Seriously Bahad soundtrack not mentioned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So Salman has been used as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Watch it for only the last half an hour.
