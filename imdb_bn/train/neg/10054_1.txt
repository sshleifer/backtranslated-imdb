I'm not alone to congratulate the first Superman movie, a picture that Richard Donner executed efficiently. I'm not alone in Richard Leicester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to the same movie Richard Donner, sadly it's still a cruel hatred. <br /> <br /> The superman world is one where the suspension requires a steady amount of disbelief, but Superman 2 extends far enough. It is a matter of those who operated Superman 2 because the scripts insult the intellectualization of a first grader. There is no conspiracy in a sense because the characters are zero motivated to do their job in contrast to the original Superman. With or without its capability, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is managed in a least reliable manner. There is too much criticism, so I will not be bothered. I condemn this movie ... Perhaps the leopardic version of the Lester edition is more appropriate for mesonic scripts based on this film. Super-duper bad
