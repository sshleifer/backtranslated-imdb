A female vampire killed young girl and paint with their blood. One of his assistants who do not want to be a vampire, so he must do whatever he orders or becomes bloody. After some people were killed, the assistant repented and loved the homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? Its pacing is very slow, it has some weird sound effects (sometimes a bite does not look so weird) and ambiance (I'm here a new jazz) and those lights do not seem to be included in the set. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not do it; Of course, cross, light, garlic and stick do not work. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny funny movie too. Perhaps it can not be fun with some friends and many beers (be honest, it's funny at the end of 10-15 minutes at the end of the movie.) Do not be fooled by the troma sticker, it's a bad movie they present.
