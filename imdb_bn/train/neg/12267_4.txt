To fully speak as a movie, I really do not like it. Because there was no FX or we had a single cabin for the whole movie, so it really looked at me. <br /> <br /> I did not like it because the acting was shady, its "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; Then they play a distinct role, one is convinced, others are aggressive, but they never make the point! Also, the lighting was terrible and I'm just mentioning technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I'm just "I'm out of here"! From some letters <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody is free to write their own opinion about this story, and the story is good writing and imagination. . I credit the book's author, so, my 4/10. So, to the end, do not believe in the story of people, just do not spend the whole time acting like you, he laughs, and roams around at the same time and does not make fun of you like. <br /> <br /> Partner <br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading;)
