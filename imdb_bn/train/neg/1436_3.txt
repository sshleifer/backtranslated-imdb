Oh dear The best talent of British TV has created this series, and so I can only assume that they are working under incredible time pressure, and have to sit for many scenes. <br /> <br /> Some terrible highland mystery scenes (most of the time when "monster" attacks and we see it from his perspective), but I'm afraid that most of the stories are strange funny! For example, at the moment of a moment discovered by a hero in a golf course in a golf course: oh, look, there is a hand ... oh, there's another hand there ... hmm, it's a little annoying ... <br /> <br> Over the years, fans of British civil television campaign to release the serial from VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said it. Now I understand why understand!
