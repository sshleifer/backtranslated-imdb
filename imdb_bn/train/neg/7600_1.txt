This film proves that good acting comes in good direction and it does not ask for dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actress but this is her child. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actor feels annoyed and half-hearted. The movie's atmosphere is bad - I can think of it when it's over and I'll close halfway. The director did very poor work and even though I did not read the novel, but of course it is a missed opportunity. The atmosphere is trying to raise the film and the message and storyline will not reach the audience. In a word, it's a great movie.
