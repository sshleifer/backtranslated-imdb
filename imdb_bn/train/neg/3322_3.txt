Unfortunately for me, the first ever I saw was Berkeley film "42nd Street". I then expected his staff to be that good. I found out that even with my early favorite classic-era actor James Cagney, this was not necessarily the case here. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the end the number of musical numbers is always spectacular, but the story is like many others and quite tiring. They always seem to involve the screaming, unhappy producer producer. In this movie, it is Cagney which is often shouting that she gives me headache after a while and her character is wearing thin .... <br /> <br /> <br /> Even here the songs are "near" 42nd Street "classes, you can sing for years and years - decades, I would say. This movie song is not memorable. No, this is one of the few early cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - I totally disliked and was very frustrated when watching.
