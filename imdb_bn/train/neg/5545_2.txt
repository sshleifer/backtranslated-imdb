The "rebellion of the rebellion" proves that due to the rebuilding of the same director and the reuse of an idea does not necessarily double the amount of hartal played. <br /> <br /> Halperin brothers responsible for Hallo's classic "White Zombie", after a few years, broke the popularity of cash into cash for its popularity and closed the eyes of Luogessi from that previous movie. There was a court battle with rights owners of the film "White Jumbo", who would not be able to use the word 'jumble' in the title 'hello'. This word is the only thing that can help the film, because everyone knows that bad movies can earn a lot more money just by heading the title 'Zombie'. Victor Halperin learned only a few years ago before being able to make this outstanding movie more humiliating. It seems that he did not manage any other horror films after this disappointment. The bodies here do not seem to be true to walk, but only hypnotic victims. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> : A man who falls in love with a woman who plays with his heart and only assigns him to love his friend, whom he loves, jealous. It sends a spiral of madness to man, in which he uses jumbo mind-control tricks, trying to change the accessories to its advantage, which tries to win over the woman who does not spit. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most blatantly obvious plot development I've ever seen. You will not be blind or stupid to see the end coming. Not even good acting Compared to ethnically encoded "Zoom of King" (which I was present on buying the same Double Bill DVD), an atmosphere feels like a terrific masterpiece and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. It makes the sci-fi alien zombie cheese festival "at invincible attackers" feel like a serious drama in the age of atoms. This is a big ball of cheese, so ridiculously melodramatic, which it probably can create a Korean movie fan twitch (South Korean movies are often known for use in melody). The credit company called The Favorite Film List. I'm not sure who will be favorite picture, but they must be stupid. <br /> <br /> is not recommended for fans: Zombies, romance, or classic movies.
