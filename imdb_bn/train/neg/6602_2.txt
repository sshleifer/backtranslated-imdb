For my life I do not understand why I should make a movie like this. The plot was tired, the performance was intense, the language was consistently weak and sometimes the use of the word "F" seemed to be like a lack of dialogue so that "F" other "good" Americans want to hear it. Gossett was particularly stupid and enjoyed his part. Forget this c__p, rent 'shake' and have a good smile.
