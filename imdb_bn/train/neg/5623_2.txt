Hollywood's attempt to become Jack London's "Jack London" adventure film is not a bad idea; Of course, he led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This picture, though, up to the plane and the unhappy air. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shhea (as in London) has some Londonesque lectures; And, his beard was so nice to see Jack, his dog, "got the call of the flood" after spending some time in the snowy mountain with "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very nice. This picture is parallel with London's life and World War II parallel "yellow danger", which is both boring and insulting. <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santel ~ Michael O'Shaeh, Susan Heard, Virginia Mayo
