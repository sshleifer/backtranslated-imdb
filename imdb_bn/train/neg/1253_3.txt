I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on restoring bad movies and just leave the classics. We can only hope. Although this remix was not a total waste, I hope I'm returning six paisa to the original DVD. One of the worst violence and the worst past I've ever seen This version does not add anything new. Repeat it why Hollywood should leave alone things alone.
