Not really spoilers my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants to ignore the number of visually impaired 10 items or less of his character, a film with deliberate indoctrination and only the mentor / all-you-can-do-theme. He plays Morgan Freeman's semi-washed version of the modern universe, who crashed through a child in an old Ecovanon to find the role of his next film in Carson, Brentwood, CA. Why Karusson, so a mystery. Cal residents. He could have saved the tour and moved to any place in San Fernando Valley and found the same material. Puzz is pretty cool to see in Vegas, a cross between Salma Hayike and Penelope Cruz, playing an unhealthy grocery checker in the final but slow local market for Morgan Freeman's research. His character is known only as "snow", when people are acting in real life, they mean "Psst, that's him" and so on. Unfortunately, I was very confused that he had all the world's knowledge and advice but he did not have any reliable return to Brentwood's house, there was no cash or debit card, or had knowledge of his cellphone. If someone gives such a high opinion of their souls that they believe that they have an answer to all things like him, then I see cash and a blackberry to show the intelligence and good survival progress which is to save the huge ego that he has. Nothing happens in this movie. I do not believe that one of the main characters was notable, instead of being confronted with each other. It was knocked out by the idea of ​​adultery, but then the ideas became violent. It was like a shopping cart with Steve Martin without having sex with me. It was spontaneous for Freeman and was uncomfortable to the audience.
