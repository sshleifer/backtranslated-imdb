The title of "Prim Night" - the only remake of the 1980s Slicker Flick, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nilssen. This movie is held in Oregon City, where Donna (Brittany Snow) is going to go on her senior promo and make some fun after having done some very serious incidents in the last few years. He and his friends reached the promotion, which is being held in a grand hotel, and remember and enjoy the funniest night of their life. Nobody knows, a man from the past of Donona, who has scared him for many years, he is also like ... and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a fan named "Prompt Night", so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I must admit that I was very disappointed. "Prom Night" is suffering from the worst sufferings of a horror movie, and it is predictable. There is absolutely no surprise here, and I felt that I have seen everything in this movie several times, often good, before. Is this equal for the audience? Boredom Of course you have not seen any horror movies, or are not part of the pre-teenage crowd, but most of the viewers will probably be able to guess what's going to happen. The plot is straightforward, but the whole script is void of any kind of wonder, wind, atmosphere, or any other thing, and it really hurts the movie because it does not sink viewers to their teeth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems impossible to make a good slasher movie with less Gore. For example, take "Halloween" of the presenter - the least of the screen violence, but still a very awesome and effective movie. You do not have to worry about the fear of movie, but even the "Night of the Night" was freely violent (which is not too early), it still adds a little bit of the movie because it does not have much to do with scripts. The tension here and the mystery is the lightest, and I spent most of the film in the forecast of the situation, and about 99% were correct. Our characters are not well written in order to make a connection with them for the audience, and their numbers are regular and vain. <br /> <br /> I'll point out some things that I like though about this movie, though it was not completely vain - cinematography was really nice and everything was very well illustrated and fairly stylish. In "jump" fear (which are mostly predictable), there were some tricks. Set for the movie is very nice and a good place to unlock the plot, but it can be predicted to be predicted. As acting, it is the best intermediary. Britain's Snow gradually plays a leadership role, but the rest do not really show much talent. Johnathan Shake plays famous, and perhaps most experienced actor here, but he is not that impressive. However, I like the character that I played, which is a nice change in the type of 'Mascaid-Stuck' type killer that we see a lot. As far as the end is, the last fifteen minutes of the movie ended my intelligence and it was very climatic. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Prom Night" was frustrating. Everything could be a decent slash movie considering it was quite a bit annoying, which was very small, routine and predictable. There were several neutral moments, but the film did not have any mysteries or atmosphere, and there was no development of its little plot and not credible characters. I will advise the devious fans of the season to save their money and wait until the video comes in, or rather pay the original, because there is no surprise. Some may find little entertainment in it, but it was very much expected for my taste. I hope well, and left the theater very frustrated. 3/10.
