I discovered this movie in the IFC, and I think it would be interesting. For "small" love stories, some stories in this story really dragged. This woman is acting because she does not have a name, Casey Baker and Alicia Wight talking about their own sexual relationship. I have to admit, "Strike!" (1998), want to begin to see more romantic views of the first sex conflict, when Odet Sinclair's acquaintances first asked him for the first time, and Tiete asked, "Was it beautiful? <br /> <br /> Some people think again I think it will make things even worse. It does not have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but in any way I can not Expected more.
