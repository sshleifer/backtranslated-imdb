I laugh all the way through this rotten movie It's so incredible. After many years of marriage, a husband leaves her husband, broken in front of the real estate office. What happened? Office Manager comes out and gives him a job !!! extremely happy! The next thing you know is going on in two women. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing rings are true in the movie "Life Time for Women's Good Nothing". The fatigue dialogue does not help "I do not want to spend the rest of my life, as I had the chance to be happy and it was not taken." There is a rich, remote mother who dislikes her daughter's new relationship. A Susie Black Maid - Incredible that in 2003, there is a smiling black maid where a film was made. Hattie McDaniel must turn his grave. The woman is a husband who freaks out and wants snotty teenage custody. Sheesh! There is no cliche left to flip.
