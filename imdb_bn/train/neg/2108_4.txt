Several deafs were mysteriously killed on the altar and later their bodies were stolen in the way of chicken. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decided to investigate this mysterious murder. Prior to each event, he discovered right on the right that the bride was given a rare orchard (supposedly from the groom), which contained a powerful drug, which died after her death. Patricia said that the orchid Dr. Raised by Lorenz, who lives in an isolated estate, his wife. In fact, Lorenz is responsible for this fault, keeping the wife in suspension, and using her gland to keep her wife alive for eternity. Patricia, Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr Lorenz on the medical mysteries surrounding his wife), sets out a ferrous marriage. Lorraine tried to force the hand, which eventually led Patricia to a mad doctor's patch. There was a very good opening of this movie, but it ended up with the establishment of shot and other weak scenes. Perfect to throw, Walter and coffin deserve well, but that life. Russell has stolen this show (even Logosi does not consider his monograms in one of his memorable acts), but Countess Lorenz plays the role of attributes of many of the most striatipedal features of today's Hollywood Prima Donner. Weak and good end as well. Ratings, based on B movies, 4.
