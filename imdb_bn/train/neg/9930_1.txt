From Mel Brooks 'Blazing Saddles' to cruelty the character of Sheriff Bert, in his own weekly sitcom, it is a cruel, insane and painful effort to underestimate, just like some people it is really bad! <br /> <br /> Sunny reminds only unfinished viewers that this supposed comedy can be a fun and how frustrating it is to laugh at all! <br /> <br /> However, it's a bit interesting to see Louis Gusset Jr. Cleavon Little impersonate her best. Her shame shows through every scene. He was much more fun in Habilore's movie El Diablo, he was here in this cheese slab! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
