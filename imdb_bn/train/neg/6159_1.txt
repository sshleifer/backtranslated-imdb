Why do everyone think that they have the responsibility to tell the movie that they are fensor? <br/> <br /> <br /> I think sports movies fall into two categories; Good films have been made about human soul and competition, and 'by the sword'. <br /> <br /> In fact, it can not decide who wants to be in this movie, a sensitive drama to make the best effort of life. Competitive motivation or a martial arts flick accused. In the end, it is not strong enough or completely enough to give me an eye care for it. <br /> <br /> I have a fence trainer for the record (and now I'm officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fencing in a movie it does not automatically get worse. I look at star fight (episode 4-6, good movie, bad fence). I like those movies But when you put bad movies in bad movies for some reason, some people think that it is only purists who think it's a hairy effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's just a bad movie. In the end, there is nothing for the enthusiast or movie buff, or only one pulse and three brain cells to visit this movie. <br /> <br /> When I watched a movie and I was forced to think, 'Man, I am seeing the robbers of great power. I know that the time has come to see the logic with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is someone in the lobby that would give me two hours of my life.
