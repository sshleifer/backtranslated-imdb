First look 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (DR - Harold Young): Third World Mummy movie is the same as the first two, from the viewer's point of view to the final result. The stories are similar and the results are Ho-hum. The new followers of the Egyptian priest sent a mummy to our country. It is hoped that he will be able to revive the progeny to kill the original grave. This time Mummy Lone was played by Chaney (who did not make any difference because she did not say much to act for this character). The new priest became a chicken in the city and the maternal uncle sent him to his dirty work after eating the suede juice. Again, a girl goes to the street, a priest falls for one of the mother's descendants and wants him, yes --- to be immortal with him (have we not heard this before?). The plan, of course, is that the debris hangs the mosquitoes with torches (like the Frankenstein monster) and end up burning the animal ... ... how can they get a sequence? Guess I'll find out with the next one in the series ?? Or not .....
