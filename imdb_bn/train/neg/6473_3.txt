The first installment as a child ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was great characters, songs, and a fun family filled the film. One week or so again I saw this movie for the first time. I believe that this movie was like most signals and did not overtake their origin. I think I feel like this because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, this is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Aarle gives birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgan (Euresel's sister), so they build a large wall around their house on the ocean. When Melody grew, he started to wonder outside the wall where he was forbidden to go. Morgans are trying to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a movie so you have to find it. I like that voices the same and again like the wonderful singer I think this is a good family film though overall!
