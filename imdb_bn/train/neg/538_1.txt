Wow, acting is a waste of talent. My husband and I were thinking about it, it would be better, these actresses are very good at this time to waste their time. Unreasonable characters, hacked scripts, and uninterrupted pensing made for a long two hours. I can not actually hack it and the groceries are left to shop (cat litter is more interesting than this movie). The husband stabilizes and ensures that it is not better - as long as Buddy dies, so you want to strike them all by car and finish their sad life. It will be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and clothing can not keep this one alive.
