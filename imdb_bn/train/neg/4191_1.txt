I saw a lot of horrors in my time, all of them are unreasonably bad, but no one reaches deeply that this part of the trash reduces itself. This movie has caused me pain and pain, because I saw it because I tried to wrap my head right about this movie. Now, after seeing it, I realized - what happened and why, but the film can be very enjoyable when you see it. Yes, there are traditional scenes of illogical violence, a linear that shows the mind-intellectual insights of its characters ("Highway me ... my!"), And enough nudity confuses us with enough "plot". ", But you still feel the film alone and will take advantage of it, like a dog who did not want anymore and left a box beside the street.
