I got the UK 4-disc special edition Superman 1 for just $ 5. Extra stuff included 1951 features Superman and Mole-Man. So last night I put it in the DVD player, and here my results <br /> <br /> Some initial frustrations - I did not check, and I think it was tagged mentally as one of the All Alan Serials. . I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves like Superman, and I did not see anything other than the amazing alpine clip - but hey ho, never mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> For one hour less. IVDB said it was made in the movie as the release of the movie before the first TV series, although it has a sense of two episodes of one episode of the first TV series of the Revis. In any case, this is a strange choice for reasons I'll go later. I am an age where I remember TV and movie production which is limited to one or two locations and sets, so there is no big surprise here. Even for low budget movies, this is really a low budget. <br /> <br /> The story is concerned about the small town of Silsby city - population 1,430 - which is the worst oil mile house in the world 6 miles). Opening with a fast forum to take action to close the story thoroughly. This conflict with the arrival of metropolitan journalist Kent and Lane for better reporting on the oil company's direction. Clarke is believed to have emerged in radioactive cave 6 miles below, starting to mochching round the city with a few strange little boys (head on the head, bigger in the head, black and blackjack in the eyebrow) and the drillshaft arising from the closed, and annoying expressions on their faces. . <br /> <br /> Now a deep breath, here's the remaining plot of the photo. Young children scare some children, so Jeff Corre (playing the fierce ginofob of the city) encourages some pals to kill this "animal". Superman stepped in step-by-step and took him to a local hospital. Corey's friends hid that little guy in hiding and guess he died, but he escaped and dropped Shafts down. The Hanging Hanging crowd hanging over Mole-Man in Korean Hospital (despite Sheriff's arrest) persuaded. Superman stopped access to their hospital and took the wounded bird to Shafteen to bring him back to his music. A total of 4 Mole-Mans appear with some kind of weapon that they burn in Jeff Correa (I call it an arc! Gun, because its only effect considers Kori to be "bug") and Superman protects him. After the manner in which he behaved, he suddenly changed his way due to Superman's surprise to save him, Mole-Man returned under the shuffle. Last <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the picture is an hour long, almost miserable, careful and follow-up to ensure that I follow "Mole-Man 1 Cripps" to any one of them. Looking out. "Mole-Man is never involved in any means - they have no dialogue - they just roam, torture and return, they look a little unexpected, but city reaction They rarely refer to the reaction of cities to the demons. <br /> <br /> Reeve is very good at Clark Kent - too much hard-ness reporter, much more Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane, but he is a terrible, terrible superman. I do not see the part (at least his hair is in black color, which changes the light hair instead of playing in some episodes of TV), like my book, he made a mistake in my book. He was told that he was called "Pause Strike" (which Superman constantly works), but someone told him that it should not be a fist on the hips, not a fist in the ribs, and he plays Superman as a teacher in a strict and sensitive school - he actually does his fingers Do not push it towards re-transmission, but he can do it too. <br /> <br /> And the superman swirls a large amount of walks. Tell a huge amount - he really does not do everything), and a bit of running. She takes several times and lands, but the flight is not seen at any time. Oh, some bullets blow him up, and he uses the telescopic approach as a clerk, but with no visible visual effect. In fact, the visual effects are obvious by their absence, and some of the present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort considering these values: but even by those standards I think it is a fantastic threader effort. Thankfully, the production lines of the TV series were high, and at least they had trouble getting some more stories about them. <br /> <br /> Something frustrating - I will not see it again.
