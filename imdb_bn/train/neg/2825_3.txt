This week, I think it will be fun to meet Corey Hayme, just last week and see "all the lost" movies. I'm not a fan-boy - not far away - but within the first few days I liked those two Koreans. <br /> <br /> So, I prepared myself for three films. Unfortunately, I've selected "Dream Machine" as the first (it has never been seen before), and it was terrible horrible, I decided to lock the back in my coat and shut it down before it popped into something else. Her But I was able to fight my way through this movie first. I used to think that it wanted to play wildly in the same League as "The Pharaohs Buller of Off" (1986) but was caught in my own confusion. Actually the whole film wants to be a comedy, and in the end it is hopelessly thriller. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is the court: a corpse in a trouser trousers. Everyone else fails very badly, it's shameful. Even the most for frost. I can dig him as his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some guidance guidelines. This was not clearly the case of "Dream Machine". So, we have a perfect car, yes, that's Black Porsche. Heim's perfect girlfriend? Just have a blonde chick who has no line in film. The perfect murder ... almost? Filmmaking villains try to steal some of their babies flat on the donkey, trying to steal the whole film out of the trunk, and then at the end of the film, she thinks she is Michael Meyers (Saturn Mask) apart from White William and Corey Heim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Wrong If they try, they can not make this flicker a liar. A stupid, weird movie with a story that does not direct any direction directed by a director, who does not know how to handle his cast. Great achievement! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: On the last shot of the movie, what did you think to laugh at the camera directly? Your or the director? is not it.
