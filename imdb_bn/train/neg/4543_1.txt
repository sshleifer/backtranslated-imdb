I read the book and the book was impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie, its direction, screenplay, and the acting were absolutely impossible. I was crammed with the lack of a painting that I could not follow a novel, a novel that could portray all the actions, simplicity, and courage with a radioactivity of a real realistic story. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie was not published to most people in the city. I do not know if anyone will not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, however, that when Peru could be failing in such a beautiful country that would fail. <br /> <br /> To the potential audience, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
