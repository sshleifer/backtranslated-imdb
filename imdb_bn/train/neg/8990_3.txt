Steven Vasquez and James Townsend, star, directs and co-writes Horny Flick with horror very good ideas and intentions with this wicked little drama: A gay film that takes a different story than normal fares and wants to make a drama as a thriller Trial on So why does not it work? Initially, the films were losing the frame from the beginning, and spreading purposelessly instead of the movie, creating a suspense thriller for death, but to satisfy the audience who want to face the naked eye. This is not a bad thing: it can certainly improve some of Hollywood's successes. The film tries to talk about young men and women, relationships, disturbing parenting, experience with all wild antics involved in the club scene - and kill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Townsend) In a loving way, a girlfriend is a successful child with Zenna (Sarah Kelly), but her eyes are visited by the boys and a time where she meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who is on the same path and on each level, Can give it. They come out of bonds, Devon, and the mystery begins: The absence of boys around, David's grandmother psychologist said. Kirk Tyler (Dan Suite) Devan's comforting mother Donna (Sonja Fisher), despite Devon. Due to its new relation it was cast in the streets. It seems Tyler is in a dark business, hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl MacDougall) who is apparently investigating missing boys ... Daven has collected his wealth from his girlfriend of adultery and his chronology and the team together. Tyler and his detective sidekick And through it all, Dona radiates the warmth and burden as a perfect mother of a gay boy, etc. <br /> <br /> Some actors are delightful in the eye (and the eyes do not have too much of the time to check very often!) But the acting degree is always In less time The feeling of commitment in each part involving the only thing that pardons us (and in some cases it is too poor to forgive). Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his business. But ultimately the people involved have something to say about trying to get a gay film at a different level. Perhaps their next one will be more polished. Grady Harp
