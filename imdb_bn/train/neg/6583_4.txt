Interesting ideas and stories that do not quite work. <br /> <br /> When you look at the picture, you may feel uncomfortable at the end. I do not really know who will have to root for the movie, so Tees Digs became indifferent to intelligence, the rest of the letters seem so quantitative and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim was Alicea (Mia Kischner), we were really pleased to publish the plot and faced criminal justice. The problem was that he was malicious like other girls, looking at the opportunity to face the sweet girl in a convenient cocahed. I do not understand the moral message of this movie, and it does not work as a detective story and thriller.
