The word can not just describe how bad this movie is. I saw it in the video last night and I could not believe in what I just saw. Basically, "Schnyetter" is looking for the ex-military person (Lorenzo Lama) and his abducted sister, who is captured by delivery-style rednecks. Film acting, writing, direction, photography, and editing are unsatisfactory with a song called "Solaris", which can be one of the greatest theme songs of all time! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Funny back carter" to "Horsack" (Ron Pallio) played a ridiculous bad guy in the film. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at all costs.
