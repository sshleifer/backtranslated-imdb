I did not want to see this movie first, because the trailer has given the impression of a simple and highly anticipated movie ... but recently I had the pleasure of inventing the amazing "Monsense in Trashions and Plus C affinit√©", which was well-directed and Lauren Tirard ("Praetai-Muhi Written and written by "TT"), I changed my mind and decided to try it Bo, "the ghost taha-moi", "menasonjesasa" as well ... and it's not at all. The script is not bad, but it is not operated as "Mensonges ...", but not as liberal as the actors (especially Charlotte, as she is usually annoying) Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and to be very honest, I still do not realize that this kind of The crane can achieve such success, even with such casting ... although the story may be trying to create a lot of interesting plots, but it is not good for the tireard's "mensonges ..." It has been written by him. Easy, disrespectful, and lazy jobs. Completely overwhelming!
