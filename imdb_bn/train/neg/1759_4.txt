This effort was like an enchanting TV movie ... I do not think I would ever be released on the theater ... If so, then it must definitely die quickly. Seeing the DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was clear that this film is nothing more ... Ed Louters is an art critic of greed structure? Any funny changes that must be done ... I have not seen Ed from "the longest yard" ... all of them have played mostly under the bandwine leadership without Pampo ... they had zero charisma and most of the pictures look like sleeping ... Pompey The girl had a dimension ... she played each scene as a loving little dog ... I still saw the slowest line of 3 years old ... <br /> <br /> Che Views My wife and I have headaches ... very fast, fast cutting and cornered ... if you're going to Barcelona to shoot a chase scene, then you might want a few wide shots to absorb the beauty of the backdrop, right? The whole story was quite impossible and far away, but hey, we liked it better than "life aquatic ..."
