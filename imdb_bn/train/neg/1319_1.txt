Perhaps someone heard Alberto Tumba. A former police officer, former air champion, and now, an incredible actor. "Alex El Airet" was planned to be a TV "mini serial", but Italian television itself refused to show the film on its channel. Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. The script is only hilarious (it is supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like 5-year-old kids But it really congratulates you as it's amateur acting: Alberto Tamba, who does not consider himself credible as a policeman, he has played a completely stupid character: Especially for the Special Operation Italian Police to keep special doors open! ("ariete" is "RAM"). This super-man will try to save a young beautiful girl's life (a genuine Italian "small" TV show, Guyika Eros Ramjotati): Excellent but absolutely inefficient in acting. To lose one of these and to make yourself a favor. An embarrassing film for the Italian cinema industry: John Travolta has been closed for Earth attack.
