I usually do not write reviews, but I do not understand why it wanted to give such a high rate and warning to horrible lovers because I can only guess that these high-level average TV viewers were given. <br /> <br /> I only saw the first two episodes, but these two were so close, it was no longer fun. The same old stories you've probably seen / have already read several times - living toys, bad things of other dimensions ... and it's not only these stories that are not innovative, it's a pretty bad version of those clich√©s. I like that the two episodes are "shiny" and "silent hills" at any time. And do not even ask about the visual effect ... In the first episode someone is okay but in the second ... terrible. Some films seem to be wrong in the student project. Blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing remarkable It may be interesting for kids who are ten years old who may still not see / read many scary stories (though I would rather recommend "out of faith" - now I call a decent mystery TV show). But this is worthless for an adult horror fan. I only gave 3 points because of some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.
