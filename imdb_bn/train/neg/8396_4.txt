... but I saw better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a movie crew trying to reveal a horror movie where the incident took place. Three guesses will happen. It's not a total bomb - Cast John is fairly good with the best performance with John Ireland, Father Dammurg and John Carradine. This is well-made - for a low-budget movie. Do not expect nudity, oath, blood or gore (the film has a very low PG rating). I was not completely annoyed - it's just a cool night to watch. I saw it on video - it was a great print - it was impossible to see very dark and some scenes. Yet I did not hate it, and this is a great ending that surprises me - basically nothing happens, so that it guards you. Only if you are full of a horror film but only valuable.
