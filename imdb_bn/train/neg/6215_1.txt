It was really a waste of time ... The film is a weak plot, the story is broken and very frustrating with a lot of surprise .... While the animation is a top notch. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, I tried to give the benefit of doubt after telling myself that it may be interesting at later stage but it was never unique. This same plot has been played again and again, but what was worse was that the plot of the main plot was a complete story about how to kill bad stories ... the author could do more with the whole idea but it seemed that The heart was not there and wanted to stop the film as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> Overall, too much campaign is not able to deliver.
