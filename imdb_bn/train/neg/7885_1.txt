I believe religion is outside the government and outside the film. When I want a lecture, I'm going to church, but I do not want anyone from a movie. I do not think of some supernatural themes, (above all, religion that you can get as a supernatural!) But this movie has so much publicity that I was really annoyed. Landlady reminds me of the documents shown in other movies. Looked like bad people were even horny. <br /> <br /> What's stupid is over: The hero joins the meeting and cried out in old age, and the spell was broken. The only life that was easy was that. I think movies should be distributed with caution when they are stupid: Dazzler! Inserting here!
