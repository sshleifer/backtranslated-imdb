After the Christmas break, a group of college friends fall behind and help break the horses and replace them with the apartment building. To make the job a little harder, a killer, circulating inside the chic-wearing psycho hormones, is prostrating to groups in different violent ways. <br /> <br /> 74 videos registered as one of atheists ", in the United States, listed in the United States in the 1980s, Duram that dried blood created a good reputation for it before looking first. The word 'video nasty' sounds a few great things like the obvious velocity, violence, sex, etc.: All things are a horror fan's dream. So, after listening to all the information, I expect a lazy slashher experience to settle in authentic (title Alt.). . . And that's what it tries to be, but quite a lot has failed completely. Apparently, the film is not great. Cinematography, Gore (without couple scenes), and overall failures all fail. It's not just enjoyable to watch. Lack of inorganic scripts and often tossing random things without any real reason (like openly murder). There are some great death scenes, in which beautiful beautiful faces are melted (which can be seen in the poster), but for this it's positive. The performance is very bad, the story seems to be unimportant, the killer is not cold or scary and it is a big mistake that any slasher flick can always avoid: it's a little annoying. Overall, for a few UCLL movie students $ 90,000 (which will be twice as of today) for movies, Droom that dried blood is not a total mess. This is a couple good things, and fairly watchable. . . However, a slash depends on the level of movie like Flickr like House on Sorority Row and Pisses. . . It just can not compare. Do not expect much, and you may at least be entertained. I hesitate to say it, but in some of these films I saw it which is really good with a remake. . . And yet, they go after great work like Black Christmas. Well good . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> For the most part. . . But nothing special. Also, they have faced most of the best killings. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: Nudity is unexpected to me (to me), but not too much. <br /> <br /> - Cool killer (s): No. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />: I think, yes, but I do not care just enough, and it is as clear as the nose in the assassin's face. <br /> <br /> - - <br /> <br /> Final ruling: 3.75 / 10. Ah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -Pro 3-
