Eight gene rollin film I saw is probably weird; The misleading plot (as it has) started to be very slow to survive for more than 84 minutes at the beginning, but it can be weirdly upset anyway, as it continues! A female vampire (committed by the title, short dressed) is held in captivity in a distant cave and only 'festival' is raised in the blood of the willing victims (apparently members of suicide club), such as uncertain where all this leads him, the writer-director is finally the villain ?? The strange father of the real face is actually empty ?? Harmfully publish a mutant (?!) From the future! A ruthless motion and a dream-like atmosphere (the goddesses wear hoods and animal masks to hide their characteristics from neighboring girls), of course both the filmmaker (setting the seaside setting in the {anti-mountain ranges}) and the "euro-style" style, Nubile beauties on display As the beaver of it. Personally, completely visually appealing, but the most enjoyable thing about the issue of intellectual vacuum, known character actor Bernard MÃ¼nson (who was present on the sixth day in the film Luis Bunuel) sees them spreading occasionally from time to time!
