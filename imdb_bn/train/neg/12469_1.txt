Suddenly I will leave the movie when I see the whole event. This is especially true when I rent DVDs. I left Syrani completely. I became annoyed with half the way. <br /> <br /> This movie is isolated, annoying, confusing, and in need. Acting was without dry and trustworthy portraits. The general plan was good but was developed in a radioactive and annoying fashion that failed to understand my attention or interest. Multiple sub-plots have often failed to connect with each other and looked more like a random story than a genuine attached plot. Too bad a serious issue and such great actors could create such a flow. I can not imagine this award a less reward for a nomination.
