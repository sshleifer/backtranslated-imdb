This movie is an insult to all submariners. It was stupid. It has been written by monkeys. Acting was irrational. If this scenario is the largest navy, then I am crying for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put submarine films as far as "below sea noise". Gene Hackman will really be required to rent money to make this shit. Denzel Washington has been high. Plot Little makes no sense. And the end. Will a criminal be rewarded for his crimes? Just think Hollywood will have this garbage. If you still figured it out, I did not like it. And if it is not for all pro comments, I would not be bothered to post.
