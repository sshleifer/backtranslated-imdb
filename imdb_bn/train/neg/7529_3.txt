Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is still one of the worst films ever made. After the hijacking of the glass, after the helicopter decreased it caused Bruce Lee to die, but did not explain how he came to the helicopter while near the eastern scene. But helicopters that are only 200 feet in the air. It gets perfect fools since then, like something out of a cheap comic book. Though the idea is not so bad, it does not work with a degree industry from the point of view of filmmaking. There are dozens of martial arts bombs, usually made in Hong Kong. I think Gene Cloud Van Dam adds potential stories to his film and improves the trend about filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Sighal's films were better than the 90 percent of Hong Kong's martial art junk films in the 1970s and early 1980's. Despite Bruce Lee's 'Game of Death 2' my opinion falls in the Junk Cinema section.
