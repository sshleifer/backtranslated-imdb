I agree that this story of Melville may be impossible, but it is not even a credible attempt. The 20th century story only reflects the purpose and nature of the original story; Perhaps you might be able to move it to England, but it will be a period. Even our story narrator - the proprietor - says it to a flashback, even back to somewhere around 1800. In the late 19th century, a strange abducted worker would be rejected without any thought. And in the 20th century? Come on! Give me an isolate remove pause !!! Even around 1800, this kind of behavior did not work very well until the end. And the movie is ending? I do not know what that was, because I did not see the whole trail - I had to stop. It was like setting Elizabeth "named Designer" in England in England.
