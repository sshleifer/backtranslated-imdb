The value of watching this tacky spoiler also destroys everything about 'Annie'. Characters are almost cheap by poorly written texts and they seem to feel less quality of production. It was made very clearly for the TV, but if I find it on my television then I'll just flick it over. The children of the film work well, but the actors are incredible and so the film fails to really draw you. This film lacks the number of music / dance that makes the original shine and, in fact, we accept it in the light of Annie. All love Johnson has repeatedly bothered and acted as ... You can not make sure that he really is Annie. The difference between character appearance continues to tease me throughout the film's duration. Sorry this signal was a total flop.
