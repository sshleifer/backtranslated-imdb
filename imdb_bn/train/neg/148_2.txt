I'm in Iraq, now I'm doing an action that gives me plenty of time to watch movies. We also got access to a lot of pirated movies, this jewel came with 11 other movies, and I have seen it a lot. I have seen a few more reviews that the film does not take itself very seriously, but in reality, I think this is a cover for its horrible subject. It's not a tongue in the cheek, the authors really thought they were improving the movie Blade. This movie is just a part of Vampire Assassin, which you did not see, I recommend. At least that movie is so incredibly bad that you thought it as hard as you could. This is the occasion that no redeeming attributes that are right at the cusp. From the bad acting, Cliché visual (ie opening credit), from adobe premiere special effects. They did not even get the space for guns, where the film was supposed to be with them, but if you are using the effects then correct them. For Cast, it seems that they went to a class only and they picked up the first one from the ugly dog ​​because they were gone. Once again, the vampires are like Ron, who likes to do stunts, they can not do it. Also, comment about this "old vampire movie back" ... no, it's not. This is exactly what about all the new vampire movies Buffy Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, They're All About Fighting Some Super Star Vampires It's the worst vampire genre, bad blood, screaming mesh, and Chasey on acting. Obviously anyone wrote a good review about this, that in any way the movie is connected to friends or cast. But what do I care about, I've paid 33 cents for that. However, this wrap up, film school decided to make a movie on their first semester, because I give them credit because it is better than I could. Of course I know I can not make movies so I do not try. I know how to watch movies though. I work 12 hours a night, 6 days a week, I have seen thousands of times a year that I came here and it was so bad that half way through me was the hope of a mortar attack.
