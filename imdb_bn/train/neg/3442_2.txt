I completely rented the film with the appeal to me in the cover. However, I was sorry as soon as the movie started. Looks like they've used a home video camera to shoot this image and let a little child do this. They tried to frighten the man by using an appearance and shape of the illogical face, but I saw myself laughing, I could have kept myself together and could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> I felt some really good idea for the plot but due to the dodgy line and in some cases they were overshadowed. It was not in any direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit through it because it gave me physical pain to see but I ended up doing what I started so I breathed deeply and letting it continue. Certainly 98 minutes of my life has been lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> I knew that you saw the 'Hunted Boat' I am not a supporter of the low budget horror films, but it was a big disappointment, I think that after 'terrorist tones' nothing can get worse, but it has reconsidered me. <br /> <br /> ************************************************************ *****************
