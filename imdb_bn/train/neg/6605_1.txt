Only self-respected intelligent people are disturbed (or amuse) designed. If the director's intention was to dislike the title character of the viewer, it was right, but I know that there is nothing as a Hollywood director who criticizes the American Marxist 60's movement, especially in the 70's, not a filmmaker. There are many stupid conversations going on here, sometimes I do not imagine that I'm not actually watching the comedy. Would not you blame for thinking that you taunt this ?? How na√Øve it is that the movie appears Spacesak is in his part of left-wing films, which brings me to a clear, undisputed conclusion that Redhead Hick is one of the liberal bodies of Hollywood. But, I mean, they are not all? Nice boobs, but ** ** for the brain.
