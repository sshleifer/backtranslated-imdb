I've seen this movie because I'm a big fan of Phoenix Phoenix and Jocaine Phoenix. I thought I would try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I regret to check it. She was embarrassed and the movie was just this strange plot if you want to call it. Sissy was just curious and Jellybean is just sleeping with both of these old people on the hills, who are sitting on a toilet, what's going on? I have not been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just a total garbage. I do not believe that actors agree to waste film, money, time and place such as waste. Sissy does not have to get me 'beautiful'. I thought that he is all but that. Those organs were just stupid, and why could they have hithike? What is the topic of ??? 0 out of 10, no shame, no even worth 1. Hopefully, in other movies, the rain is good, I forgive him for this performance, that means I can not do anything better with that film.
