I do not know what I missed here, but I can not believe these positive comments of many people in this movie. I had to fool it, and think of a bit above. I like the performance of Greg Henry and Michael RÃ¶mer, but others are just boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movie, I really do, but it was a bit more down for the alphabet. Me I saw someone who compared this humor and horror to "The Army of Darkness" and "The Dead of the Dead" as well as "Against Re-Animation". You are definitely kidding. I did not find this funny image, I tried it, it made an effort, (probably a lot more of an effort), but my opinion failed. When I was hit by catching the 3rd or fourth one-fishing, I was turning my eyes and checking my watch. <br /> <br /> There was definitely a lot of respect for many other movies, which are always cool, kind of funny junkie for us. But here it is just a lack of original thought. Of course there were some nice special effects, well-groomed, but it can not carry a complete movie. The changed grant is cross between Jabba Hats and in the first phase of evolution, the "strange science" looked like a cross between "the cheetah" ("after becoming a monster") and "explorer" and alien animals / children. It just did not work. I think it looks like some of the grade 5 art classes might be designed by some kids. Then there was Brenda, that female grands impregnated and covered in the barn. When he finally reached the aid he looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. The design was completely unimaginative again. A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. * Jung * <br /> <br /> Now I can see more movies with Jummies among them. In those days, I wanted a patent for Romero in George and only one writer / director was allowed to do this. Apart from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy), he has done the right thing so far. Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style of Zombie. Perhaps Mr. Ramroo has destroyed a zombie movie for me, because its performers cry, cry and get involved as their compresses dry up and lack of dry fluid even a drop and they are struggling with their muscle influences. They were created by the rigid mortis that have started to set right before re-animated. "Wheel" was not the motivation of humans ... They were awesome junkies. <br /> <br /> So at the end I have a few smiles and some nice "Slyth" beautiful scenes for some.
