This is an awesome small film - and, unfortunately, the company that created this short story has made several. The brief is basically a fun idea that was not fun at the beginning and could insult you too. It must have made me uncomfortable to see very young people (about 2 years old) and pretending to be an adult - in this case, a dancer girl and bar room sponsors This is the humor that if you pretend to be adults, you might be forced to laugh at your own kids, but I do not want anyone to see it - especially when the young Sheryli Temple is rather slimy and dress like a vamp. By !! And then, some of the other kids work like adults rather than in adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they are not trying to apply to pedophiles, but today it comes to mind immediately seeing! For this reason, this annoying movie ALSO has thrown me out and I do not expect to see it again !! Quite weird and pretty terrible
