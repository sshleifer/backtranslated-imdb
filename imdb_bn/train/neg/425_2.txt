I can not believe that I am very angry to see that I am going to write my first review on IMDB. <br /> <br /> This Disney Documentary is nothing but Planet Earth Lights. Now I knew that it was advertised as "From the people you accepted the Earth", but I did not realize they were going to use it using the same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series. I see some of the owners already in the DVD $ 8.75 provided. Do not warn Disney of the fact that there is no original origin (save James Earl Jones's voice-over and the 90-second sealfish which I do not believe in the Planet Arther). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the death of male smoker Beers, they raise their children significantly after a year and show some garbage on how they are prepared to carry their memories, and the earth is really a beautiful place after all. Children are not afraid of the death of children due to the same difficulties, there is no caution for future generations, if we do not work together at all, nothing is there. We've just seen the whole film of the movie (and many more times, if you have already seen a billion people in the billion world). <br /> <br /> I never gave up the feeling of the theater, I am ashamed and deceived in my life.
