This is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all TOOO long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Line rained. <br /> <br /> There was no comedy comedy !!!!! It was not funny .... <br /> <br /> The story is so annoying and badly written that if the letters survive or die, it does not matter ....... <br /> <br / > My expectations from this movie were ......... but my expectations were completely upset within the first few minutes ... <br /> <br /> The only thing good for this movie is .. .... and obviously Vidya Balan. He has given the best performance and stands among all the senior actors ... He is just a new actor and yet he has played and made the rest of the custom look so kind !!!!! To help Govinda and his love interest, blonde also helps in saving this devastating film. Govinda fits perfectly in the role of taxi driver And the blonde also gives a very delicate and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> Another gifted actress, Ayesha Takya, is completely lost in this movie !!!! So Priyanka !!!!!!!! Akshay did his role well but it seems too much !!!!! Anil and Zuho are completely destroyed ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All these Mushrooms Screenplay and TOOO are an impossible film with Masladar, which transforms the story into play according to the comedy comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is! !!!!!! <br /> 3/10 it's four hours long !!!! Think and RETHINK !!!! Avoid it well !!!!!
