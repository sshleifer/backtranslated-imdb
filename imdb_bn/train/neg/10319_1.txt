Contrary to many, I do not think the show's premiere or theme is at least bit offensive. But his death sentence is completely another matter. Like many B-minus movies, all the appropriate trafficking seems to have been divided into trailers. For most 22 minutes, we long for any kind of original humor. Or at least avoid remoting remote remote or carpet fiber. Acting with some exceptions is horrific; Some cast members have comic overting and jesstooling suitable for infirmary on a late night, but despite the main cultural angle, I can not help despite the main cultural angle, but it seems that this is mainly due to the unarmed shot by CBC to replicate the success of a corner gene. Unfortunately, they have received the voice - and the script is totally wrong for the person. The final insult is that they did not really afford the ability to work in a real small town (why? They were so difficult to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think that the residents of the city would make Falcon out of the city outside of Rajina? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing will go very soon, and the CBC preachers in the world that have been very early, forget about this incredible embarrassment quickly.
