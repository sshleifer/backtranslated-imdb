This story-telling is an unrealistic piece. This concept is going on for about an hour before we are guessed about it; Characters are often inhuman mumble; The actions often seem to have a relation with each other; Someone can not be worried about actually killing the girl; Nothing will happen to swim in the water that seems like a pair of malicious kids; Irisman did not see any of his friends face to face any obvious reason ... like the movie itself is annoying. Only half the recreational elements are landscape photography; But no one could point out a camera to the Australian Outback, to get a memorable shot. Overall - lazy, inconsistent, proactive - and annoying to ruin the viewers' time.
