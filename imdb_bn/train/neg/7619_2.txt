As a mystery science theater 3000 fan, I can tolerate any motion picture which can be focused on me, but there is no reason for this. <br /> <br /> "Super Action" rated in the blockbuster video section and awesome "banned visual sticker" given I guess this is the only method that the filmmaker (HA!) Robert Nepnon uses to get an unexpected person at least 4.50 You can <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! These poor Mexican actors are involved with you to exploit, who you probably hoped to make it big in American cinema. You're a dishonest! <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that takes the slightest step. Do you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they're a rave in a field! All of them like 6. And the Asian people in that background? Why is it always time of day? Why does it take 1/2 of the film to show it? .. and more important why do we see another 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You give me 4.50 rupees.
