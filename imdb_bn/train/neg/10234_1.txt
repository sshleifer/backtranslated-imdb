I will keep this brief; Thank you for helping me to thank Greg: The prisoner is about a man who is treated as a prisoner for drinking, hijacking and torturing a girl, then having sex with her. This movie's single twist and poinen It is a slow date torture as a rape. And, it's not a good movie. It's not too bad it's good; It's just bad. It should also be noted that there is a "ridiculous code" among critics that they do not dare to break, although some were tempted for it, because it is very weak. Why somebody stood up and said loudly, "This garbage, and for this reason," out of me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
