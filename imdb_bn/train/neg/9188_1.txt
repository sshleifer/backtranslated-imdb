I saw this only film made by Ube Bowl, I knew that perhaps he was probably the worst director who made films based on video games that "the house of the dead" is an under IMDB 100. I still wanted to see it because I am a huge fan of the game and I want to see that this film of Doa has made so much worse. After watching this, I wanted to concede that the movie was not a story. In the first 15-20 minutes, there was nothing but a brain with which no brain was running (for a moment I thought the zombie brain dead or the girls?) So there was no animal in the street at night and after a man started attacking a woman shooting them It started, that means I'll take you 5 minutes later. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, Or horror? Or both? A good thing which I did not manage to see it all so I wake up during the second half and end up in the last credit before I know it! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Bowle, please do not make any other film. Thanks!
