I will try to use words to describe this .... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in my own hand, but after coming back I had to fear a signal. <br /> <br /> And when I chose it I was 'frightened', but now I have seen it, I have to say, I thought it was worse though. Why does this movie still spin my mind to get money. <br /> <br /> Let's start with actors; They are not good at all, but should say, some easily become horrible. But an actor can do a script like this. It is trying to make a copy of the main places when these places have changed, any type of story has ended, and any effort to bring something that has not happened before it fails with failure. It's a vain attempt to get up-to-date, they try to make it exciting using the whole 'big brother' theme, but it has been worn many years ago and offers nothing without a filler for the beginning and ending. An attempt was made to try to save the film by creating some references to the original value of '83, but it was simply funny and sometimes somewhat sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing to do and I understand nothing, do it ... see it, or play frisbee ... with the DVD ... by yourself. It will offer you the same amount of fun. I promise
