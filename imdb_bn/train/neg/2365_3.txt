This movie is just bad. Bad Bad Bad Now that I've found that way, I feel good. This movie is poorer since the beginning. The story is in hair. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddie is the worst of his cartoon character. Thank God they killed him off. And who wants to see Roj√°n and Tom Arnhem? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in this movie is our little background given in Freddie. We saw once he was a family, and we would see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). Worse than all the <br /> <br />. Here are some quality actors (Lisa Zen and Yepat Koto), and they do their best, but the end result is so bad. For half an hour I have spent watching this movie and I have never been able to come back for about one and a half hour.
