Oh why can not a decent film out of a legend story? This is the second adaptation of "Bufous" which I was disappointed in a year. But I want to say, the previous version ("Windy and Grand", played by Gerald Butler) was much more than this. That was just a little frustrating. This is a mess! <br /> <br /> What is my worst? Was it a vain plot element added for a special cause (human sacrifices? Vain love interest?), Or bad CGI, or characters inconsistent or unreasonable? Even worse they look so beautiful Marina Marina Sirtis !!! And even that does not allow you to talk about laughable crossways? <br /> <br /> And why they repeatedly remind us that there was power of 30 people in the boudoil, and yet he did not show the slightest sign of power throughout the film. He wandered around with two monsters, standing beside him to save his bacon. Even the arrogant scared the prince, he did not push him. She was very reliant on arms. Beo-wimp is much better. This epic poem was not strong bout! <br /> <br /> I want to finish it on a positive note but I really can not think of a abduction. What I can say is that, if you have ever read "Bauful", you will be infuriated by the wrong excuse for this dishonor, inconsistency!
