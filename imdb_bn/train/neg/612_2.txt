As far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those who is very bad, it is incredibly annoying. A lonely losing high school student who is constantly sorted by classmates and rejected by the girls, having sex with a drunk redneck ends up walking in the trash mom of her trailer. Then he kid out in a nearby cornfield and killed him. Apparently, the children's souls were transferred into a scary, which then killed him and teachers who were tortured. For everyone of his victims, away from a graduate-one-liner, this scarecrow can flips matrix-like through the air and can kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why he always see a rotted corpse? Like two irrational sequels to follow it, it's not even worth a smile.
