[*** Possible Spinners ***] The fame of this movie was already there, so it was with the hope that I was sitting in it to look at the character box in TCM. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a movie related to alcohol, family division, infidelity, gambling, and sexual abuse, the movie is strange Flat, disorganized, useless and clay-ridden. An example of Frank Hirish's unconstitutional image: The screenplay of Frank Hirash's dishonesty: more than the predictions of his head rather than the desire for his head instead of being "up and running somewhat" from his head - contact his secretary on his evening ("Hey Nancy, today I got blues. Let's go for a drive "), according to all the well-equipped sources. We do not think this is real people, but playing a marionette playing cardboard cutouts. Also, the source of obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirosh is not really searched or explained. Dave's repeat / stop repeated obscurity is impossible to overcome his weak impairment or to get out of the pot. Following the disappointment of Sheryl McLean / Gini's character, the moment her marriage was presented to this viewer, perhaps, the failure to fail, and it was clear - by the soap opera convention - it will be solved by only killing someone. Immediately the lover runs around the gun, I started betting on myself - who killed guinea? The whole thing was horrible with the capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> Not saying that Maclaine's performance and Dean Martin's standouts here But overall, I found the film's interest in films from the history of Hollywood completely.
