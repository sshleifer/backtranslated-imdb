It is difficult to judge arbitrarily in a film, which has so much effect on me in my youth. This is with a doubt of the worst kind of exploitation film. I was unfortunate to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I would never forget it. I had the most horrific movies ever made it. I have seen this again again this year and I was afraid again. <br /> <br /> I'm not an enthusiast, it's a big crime to tell others what to say and what to say, rather I have done a great crime to do something that is horrific to be involved in rape in this movie. I love orange movies but this is just normal nasty. Instead of hire some Rus Myer.
