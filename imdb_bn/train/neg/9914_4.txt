This film confronts child abduction from a mother's perspective (Lisa Hartman Black) acts like a man who will work in an action thriller. In contrast to other films where the focus is on the police, the mother is following her ex-husband, who kidnapped his son. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do it. She gets caught, and then realizes that this is not her child. The person who was waiting for most people to wait in a mental ward or a few months in prison. However, in this movie the mother was released a few hours later because the hunter's parents are sorry for her. After some time the mother entered her mother-in-law's house and the police arrived and noticed their guns but they let her run because they recognized her (and sorry for her?). <br /> <br /> They found the child in another place in the story, but when the police came to find the house, they left the door and went into the river on a ding, apparently an important turn for the father! The mother gets her to rob someone, and even though she must take some time (in real world), she and the lawyer-boyfriend, and the police will catch another valley very quickly and it will turn out to be water by land. Instead of stepping out of the roof to find the father in the field, the mother thought that she drowned the boy and when he saw his life-jacket, he got into the water. Of course, he could not swim like a rock. The lawyer protects them, but they get the chance even after their parents. At one point his mother died in a clinic in Mexico. Where it goes, and where nobody knows! In some ways, this movie really absorbs child abduction and it is not very positive. On the other hand, it is fun to see a woman doing crazy things in such movies (or funny?).
