Miscasting will happen. Susanah York is a bright young Jane, and her performance is perfect. However, Edward Rochester is considered to be 35 years old. White-haired George C. Scott thinks and behaves like a pregnancy 80. Jane's dead uncle is better! He creaks and snarls, offensive and deadly. He looks like a bastard killer who has sharpened his ax axened out; We are not surprised that he has detained his wife! The great love story looks like a Saddam-Masocic nightmare. The novel is quite dark, but Bronte's Rochester is comparatively young, athlete, strong and charming. He has a fine speech and voice of singer, a good mind, and a conscience that he fails to fail.
