This is a film that shows that the mood and music and textures are not enough to make good films. Of course, the audience is treated in the beautiful scenes of Los Angeles in the late 30's - I especially liked the view of the trolley in transit, and the tramway was mounting on the mountain - but in a sense this delicate painting is self-defeated, because it creates a mood that "something happens Going "- and does nothing. The script puts the risk in some plots or actions or injuries - and time is not wasted after the time. The character of the movie is necessary (I guess) even the letters are not necessarily wrong. Both the actors, both highly praised for their roles, have not expressed any repression or pain, and the script does not reveal us. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Soreland? That's another story. Her character was so beautiful, so she played perfectly, the camera wanted to follow her.
