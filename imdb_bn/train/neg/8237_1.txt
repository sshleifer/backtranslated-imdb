How is this film ever released in the name of holiness? It seems like it was shot on someone's mobile phone and the screaming girl took the whole new depth. They literally scream for the whole 90 minutes. And that's all they are. There is no plot, no excitement, no characters, and a lot of acting. Just shouting and screaming. <br /> <br /> I left after fifteen minutes and to see if I could see a wound soon. It's not - of course, without screaming. Okay, there's another problem going forward in Fast Forward - there's no camera to talk about. Each shot looks like each shot - mid-distance, one angle, dust, dust, dull. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. It's good. It's just plain bad.
