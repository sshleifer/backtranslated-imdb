When a theater's staff finds the old rock of the film, they decide to show it at the screening of Night of the Living Dead, it is an old preview relay. Unfortunately, this is actually an old-minded mind control test that makes audiences a group of unconditional shuffling jambos. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the hatred of this movie. It is a low budget independent production with very few camps, but it is not eligible for "1.1" in IMDB. It's just a lot of fun. It is clear that film makers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror films, and they have created a recreational tribute by scanning them with references and tributes in various ways. There are feelings of such things as Living Dead (very similar in many ways), Evil Dead 2 and Darkness of the Army and others. <br /> <br /> How do I explain the dead bodies, though they may actually think that they may have the physical characteristics of a zombie, actually living dead-incredible person, but I appreciate the efforts of the authors to explain it. The effects of Gore was perfect for the budget, the acting was right, and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I like it.
