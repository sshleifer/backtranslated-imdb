The romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood is a romantic drama (William Holden, surprisingly enjoyable among this extremely fabulous arrangement) about a ridiculous hippie (Kaya Lanez) and love relationship that grew between Los Angeles real estate agents in her golden years. The script is a little but without some thoughtful paragraphs; Yet the scene is now like a middle-aged blackberry, which comes as much of the picture as the picture. It has done a lot of good work in different ways: Holden and Lenz do not match well (its measurement seems to be very little about the tower), which makes their close scenes less stirred than uncomfortable. Date, smoke-romantic, and mostly unusual. ** **** to
