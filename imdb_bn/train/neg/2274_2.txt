Well, I hate Hollywood, but love the movie so I have to see these ugly movies in the theater. And, I hope Vanilla Sky will be good. I hope they basically "open your eyes" will actually keep one, or they will make it their own. Well, it's a little bit, and sucked it. <br /> <br /> It's a good start. I love radiohide I wish that were more than that. But ultimately we have to listen to good vibrations by beech age. Talk about a wide range of suction. The club had one or two good songs and probably had some songs, but oh why they had to bite the GV during climax. It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it does not have anything to do with the plot. At least keep some money behind the song. Children A = Primary Anyway <br /> <br /> <br /> She also works with the club scene. It was awesome. Otherwise the movie was a big force of arrogance. As the audience will get the movie. It will read the subtitles, and will not be left. It's as simple as that. Motivation got all screwed. I did not understand the motivations of Diaz (did they not work on the chicken soup night before?) And anything else. And I hate Cart Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in this type of film [like Aye Wide Shot]). And lift. I get it As they tried to improve the original with a nasty American rock soundtrack and crappy corners and good film prints and shiny processing and it helped if crowe did not screw it up. <br /> <br /> 2/10 the main disappointment.
