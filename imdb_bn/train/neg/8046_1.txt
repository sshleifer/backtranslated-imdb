Any? Do not think so! Well, in this case you have to stay away from what you have to do, "you want to know a secret" because it is only the one-half pointless post - "screen" which is not completely slash without a price discount. The plot is ridiculous; The characters are incredibly stupid, the cattle-factor is insignificant and the whole thing is just really annoying! You can already receive from the title, because this image is basically inspired by "I still know what you did last summer" because the events are in similar settings and killer's motivation is equally stupid. Why would anyone want to steal ideas from junk like "iWWLDs", a complete mystery to me, however At least this film can depend on Jennifer Love Hevitt's valuable rack, but the girls of this junk are terribly illusory in addition to the brain. One year after her boyfriend, still unauthorized murder of Beth Morgan, her new adulteress and lover of four college students went to Florida, so that they could spend their spring break vacations at a Spanish Beach House. The killers did not take any action all year, but now they follow the flock of Florida and start their coupons while leaving the title message as a few business cards. There is no ambiguous face behind a ridiculous mask and you do not have to be really awesome experts to think of the attempts to write the wrong track undoubtedly embarrassing. Since this plot is so thin, since most of the films are completely irrelevant padding, including the incompetent Florida Police Force and the 'mysterious' sub-plot of the FBI Inspector, who wants to set their own personal scores. The event of murder is impossible on the screen (when you do not hate it when it happens?), There is no unrealistic T & A to enjoy, and you will not start well on the quality of my conversation. The trouble through shit like this is that only you realize that the joyful spirit of the slashers of 80 has gone for the better.
