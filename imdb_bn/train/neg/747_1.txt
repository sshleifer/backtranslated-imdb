Finally, I thought that someone h Yes. Wells is going to judge classic, not just in the wrong locale or any other version of the era, but strongly dependent on the book. Well it clearly follows the book closely, and that this mess is the only plus. <br /> <br /> It is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours) long, book only 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hynes is asked to show the nerve here and says "If you can do something better ..." I would say "yes, I used to be" and I have never used a video camera or any kind of The drama school of my life <br /> <br /> I made a great payment to get this shit in the United States of America in the United States, do not make the same mistake as me.
