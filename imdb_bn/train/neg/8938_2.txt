I still can not believe how bad the movie was. If I was not a masses, I would not see if I would have lived to see. Looks like it cost about $ 1000 to build, but it does not mean bringing it to them. Acting was horrible - not just bad, 3rd grade riders could read the lines better. Secondly, the only reason to see such a film is skin, and it is painful to this flick. We will not even see more interesting chicas in buff. <br /> <br /> Ahhah good, good luck next time?
