Director Spike Lee is famous for making filmmaking, indicating racism. In many movies, such as "The Right Thing," most white people are all brutal racist. In this film, subject to different marriage content, there is a complete problem with racism. It's amazing that the double quality available worldwide. If Lee or any other person ever makes such bias against another group, he will be jealous, but Christian? Hey, it's their "open season". <br /> <br /> The respected OC Davis shot his son, shot him, and then kept his betrayal on top of his Bible. If you miss it, then just zoom that for another closing. Hey, people, here is another Bible reader and see how he is! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who can argue racism as an evil thing? However, it is set for Lee in his film as it is in his other films. His clear bitterness situation does not help the white man. It only adds fire fuel. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: Get started "Start the right thing" and leave your ancestors in Colette. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
