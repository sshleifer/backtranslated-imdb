My 7-year-old girl liked it, because she would do according to the strict assessment of Disney Execution. The problem is that "air sisters." It is a strictly numerical number of children's films, calculated comprehensively, politically correct morality of a couple, and enough laughing to avoid a horrible G rating. As a parent, even as 10-year-old, you saw it all before, and worked well before. Think, "101 Dalmatians are meeting home alone" and you get the general idea. I have a good story of a good children's story that is of the opinion, duration "Air Beeds," which are almost as real as recycled paper, fail to meet that standard This is not the worst video seen on your child, but there are better migration.
