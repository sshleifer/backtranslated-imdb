I've just finished watching this movie and I was basically just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> I'm an RPG gamer (computer type, one of the DND Tablet stuff) but I could not find any joke <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I'm just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think in the whole movie I smiled about 2-3 times. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> Even if I do not have a DND fan with this huge movie, I do not even suggest getting annoyed with the movie and it will probably be the best to clean it.
