I love horror movies. I can even praise most cheese (face to face, 9 of the 10 horrible movies on this day are in cheese), but it was just ridiculous. Dreadful acting, horror writing, complete holes, and incredible characters (there are no main actors here!) And the total lack of enough body count. I'm 79 minutes salvage in my life I just want to waste. At least Krook brothers are named. The only good thing about the whole picture was to see Alicia Silverstone - face-to-face. How to ever Sundance it is totally annoying to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even in the scale of the slash film. Come on, come on! Who will suddenly get 10 seconds of cheap earrings after a quarrel? Lame
