A little boy kills his mother and his father hangs himself in. Twenty years later, he gathered friends together for separateness so that he could not escape like his father. All stock letters are in place: nice couple; "Funny" guy; Hard (but sensitive) hood; Smart girl (she wear glasses - that's how we know); Nerd and blondes no two personality. It involves stupid wood statues (not asked) and kill people. I knew when I was in danger, after a big opening scene, we jumped 20 years later - all the horrible movies do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is frustrating, acting bad Palmer - why Betsy?) and killing stupid and / or hypothetical. My favorite scene is that when two people are sexually permitted with permission and the idol prevents the man from wearing the bed fully dressed! A real bad, stupid incoherent horror film. To avoid all costs.
