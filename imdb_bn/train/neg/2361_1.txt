The worst of this movie series is the easiest. Although the new line may look at sales only, they all know that it has earned more money than ever before due to its 3D end. It was not good at 3-D, because it was 50 degrees red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was such that people wanted to see what they wanted to see. Still the movie was so bad! Bad scripts, bad characters, bad acting, bad directions. This movie is trying to push the camp factor more often like the "Lonny tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for horror listeners, because it is not scary and scary and not funny. Amusing for the comedy crowd A really mess with some really bad kaymas, which is still trying to play this whole thing as a camp and it's probably going to be smaller than what they wanted. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were fans of this series, just this was the prayer that this would have ended in how bad it was achieved. It is a film that gets horrific outside popularity and can be a trap of faith that the audience wanted to laugh about some stupid comedies looking at really good and scary horror movies.
