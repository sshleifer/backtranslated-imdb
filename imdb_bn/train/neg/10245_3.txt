I hope a lot from this movie. Like Kinda Lek's life is like Nostradamas, but instead I wasted time and lost films. I can not even explain this movie. It was terrible scripts from biblical pieces like wood acting, ventilation, tide waves, and earthquakes. But that's the end! I had to wait the rest and hoped that something would be meaningful but that did not happen. This movie is about a couple who tries to find changes in the world in China where the earthquake occurs and ends in a convention run by eight people and a priest. Convocation is the end of the misshappenings. Full movie missiles and annoying. One of the worst lees.
