ARG In these horror third film Shafing Dinosaurs came out of our bouts of another bane. During this time, European terrorists (Irish I say) Hi-Jack is a military coup that talks about uranium transport. They pull into a shipyard, open trucks and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemium comes after the Rubber DINOS terrorist, police and some marine soldiers disperse. It seems that the whole film (again) was inspired by the Alien (such as Carnosaur 2) that "clustrophobic" was going to the ship's building? Guns ready This third image is perhaps the most dry and unreasonable film, with only one type of blood when the rubber dino closes the marine head. When the dinosaurs are as tough as normal, shuffling animals and t-rexes roar, it sounds like a mad elephant (it seems to have no eyes). Copernicus is one of the most important pictures in the film: they enter the house where the hijack truck is kept and you hear some strange sound from another truck. After the surprise of the opening! Rubber reptile gang explodes and consume them. Why was Dino locked in the second truck after fleeing the first truck? How can they be locked because the door of the truck can only be locked from outside? What was the point of filming this scene ???? Oh bored, who care? Thumbs down for both Rubber Iguanas in size over.
