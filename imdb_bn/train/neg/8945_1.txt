I must admit, before watching the cinematic adaptation, I have actually bought some books that I actually read. Nineteen nineteen-four can be one of those rare events. The book was great. It was immersive and interesting predictive. But the movie sucked just plain. It's the worst film I've ever seen. I did not close it after the first 5 minutes, because the movie was half-divided into two parts for a single class to see. It was dark and diverse, but did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. The performance was nothing more than the average and there was not much to consider, it was extremely fatal. For example, the book did not impress me that Winston could not be more embarrassed than a single word at one time. The annoying, annoying, and apparently unexpected, the film is completely cancerous. Wait a second ... Is not it British?
