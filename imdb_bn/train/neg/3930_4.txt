Second Renaissance, Part 1 Let us show how machines first rebelled against humans. It starts in a single case, in which machines claim that they also have the right to stay, when people say that a robot is something they own and so they can do something they want. <br /> <br /> Although an interesting firmness, the story (violent!) robots and riots among mankind becomes really stupid. Any other critic indicates it, since it does not seem right in any way, it is all very clever. <br /> <br /> Animation stories near the matrix core (especially Osiris) work best. As part of the Second Renaissance 1, I want to say it is very violent and very stupid. 4/10.
