Anyone who was a fan of the original series, there is also a source of stories that should be embarrassed by this series. Borg does not come until the cargo enterprise is brought to the gamma sector, never before seen before facing them, the NCC-1701 was the first ship carrying the name of the enterprise .... What do I need? Berman and Pillier's Jean Rodneyby created a smile. After death, they saw only $$$$ and walked on their own path. No wonder that Majel Barrett was in every episode of the star track until this series. I do not blame her for not involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. She is a great actor, as a whole cast. I like them all, but the story is sad and ignores all ancestors determined by the original series. Just check the rating. I saw more people deep space 9 (which was incredibly canceled).
