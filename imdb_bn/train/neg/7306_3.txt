One of the most horrible films I ever surrounded through. I never took the time to write one of these, but after feeling guilty after producing this film I felt compelled and feeling a bit annoyed to waste my time on being honest. There were so many parts that caused me totally annoyed due to their complete randomness and lack of sense (for example, when the police force ever shot people with infectious disease? When will the hospitals be expelled for the lack of cure, when his wife wanders on her bed in her dress gown Wandering around?). Also, the characterization - as we often came to expect in such films - was horrific (like a blonde man - I do not remember his freakin name and did not toss anything - completely turned his girlfriend out and left him) and finished So far I want to finish them all! There was nothing to write about the production was terribly disconnected and cinematography.
