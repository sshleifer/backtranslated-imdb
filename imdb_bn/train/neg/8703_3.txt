The Primitive Species (1996, D. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The army commando team will have to think quickly if they want to prevent the extinction of humans but instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> You see the cover and get the movie's first impressions. It's pretty much around. Acting is only acceptable from only few characters. The story is based on the poor, army and mineine, the whole film is trying to kill the dinosaur. This picture came three years after Jurassic Park. Instead, the film seems to have come out of the Jurassic Park 13 years ago. Dinosaur costumes have been created so badly, and I mean costume. People have definitely dressed up, and this film makes no effort to hide this. A scene when a dinosaur is driven to a surface, a scene is created, where it appears that anyone surrounds the creature. This is a good thing, which comes out of this movie. Short running time In just 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not waste too much of your life, but try to avoid it completely. <br /> <br /> "It's like the 13th nightmare of Friday." Officer (Brian Curry)
