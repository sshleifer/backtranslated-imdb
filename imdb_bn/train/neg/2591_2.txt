At the beginning, I want to say that I'm a fan of American Pie series. Although 'nude miles' and both of these are the worst, it seems to be the fall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First, the best part of the film was an American pie photo, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are several bad things to say about this movie. After all, the story has a very old 'pressure' structure. First, the characters have the role, then the promise of the Beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which is exactly 25 minutes in length. Along with the general stability of the plot, there is little to no character development, which creates a double trim of a bad plot. From <br /> <br />, I deeply dislike stereotyping in this movie. In other words, the flock is very cool, as the only thoughtful sex-boys, and clearly showing the ghi as inferior. Also, it only shows women as sex objects, and males only want to deal with women as sex objects. <br /> <br />, the performance was also poor. Perhaps with the exception of Steve Tullle <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> If you can see from a teen point view, I guess this is good, but this movie has been rated 18+ in most countries, so it should not really be seen by minors.
