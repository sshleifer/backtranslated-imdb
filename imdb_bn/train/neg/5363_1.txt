I do not think this movie was bad except for bad script, bad acting except Janine Turner, no imagination, a fool plot, a stupid ass husband and unfair divorce settings. If you have never seen this movie before, it is not worth it. The only thing that was good about it was Jenner Turner, acting a good job. Terry's husband is a stuck smart-ass defense attorney who has won in most cases and even the criminals murdered. He thinks he is so smart but he really is a nut. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Beautiful girl Yes he is really the real pitch, no. She is no day at the beach.
