Tom is listening to the old-time radio broadcast, some of today's kids will be seen on TV in the 1950s. However, when making this cartoon, they did not make television, so get the stories from their jokes on radio from music to music. <br /> <br /> Tom literally vibrates in his boots and hears some stories about "Phantom". He is doing exactly what he is doing to the narrator, for example, "the hair is standing permanently, the coldness of the ice awakens in his spinal cord, and his heart gradually slows it down on his throat". - Cat antics. <br /> <br /> We will get a taste of what we will see after 194-cartoons, which are tortured by Tom for any reason other than shocking fun. If the cat asks the problem, then it is a thing, but when he remembers his business, and Jerry misuses him physically (and mentally), then my "little man" has a hard time. <br /> <br /> It was one more minute to follow the initial T & M efforts. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It actually pulled for a while. The sketch went too long because it might have been missing some five minutes of missing. It's normal for Tom and Jerry. Generally, they are very fast paced.
