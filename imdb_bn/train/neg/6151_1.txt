... and * in any way * clear, logical and do not realize that the painting of tired tired fatigue is illustrated in the picture. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old, and spent my 16 years. Life is struggling with misleading fears and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character of the film, I was successful mainly because of the reason: I was thinking about maintaining a confusion from reality and to know what was actually happening and to know what was going on. In the end, I was really successful because of the medication, but I certainly went crazy because I already knew what medication I had taken, and there was no difference between it. <br /> <br /> So, I think you deserve to say this video is a total fraud. It does not only spoil the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - here is something really important), but in most cases it shows a consoling, humorous view of schizophrenia - which is completely absent of the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is not the brain structure, not the disease. A schizophrenic * is not a "common man with a disease", it is a person who feels differently from the point of view and from different people: things like that, time, place and human personality are not difficult. He may think it may be bent, it may change, it may change and even be invisible. To deal with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very fantastic internal world that does not expect "normal" people - but it remains trapped because it is not related to most people and ultimately its world is poor and poor. A blank, confusing dead end. <br /> <br /> This ridiculous "healing" is different from what is pictured in the Tier-Jarking movie. It should be violently horrific. Other people without the main character should appear strange, weird and weird, such as Linch's "Eraserhead", for example. * Really * should be interesting, weird, gross hallucinations, because it is about schizophrenia which is about It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", see p. Who Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubic", D.C. Play "American McGee's Alice" from "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or PC and you might have a vague idea like this. Do not watch the "Feel" movie of the month, see the situation of painful, characters and visual characters and stupid plot strategies. The "The Cell" is the most accurate film about the mind of a schizophrenic, his attitude and the inner compatibility - it is fierce, weird, confusing, and very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, not detailed about schizophrenia, it is not a handsome, you joke driven. It jumps into your mouth and does not let you go: The walls are separated, the people become strange creatures, you think you can pursue with time, you are not sure who you think you are all, everything seems to be . Strange, unusual. Believe me, this is so much more than what is illustrated in Melodrama like soap
