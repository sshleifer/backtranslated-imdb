The lack of film style, I mean the original style Everything shows a copy of the first appearance in photos, music, dialog, etc. Yes, there was a goof-up in the original, at the beginning such a car was shown **** number and a few seconds after it started falling down a hill including MH MH ****. There was a lot of movie in the movie :) Is there anything better in the movie? Yes, for Kareena fans, if any, then in Curina's Bikini. For Akshay fans, its dialog and action stunt. That's it. Nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and do not blame the director or actor. The director is already mad and the actor, I regret them.
