What is RGB? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Does he have run out of creative ideas? If he has, time to take back the seat. I went to see the movie with great prospect - of course I did not imagine that it would be somewhere nearby. I did not know it, promos said it all. But even then I think it would be a great RGV treatment, after all he is the same person who managed the truth and company? Or he? I have doubts after watching the AAG. I'm not going to talk about the plot or the story, because it is mostly taken from the original, if you really die and see it, you can play a fun game with friends: Identify the scenes from the original and give your own rating! So becomes Veeru Hero (how is that corny?), Estimates Heroes will not be that great word. The horror, the comedy, like Ajay Devon Hero, has become frustrating and the hate speech that was really effective in the company seems to be a fake. Chemistry does not exist between Hero and Gunguru (Nisha Kothari). In fact, more charming Nishas try to be more boring than them. This reached a peak by the end. The king is not really bad compared to the other, he is a man to see in the future. I was really frustrated with Amitabh Bachchan like Baban, he looked like Gabbar Singh's joke. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl covered with a bowl, instead he is afraid of a beggar like him with his bowl. Mahan Lal was the only demonstration like the inspector Narsingh. I do not have patience to write more I fear.
