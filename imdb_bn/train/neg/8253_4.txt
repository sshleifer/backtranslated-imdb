The film was a beautiful opening, I truly believe that I was among the best romantic comedy I've seen in a while ... There were some "foreigners" about the way to set up the film, though realistic, some abstract and mysterious. But then the story line is becoming more and more unreal. Not saying that the last thing was to be done and the product will become almost obscure ... the most common romantic finale where everything goes wild for everything 'favorite' character. In a scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake, and "the woman of his dream" confesses only to her love for her sympathetic crowd. Come on. In the end, 'good boys' win, 'bad boys' loose ... you get the picture. A WASTE A Possible Interesting Cinema
