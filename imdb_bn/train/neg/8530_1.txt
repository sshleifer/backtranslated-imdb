"Her Cardboard Girlfriend" is the last film of Narma Shearer. He left the movie and I think, joined the board of directors in the MGM. That was a good step in his part. The part of her "Cardboard Girlfriend" was talky and annoying. It was clear that there were few actors with conversations, so they had many conversations to carry this Turkey. <br /> <br /> This story was a good man (Robert Taylor) who was jealous of his playboy fianc√© (George Sanders) about a rich woman (Narma Sher). I'm surprised that director George Cooker, Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor did not spend most of the chat footage. Mr. Cook has played Mrs. Sheare's best "The Women" but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> Best acting in the film was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he gave his best comedy role in the film and in 1941 "When Ladies Meet". In 1942, she gave her best comedy performance in "Cardboard Girlfriend" and then gave her best dramatic performance "Johnny Ezar." She was a busy year. I am thinking of all MGM actors, Mr. Taylor has worked with many big and small actors. Also, mgm m Taylor gave all kinds of films - most of them were successful. For this reason, the MGM has kept him for 25 years. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was very good as a Socialite heel. Eight years later he played a similar role in "All Eve Ever Eve" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. For Mrs Scheer, it was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and very dramatic for this comedy. In 1939, he made "The Women" a great comedy and played his best. It was very clear that he was looking for his younger leading men "his cardboard lover". Also, it did help that its some clothes were not awful. <br /> <br /> Very bad he and Mr. Taylor do not "escape" in one dramatic movie, like their last movie. The same opinion about this movie could be mentioned in another movie, "Private property", which in 1937 with Jayel Harlowe. Taylor made. It was very gorgeous, boring, and the actress looked old. Miss Miss was sick throughout the movie and no one in Hollywood asked him to go to the doctor, so in 1937, he died at the age of 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and got a good role.
