I do not know why I waste time and take the time to review this movie. If you expect a satisfactory conclusion long enough ?? Good, bad, or wonderful ?? No It finally fizzles out after stiff, formula, expected conversations and acting. Indoor scenes are so tight that if you think the camera is zoomed out by a millimeter, you will see a clean light. Dresses, hairstyles, and sets are starred, tangled and readily. At the beginning of the 20th Century Arizona did we live like ordinary people? Comparison of other reviews compared to Sam Pacinpah, the insult of Packinpah: At least that director blown up his violence in relation to chaos and greatness. Hard Man's Gotta is the gratuitous Explosion Squib from bad guys wood impersonations with manicure nails. Huh?! I can believe Hesson thought that he might be doing something valuable with this picture. (He does not get to touch his gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I'm not guessing why I sign up for this travesty. Want to see a movie at the end of the West, as we knew, we knew them as the end of the West? See atheist or overwhelming again. The last hard man is a joke of a death in the west.
