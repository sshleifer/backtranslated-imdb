"Extreme Change: Home Edition" Yet another 'sentient', so-called 'heart warming', and out-for-rating shows that the ABC has time to keep together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problem that I go through this family. For that, I'm sorry. But four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, an underground pond taking half of the reservoir, and the kites all over the expensive designer clothes are too much bit for any family? Sure, this has been through a lot of families. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, the things posed by Ta Pantington and his crew in these rooms are appropriate for the whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really bothers me about this show is how well he and his crew are always good at saying about every little or family situation related to the family. A wheelchair-bound person says that he is 'too strong', or 'very brave' is really a bit old afterwards. That may sound rude, but believe me; Check out this program, and you'll see what you understand. <br /> <br /> To all, this show is exaggerated. If you want to see it, go ahead. This comment is just a head up you see.
