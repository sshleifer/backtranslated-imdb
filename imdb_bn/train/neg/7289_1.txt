This is a movie of an infinite appeal from a relatively well-defined group (in which I'm not part of) I did not expect this movie to go east - I finally got frustrated. The history of a terribly effective (often "rolled") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup tea. An epic poem like this should really provide its viewers with something more ending. Finally, such pictures are not about a human condition - this image gives a new light on its more meaningful aspects.
