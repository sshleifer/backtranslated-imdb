I did not really know that when I went to the theater (this campaign on satanism, etc.) I saw the last film trailer very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? I do not think the idea of ​​my good idea and honesty, I feel like showing a really good, scary movie, some puppy is not a religious French that some chick tries to score cheap thrills by being bloody a few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from the barbarians! (!) But I found it very strange that an atheist, who is receiving a pink gold string from a dead priest, can suddenly end up with Christ's wounds to be deeply religious ??) I mean, he has been frustrated with despair, losing Have elements, behave as a general rebel et al, and here he is showing the wounds of Jesus Christ ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> His crucified scene, behind the head, shouted, blood everywhere, it tired of seeing a dozen times. It was not fearful or frightening, just boring. However, it has become very painful to see - that dazzling scene was extremely annoying ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you have a Catholic, the defiant does not see it. If you're not, still do not see it.
