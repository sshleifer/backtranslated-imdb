Straight to point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most curious, shiny and cruel horror films ever made. This "comedy" is something that is similar to a trace that is made even that it is almost even unavailable to something that is even vague. I said almost because after all there are all fans. <br /> <br /> This picture is not even bad, "good" is bad or "enjoyable". "Cinema 9" or "Robot Slow" is an offense for these movies to keep the movie at the same level of entertainment. The film like that can actually see you and get a kick out. But this picture is so bad, so badly created, played and scripts and so incredible breed, there is no trace of only "camp" or "scalp". <br /> <br /> Although this was made Saturday night before the live premiere, the comparison was probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL scit you can find. And people, that's BAD. To leave male viewers, Shapiro threw every breast breast of the breast, but since 1974, weak-painted breasts will not excite anyone this day. In fact, this image has become so weak and this kind of sleep inspiration revolves around, I suspect that if someone was excited in 1974, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A man made this image. I swear to God that anyone ten years old, with a video camera, can be some fun and more clever. It's just just unrealistic - it's really an incredible movie. "Jokes" and "Gagas" are so childish that even little boys do not like to tear parents' kisses at night. <br /> <br /> I'll give this picture one thing - the last sequence, the "dancer" sequence, where a guy on a NYC street (Shapiro) plays a melody, this awesome movie is the best thing to do. Shapiro is trying to fill the time for the entire song - at the moment it is not clear immediately - "Danced man" sequence is not great - but in fact it was a bit viewable. The part of this sequence that begins with dancing with the people of the cop itself, the trail of the whole film is the only trace. There is no doubt that Shapiro has finished this sequence - again, though not so big, it easily hits anything else in this "film". No, this movie is such a complete piece, it is impossible how a real man can become so stupid clever. This image should have been named "Why Shapiro Crumpom". It was surprising that it was made, but many real genius filmmakers could not enter it. However, I would say that I believe that gifted people in NYU will love this movie. Total garbage
