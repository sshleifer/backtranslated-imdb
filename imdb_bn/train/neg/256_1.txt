What? What does jammy fox seem to be funny? Does he really feel funny? Well, interesting to see his confidence became funny. There is no identity of the human being ... I mean that you can see his statues, immediately see, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he really strives to imitate them in most of his movies. The only problem is that he did it bad, disrespect and some parts where he looked like a partner, with the machine ** t attitude and then suddenly Martin Lawrence, went to be funny and weird-stupid comic. It does not have any personal touch, I mean that he does not contribute anything to the person he tries to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really m Dool-boy. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping for Hollywood, and the example of the black community in America is good for launching a great stardome, for example, like Don Chadle, but probably the gentle remixes that kindly represents Jamie's good generation.
