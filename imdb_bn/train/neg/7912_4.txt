Most agree that Wolverine's character is one of the most scary characters in the history of the Coolic book. I'm not a marvel expert, but I grew up with the courage of X-Men and explicitly approved Hugh Jackman's scrawl logan's widely known screenplay. I enjoyed the first X-Men, Sevoyel was very heavy and dirty, and liked the third as comic book entertainment. Through three movies, I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I have pursued the idea of ​​creating a "source" movie about Vovirin can very well end up as a better film than three X-Men movies. If we pay attention to one character, then I think that I can achieve a movie that the second movie failed - it's a fairly complex and courage-driven comic book adventure. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This is not because of a plot development that is also clear and beyond basic - though it is certainly not good - because it does not seem that the film does not even try. At the beginning, it does not qualify as good entertainment. There are some steps in this movie that are very close automatically. With elements of a special effect or suspicion and when an event gives you the following five predictions, it looks like a brighter film, it's an action / adventure movie that implies you have seen dozens of times before. Of course, this film is not terrible as a bolus piece. ** But when everyone is told that they are part of an event that is a partner then you should at least create the connection and of course it is bad enough. <br /> <br /> But there is a big problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way, which makes you forgive many plot holes and character stupidity. I think you find the most basic error in the title too. I mean, "Origins". Really? People behind this movie are thinking about that title? What do they mean? Do you want to know the source of Wolverine? She grew up with her brother. They ran away from home in dramatic situations. Then they went off to fight. All of them Civil War, First World War and Second and Vietnam. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Finally, the brothers (Subertoth operated by Libra Sreebeer) became bad. "How?" You ask. I do not know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Haney. "Yes, but why?" You still ask. I just said I do not know !! The movie does not explain. He is bad "Yeah, but ... you know, the 'original' ... yes, a source that's good! I mean, duo! However, they finally ended up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers, some with the government, Hu-Hoom. Wolvie got enough and left her brother for six years, she was a happy lumber jack with a loved one, who almost became a little helpless during Subrettoth, and was suddenly seen. "Yes ... but ... why?" - Shut up! And Wallie's evil A guinneapig decided for the bunch of scientist's bunny, who created him a meat-covered metal fighting creature. He went after all the bad guys and they came after him and after all the war he wiped out his memory, the first movie X X Men "<br /> <br /> there. That original You can find it behind the DVD cover. The real movie will not tell you anything else. There is no suitable view of action, no good hero, villain or ordinary character (line from my couch audience: Fat case! Token black guy! Oh, I give you cash if this girl lives in this film .., it is supposed to be gambit ... Mmmhum, yes, well ... oh-huh, right), a line of memorable dialogue and no t-shirt was added to zero lines, it can be added that the common stupid genes Saguli common that you usually can forgive ... well, that sounds mostly like a waste of time, right? Fans have to check this out, or have already. There are no obstacles. But if you do not like X-Men movies for other reasons, they are well-prepared and entertaining - look them up again and try not to do any harm to yourself by trying to find a source.
