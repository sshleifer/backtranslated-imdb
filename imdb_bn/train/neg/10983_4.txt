This game was first performed by the BBC 30 years ago, it was quite different for the time being. So some people find it scary, and can be affected by special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at play at this day and age, it does not seem that awful <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think so ...... But if so If you see this game again, you will notice that the first train will enter Suranga, push it with red light directly! (Maybe how was it during Dickens?) <br /> <br /> The pathway that you have headed towards that signal box is very steep and will be noticed in a poor country. Of course there was a series of correct steps with handrail for a singleman to climb up or down. (I can not help but see things like this) <br /> <br /> I will not take anything away from acting, both Danel Eliot (Signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (Passenger) have performed well. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on? ...... I mean ghost or brother, do you ??? Does anyone really understand this rather confusing story ??? (Well I'm not the only one) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is suffering from the horrific events happening in these days, and in some places it is not very confusing and there are some unusual signaling exercises. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
