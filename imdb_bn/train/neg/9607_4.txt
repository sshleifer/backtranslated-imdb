Do not listen to the confusing title "Wehrolf Umman" Europeans are well known for emphasizing their fears on sex and nudity on frightening movies, but here only a little more. "Weorolf Umman" seems to be the title of the title of the title and mercilessly killed his partner. Make fun of the first few times, but its one hundred minutes faster becomes very weak. Shes is not even a vairobol, but a skizo chick whose ancestors are leaked for lycanthropy. The film can not even define its voice with ten minutes (a flashback) legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was for the trash classic later), rather than torturing and torturing women in a worse way. A revenge thriller At the end, the director insists it is based on a true story. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> To be fair, production has some entertainment aspects. The title iswolf has a look on the woman and has some nice elegance effect and nude scenes. However, this rather rather becomes monotonous. Also, the Doubled Dialogue is quite delightful in Shibir fashion, especially the world's most swinging doctor (he drinks on work). Unfortunately, the film is getting quite excited. There really is no real plot or something else. It's a shame, because to read a story, I felt that this film has some real possibilities. "Weirolf Umma" is much more by the value of the exploitation style, running slowly, and somewhat vain. (4/10)
