Ah! This picture is my headache. And not well. Maybe it's a growing hatred for my action, but when I go for a sharp melting like the Navy I still dislike this picture. Now I utterly condemn. <br /> <br /> Get the best quick story Keep the title and throw away the rest. Instead use some semi-ass future Gladiators story so that the plot is full fill in the danger of collapsing the entire object (why hide in the middle of a rebellious base, why the cameras? Why is it clearly that the footage is clearly marked in an unguarded room at bakersfeild ?) <br /> <br /> Full movie triesley from terrible scores to the shadowy shining costume Thousands of screams Wig <br /> <br /> Do not look at this picture. I know some people like it, but some people are sitting silent and I do not even understand them.
