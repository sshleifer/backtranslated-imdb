"It seems that many critics have found the imagination of a Woody Allen play." And for good reason: they helplessly scam the Kathmandu and Bergman's scary imitation. And let's not broach myself: Allen Bergman's response was most supportive of Allen's intense accusations. What I found is: Why did Allen generally praise for his originality in the simulation of Bergman, but contemporary Brian Dippma was excited for "hijacking" Hitko on Hitcoo? In the view of Robin Wood, it is a strange form of cultural destruction. I have to agree with that.
