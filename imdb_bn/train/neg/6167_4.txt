Like most people, I was buying this movie because I was telling that Ying's pictures were on the box and the idea (from the previous picture and title of the film) that this film is about to ass for a 90 minutes of East Kikiin. However, for my frustration, say Chinese Hercules, there is no response to the Yeong Gene Cloud Van Dam and there was no surrender to the vain tiger ... erm, say yeung - maximum exposure in video box, minimum actual screen time ! Okay good <br /> <br /> The storyline is a very basic element, but it is well done - peaceful Kungfu fighters (played by Chen Hui Minar) accidentally kill a man and do not promise to fight again. Then he went away to work as a laborer on a crowd where he influenced his colleagues with the ability to lift his heavy goods, causing him to be an awesome fighter (suspecting how it works but does not seem to be) ). Meanwhile, Peir makes an agreement with corrupt boss gangsters, offering exclusive access to their peers. As a result, the workers were expelled from their ears and forced to live on the beach, where they gathered against their boss, gangster boss and his hanging Henman Boo Ying. <br /> <br /> quite observable (mainly waiting for the next glimpse of the ball), there were some problems with me - firstly, bad dubbing, but it is certainly a matter of the old Kung Fu film. However, the film continued to drag into various war scenes. And for the war scenes themselves, I found them too long, badly by the choreography (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Fired badly, and sometimes those who do not show any martial arts skills! In fact, most of the fights in this movie are not 'dead', but people are beaten without any resistance! Finally, the protagonist - written by Chen Hui Minar. I did not see any other movie with this guy, but at some point I did not do the routing for him. He not only saw the wonderful and tears of tears, but I did not fight against tyranny against him! I understood his reason, but if he did so long ago, he could have saved many people many pain, we all knew he would do the last and fight! There was a great mystery why the people of this whole community were pinning their hopes on a person that they never saw a war! <br /> <br /> Truly, this film had big savings in the presence of Yeng. He is never huge and brutal, he has some nice, funny lines, and how to master the rest of the Master's class to fight with the film. The person's screen presence is unknown and you can easily see how he became a star. The man fears life from me, but I'm sure this is the only person who did not see this movie, who transformed Bolo with the last war! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Yeung is great It was not that a person did not meet. People are a legend !!
