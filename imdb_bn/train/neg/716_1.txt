This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, gags are only for retrograde and absolutely nothing else that will make the film valuable. In the whole movie Freddy (oh my god is a funny name, hah) once did not ask himself how he came from a plane to the middle world. A lot of anonymous and completely strange characters whose name should be funny words. For example, Gandhafal is called Alamgandi, Sam is called popse ... and more. I do not even smile during the whole movie. GB seems to be made by those who are negative in their IQ. If someone is trapped in a quote, then it laughs (if it happens 5 times), then this film is probably for you. Another interesting scene: They try to guess the word for a closed door (why not ask - why not ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung. So if you laugh in this example, then you can choose this movie. For everyone else: Visit YouTube and see "Weed Lord": It's a lot, much more fun.
