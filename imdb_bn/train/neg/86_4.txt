As a Southern Baptist, it hurts me that I must give an average rating in a perfect Christian movie. Of course there is not much that I want to disappoint filmmakers from a series that is harmful exploited. Yet, I want to tell honestly that "the supremacy of love" is usually a low budget, less original, self-conscious Christian film. The plot is predictable, acting medieval (I'm kind of being), and performing brutal. As a TV movie it can probably be slightly above, but as a feature film it leaves a lot to be desired. Try guys. You've got to have a movie about real Christians somewhere inside of you. I think you are GK Chesterton or C. come. Change Luis for some inspiration?
