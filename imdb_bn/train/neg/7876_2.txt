After watching this film, I took part in the panel discussion, filmmakers said that one should look as a proponent of thought rather than a movie. Well, the only thing I was excited about was a waste of time watching the movie. Film jamics (documentary style, future setting) is thought to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. This movie illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very annoying film circulated in church.
