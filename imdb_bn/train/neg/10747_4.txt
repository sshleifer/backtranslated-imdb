Camp Blad III is a huge improvement over Camp Blade II because it is the most suitable place and a primary plot. This time they have moved away from the car park, the other two films have been filmed, which is a good step, since you can not hear the conferencing drive as a remote thigh. <br /> <br /> There is almost a reality TV show and a fake shoe to scare the competition It is rarely a new idea, I have seen at least three horror films where it has become a genuine killer, but at least this man is hijacked randomly instead of just this person. <Br /> <br /> It is a good less than a few good laughs for the second half of the series. If someone gets thieves for the first time and the bike is behind a microphone like a fan, I would love to see how gun words are affected. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone wants to make a third camp blood, I thought it was good to start with scratch but they tried at least with it. Half the nude deformed woman was a bit too much for me, it seems that they tried to hire some people to keep the continuation, who would clamp her clothes for $ 5, just as they did in the second movie. They are still used for a machete stabbing cut that does not work but oh well, what do you expect from a camp bleed movie? If you want shit films then you'll have some fun on this one.
