Those of you who have never heard of it (or watched it at the end), cracker is a brilliant British television show that is overweight, chain-smoking, and psychologist named Fitz, who helps the head of the Manchester Police to commit violence. Criminals It is considered one of the best artists out of England (and is saying something like this), and it was successfully successful in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the real stars are reunited to spend another hour or two with the original author. I liked this show since I saw it a decade ago. The DVD box set places a great honor in my collection, and I can actually quote a good deal of fiction interrogation scenes for the term. The concept of Robi Coletten fills me completely for another TV movie about fittings with Jimmy McGavner. <br /> <br /> I'll start well. There are a number of things that affect me about the main cracker series, how fast the format was defined as a character. Five minutes of the first episode ?? With his lecture (throwing a book in the air), his drink, and the casing of the man in the gambling machine row after him ?? And you knew, only knew who this character was. You can feel like "click" on your mind, a click that occurs only when a great actor wrote a big role by a great writer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, but I always felt that some of the next episode ?? Who did not write McGwen? <br /> <br /> The good news is: Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show ?? Make an incredibly inappropriate comment on her daughter's wedding ?? You'll feel like "click" again. It's him: Patulent is a moment and really next, always insensitive, sincerity with sincerity, but brilliantly in the process. If you love this character as much as you love, you will be happy about how you will be portrayed in the movie. And extending to Judith and Mark: Actually, what you have to do with the fits is fully managed. <br /> <br /> My problem with this movie is trying to solve the problem and try to solve it. In the standard cracker fashion, we know who criminals are right in the first five minutes ?? Mercy is false to see it portrayed Fitz. In this case, we are a serial killer who is out for American blood. And because of this, unfortunately, there is no credible trauma due to it ?? Rather, it seems that this killing could allow the author to display his personal political beliefs here. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write, because I truly believe that Jimmy McGavestone is the greatest writer in the world. I do not have any problems with the current films, or any film that takes a political stand. But in the cracker universe, we are not like characters, like behavior like human, like the characters. Instead, the Americans in this film are all fully pictured in stereootic fashion. Do they know nothing? Loudmouth who complains about everything, whips the locals and their wives? One of them manages all the above tasks in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I'd switch channels or something wrong. <br /> <br /> But it does not stop We have received constant reminder of how bad the war in Iraq is? Reminders which can not do anything with the story and do not appear virtually anywhere. The killer is so busy that what Bush was worse than Hitler was that he forgot almost immediately with murder; But much more, he is such a mouthpiece for the author's political opinion that he does not forget to act like a credible man, and thus we ?? As an audience ?? Do not buy a happy family from the people of his sudden transition to the souls of a tortured serial killer. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this event has destroyed me ?? It's still a good TV, which is consistently better than almost everything (mainly, once again, in Calcutta). But due to its constant politicalization it could be as good as real cracker like "be helpless" ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are two small things: the panhandle is not frustrating around, but is it rather bad? . Whole police department ?? With so many big characters, so long filled with vanity - now full of vanilla. A completely exchanging police who lacks any and all personality (how you can overcome me without excluding the personal coupling of Richard Koelle, but it is actually absent here). <br /> <br /> Also, in a few moments the show has lost its credibility for me. Based on the peak criteria of one million to one hundred and a half of the entire population of Manchester, this type of event is surrounded by feathers. (French windows? How to know the computer? How do I have my French window?) ?? He not only succeeded in this work, but he succeeded one hour less. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So all, I was a little disappointed. This is recommended, but at least remember to leave your expectations at the door. However, if the new series came after it was all good: I'm sure McGower could still write a great thing, and perhaps now his system came out of his politics, he could go back to writing about the people.
