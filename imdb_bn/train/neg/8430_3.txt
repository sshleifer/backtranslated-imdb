All right, I must admit again that I did not see any other merchant ivory (distributor) film. Or I have seen more famous works by the director, so before the discussion of my own discussion, the difference was reduced before the analysis of film. With that filling, start me. <br /> <br /> Rain is a different type of movie which does not know what it wants to be. First, it pretends to be a romance. In most romances, the drama falls in love with a supporting character, separated from the supporting character and sometimes associated with his partner. The protagonist of this movie has already won the heart of his boyfriend but could not stay with him. His name is Henry Mors and his name is Sajani, and they lived in southern India during the terrible day of the kingdom (British Empire rule). Henry has left London for a long time and has been in love with her married Indian maid, although despite her legal marriage and overseas children. What could have been better than that? Some children sneak away for frequently close to their target until they are targeted. The word spread to the husband's husband, who asked for his involvement with Morss. She denies any contact with her, but Morsch tells her to leave. Sajjani denied due to her respect and suicide. Please note that this event happened on the first day of first opening. The picture changes the sounds and becomes a crime-drama in its final parts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Murray's English-educated assistant TKK . T.K. His master knows the matter but his life is silent until it is threatened. Once he was declared innocent, he tried to get back his honor by killing Mors. T.K. Like a rainstorm, he threw him on the dirt road. <br /> <br /> I want to warn you that this is not a romance movie. DVD covers and theatrical posters show an Indian female and Caucasian people embracing a standard tropic setting. This picture is directly captured directly from the opening of the film, but quickly disappears. Then it's over. It seems like an effort to capitalize on Western fiction of forbidden love. This is not effective. The film is not only romance, but its characters have no personality. They are bundles walking clichés. Morsch is a proud white man who does not know the intelligence of his Indian friend, TK. T.K. Is broken into its own heritage and its educational background. Sajani is unable to choose a romantic career. Oh, and, of course, the Morsi family have learned about the death of Sajani, but still a little racist of Indians. If the voice is not so serious, I would be willing to ignore these problems, but not so. The film is presented with a discrete overton, which highlights the development of its poor character. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not terrible. The other than the ridiculous screenplay is not poor. All of the actors are experienced and perform well here. Nandita Das, who played Sajani, was part of the great Indian drama water. Even director Sivan has an impressive resume. He recently supervised The Terrorist, which is part of the Roger Ebert's "Great Film" collection. What happened there? Why is this movie so bad? Well, Sivan mentioned that he was inspired to handle this image because he took a brief look at the red roof in Israel. Apparently, the story was "timeless", and Sivan wanted to create a similar experience in the 1930s of India. I have no problem with this method, but I think Sivan has inspired this time very much. Actors, cinematography, and set designs are acceptable, but if you do not share the voice of Sivan, you probably will not enjoy it. My recommendation You assume that you are not with him and are looking at something else. Final negotiation: * and ½ out *****
