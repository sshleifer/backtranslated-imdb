This movie is not very good. It's boring, and not a lot of blood for a horror movie. Plot trods along just not happening And I think the female vampire was so stupid. It looks like being its reflection light because she had so many possibilities to kill vampire hunters. However, whenever one of them is pinned, it takes time and nothing happens, where he does not bite them. There is no doubt that it's just going to the wire. <br /> <br /> The last verdict: There is no closer to the first Vampire movie. If you waste your time at this time you're a SUCKER.
