In order to make a good movie you must be a nice actor or an excellent manager. You need at least two to one. There is no one in the eye of this sud. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the director too. He did not have to do a lot in his career. I love Donald Switterland, but he can not be the lead actor in the movie. He falls short When he was present for more than 15 minutes, Cetterland was fantastic in a movie. I would say for example that Switcherland was excellent in Oliver Stone's JFK when she did not talk to Kevin Costner for a 10-minute tear on a park bench without tears. Wonderful. But Sutarland is no better as the main actor in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reveal Kate? She is probably better off for the TV series. Dvd awful Terrible colors Terrible light <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
