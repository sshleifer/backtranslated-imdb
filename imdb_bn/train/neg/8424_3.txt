This film can be judged from three perspectives: As history, as Amin's profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It has failed as a history, it has said to overcome the overthrowing coup, the expulsion of the Asian, and the Entenbae High-Jack background, but not in a chronological compatibility time frame. <br /> <br /> It was interesting as Amin's profile, because Forest Whitaker was incredibly good, and if it was a good movie, then he would get an Oscar. (He found it - which the Oscars voters did not see in the pictures.) It ignores the historical historical episodes of the novel, which see the history of Amin and Ugandan from the doctor's perspective. Instead, from the point of view of Amin, Scott told uncle's doctor's story and impossible life of love. But the story is an incident that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy thriller, there is no plot to combine it. The film begins with a fresh - novel, but sets the story up. The doctor's character is defined specifically, but it is lost in the second half of the film, which results in suffocation. <br /> <br /> Why is the decision to stay in Kampala misunderstood by the doctor? Why is he curious someone is friends? The character of the novel's friend has been lost because Scottyman has a matter instead of a black doctor - a ridiculous disgrace that does not seem even vague, but shows Amin's hatred to the film's writers. . Finally the man called horse bits disappeared. Finally in 1971, Uganda moved to the left, not exactly, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where is the Equator Task? <br /> <br /> In short - if you have not heard of Amin, you can spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate the role of Forest Whitaker, but the last hour will confuse you. If you know Uganda or read the book - do not see the movie - it will only frustrate you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so stupid - he was not.
