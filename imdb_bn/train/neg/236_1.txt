I went very close, but I wanted to pay my money, and wanted to close my almost-as-nagged friend. After the thrill of "A New Hope", the silly characterless solitude and the thrilling sophistication of "The Empire Strike Back", I look forward to "coming back to my heart", with almost terrifying expectations. But from the opening scene of this offensive commercial sewer, I was very discouraged, and I was excited at Lucas. He should have felt ashamed of himself, but this hatred proves that his cold, greedy heart is not ashamed of shame. I will go ahead to strengthen this issue - your honor, I call on George Bink (but issue a bar bag to the first jury member). <br /> <br /> <br /> Layer, this "film" is a lot of licensing, except for two-plus-hours commercial karma for profit generation. It was not because Lucas could get into it - Dry guards, hockey meat-piglet flanky, the dirty jabber's muppet-pet, new and recycled cabinets, monsters, etc. Then there were the disgusting cute and marketable Ewoks. All the rebel alliance pillar above all of the alien. Each on-screen (or less) in fifteen seconds and Gidda only has a Kiddies for their collection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cheap feeling boatload. Slipping a humiliation in the face of her fans. I can not break the feeling that Lucas took a boring pleasure in spreading this stance to his fans: "These lambs are so bad that I can slice the pieces into pieces, and they wander around the theater, as well as all the quiddies their parents Whip whip me and do not torture them until they are allowed to wear every single formal wedding Unused, Cartoonish Character collects full statistics of the staff infections and I've stuffed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only this sassappula puts his nose on the surface, but Lukas are fairly profitable by selling it profitablely by the offending business which is a small number of flashes Ball stains can be removed extensively.
