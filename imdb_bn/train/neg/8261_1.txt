I was waiting to see this picture and then realized that any hope of a clear dialogue between actors was sank by unnecessary oath. Now I am not motivated in any way, but we do not make good films to shout out pornography to each other. Ian Brenner controversially is one of the worst actors in the world (witness to his testimony of the terrible lifestyle of witnesses) and his "coughing" is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. To avoid. The filmmakers understand that more than many movies have been realized that "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Animals", does not replace the proper dialogue with f-word, c-word etc.
