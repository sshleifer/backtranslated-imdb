This is a really strange movie ... First of all, we are trying to introduce a former American-American actor (or something), and it seems that this is the only role (which I know) - and for good reasons. Although he tends to play well enough to keep some interest, it is a rather flexible and flat performance. Secondly, we have always used sound effects in a movie !!! I'm not kidding This single movie is extremely ridiculous, but that annoying way. Hehe and third, we usually have a decent acting cast (including hot chick needs!), a really bad story, and some cool visual; Dialogue, gymnastics (sunshine!) Involves war, and the overall execution of the plot weakens. This movie was very good like a network TV movie (very bad Fox was not near 1985). It's a movie that's just bad, but you can not even use it to enjoy it and enjoy it, especially now it's finding a perfect home on late night TV and cable.
