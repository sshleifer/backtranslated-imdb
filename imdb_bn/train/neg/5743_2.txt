Yes, I know that I'm one of the few people to drag this movie into confusion dust. So tell me why I feel like this. Verily, it has been notified as a jabby film or similar, I could enjoy it. But now, I'm totally stupid. <br /> <br /> * Speaker ... While I'm sure what spoils * let's start with the first big mistake. If I did not know that this movie was called "Darkness - The VimPayer Edition" and I saw some sequences in which some people seem to have lost their blood, I did not see the connection with the vampires. I mean, crazy ???? Pause me !!! <br /> <br /> The second worst point is with Metal? It seems that all the young people, but mainly those so-called "vampires", judge different types of metals, mainly by their shirts! Do not make me wrong, I have been the ultimate lyrics for almost 15 years, but iron Maiden (all the band's !!!) is not going to scare me by showing me some laughable thirteen T-shirts running around, pretend to be a vampire! "Merciful" is the only word that I can use here. <br /> <br /> The third weakness: the actor Wait a minute. What actors?! You mean the director's wooden friend! The word here will be a waste. <br /> <br /> Yes, okay, the movie is very serious, but what makes that difference? This "fascinated" director was a powerful point and some if it was not selected to create an artificial vampire subject in this movie. I wanted to see the vampire, but my bulab bat was treated with some stupid looking children I liked to use. The filmmakers simply wanted to advertise the film that "cheap B-grade horror is dangerous without any plots" but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This book is about superstition against the whole idea of ​​vampireism. And it makes me sick.
