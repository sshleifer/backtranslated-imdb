I was delighted to see this movie very soon and I thought that it was becoming annoying and how they could improve the performance of Tom Hans in the 1984 edition, which I think was quite good ... I was right ... in all the truth I thought It could be good ... Certainly there were some funny moments but it does not appear to be marked with me ... acting was fine and the story is quite good Following the original, but I think it could be much better ... In this film, I would say, thirteen and heart for young people; The female agency, alcohol and sex are full ... This is another common run of the Mell Party film, which has been repeatedly done. 4/10 My vote for this.
