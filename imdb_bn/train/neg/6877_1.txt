I was sitting to see a documentary about Puerto Rico, and in the end I was watching one about New York. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to live in poverty 50%. When I see the struggling people, they usually reach the island of Haitian, Dominican, or Cubans. There is no such thing as spanglish ... either you can speak Spanish, nor you ... and from what you have heard ... you do not. Pedro Albizio Campos did not come to me. MLK was a great man. Campos are a great people who want freedom, 1%. The rest are also people like Osama bin Laden. A bunch of perterticicans fool that want freedom If you want any proof from the dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, South and Central America and Mexico. This is a wonderful work for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nouricans and their struggle. <br /> <br /> The person who did not hear enough African complaints was shocked ... It's Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will be created soon for you just one. <br /> <br /> Want to learn all these unconscious white people who want green cards to come to America, and how to run the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's work. This is not a good documentary about Puerto Rican culture. Ask your kids to pay attention to the geography and history category. <br /> <br /> *** *** Update. <br /> <br /> Booby ... ... "Doc." Nuyoricans were about. How we all feel as he preached. The title should have been ... "Yo Saua Nuiarikan ... Luch ... Spanish can not say." Please stop using PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, or any other affiliated with PR with this New York religious text. God forbids this game on the island they are.
