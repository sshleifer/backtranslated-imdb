Last night I saw this movie and hoped for the best after watching all the coolest trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. When I started seeing it, I was thinking like others, "Oh my God, what is this?" The moments were a bit annoying but then they were lost by stupid stupid music. There were rock and operas, which were considered visible scenery. There it was destroyed for me and I grabbed my head. A rental and cover is deceived by the art. There was nothing against music, it was only in the wrong parts of the movie. Anyone who did the film did not have any form of what they are doing. The cover shows electricity, which means they are caught by sea storms. It was more interesting but it did not happen. I never saw this act as the most unknown of all, and this is their first film. For the other reason I was frustrated, this plot was not sensible. Initially, 2 men saw that all older children were boat, then finally there were only 1 girl, and others were her legendary friend or ghost, I'm not sure because it was very poorly portrayed. Heitfax wrote a comment here that it is a true fact. He believes in ghosts and spirits and says that the film has a ghostly boat. This movie does not mention it about the real story. I personally did not enjoy something like this, but it does not seem impossible. I think if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur students, you may like it.
