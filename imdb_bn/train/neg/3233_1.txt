People, you can not be serious, advertising snuff is not entirely another case! It's not even terribly awesome and it's not terrible or unexpected - it's just the job of a terrible amateur artist, which is made for laying next-girl girls. <br /> <br /> The grave is incredibly bad, even the eyes-Sessin are far away from annoying me, but only I want to take a camera and kill those boys on the head. The girl is just confronted with rubber, not all moving. It was funnier to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season "I'm a celebrity, get me here!" This is more horrible than one. Do not waste your time or your money.
