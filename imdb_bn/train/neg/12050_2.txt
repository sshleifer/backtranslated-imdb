I read some positive reviews of this movie, and was wondering about how terrible the whole thing was. Some of the stories related to AIDS-related stories and "Ghost" / "Blyth Spirit" have been staged, this movie can not always remember what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Salmon and Mark are a gay couple who have "open" relationships - Simon may have an anonymous (though safe) sex on his behalf. Mark does not seem to be HIV + and he and Simon are no longer sex life. When Mark dies, Simon - who has made a habit of closing his emotions after being rejected by his father years ago - tries to remove his memories and only after graduation. Before Mark's death, his behavior was not very different. But while Satan is open and accepting his true feelings, Mark returns inside and inside of him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any sympathy for him. Most of the film. As long as it is considered sympathetic, caregiving is too late. On the other hand, Mark followed the footprints of Demi Moore from "Ghost" and screamed throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a great switch in the voice after the Mark Return. Suddenly we attempted some sunny hair, "Bewitched" a la TV show. But that's not long long. Once Simon's mental health becomes risky, the whole thing is growing up, along with amateur efforts to flick your heartbrokes. A disciplined, worried Simon Wave farewell is simply stupid when marking a tear mark in heaven at the end with a chained muscle-boy angel, mainly because it is not deliberately funny.
