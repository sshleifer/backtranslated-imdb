I can not really say what I say about this film, against those guidelines, I have seen many movies and it should still be the worst, very low budget, I spent a fair amount of money. Butcher house scene, because I could do a good job with a crew of a B & D 8mm camera and monkey. It was so bad that I just registered for a comment, because I had to tell someone, the movie rental place was not enough. But this is my 2 cents worth, I borrow it from some poor sap who rented it and see myself. Because I'll definitely not waste money again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you make your rental rented place when you do not refund your money .. =)
