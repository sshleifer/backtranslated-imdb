I saw this movie a couple of days ago and jumped across a pretty scary part. I must admit, I am quite decent ... until I start to think what the characters are saying. Logical problem: <br /> 1. His boyfriend, who seems to be a beautiful fit child, makes no sound when he is being killed. Do you think he tried to kill at least the killer? <br /> <br /> While commenting that the teacher in the gym "Love Sue with Lewis", I almost screamed in the screen. When your best friend's family was killed by a teacher with whom he had a love, if you have half the heart, then you will not make such comments. <br /> <br /> 3 As soon as Nash's maternal uncle asks, how many exits are there in the house, and mummies that danger can come forward, it's not a smart thing to take Donna, Boyfriend, aunt and uncle to the car? There is no way to find out the killer so far away, then away with the HRT and the police forces are impressive, <br /> <br /> I could go. And then. And then. Basically, the plot was appropriate, the letters were not proficient enough for you when in fact they felt any sympathy at the time of the murder and there were many errors. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples looking for a fun night only. If you do not consider all rumors, it's a middle film.
