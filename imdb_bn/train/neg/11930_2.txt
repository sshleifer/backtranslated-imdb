Times are difficult for Angel Town, gangs govern with iron fists, and for most of the time unknown (mainly due to embarrassing writing) gangs, street children, Martin wants to join the gang, so they beat him every day. But due to the presence of the kickboxer of the Olympics (Olivia "The World's Worst Actor" Grunner), known as Jacks, is on the way to the hope. Angel Town is one of the most inactive message movies created seriously. (And I saw my fate) It seems that the needs of all the gang shortened areas, French Kickboxer can not work. It's all really painful moments it's really really fun. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gurner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous these things are. Wit: "Do you like fighting? (Olivier grabs in a title of her Asian best friend) Can I kill him? I died when I want him dead! Because I do not want him dead because I'm afraid about him, and I know If I kill him, then his son and wife will kill me, so he will not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, killing someone is wrong, let alone your best friends from the equation. Strange <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not let this word hate me because I hate this movie, far from here, it's awesome. The biggest smile comes to the end of the catastrophe that Gurner sees with gang members one after the other (who denies the use of the pistol in the film's biggest rationale). Also, guns shot guns in a restricted Viet Gang machine, grunar kick-box rest. These are all terrible "Mexican" accents and excessive power words that make it a memorable one for fans of the movie trash. <br /> <br /> Another aspect of this movie, Olivier Gurner, never came to the state for any reason, and in France, it did not appear in college for any reason that its girlfriend (with a grave at the beginning of the film's painful). Angel Town is the failure of all imaginable levels without any doubt, but if you do not know anything at any level, ridicule Moroccan martial arts with the crazy level of action, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, do not forget to tacilah down, like the lyrics of the ridiculous opening song "There is no mercy in Angel Taoy" <br /> <br /> * Among 4 (bad)
