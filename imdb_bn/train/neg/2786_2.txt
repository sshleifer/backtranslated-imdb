All right, I'm not going to critically criticize this film. I have seen many interesting reviews before me, and I usually like Maria de Mediros, I was quite hesitant to make disrespectful comments - and this fashion has been almost a year passed. But every time I see my default DVD, I understand an internal tiredness. However, the impressive voice let me override! But beware of other sinefil like me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> A backdrop for a period of my life - Through the newspaper I read my local Central European Pub every day. At that time, I followed the Newsportport, but did not fully understand how the hack was sent. Reporters report report with non-prejudiced posts, or a defendant frowned upon establishing peace on any party or disturbing the insurgency fomenting against establishment. These were the times when I explored all the things in Paris, Berlin, Prague and other places of unrest in the United States, I have clearly understood all the things - but the dictatorship or not, my papers were just for the sake of dealing with Portugal's pregnancy - not as a soft empire, Not to use Flippeut Star Wars terms. So, week after week I got annoyed, but did not find an intelligent editorial that might provide history, or evaluate the social and economic effects of the dictatorship behind them. <br /> <br /> So, I had at least two hopes for the purchase of this film: Finally the details can be understood as social unrest, and enjoy a well-concept drama. This picture did not give me <br /> <br /> This image already has enough knowledge and deep emotions about historical events. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Mediros and Português Film Industry, but - it was quarterly and shallow. <br /> <br /> I received my copy of DVD from France - "Selection Official ear 2000 - indefinite award". The box shows a smiling smile, which gives victory sign to a fashion that reminds me more of Playboy Bonny. After seeing this work, I wonder what the French might think - though, as a shallow part of "film verification" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their normal tendency to appreciate for its "normalcy" but ... <br /> <br /> Look back at the box: "About Chelurooce Sir La Revolution" - Warm Respect? Try to describe the overthrow and murder of Alander with a "warm tribute"! Try Czechoslovakia in 1968! <br /> <br /> Another review: María de Mediros is a bride, with Achieve son Cheyce, son Enfense and son historia! <br /> <br /> I love Portugal, Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and country gives meat to a dry film. No. I will be in my old VHS tape in Capac Negraz and in Cancú de Lisboa - I'm stuck in two of the above titles which can be trashed.
