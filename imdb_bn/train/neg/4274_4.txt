We do not have the fairy tale of the Naked Emperor. I can honestly recognize what we see, foolish, not accepting that this program is just some aspect unavailable and it is clear that it was made from pure insight without the real idea. <br /> <br /> Well, probably many people like stuff like this. I do not I liked the well thought out and designed shows. And I admit that the show is serious for my taste and frustration ... It's a love and narcotic story ... There are many exciting soaps in which there are many mysteries (for example Dallas), but twin scores can not catch my attention. I do not think of them except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
