Even when I saw this movie at the age of teenage, I was still thinking that Piya Jadora acted in a movie about which artist, who has gone the top way. As beautiful and sexy as Miss Zadora, she could not plead this sorry-ass in a movie from the tanks. There was also no photo shoot for Panhaus, in which "The Lonely Lady" was broadcast, "Day Return", the film could keep it from tanking. The only thing that could save this movie? A completely different script. Miss this one
