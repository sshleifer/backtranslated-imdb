Well, writing was too drunk, the direction was sloppier, and editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editable). The acting was not bad, but it was not good. Most of the letters were very much liked. The movie was lost at least 45 minutes and was not used anywhere near the full hour of its full potential. It was a great idea, but the other one goes well by a good idea. It may end up in 3 different places, but it's mostly going to the end of Hollywood. And the forecasts are so bad that it does not matter. The last all observers were not worth the price. Sandra Calf was away from his material and should stay away from such movies. The film also ran out. The film was not really worth watching and I used to pay for it, I was so crazy. Maybe I was more disappointed because I really expect a good movie and got a bad one. Not all movies were horribly bad, but I would not reccomend it. So I gave it 2 out of 10 B / C so I loved a lot of ideas and I liked a character (Justin I believe, super smart one). And it was some very cheap way to cover the plot hole. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not nice. However, if you see it, wait for the $ 1.50 theater or video, unless you like the movie you see, but guess that you like it.
