Its original book was set in the 1950s but it will not be for the TV series because most people keep an eye on the style of the 1930s. Surprisingly the last accessibility train was a train of 1930s like a train, so that the underground could also play in that game. It was weak to hang a plot story about Zero March, but in the 50th edition there were students who started thinking about the world around them, so I think the people of the middle of the march thought about their poverty is the same. All the components were weak for the jap to serve himself, but he had to give something to fill the time. It could create a decent half-hour show or they could draw the book and it could be a good long show. It is obvious that this episode is the victim of style on content.
