*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** All the teen slasher flicks are suffering from a dread of originality? It seems so terrible. Above all, it is a great proof that can be used well. A young man who stabbed old, stains and murdered all the girls from prison when he was young? You can say you did not have anything to do. But this film goes through the same speed as the other recent slashers. We get false warnings from scores to camera corners, and predict exactly when the killer will strike. We know the pattern by now. This stupid slashher movie pushes more and more credibility by minute minutes. I ask you something: Who, in their right mind, will darken their friend in the dark, drunken morgue and only surprise him from the blue when he is alone and surrounded by the body? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A good shot involved Dennis Richards character slaughterhouse. She stuck inside a pool and the poker pokes her with a chainsaw. Soundtracks have some good songs, among which there is a great track by the Bellela. The music video is in the special feature section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the actress is medium. All of the actors sleep through their role. Of course, David Barijans are often stoic in his screenplay as the title of "Angels" title. Dennis Richards is a fine actress, though, and he keeps a stone across the movie. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" just like you want to expect: spectral, incredible, forgotten, Chess and sight without a good fear. Do not bother even <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
