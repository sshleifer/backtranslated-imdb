This movie is a waste of movie stock. Do you think that the map of any military mission plan will be placed in a patio on daylight with a camera with telescope or a zoom lens? It happened in this picture. Do you believe that a DEAF person will actually be listed in the Active Duty Army for the Worldwide WWII to serve in a "Negro" unit ... cooking, supply service, graveyard details etc? It happened in this picture. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer has the same DEAF KP? Will choose. Be a part of an active war mission to protect the Germans from the destruction of friends before the arrival of friends? It happened in this picture. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not understand that a German plane coming from behind and stole it and killed it? It happened in this picture. Would you be surprised that a group of German soldiers stood in a jam on a farmhouse in Germany, that the German soldiers saw their feelings only in the eyes of 50 'far-away soldiers? They did it in this movie and abandoned any entrance door for potential entry in Germany to test complete insecurity. Would you believe that, in the ventilation and clear English, the position of Captain General was mentioned, if he did not have a name, he was speaking to the person he was speaking to in an open, plain English English plain, the dam would be protected the next day? Maybe they just wanted to send an elite that America's attack would come from America's attack just to make it easier for the Germans? This so-called movie should be placed on the list of the Top 50 Bad Movies. If it was, I'm sure it would be good. See it at your own risk.
