True, many movies are very bad after this movie. This movie is a mood: The Hands of Fat, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them twice), but at the same time, this movie is an alien, predator or alien vista. Predator (yes, even that crosses the movie). Movies like this are so bad that the battleground earth looks like a star fight. Look at the Razzie rewards, your biggest contest has just reached the theater. I'm talking about this picture in the dark. This is why this image was so fast, step by step step by step step by step step by step. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater has to be proud of his last achievement, acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to do more evil than antifreeze after doing good work in the film. Although he was speaking to all his horror dialogues, it surprised me why he did not shut down the set half way. Perhaps Steven Dorf is in the film (someone can voluntarily wish to do it, but fails in it). Actresses feel good and they are really important in movies like these. It is not that the act was perfect, it was not good, it was not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film was not good. <br /> <br /> Besides soundtrack- 'Wish you wing an angel', the soundtrack is being pumped into the audience's voice and the poor heavy medal is pumped into the ears, perhaps di terrible stories (some I will soon get confused). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now ready for sale for those musical competitions. <br /> <br /> - Directed by Hollywood's favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the Classic House of the Dead. "Yes, movies can be completely bad and it's just the beginning of my deadly shag on horror movies." At least it is managed by the Uwe Ball. Saying that I would assume a monkey to be kidnapped from the Congo, bring here and thus will be forced to make opinions on how to make the movie shocked. The director of the photography was perhaps a camcaper tapped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hit a wall. It's continuing in the cameras that are still in place, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when the camera continues, the camera will be closed for some reason. <br /> <br /> - Who in the world is so stupid to pay the bombs? I'm stupid ... sometimes Sometimes I am happy that he has been taught that sometimes a bag of dogs will be tied in a bag if there is no money in the garbage. <br /> <br /> The story of the writing / story story is more painful then jumping a snow-picking junk under a big toe and kicking a football ball as hard as I could possibly with but I still try it. <br /> <br /> Where Edward Karna escapes as a child from an orphan to 20 children where science goes under examination. He escapes from the electric power station and hides where he runs the electricity (at this point where it becomes so bad that I started to laugh loudly). Then he discovered the speedy detective after many years. He is attacked by some zombie that can not be shot at death, killing it and moving with life. After that he was attacked by some insane looking monster and he discovered that anyone else knows the secret. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really bad. People of the film expected us to read about 10 minutes, which was felt like 100, that the random text of untrue civilization is an abstraction. The film does not have a twist after another, then the audience can manage, the audience wants to handle more, then the audience can ever take care. This storyline is bad at the bottom of the rock even double dragon works well. <br /> <br /> Overall, do not miss this movie. I gave it 1 in 10 but there is no reason for 0.
