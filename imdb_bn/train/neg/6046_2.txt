This film mainly drinks itself within two hours of Duffer's character - almost literally - in death, in death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough good news or character to be surprised. It was just a deadly, bitter waste of time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Stormer is an excellent actor. But this picture just sucked. Slowly does not make the movie worse, it was just bad. The sketch plots mixed with artistic ramblings of anaopharyphic wonders are not to be combined together meaningfully for a plot, some point of view, which ultimately ultimately ends up in some knots. I really appreciate the artist's perspective, but as entertainment, it keeps me asleep. (Seriously, I had fallen asleep and had to see the film again - which was more frustrating.) <br /> <br /> I usually do not like negative comments or reviews on the work of others, even when they suck, but this film is a warranted . It is very bad that these great actors are ashamed of this end result.
