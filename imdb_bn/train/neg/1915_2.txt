It's a pretty good cast, but the film is nowhere near the mystery of the original Italian comedy "Big Friday" on Madonna Street. Anyone looking for any recreational copper images should actually see it. William Messi could be our greatest living actor, but here he used a little bit. And the main role played by Marcelo Maastrianini, her role, so I'm sorry to fill her shoes. As well as Bogart or a young De Niro could try to imitate. The industry is rich and transformed, but nothing comes in the story, extra bits added to the story feel completely unnecessary and miss the things they take away. Even the way they start, they are strange and surprisingly real. Sam Rockwell is his weird and genial charm and Luiz Guzman's strange charisma, but the love story of the movie seems to be an incognito and flat. It is very bad anyone has understood that this movie was created first, but it is also very bad that we live in a culture where we think we only need to rebuild amazing things instead of listening to the real things.
