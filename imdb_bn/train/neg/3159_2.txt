Sorry friends, I have already written my opinion about this movie, but today I saw some other reviews. There are many people who agree with me, but there are some scary guys who really like this movie. I do not like to write ugly reviews or criticize other people's opinions, but I think it's just fair to warn someone who can debate or not see the film. This is not a good movie. I really like the movie and I'll only watch something but the movie I saw was incredibly short list and I was happy to leave half the way. If you are really unbelievably tempted to see the trailer ... the mistake I made because the whole film is in the trailer ... there is no surprise then, just a few frustrating dialogues to waste time. I love Michael Vertan in Alliance and hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to prevent others from living in such a movie!
