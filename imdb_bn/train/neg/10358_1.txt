I have read the whole time 'a burning time book' and then saw the movie. This book contains all the elements of the book, but the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours. It really shook with many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> Around meg of a fork in time, a woman named Charles Wallace and Calvin must be able to find Meg's father and close the Camjotage Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really a tragedy. The acting is horrific, the direction is ridiculous, and situation is not needed so far. I really saw the same person Madeleine Angle, who wrote the book and made the film, created a great book and a terrible movie. Acting is worse than acting on a direct video. Yes, I had to accept the effect was cool. But seriously they are not all possible horribly and serial. If you read the book, the film will crush you. I could give it 0 but sadly I can only give it 1. A half can be useful.
