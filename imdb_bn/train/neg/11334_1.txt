Here is another condemned European story that they explode the religion of their country. (This atheist filmmaker is relentless.) Here we see a cruel explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I'm not Catholic). <br /> <br /> It actually won the Academy Award for Foreign Film. This is probably because the story is very weak in the Catholic and religious beliefs. One of the main characters is a pastor and he is more careful about food than anything else. She is portrayed as nothing without a donkey. There is no doubt that secular-dominated academy likes this movie. <br /> <br /> There is also something to say that gives an intelligent man his religion, so that he can marry four daughters in the story. The girls "seminary" students (who say they are studying for six years but he is studying to say a fireplace!) Activates Seducing. I mean, how damn this picture is ?? !!! <br /> <br /> This is another excellent example of secular-progressive rebellion in a dismal and global (not just Hollywood) film business.
