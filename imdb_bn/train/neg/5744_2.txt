This movie was terrible, kept simply. I was so dangerous that I was registered with IMDB to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I'm a campie horror film expert, every second. I have seen "Redneck Lomis", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumpy Party Genocide II" and more. I know my schllock. And I know this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three quarters of a screen is made up of scared people from one side of the screen. When they are not running, they are spouting non-rising lines, without emotion or motivation. The actors started to be acceptable, fall into pieces. There were very few short shots; I was a 3-feet-long tripartite of Lex Zoncor. He has used me several times a year called "Leaf Manuver": It's zoomed out of an amateur-like interest. Apparently, the movie crew could not get enough to sunrise, so they painted a sunset ... and played it on the opposite. With this lazy in the direction, you are actually impressed with the ultimate poor scene. The only thing that you can guess is that the last five minutes were pictured before the first eight fifth minute. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (poor) poor movie then rent "Ricky-Oh" or the basics "Dead living." If you are a schlok buff, and looking for a challenge, "dark" let's go one. <br /> <br /> quotes and pictures <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
