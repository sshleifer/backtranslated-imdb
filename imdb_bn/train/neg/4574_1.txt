I went into this film similar to this matrix or pie. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, bad acting plot in the film (with CGA animated cells and with peptides for booting). However, the actual focus of the film is coming out in the new age when talking about "experts" - good hogwash between the plot segments <br /> <br /> Sure, it's fairly close enough. At the beginning there is a little bit of quantum physics. It is, for example, that the electron exists as particle and wave both, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the film takes a giant (and unscientific), saying that sub-atomic quantum effects are also large. Talking heads take even more. According to them, the following is true: <br /> - When Columbus came to the Caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ship because their mind was unable to feel that different. Meditation can reduce the rate of murder. With positive thoughts, you can walk water. - Your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in the water bottle. <br /> <br /> And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> The film was tortured. This movie felt like a movie that they would show you to join you at a meeting. After doing my homework, I realized that it was basically correct. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be seen as a campie comedy (although it is not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not see this movie.
