I was really frustrated after watching this movie - not because of the actor, the story or the management - I was frustrated by this film advertisement. <br /> <br /> Trailers say that the battalion "chose the third path" in addition to surrender or death (Polish infos also were misguided that their own artillery or German guns were chosen to be killed, they were even "wrongly transferred battalions" As well as the title of the title was translated). It ticked the right spot and I bought this movie. <br /> <br /> The frustration started when I realized that sitting in the third step is counting the dead body and the corpse is followed by counting ... Then I started thinking, "Hey, this story can not be easy ... I can find some wonderful way for this cute officer to save anything of his soldiers ". Well, he does not, they are just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And so I was. <br /> <br /> This story was based on the real events of the First World War, so the author could not use their imagination much more, even thought that the film was really vague and even a little annoying. And I wrote it in the first place - there is no blame on the actor, the writer or the director - their expectations over the level of this movie that people can market with their marketing.
