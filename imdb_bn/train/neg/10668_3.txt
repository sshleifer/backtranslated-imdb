There were some great actors in this movie! Unfortunately they forgot how to work. I was optimistic that the movie would be better but it would continue but the act was so robotic that it had been destroyed since the very beginning. It is actually seen that the actor is studying full time from the whole script. Perhaps it was a musical score or director, but one thing is certain that make-up artist will get another job! The face powder was so thick that the actor was facing face to face! Nobody will recommend this movie, it's no surprise to hit the theater. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods is telling you not to give up all the shame. Plot great was just a whole lot needed.
