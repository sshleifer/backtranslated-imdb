A frustrating movie to watch the Wayward Cloud. Terribly bizarre, it treats each shot as an artwork. The feeling that you get impression that each shot has been drawn with a fine degree of design design and drawn; In the nineteenth century, the very first movies were cranked, and the imitation of their creation revealed how far the movie has progressed, the camera never goes here? Except camps and colorful musical numbers. Environmental words are kept at a minimum and are rarely called a word. This curiosity, but the effective device forces the audience to focus on the revival of the view so that the story progresses at sloppy speeds and we feel submerged ourselves. Unfortunately, at least for me, this immersion hour mark starts to uncover almost anywhere. I started to think that challenging to watch the movie was challenging for me, when it took a minute to make it more difficult to see that I just wanted to see the war in the will. <br /> <br /> The content of this film was not as it was sex as it is no doubt the Western audience is even more vague. Since there is an abundance of sexual abuse on woman nudity and an unconscious (or possibly deceased) woman, it is so insulting that when it can talk about the reduction of the amount of pornography that both men and women (users and used) it is so zealous as it effectively Prefer to create its point of execution. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in pornographic content will find this mistake for all the wrong reasons and see it with their sticky finger on the remote's fast-forward button. <br /> <br /> For all its problems, the film is definitely a stabilizer, and you think it's more about it, it seems to be certain aspects of it. Ironically, for a film that is very rare, the audience will probably be rewarded as the second or even third time seen ratio. For me, however, once was enough ??
