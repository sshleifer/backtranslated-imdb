This is not the word of bees, it is also affected by this very long, very annoying, poorly performed movie. I did not know how I created it all after 3 a half hour after falling asleep. The plot is simple ... 3 perfectly unlikely morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Roma was deadly. If it is possible, it's even worse. > If I could see this film without closing ... or kill someone, then I must be a micropist.
