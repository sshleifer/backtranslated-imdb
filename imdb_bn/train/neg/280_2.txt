God, I was bored of my head as I saw this pilot. I was expecting a lot from this because I am a great fan of James Cameron (and I can not even add to "Titanic"), and I would guarantee his name as a money in credit. He wrote Leiden Strange Dais.). But the matter failed miserably by grabbing my attention at any time of almost two hours. At this time, it had left its two lines summary, and I had a lot of pressure on finding any coherent plot from the strands I went anywhere. On top of that, I do not think Acrobatics have gone beyond the regular "A-Team" episode. For Alba, yes, he certainly is superb, but the fact that he only showed the facial expression of the entire film (the rug and surly), I also bored him "an attitude of gull wit" You can count me this, Mr. Cameron!
