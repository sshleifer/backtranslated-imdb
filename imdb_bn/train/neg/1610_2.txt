I found so much enthusiastic about this movie - I saw the entire 4-hour roadshow version, how diverse it is isolated. Castro and Che, for a film about almost a philosophical man, involved in a fierce political struggle, it is almost entirely lacking in mental fire. Bensio del Toro and Damien Bichir (who is the second-highest level actor, best actor with a little high sound) has no play or depth and basically says to Castro Che: Go to there and do it, to use any effect or to use this action There is no effect on this. Oder is still Castro an actor who got the necessary power to play Castro-Joachim de Almeida, but he is apart in a small part. Second half The film is hairy, bearded men walking through various jungle, and the film is not going on for any particular purpose or ending up in the hope that you expect that man and his followers to burn in the fire without the tension or passion. Much of the reviews I've read praising the work of director director Steven Sönderberg almost ignores the actor. (Actually more than Plot or Actors in Süderberg's new digital film cameras or spent more time with English subtitles than Spanish speaking conversations). This is an odd, extraordinary thing) Soderberg was the only tenant gun in movies and B) It is not much more than the work skill, while going to New York, black and white Ada cut camera-work indefinitely to Oliver Stone's JFK, without sign. If you can imagine Andrew McLaughlin managed red instead of warren, you get the idea of ​​the outstanding skill of the film.
