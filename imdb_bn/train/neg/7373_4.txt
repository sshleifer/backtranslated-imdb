I do not know how you are watching for the rest of Steven Sighal films, but I see them because they are as silly as they are always good to laugh. Why do you rate 1 movie out of 10 based on dubbing this movie, when that thing creates a movie that is a favorite favorite choice that you can laugh at the ciline? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is not a great movie, but I think it was suitable as one of the other Steven Sigal cars; Actually I do not think it's her worst by a long shot. It was mostly semiconductor coherent plot lines, and most of it was fundamentally exciting. The end really sucked, but even that was some enjoyable trashy material. Eventually, the story did not provide the promise, but I really thought that acting, characterization (if I could use such a big word), and the rest of the production values ​​would be truly delivered in the true sense of the Steven Sigal fan. Especially Segal is a stone-facing face, a dirty man, which we have come to expect, and the rest of the cast supported him very well without upgrading him. This, man, what is a Steven Seagal movie Deal with it. Or better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
