Warning: It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it is a bad movie. (See example 300). This one ensures lemma above. The second scene constitutes the tender center of all tasks. We finally know that the movie makes annoying. Even more, the story goes many times behind as other plots are revealed. And this becomes more frustrating. To compensate for the lack of suspicion, we learn more about how insignificant letters are. And oh yeah, there's plenty to show them. Andy (P. Hoffman) For example, an addict, more? Is he deceiving his wife? Plus, he plans to rob his father more, his wife is cheating with his brother? His sympathy towards the death of his mother, more ?, he is a serial killer, more? Etc. There is not enough room to write here ... I'm wondering how he could do a top job. And why not leave him before his wife. On the other hand, I enjoyed many performances by actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Here even PSH saves the remaining $ 7 for this meaninglessness. Why stupidity? Because it does not mean, why should I take care of hateful characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic (least blessed) character. It is also very sensitivity, for example, we want to take care of the widow's father's hardship without getting to know the parents before the criminal.
