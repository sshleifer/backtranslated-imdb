I got this film from a personal collector and it was very weird about it. It was 7,8 (only 9 votes) in IMDB and some external comments were nice. But I would say that it is very normal and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well managed, but it never made me wrong. It starts well, but it does not bother me, I do not like the story so simple and which becomes normal. <br /> <br /> You can laugh at something And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giellas you want (malicious, miracles, fools, poor, atmospheric, cruel killings ...) you will not appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> I can give it 4 for good instructions and editing, and final twists, that make the film entertaining. But it can be a lot better.
