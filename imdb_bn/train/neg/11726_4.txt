Wesley Snipes is James Dyal, a tenant assassin, CIA agent and a pure bad ass special operator. The horse breed with the name of macho as a cowboy hat dons and beauty in its free time period. <br /> <br /> Enter its supervisory officer, Agent Collins. Write a new assignment - a terrorist assassination in UK custody. Of course, a United Kingdom state is a great place for secret offs and head-shots outside of the capital. <br /> <br /> The killings are a great success, apart from eliminating this killing plan. So the dial partner and the local contact die in the steps to avoid the police, when the dial london tries to reach the Coppers and the CIA tries to settle it and get a hot property. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the safe-house is regularly visited by the teenager Emily Day (Elijah Bennett), who loves hanging with the arrest warrants and hanging with cold blooded killers and helping them escape from the UK law enforcement agency. <br /> <br /> Need a script that I say? Plus Wesley Snipes Wesley Snipes (this is a pro or a con) plus the film is quite compelling. On subtraction editing is very unusual and there is a storm effect on the stomach.
