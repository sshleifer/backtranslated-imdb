A professional executive is very successful in his professional life, but he is very incompetent, living a child with Down syndrome, escapes from the habitat. Both characters feel very lonely, and apparently the less intelligent one will show the executives the beauty of life's small things ... By this argument, I did not expect Amelie-like environment and sensitive music, but morality is a scary movie. However, there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite fierce), and both of the actors, Daniel Attil and Pascal Dwacken were very good, I decided to watch the film. In general, the French film has the power to show something that feels much more about life, which is more resistant to the stereoated American film. But, because of that, it is very frustrating to see after the strange completion, the boy's impossible death, ruthless tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap moral, the helpless smile of the girls, waving from heaven as a man Michael London ... really my gentle opinions, nasty.
