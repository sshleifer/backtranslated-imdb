Could not sleep at the other night. So I got up, broke in the tube and this movie was there. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are far more than the chin. As the "Forrest Gump" level was aspiring. But Gump falls like a fairy tale where an extraordinary lucky man manages us through the ages. TGMB just depends on the tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a broadway musical where the actors have ham it up. Each character's purpose was to fill a stupid 60's archive. <br /> <br /> How we got acquainted with Phoenin: embraced his black maid and made a picture of ML. Criminey, talking about heavy elephants. <br /> <br /> "Free heart is not love, man? No, I did not have time." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCL." Oh, excuse me? In the 60's, there was no square around L. Instead of taking time to make Berkeley unique, we can not hear this brat, not going there <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She just falls in love with someone who is racist to show tolerance to other kids a prop. <br /> <br /> Things are, pieces of time do not have to be this sugar. "Dazed and confused." Take a look at how we presented Randall Floyd, the protagonist of football. We do not see him at the football field first. Actually, we did not see him play football. We were presented with him in the class, on behalf of him, invite a group of insect friends. <br /> <br /> "Dezed" Feminism Some chick is not getting duplicate. It is much more organic, more serious than that. Refurbished in the women's home with flip talk about the island of Giligan. Severe thoughts can increase the most basic settings. But true life is like this. <br /> <br /> Here are some warm comments that the themes of this movie are still relevant. I agree! Baby-Boomer Porostaljia I feel so frustrated by this piece.
