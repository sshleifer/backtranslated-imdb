This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams will fit into a tutu to fit into a knit-like part, even her performance was still unfortunate. Kurt Russell was more credible but still was awful. There was a lot left to spend the plot and the rest were terrible. What was going on for this movie was the only trailer, which forced me to lose 90 minutes of my life, which tried to get my head back. <br /> <br /> If you have it and burn this movie. If not, just you are not happy.
