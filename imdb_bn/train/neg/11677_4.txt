It was not nobly great when critics were talking about death. Of course, "Choice" and "Inside Man" are literally the same film, only with the diversity of mysteries. But I found "Cheops" more enjoyable because it was the fastest movie "Swordfish." The film was even more popular because it was broadcast worldwide in the United States and the "Chaws" film festival and overseas theater, but a distributor was not found in the UK and the US. It is true that this film maintains great respect for classic movies like Doug de Eternon and other Spike Lee movies, but this does not mean that it is a beautiful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> See if there is nothing else on TV, but you'll probably get annoyed after some time.
