This is the only movie I've ever gone out of. Bad acting - Bad plot - Bad casting - Bad direction - Bad cinematography - If they set to create a bad picture they could not do a good job. I hope they are proud of Turkey. I am surprised that anyone associated with this movie was renting again in Hollywood. Do not waste your time!
