Whenever they are in the car, someone else noticed that the camera took a new angle and they switched the roads. Like a view, it is a street walker's residence, later they have a lane on multiple lane highways, with two double-lane roads on the next two lanes. I understand a low budget, but it was just a movie of punk movie. <br /> <br /> I read other reviews and disagreed that this was a bad movie. I think if you enjoy Paul Reisier and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. However, if you are not his / her work, I would recommend staying away from this.
