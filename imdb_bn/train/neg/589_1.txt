Actually, I went to visit the film because it is not because of the drama, because it is not because of the plot, because it got 17 ratings in Luxembourg and a film must be really brutal or pornographic to include in this category. Believing me, cinema-fickle, I saw most of my life's brutal films (Aichi The Killer, Ivvvvvv, Helvijer) but this movie I've ever seen is the most annoying and brutal picture. <br /> <br /> This plot was stupid, stupid, direction-sensitive, the act was moderate, even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtrack". There is no single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some scenes are really difficult to stand up to. (Especially in the scene, where you see embryos in glasses and hear baby crying - horrible). I do not understand why this movie was rated in 16 ratings in Germany, where the norms are generally difficult (such as murder-billed (but it was fun, it was a great expression of the Asian film, and in addition to a great direction) a movie was like a graceful country. Ratings 18). Nobody can call this horror movie, because it was more about showcasing the public than scaring (showing the "creep" face in the middle of the film was a bad decision); For me (excuse my expression) it's only an insane director living out of his annoying imagination. In some scenes you see violence, in which there is nothing to do with the plot and it does not give any explanation. The plot has holes and errors, the dialog is annoying, I can not really say the only positive aspect of the film except British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I have something to say, I want to ban this movie from the theater, I understand why some of the big production companies have not invested their money in this bank. <br /> <br /> I am interested in getting feedback on my thread and I would be happy to discuss one or another topic. <br /> <br /> "The Dream of Life", "The Dream of Life", David Amus
