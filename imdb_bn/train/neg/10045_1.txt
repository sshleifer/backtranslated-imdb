It has been said all over the world that Tasan will be a great movie with great joy, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made serious mistakes in accepting actor Kareena Kapoor. She was intolerable throughout the whole film. His son-in-law does not really look good. Even the story of the movie is not understood in this way. Everyone said that India's Quetin Tarantino victory, but not quetine. Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is a great actor and this is not the picture. Like Saif, Akshay Kumar has also been the victim of this picture. Styles and forums are not really good at this movie or I was disappointed
