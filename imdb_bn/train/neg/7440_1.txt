After years of searching for IMDB films, I am going to the record as the second person I was inspired to write in the Noche film, The Abandoned Two Account and post a comment. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was at the edge of existence, and no "puzzle" was added in any way. The acting was ridiculous and the writing was embarrassing. How did this film get back and came completely completely beyond me? Fantastic use of the word Anantia Hill and the repetitive use of the word is the only one that I have got to save only. (And Bright Sound Design) If I try to watch this movie again or with the movement of wild horses then I can stand against difficult decisions. I am disappointed that I 0 unable to give it.
