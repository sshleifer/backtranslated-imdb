Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, has nearly three "couples" and their relationship centers with obsession and violence. As much as I started worrying well as well. Fun These couples were plundered by a hercosexual couple, two hefajitian male friends, and a simple man with a gay man who was "homosexual" hunter. <br /> <br /> The movie does not really have much role in the "hit" couple. While watching sex scenes or walking with each other, they show some scenes that they like to be aggressive, but they do not seem to be any real purpose after being so small. My sense is that they show more everyday images about how sex / violence is consolidated in a couple's life. The couple is not very aggressive and it is not even shot in erotic way of any kind. As characters they do not add more to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This escalates in violence. And change them in violence. It became a way of sexual gratification. And because of the film's progress, their violence needs release. My main problem is that violence is not trustworthy. Sometimes it seems that any character is any real danger. It just does not work. The film's entire theme is about the relationship of character with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, help does not make-up. Sometimes, okay, another time it's too bad. In one scene, I was really surprised why a character was rotating on his face. Confusing More interesting pairs of characters "<br /> <br />" Stuckler Couple " Here, Calcons was saying more and was able to develop a more consistent story. Perhaps the letter seems to be more development and seems to have the resolution at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> It's pretty. Most of the low budget flicks are not as ambitious. I do not think Selson wanted to achieve his goal. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial or uncertain. Shiner was incredible. This does not mean that the director will not be able to achieve anything with his next movie. <br /> <br /> She seems to have something to say.
