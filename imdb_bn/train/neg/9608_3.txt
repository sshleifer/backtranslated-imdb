Man, who made this image? And more important where do I get anything? The opening scene sets the voice for the movie: a woman transforms into a whirlpool, nude in the fire circle. And this is a Rick Buckler 'American Werewolf' transformation, people. We're talking about some of the worst makeup ever caught on film here. I'm just nude Annik Boral (who plays Danila, the protagonist of this movie) (Any word? How bad it is. <br /> <br /> It does not look much better than here, Daniela and her condition or something about men The minutes of the actor's whip strap has been lost (I can not remember, but the conversation is so bad that if you do not smile, you will cry). <br /> <br> The funny thing is that Niyelao is a bherubola, he is a mental patient, whenever there is a man (understandable, as was raped child), he thinks his father is like a sheep. The opening scene). He can not help but he meets every human throat tear, and he wants to be the only choice! Daniela started to see them and they fell in love with a staffman who did not trigger her 'episode'. Here you see a montage in a chessist that you can see (sunny and horror after diving headphones with a window). <br /> <br /> Daniele is not fortunate that the film takes a cruel turn, she is seriously beaten and raped by a gang of rapists who kill Stuntman. "I spit on your grave", Daniela carries bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> This 100 minutes of my life I will never return. But hey, this game is when you play as a movie singer.
