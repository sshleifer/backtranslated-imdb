I did not even ask why I saw it! The only excuse that I was ill with bronchitis and the channel could come with very weak to change. :) It is very terrible for words, which is not bronchitis. Acting helpless, Richard Greco cut it off as a serial killer of a trigger-happy, gun-sling with a terror to kill the police. Nick Mancuso phones act as police on his trill, and Nancy Allen plays the only sympathetic role in the whole film. The script is frustrating, pepped with the cleaned lines, "Are you ready, Parird?" Every victim of his victim Richard Grieco purrs Terrible To avoid.
