This is actually a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Gonyith Paltrow, the script was written as much as possible. But the acting was awful. In addition to Kate Bincassel, I believe the book's true resemblance to Emma, ​​all other actors are trying very hard. Mark Strong was not "gentleman" he was "supposed". He was often rude and objectionable, he had no feeling, and throughout the film you could not see his love "growing" for Emma. It had a serious impact on Kate Beckinsale, who was trying to "recover" his main role and his partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry in the whole cast. Harritt Smith, starring Samant Morton, Mr. Elton appears to be an actual attachment played by Dominique Raavan. Therefore, he does not feel as heartbroken as he portrayed in the book. The film's settings are very poor. Clothing is more so. I have to imagine Emma Woodhouse for a more fashionable and elegant way to dress that she is here. The end is very long. It's good that it's like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending up for a movie. And again, in the face of Mr Ketterlen I can not see the feeling of happiness. To finish, I believe this adaptation is loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seems that the film was created without any budget. I like to see the version of "Lighter" with Paltrow and Northam, even if it is clear that it has become "Blockbuster" but seeing these actors (except for the good Olivia Williams and good Kate Buckinsle), the whole script will be destroyed.
