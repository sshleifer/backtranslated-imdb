I did not even read a biography of Lincoln, so it was probably a perfect portrayal ... <br /> <br /> And perhaps it's because I'm using similarly incomplete and unrealistic imagery which are unusually denied by Lincoln, Bright, Honorable and Our country's savior ..... <br /> <br /> Why would they make a movie representing Lincoln as Lincoln? Although Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his screenplay seemed somewhat humiliating to him as "Aag Shix, I'm just an ordinary guy". <br /> <br /> [There was absolutely the whole of Bushi Junior. For the campaign, he thinks he is "just a regular guy" so we do not care that he is a wealthy and privileged Moroccan - but it is a completely other story.] <br /> <br /> The film is not only a common (easy Looks like a kind of person, the film says that Lincoln only accidentally entered the law, and that was not interested in the law - only a false concept It's about the rights and wrongs of the law. In film, he is a very good defense attorney (he wanders around his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the result is determined by most of the opportunities / fate. Also, partly because it was reactionary to Republicans (i.e., in response to some games sponsored by Democrats) and partly because it was a time-lapse image, unfortunately, this movie is religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this picture!
