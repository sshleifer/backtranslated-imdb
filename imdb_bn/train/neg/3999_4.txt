I must say that I was helpless with this picture. I was never a huge BNL fan, I was like a song like his song and emotional nostalgic (it was in grade 9, if I had millions of dollars, life shoe box etc.) However, I saw their live show clip and I really liked the show's improvisational and idiotic nature. I hope this movie will highlight which, unfortunately, the most interesting part of the show is because their music has been well-received, but it is not quite compulsive and it is not mandatory (in the middle a standup diameter is lonely which was completely vain and annoying., Jim Crigan drunk himself Despite). The film does not show only a few minutes and (and you know that they have a good moment, such as Afghanistan's concert "Coffee, I charge, my name is Steve Paji and I'm really big"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, that song was in all places * again *, I almost grabbed my own hand. Like the BLL, a few years ago, I remember many memories of sitting around Campfire in Canada, "If I have $ 1 million", BLL was a religious event in Canada and most of them have a special Canadian slant of humor (Caf√© Diner for many students here The main, and the name of "Gordon" Canadian Canadians) has gone on for several years. They have gone there in the gloom, and I was a little grateful. Then suddenly they grew up in the kingdom and everybody thought that they were the new band of this brand (yes, they are new brands, but they're all 30!) When the rest is going to Canada "Oh! Guys, I thought that these guys had been a few years ago Did I have to hear 'million dollars' again? <br /> <br /> The concert footage is not bad, but I've seen more of their stage routine, shooting is not great, And things like clips from their massive open shows in Boston have become very fast in the interview. The interviews are surprisingly lazy for this kind of funny bunch, I think they are old and they have family and houses and elements and have a bit sitting. Go to the type of elements where they give the DeadPan insanity, then they smile and It breaks the debris, interviews with Moses Jenimar (Canadian Media Mogul) and Terry David Mulgin (music family), very enthusiastic and unknowingly entering the top territories. <br /> <br /> This film is not really too documented, I mean, it's basically a show and at the beginning of the film, they are already huge and have a huge travel group, we arise from their obscurity Bong "wonderful" They do not seem to be popular, it is a systematic planned-out event, so it's ultimately useless, half live concerts, half documentaries, and not much more. <br /> <br />
