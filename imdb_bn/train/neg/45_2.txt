As the number of video natives I still can not see at least, when I was available, this little trash was popped up in my "rental" list. <br /> <br /> There are a fashion model on the premises or some are being kidnapped and the impersonation took place in the jungle held for ransom by a motley crew. Some other caves are rented to bring him back and he has a bed of money to use as an exchange chip, although he returns to the girl and with all the money, he gets a significant cut. He has brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! Guessed, they are all terrible and sinking will shed blood to you. After stealing in the jungle, we learn that a dog belonging to a nearby goddess, whose underground angel angel is flowing inside the woods to find the tribes to destroy a human like King Kong. Now, this fellow is sometimes a nude guy with some of the worst makeup, Ping-Pong Ball for the eye and it's quite a lot. Its growing and groans have a harmonious feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself mutating those scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, do I forget to mention almost steady nudity? The reason for this film's ban is probably a specific scenario, though it is one second long, in which a girl attacks a girl and throats her throats, but this is not the reason for Gore's fans. Also, Jess Franco crosses the normal T and crosses and shows long close ups for female genitalia, and sadly, men as well. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you've got it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even good bad movie. It's just a shocking padded trash that can only be seen in a video nasty fan, and even if you have made your way to the list, then leave it to the end. If you look at it first, you can get the idea that it is ideal for the listing, which is not true.
