This film has a weak plot, poor characterization and weak special effects which I ask why I saw it and lost valuable lives. It's a random character that does not add anything to the story and the director seems excited to get his girlfriend in the film. Robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is introduced by a huge knife switch. It will be ridiculous if the movie is not so bad, but there is nothing interesting about it. One of the main rivalry is the only rivalry, and he was killed. When you make a route for the bad guy, it is a sad reason, because it is the best of encouragement for him. When all was said and done, the film was released better under the cutting chamber, or sometimes financed.
