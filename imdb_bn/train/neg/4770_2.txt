I wanted to like this picture, yes it is a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but i like them. If done well then it was a good, not flexible, all the elements of the good movie .... Unfortunately the elements are closed! Acting was terrible, and for the first time when the detainees were presented with one after another (the hoods were stopped) comments, and one liner was very horrible, yes I know, bad writing .... but it's more Bad writing was about bad writing. Two prisoners had relations with each other and even if there is not much else in this movie, sorry, I also wonder why I am annoyed to review it. <br /> <br /> <br I will end up with plot holes, plot holes and more plot holes! Frustrating!
