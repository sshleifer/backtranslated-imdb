Slackers are not just another teenage movie that really worth seeing. About Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C Meron) from HoDen University, lying on cheating and plotting with honors. Three roommates proudly surrounded their path for the last four years of college and now, during the final examinations, this big-men-campus school is being disturbed by the most unlikely father. The plot is very stupid and because there is no reason to see it until you want to stop the brain for a while. Slackers really add a new genre that adds nothing new to that genre. Slacker's comedy is hit or missed, but there is no real real fun or real moment in the film. Its really just a collection of gags and some are actually quite funny. Although not every eight jokes at work, at least eight. Screenplaces can enjoy some high school and college students that are full of gender and breast jokes. Even if they do not remember this movie very soon, it is not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays the weird Ethan and after some good comedy appears he has very little stoop. Jaim King and Devon Sawa are the other big stars, but rather than worse than this picture. It's directed by Hugh Nicks and it's his first movie so you can not blame him too much. Though perhaps the most fun character is Laura Pryp√≥n, she does not have too much of the movie. The film is very small in 86 minutes, but it can be too long for some people who do not like such humor. Slacker is not the worst movie of 2002, but certainly less than the average. In comparison to other movies in the genre such as Auto Tinny Movie, American Pie and its Signals, Scary Movies 1 and 2 etc. So unless you have seen most of them and you are looking for something new, slakers can fit that bill, but if you see just about anything else then that is better. Rating 4.3 / 10 below average teen comedy that is worth skipping.
