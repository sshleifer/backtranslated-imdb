I can not waste my time with this movie. I can not call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and weird Flickr but this bored me for death. Badly created and bad acting will be strange to destroy it. You must be surprised at what these people were thinking when spending money to make this movie.

You will be the reason that you can find it at almost any video store. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,
