It was a terrible movie. Do not be lured by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both great actors, but this will only be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not be freed from the ridiculous story of this movie. This movie is a nineteenth-century American campaign piece. Colombian rebels had the most kind of scenes while creating their cases for the revolution. Maria Kancta Alonso Fonye appeared, and her pseudo-love relationship with Waken was nothing but a mental plug in a movie without lacking a basic meaning. I'm disappointed that there are such movies, like the actors Christopher Walken's name is wasting a good name. I can barely sit through it.
