I'm a bit lucky to work, so I was excited to find this DVD. Unfortunately, I was given below too. This is a small cartoon series that tries to show humorous and hateful kind of humor. Animation is extremely crude, no doubt using Macromedia. Each cartoon bears a big fat guy in his family and usually played like a quarrel for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> Those who are not aware of the science of this animation may have some effect on them. However, if you've spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com like me, these cartoons will not be different from any other content you've ever seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists in the Newgrounds are doing a lot better than those shown on this DVD. If Lynch submits this work on the website, then he will be mixing well with newgroups. But instead of the new degrees I saw it on the DVD, otherwise I can give it 4/10 instead of 7/10. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expect better quality in both stories and animations.
