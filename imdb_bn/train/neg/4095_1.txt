Today, BA Arthur has died, so I was roaming the IMDB website and I was seriously injured in a show called "Gloria". "All In the Family" was a brilliant show for his first four or five years and I saw betting once I saw it. However, I swear that I was not necessarily a show called "Gloria". Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe, instead of showing television, I had a life as a young adult. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the franchisee "all in the family" became so bad that it was born that I never saw - and was rated very badly by the previous critics. <br /> <br /> I rated 1 rating for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register a poll, and should be condemned for writers and TV executives to start a show that there was no business in the air and the greatest art of TV history Hates a memories. <br /> <br /> Shalom, Zeidight
