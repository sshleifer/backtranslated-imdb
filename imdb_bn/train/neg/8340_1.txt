One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's so annoying that I switched it off the middle by watching the news. When I switched it again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with dreams and ends with dreams. Then there are some more dreams in between. Come on, do I have to be interested in this? A film must have a reason to be attractive. The moment you felt the film was only a dream when an intuitive filmmaker was stopped. Sometimes did someone tell their dreams and what their meaning was? This is !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horror.
