I'll say it again: This movie was completely lame. Kids are sure it, but adults ... will be suspicious. The whole thing was basically a re-share of the original, which could be expected, since they completely discovered most of the ideas in the first movie, but do they still have to re-release their entire movie? I mean, everything is redone from the Little Mymad. The worst part is the Morgan "Ursula's crazy sister" that comes out of there and threatens Melody, which Trickon seems to be ridiculous with her magic trident. Why did Trinity do nothing about it? Because the plot had nothing to do with him. I could go, but I did not. The whole thing was a shameful attempt for more money from Little Mermaid, and was probably thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell. Overall it's a terrible waste time.
