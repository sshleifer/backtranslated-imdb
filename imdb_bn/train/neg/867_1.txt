I had high expectations for this picture, though it was a bad review on paper. I was very tolerant, and I sat through the whole picture. I finally feel quite sick. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not particularly sensitized at least prudent or transparent movies, I enjoyed Woody Allen's' Everything You Never Asked About Sex. . 'And Michael Hannek's' Funny Games' - I want this ten-year-old woman to drink milk completely ill, the missing director director. And when this movie reaches an "orgy" where the boy drinks both of his mother, as well as the woman is hungry for the whole film, I often became annoyed for total distortion and emotional pop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Always avoid this movie, it has been shown in history as a lesson in bad film .
