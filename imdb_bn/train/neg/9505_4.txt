I'm not going to criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It was fantastic spunky at times perhaps the best animal action scene. Clyde Bitty is not exactly a matin√©e statue. She is not looking a little slightly and especially good. But that's okay. He is the lion's cage man. We know that when she does not take time from her lion to persuade her lovers, she will end with an island with her and save that day. Someone said that it was a history lesson. Circus scenes hanging around other days, especially around children. I did not understand that even in the decade of the 30's, they had traveled to three prominent schools. It seems something outside of 1860. I guess they were stock footage. No wonder any things have been forgotten. They are always talking about fixing her up. Even a worthy. It's a giggly silliness kind of, say a little about the male female relationship in our time. But if you do not do it very seriously you can enjoy it.
