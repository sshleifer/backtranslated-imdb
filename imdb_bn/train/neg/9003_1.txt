Truly this movie, I really mean, sucks. It's so big of plot holes, and 30 feet dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the Dragon itself, which inevitably will make the worst computer-generated image film real. I mean, when you see something like that, then you have to think, "Wow, really made this movie." Then it has been released. Anyone they are, I'm sure they do not work in the film business anymore. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, it was not on DVD, so I (unintentionally) took it video. The first thing to appear, for the two towers, was a lord of the ring trailer. It was a very clever move, putting this trailer on the video. This gives me (unwittingly) the movie 1 star, otherwise I could give it zero stars. Probably the producers, though, have to draw the character of Dean Kain (I think how you spell it) in public (oh, which is the video store). Later on, they employed the Split Screen Technique (like the Hulk) (I guess), the piece of this film is compensated for an indecision. Cover the box, we see a picture of our hero, and the dragon. The Dragon looks just like one in Dragonfly, or is it just me? However, the film looks like a rejection from Dragon Gremlins 2, and has a Nintendo video game villain CGI from the 90's (probably worse). Also, the dragon's movement is not like pursuing its victims - it's the same F ## monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, left leg-dom, dom, dome, dom dom, dum f # $ dwom! This just pisses me off Perhaps the filmmakers thought this thriller and Jos√© had the same effect. Why does not have a Dragon Pov shot then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not expect superman here. For the first time I saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was a plus for a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> It's so bad for the story, my 5-year-old brother could come out well. When I was not there, she was trying to lie about because she was roaming around my house. Oh, and did I mention that I hate F @ # King who made this incredibly stupid staped cap lazy film? !!!
