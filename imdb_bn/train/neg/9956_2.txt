I made a special effort to watch this movie and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems optimistic and releases the expectations of the actors one by one - I like the Pacino in Sanant of Man, and many French and other movies of the 70s / 80s saw Annie Duppere and Marthy Keller. But I have forgotten that any part of the dialogue is going on in any film, and in this film they are absolute ... trash! Filming locations were also attractive, but hopeless, hypocritical, and forced dialogue dragged the whole thing down to zero. Along with this, I can not find any allergic motivation for motor racing worldwide and no interest in this sport. Even extraordinary dialogues in "Love Story" were better than this movie (and it is saying something !!). I really had good hopes from these pictures and was so frustrated that given down so much.
