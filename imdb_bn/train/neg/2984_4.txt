I admit that most of the film was unclear, but I still had fun. It has a subtle wonderful power, on average music, and the women of film protects themselves fiercely, there is no pr√©ji here. I could think of several other movies which were bad, at least there was a playful plotline with some such social commentary. How they combat the Viral epidemics, destroys everything, even if it means how dangerous the military revolution can be after people's demise. Fulci tried to combine his earlier work (hell, door of Hell, door of hell). She failed, but definitely not unfortunately, like many people you think. I have a soft spot for the zombie films, so I admit that I have some favor when reviewing them. I'm saying that this film is good for once, if it is not so much growing in the making of the film (Felici left and Bruno (I could have hacked them with their best), it could have been much better and more attentive. It will remain in my collection as Gulmani Han song of Phulasi. An amazing note, it has a view of zombie 3 that people in the cemetery actually ripped off, I can not believe it myself, it'll be a surprise to check it out.
