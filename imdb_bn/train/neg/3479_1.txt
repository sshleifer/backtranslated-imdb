I went to see this movie in the movie and I was surprised to get into the house. Only me and my girlfriend were! This shouted, this picture is not very good. <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me, the picture was terrible. Ben Affleck played a guy to buy a family for Christmas. This is a very hypothetical story with falling in love with a girl who hates her. His performance is okay but he is not very good for the comedy look of the film. The plot line is poor and comedy almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There are some good points. For example, the family is going apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review is ruining other people by their money. I was very shy out of the room !!!
