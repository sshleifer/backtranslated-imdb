This film must work with Arch-Nemesis Doctor Clo, of the Inspector Gadget, which is returning to the peaceful city of Metropolitan city many years later. Using a new "cool" criminal aircraft to help destroy the gadget's popularity, and everyone needs to foil the gadget. Sadly, this film was fantastic, the series was fantastic, but after almost 20 years it was revived with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it will not be cut; Dr. Clo is not only terribly frightened, but he sounds like a wrestler with cold, than his original fearsome soul. It is supposed to be a child movie, but the plot is so painful, weak (the animation I did not mention the animation) that got it compared to the original series. Some have decided to turn Penny back on for two decades, she now has some masked style and does not play half of her role in the TV series. The gadget is in candlelight discussions, as well as a plot angle that focuses on the whole vehicle's words. Maybe I was just a boy who grew up, but I felt that the live-action version was more painful than I could bear, but now they go and take full series of TV series. Ours It's more than I can take.
