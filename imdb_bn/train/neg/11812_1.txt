... but I'm not one of them. Diary of someone was at least two-thirds observable, but the film's annoying and self-centered third part gives us the taste of being in this extraordinary self-tempting zodiac. Moretti says that she feels the need to make this film, but she does not want to do it, when the audience thinks she should be with her, but she really does not want that. A movie about Italian politics and selection can be interesting, but it's not that movie. At one stage, Moreity and her friends are standing outside the Communist Party's headquarters, discussing in an interview that they are preparing to deal with party leaders, but we never see the feature of this movie. The incident interposed with Moretti's political ravings leading up to the birth of her son, and the next home movie shot with her baby and later child Pietro (the film drags us through many years and multiple election times). We keep expectations to see some specific order or cogent argument, but they do not come. I had a great deal of doubt that I could have been patient with Noni Moreati film again. She succeeded to feel like an hour and twenty minutes an eternity.
