Lulu (Luis Brooks) works as a type writer and is missing some of his life. She entered the Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andrea (Georges Charlie) and she won. She set off for her boyfriend Miss Europe title behind. He won again but returned to Andrey because he asked him. Once back, once again, his life becomes old, so he wrote a note on one night and gave up for the fame that Miss Unmukt waiting for. Andr√© follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This picture is the most silent film with a piano music track. It seems to speed up everything so fast. Limited dialogue has been added later and it is very scary. Cast looks like it's a silent film. The best part of the movie comes to an end, but the story is too long. After watching this, I'm not really sure what the big deal was in the face of Luis Brookes - he has a terrible haircut that makes his face fat. I do not need to see it again.
