These reviews claim that the movie is so bad that the overboard is running with it. Leonard Part 6, the Battlefield Arena and Gogli's conviction, is not guilty of this movie. Those cinemas were entertained in their horror but dinosaur dung this pill is so painful to her painful. I have seen Baby Geniuses and Superbbis. I have not seen bad movies after seeing this bad pain. Let me tell the story before I start the review. Theodore Rex refused to keep a $ 35 million sack on the New Line movie theater. They spend the loss of direct video, making it the most expensive direct video for decades. Plot: Millions of clones of dinosaurs that they can launch sun missiles, which will kill mankind and start another ice age. Katie Coleton, a female police and a friend of the evil dinosaur, Theodore Rex, gathered a reluctance to stop him after the death of a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > All its mystery movies Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite terrible. Huawei seems excited and is trying to wing it with its performance, but there is no benefit. Theodore Rex has become boring and his left-hand behavior is thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him and hurt the people and hit his tail (accident and aimlessly). I thought bourgeois was bad but theodore is coming back to Rex: the worst movie of his career. <br /> <br /> No one will tell you that this psychology is enjoyable enough to be bad. I did not see this movie. What I saw was the ruins of a train which was written by man, which certainly had some ill-praise for Howard Dak. The level of humor and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's Inbreed cousin. Painful from end to end.
