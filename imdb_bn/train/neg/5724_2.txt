I agree with the latest critics that this movie was terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of gossip and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow dynamic, meaningless plot and the end of the fool. This was supposed to be filmed in any way: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a great movie and I would recommend seeing it instead. I had a technical resentment with the DVD that if you close the Spanish subtitles, they come back after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu again. Also, do not waste your time in the deleted scene because there is no audio and it just looks like a tourist footage.
