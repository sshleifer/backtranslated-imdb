I have been looking forward to seeing this picture for a long time, "Returning to Paradise," which I saw. I was very frustrated. The most realistic thing about this was the assumption that I was partially stolen from "returning to the sky". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Binsell, and Pullman were fantastic to see their role. Although I do not like the dance character and feel very annoying to him. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the film. It can be done very well, for example, the situation of prison can be more emphasized and horrific horror. It was very cheery in a movie to be realistic. There may be more action and excitement <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is "sad". I could not predict that. But till that time I did not take care of what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
