... there is no one to watch the movie. My husband and I went to see it last night. It's just a small theater, but there are usually a decent amount of people there. not now! Last night, my husband and I were watching the dragon war! Now we know why <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is the worst one I've ever seen. Yes, CGI was good, but that was that. Acting, scripts and dialogues, instructions, execution etc are so horrible God! As we were alone in the house, we could not speak during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad we were, it reminds us of the powerful morphine power rangers, Godzilla, deadly combats, and the Lord of the Rings. We were expected to portray Roth and Lord ZK as the captain of the solar army. <br /> <br /> Animals were ridiculous. You can not introduce loads of cannon / dragon / camouflage thing legions with canon without explanation. There is a wide spectrum of Lord's letters of the ring, but it's not just one and a half hours, they develop and develop with three movies. <br /> <br /> Change of scene is horrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was a very simple plot, I lost myself in the plot hole. <br /> <br /> The letters were Caucasian American, but due to the written dialogue in almost broken English writing <br /> <br /> The final scene can retrieve some value for the movie ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died, ... although she did not know him for a long time in this life. He does not feel very sad to leave "Murders", he does not know where he was and how to go back. We did not understand where he was for God's love or how he was there, but if he is not disturbed we can not be. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why did he lend to Queen Elizabeth, who was wearing the soul of the garment? Another thing ... 3 of the main character characters were brought back to finish the work again. Sarah completed her work and came from the afterlife. Jack does this as well. So why does Ethan become drunk? She has left alone without her girl, help her get back without a map / compass / helicopter. What is he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And if he returns home, does he go back to his job? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We said that we paid for it because we paid for it, but we were locked up as soon as the credit was hit.
