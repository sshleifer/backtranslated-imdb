I want to say that I am a public republic, although I do not agree with Bush's office much. And I love the daily show and the report of Colbert. They will be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy Bush's joke in Canaan, Letterman, Lenou, because I admit that Wa is not always the most intelligent man to walk the earth (I believe he is not silent.) But it has reached such a stage when enough is enough and it's really fun. I see where it might be funny and it's (he's doing fun because he's delighted in the figure of our authority.) In the comedy center, it's hard to try to make fun of him. I probably mean a special episode, but a complete series is just stupid. Looks like the cc only has the same blurred joke that we've heard it many times. I can not really see this show is going on season 1.
