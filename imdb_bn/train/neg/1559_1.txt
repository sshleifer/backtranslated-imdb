If I live for 100 years then it can be a very bad film. I think first class students can bring good plot lines as a class project. I was inferior to see it, and God has mercy on the creation of this autobiography, who paid for the production of this film. <br /> <br /> And after finally closing it, I really wanted to vomit. <BR> <br /> While creating this, there was no source of photography. There was a formula about someone acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> One time I saw Starz! Channel - even the main one. And it's about 3 AM It was at.
