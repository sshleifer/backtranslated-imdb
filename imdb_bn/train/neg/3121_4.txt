This movie is trash-poor. This is a terrible taste, and is not recommended in pedestrians and scripts, although based on real-events supposedly - which does not add much, it makes more of frustration. Directions such as scenes and out-of-the-scenes are not working well. Robin Williams is not sure what to see in this character or story. To get started, Williams is not a believer in breaking a relationship as a gay and the relationship itself is interesting. Even worse, his character is bound by a ugly podfofile story and it's no place as a plat device. You are an old Rory Culkin toutlessly spouting "d_ck_smker" - good fun - which is quite annoying and then laughs by the character of Williams. Finally you cast an angel as William Guardian advisor in Sandra Oh and the whole fiasco explanation at the end. The character of Tony Colett has only reversed his 6th sensation performance with the usual annoying and poor side. Very able to miss
