This is a badly made, poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parini. The story is based on the same name as Sharat Chandra's book and it is distortion of the root. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but sham creativity. Acting by everyone is influenced and the entire movie is a remake. The abuse of Lolita (Balan) makes Shaker's father's favorite words cheap and shocked and destroys the original story's soul. Again, in the scene where Shaveer (Saif) lolita is cut, there is not enough space with the flow of movies and characters, it is very annoying with the senses, and can easily be avoided. Likewise, sex scenes between Saif and Balan disrespect the film to attract viewers and a cheap quicker. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its soul, the work is different. The song "piyu bole" is quite okay. Another silver pillar of dark clouds in this movie where Saif stood for himself and was rebel against his father. A positive exit from this original and demanding claim. These counts on this movie 3 they deserve. The song and dance artifice by line smacks and it is a make. The song is protected, but remember that it has heard it somewhere and if it does not make a mistake, the tune seems to have been stolen. <br /> <br /> Ok, the time has changed since now. However, this movie is not even reflected in modern times. <br /> <br /> This happened when modern Bollywood filmmakers influenced NRIs and were increasingly obscured by reducing the profitable NRI entertainment market. Such films are not India or any other part of the world.
