Gishar's memoirs are a beautifully illustrated movie, no doubt. And the acting is usually extraordinary, at least in terms of how it is characterized as characters as characters. However, many details of small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me to be very annoyed able to fully enjoy it. A small story, which shows a lack of sensitivity in nature (it does not loot anything), where Moya is on a snowy winter day, where hanging bells hanging at the entrance of Saiyuri's house. The bell he has played is Fuhrine, or the wind chim - which only moves out of Japan in the summer! People of traditional Japanese homes do not sit at the door - they open their doors and declare themselves. (You might think it's a little bit of a story, but I'll explain it in a movie about America where a Christmas dress hangs at the door of July and no one misses it.) And do not let me start the Maoqo and Gaisha which is completely bird- Asian / Chinese / Kung-Fu-Ish, and nothing like the real thing, its completely wrong hair on the hair. I think that the attitude of this joke really comes to the attitude and the imagery of people and situations, rather than the culture they want to prove to this culture. So, I think at least the Japanese culture and at the Kyoto premises of Geisha and Micro (which is "Miyako"), I think you will enjoy it. I honestly believe that this movie can be so good ... as it is, another Hollywood version of "Exotic Japan".
