There is a movie with a good cast and beautiful looking location work, but this is not the only one. Director Richard Brooks will be a little tired at this stage of the game; How good was his job! The horse and the rest of the work gradually continued slowly during the speed scene. This film requires speed up, if anything The horse feathers that made me look terrible terrible and those obvious tire tracks at the desert tracking moment - just lazy. Sloppy work very bad. Actors are ok, but I certainly saw them doing well. Ben Johnson is always a pleasure, though. I saw this flick some 30 years ago; Then was frustrated and remained so on the second visit after 30 years.
