It can not be described how foolish this film can be described. This is a series of random, persuasive clips about everything from an intelligent Batman Spuf to old-lady (real boring) with everything about it. The only remote entertainment thing about underground comedy movie is seeing the film's best actor Jo√£o Bottufuco. Also, it is rated NC-17, pushing the only man who can tolerate it.
