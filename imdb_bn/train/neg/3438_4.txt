The spooky boat sells itself as 'The Fog' and fills it with 'Open Water'. In many ways this is correct. There are awesome and strange people to be interested in you <br /> <br /> But the best of acting ability. Clear signs show that this is just a bunch of friends who create a horror film. All the credits in which they make the best of their ability. When you take a low budget, it becomes very difficult for special effects, ghosts look like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are unclear and weird But in a short period of time, it is too much of the use of twists and turns that disturb and confuse you. This is very good for keeping the picture awake. At the end, ignoring the irrelevant curves of every 5 seconds, you actually want to know what you want to know. And willing to wait for 1 hour and 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship but it will definitely be made in front of the TV in the evening.
