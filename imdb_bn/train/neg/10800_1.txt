What was the point of this movie? What was the plot I do not know. Shock can not work, people do not know how to be guided, and I was kasam! Raps a gin? Come on. Maybe there will be a movie like Aminem or Linkin Park. I think I just saw this to kill time. It was not really my interest. I just think, "Shek keeps this picture in the picture ???" The whole story looked very stupid. It's made in no sense. I think there is an unwanted moral of this movie that you can find something in veto and something can happen. I can not comment too much because the movie is so horrible that there is nothing to comment on. I think this movie "will" will go away.
