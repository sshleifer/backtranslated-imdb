This type of story is not unacceptable because the movie is in any place above 5 stars of 10 lines, because it is behind George Lucas and it has the words "Star" and "Wars" in its title. It's an insult to the aspiring filmmakers, and many others who have definitely made extra films with higher stories, writings and acting, but have not received credit. It's a travesty <br /> <br /> The first thing is the first. The story Anakin's evolution? There is no one. Besides the little make-up around the eyes, and a little loud, there is no one. He is a single blow Darth Vader of the young, stupid, Kaki Anakin Squawler. The only thing that consisted of the original series 'Doubt Widder' was his intelligence, how well he did all he did, plan, war, you name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin felt in the estimation triangle is its consistent folly. <br /> <br /> Which part of Emperor Palpatine says to Seth's legend that he does not refer to Emperor as honest? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Battle scenes use a lot of digital double. Everybody flying in the house of flying dolls everywhere like table reers. Duke, Emperor Palpitin, Anakin, Obi-Wen, there was a Robert Digital double jumping around almost every soldier. <br /> <br /> One particular war scene, OB-Wyon and Anakin climatic war, in fact they both turn off in the middle of Paris and ripostes, apart from their sabers while doing a few times to twirl. I understand that the choreography has been done in the fight, but that has pushed me into disbelief and hatred. <br /> <br /> The text was awful. All dialogue was extremely low quality. Ian McGregor and Natalie Portman could do better with their line of good actors, but that was not enough. I could not say enough bad things about this film. There are many more special effects, intricate holes than the center of the universe, and no insight into the characters. This image is the biggest mistake: new things are not given. We all know some rough pictures, all Lucas had it in color. <br /> <br /> We knew Anakin had lost her organs. We knew Luke and Lia's brother and sister, we knew that Luke was the son of Aachen, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda were to be deported, we all knew. There is nothing new in this picture. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes a dread fellow, she asks Padma, and when she dies, he will hear, he will reach. Her arms curiously and screams "Nooooooooooooooooooooooo." The scene shouted in B-Movie all the way, and I was half that Darth Vaida went "Danger robins, danger" at any time. This is what A B-movie, which is disguised by a huge budget and a superhuman fan base, which now decides with the first two films dragging their values ​​into earth's crust.
