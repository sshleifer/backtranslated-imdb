During the cheap cheap movie on the debut of Crazy Fat Athel 2, I was surprised that it was the same movie which was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is stupid easy to find. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with a eating disorder, is overcrowding the hospital because half of the house is released. He is observers by most traditional residents and a man keeps dead flies in another's soup. Ethel is then teased by half-chambered house crew with a chocolate bar after a chick hits the measure on measuring the quantity of food feed. Ethel responds by strangling with the cable hose on her stairs and then .... well, you get the idea. All this sounds like fun, it is not. This picture is made with poorly influenced effects and even worse performances. The characters are so wooden when they stand in front of their singer store, providing their lines. To make things even worse, half of the film has flashbacks of the first athletic film, chronically insane, which is slightly better. A very poor effort.
