The worst kind of pictures. Originally, the declaration of independence in the United States was replaced by a plasma screen and it fooled the museum's safety for a few days. Eh? <br /> <br /> It seems that the screen will run from that battery for less than 2 seconds, it seems that the internal resistance for the current supply is less than enough. <Br /> <br /> This is a dozen big car batteries and an electronic inverter is possible, but that does not fit in the system case. Sorry to be anal, but it's not even close to being possible. The rest of the film was not very good and I was surprised that the budget could not donate or donate to me.
