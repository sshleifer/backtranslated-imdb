Stanley Crumar manages an action thriller and brings out two things: Action and Thrills. Junk Hackman has been convicted of being run away from prison for doing some mysterious work at Dominino Principal. Richard Wyommark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallacht are their employees - they probably work for the government, but since it is not clear like most of the plot lines in the film. Hackman asks many questions which are never answered, so the movie does not go anywhere. Although it tries to be like the Night movie and the Parlelex scene, Domino Principals combine the ambiguity and mystery with confusion and frustration. The film is extremely good picture but it works against it. The direction of the cramber is without any style. This is a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> Acting is fine with Hackman, he has proved that he is unable to be upset. Widmark and Wallach are appropriately cast nasty and Albert Widmark's cruel lackey as well. Even the hacker Mikey Ronnie is pretty good as a hacker sidekick. But Kandis Bergen's cast as Hackman's wife is a strange thing. We told him to spend time in prison and it looks like he is trying to sort some of the south curly. The idea of ​​the crawler to wear him as a trailer trash is to make him wear a ugly brown wig. This is a role suited for well suited Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
