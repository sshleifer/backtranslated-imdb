Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, it was not noticed. The historical issue of the giants is good, but the knowledge pours into milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. I said, take this rock wheel and a steep closed roll. I could not even see the whole picture. That's a lot because I rarely walk to any movie. I always want to give their last minute chance of release. It's impossible to break something bad. Well, at least not playing well .... <br /> <br /> "Fall" is the only issue in this movie. 1/10 and sinking into negative numbers!
