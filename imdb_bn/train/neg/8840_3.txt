The perfect example is not what you do when you have a great idea. Is not that the problem? The concept is full of fresh and potential, but the lack of any real substance in the script and its execution. It will grab you from the beginning and then a little bit of your emotions, invest in your interest and character. There is nothing here that does not have the movie to stop and sustain the flight, and here's why. First of all, you do not really care about letters because people are not presented in a way that might be related to humans, I mean that it is not a superman or mission impossible, it seems like ordinary people fall into a stressful situation. They are not reliable in the way of action and interaction. Example: Jeffrey Combs gum as a police chin, frowning and looking intense is not the only way to go here all the time. I mean, what is it? She looks like she's in the toilet or something. I love him again in the animator and the way he played acute / neurotic, the irrational medical talent was worth the money. But for this, he tried very hard and hard to look at the end but still it is not normal in light neurotic method, I am surprised that he did not waste his jaw during filming. The film basically depends on living, it is rarely a pulse and it is waiting for something that will never come.
