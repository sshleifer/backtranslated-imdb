The movie is quite different from the very long and unfortunately novels. If you want to watch the movie then do not read the novel because it will shock you. However, cinematography was okay, and if you are a person who likes adventure style who seeks Africa, go for it. Performance is adequate, however, many important events in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother instead of a lady in search of his father. Gag was intelligent and killed in the cave, although here he would show as a good person who wanted to stay in the new king.
