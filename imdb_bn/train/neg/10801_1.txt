Now, I'm going to see a movie that has a poor review and says, "Hmm ... it's not so bad!" I love cables gai, and thought that my big fat independent movie was great. Remember, I did not really see this with high expectations, but I thought that maybe ... maybe it would be so bad that I could smile at it. I was roasted. At this time during my hardship with this "film" (and I used that word at least) I was also humblely close to entertainment. To begin with, Quintin Tarantino looks like Marlon Brando while performing the shock. I hate rap music, but as far as I can say, the fan of Michesh will probably have better rapper. The main character is simply annoying, and it is not a character that is not easy to like it. Very clearly, I'd like to eat a tropical piece outside the bloody lung of the Harlequin embryo than this watch again.
