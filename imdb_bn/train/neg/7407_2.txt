1st January 6/18/2009 ?? 2 of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A strange psychology film about a girl with autism which is being tested in a hospital, triggering energy, and then breaking all the hectic looser breaks. I'm not really sure what the motives of filmmakers were on this issue. What we found for the next one hour (at least it was not) was a rotating horror / evening zone / sweepsthoot / ghost movie that could not even understand in any sense till the end. Initially, after leaving power, the girl and her father were absent in the hospital except for the small group. Generally annoying character, a weird old man, and usually a difficult man, is like a terrible man, and of course, that character attracts the main character. Random stuff sometimes starts to look like ghosts and monsters, indicating a time off and the dead try to protect this small group from what they have. Of course, no matter how the autistic girl is, everything is all about. Really, how they hate it by using this hatred and the reason that it was the reason and to establish it in a hospital where people are cared for is really a lingle. We did not really find the answer to what was happening? That's pretty weird, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to go out and get confused for one and a half hours, this is not for you or a movie. What time is a waste? Really!
