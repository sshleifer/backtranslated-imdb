I went to screenings of this movie and when it laughs me in a few minutes, it was a big mistake. This first represents itself as a ridiculous exploitation of a real-life divorcee who is trying to find love in LA. What is it morphs in a boring, narcissistic, and unfunny romp through film director's love life and professional life history? Jokes wear thin thin and you suddenly find yourself not care how this person's date progresses. The laugh is that the director presents himself as a highly annoying and serious defective character and then wants to be concerned about us.
