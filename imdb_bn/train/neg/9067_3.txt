Although I had some hopes for this movie, especially since I enjoyed playing Jason Segel (Freaks and Geeks, undefined) so I said that in the recent memory I saw one of the worst movies (Loser and Dr. T and women are on that list ). <br /> <br /> Yes, aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly The compound was not bad - the scam artists cheated with their cheating through college and met their match when they were discovered with a proposal for them. The problem is that the letters were so unlikely that I was not concerned about any of them. Blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was a psychotherapeutic that was not funny at seeing him - he was not particularly fun or charming, he was just a lunatic, who was actually dangerous and not having fun. It was difficult to follow the editing of the film - it was over in imagination and reality and it was often unclear what was. Only two or three of the gang scams were shown, you only had to take it based on the belief that they were actually a scam artist - their plans were made for a better movie. The story of so-called love was unreasonable and unbelievable, in fact it was stupid and weakly written and directed. I could go about the movie's shortcomings, but you get the idea. $ 4 does not have to be rented or rented from movie stores!
