The way back when I rent free videos I picked this one. Oops I wanted to mention outside mentioned summaries earlier. 1: There was a strange and sick attraction for food to do much with the creation of this film, it was fair and unnecessary. 2: There is a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be full time, and after a few days of watching this trash I felt that there is some ambiguity in their tracks. That was either or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. You can not feel much experience or talent throughout the film, many times throughout the film. And do not even ask about acting.
