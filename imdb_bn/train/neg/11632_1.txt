I saw this movie in snake preview screening and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just boring. Full of his dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in order of action (such as the "Little Germany" in the shootout). I've made some things I've enjoyed in the movie ... and many of which I disagree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. Fart Jokes. 3. Poop jokes. 4. The dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Taliban 7. Bush's fun again ... We have found that he is an idiot .... 8. Dude has blonde hair. 9. Plot. 10. Minor killing 11. It was in the Uwe Bowl. 12. Most cast was just unpleasant and was outside. <br /> <br /> Now (some) good <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses a cat as a silencer in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Make a return to the Crotchy (and the Dakar manufacturer is a Camio) 4. Um .. I do not have to pay for it. 5. There are several "effect" moments <br /> <br /> I said again. He made another crappy game in the movie Adaption. Codos to you, sir. 2/10
