If you want to entertain, do not go to see this movie. If you want to see the heroism of the war, do not go to see this movie. If you like well and want to see an excellent playback, do not go see this movie. Check out this movie if you like movies of general Hollywood war that ended in a politically charged appeal to the public about the glory and glory of the war. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they do well then they can learn something about the outstanding and worthless attributes of war. This film shows a bunch of people walking around the village, which is scaring the clich√© lines, doing the most anticipated things, and protecting oppressed people with the same exact power and cruelty. This film is a movie and disrespect in American America! You can imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or from any other country, and this is how Americans are really? Wonder, everyone hates us! Please, please, do not waste your time on this part of the junk; If you wait, and hire it. 4/10
