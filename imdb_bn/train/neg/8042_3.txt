The secret is ... these movies Sorry, but it's OK. <br /> <br /> **** spinner **** <br /> <br /> In this bad hobby I know what you did in the last Sammar and the script, played well by Beth, Dori Burton, quite well Some have joined a spring break trip friends. The group tries to rent a fancy room and enjoy a fun vacation. Then, the beginning of death. The first is to kill another friend, which leads to a sad and tedious measure with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note, Derry Burton, Rise Witherspoon of the poor people ?? He looks like Reese, works like Reese and the police can pass the lineup to Reese. Maybe how did they throw him? Anyhoo, modest cinematography and fair acting can not do much for bad conversations and terrible writings.
