TV Pilot, do you love them? Quinn Martin tried it after a bunch of other TV detective films were successful, but it does not go anywhere except the MST's state. Roy Thines Diamond Head who ordered an anti-Mario to find the Super Mario Lovejoy, I mean the tree. There is more to Zulu and Tso-Tsing ethnic comic relief and more. The tree is sucked like a bad man, despite all the disguise that looks similar to that of a common man. Here you have more unusual clothing fiber that you can imagine (needed in the 1970s) and the show itself is anti-climatic. Why did the series go? If you think about it, it's quite blatant It's fun for MST again, but not much !!
