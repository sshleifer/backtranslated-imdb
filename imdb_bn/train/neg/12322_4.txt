The general idea of ​​these views seems to be that the film has some stunning animations (I have seen it on Blu-ray), but it really falls from a deep depth. <br /> <br /> Firstly all of the characters are pretty dull. I got an indication of the Laputa situation between Azito, Tula and main opponent Shawnak. But maybe my heart broke and this deliberate thought was (Laputa is my favorite animal, original Angle Dob). Characters are not really loveable and in another post it has been mentioned that they fall in love very quickly, poor old chimes become jealous (she loves Azito, who is unconscious about this). But at the end, it is finally forgiving Toola that it ends somewhat "happy" without any explanation for the change in heart. <br /> <br /> There is a serious lack of explanation here. Who really is the druids? Are they human And who are weird women / girls who hangs with them and seem to run the forest? It can not be explained why they are there and how they can give the regular directors of the people. The plants coming from the moon are not yet fill in this empty. It's almost like a weird version, Trophy day. <br /> <br /> and who can call it? <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this picture but I wanted to like this picture but I did not find any deep image like ghost in the shell or got a real character like this. Miyazaki's I'm not bothered to see it but I do not want to buy it. My advice? Buy it if you have a few hours left, but lend it, or buy it cheap! Perhaps if your new movies are animated and you do not have much to go, then you will enjoy it. It is certainly visually pleasing.
