Jasica: The name is a magnificent story as a ghost story. The theme may be awesome but Comedy comes around! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie tries to pass as a plot. It's really nothing more. This movie has many related scenes, in which there was no connection with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> From the first scene immediately, the movie "Directly" - DVD "Attempts like VANCANCY 2, there is no sense of direction or creativity in the film, and certainly a bad name for" Straight to DVD "movies. The side is weak, poor as the lack of fear or tension, even dramatic elements are driven frustrating and even the worst soap opera shed <br /> <br /> The performance of the board is to show even the slightest possible probability of a completely unfamiliar and even successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many different scenes are incredibly long, With lots of breaks in exchange, I'm not exaggerated! <br /> <br /> The only reason I have rated this movie is 1 instead of 1. E, because some poor acting, coupled with some strange conversations worse for the price. I have the sentence "a few" words have imposed. This camp blauda or myasasera Nile songs like "worst-to-best" movies, not overall. If you want to laugh violently then see those movies. If you want to watch the horror movie about ghosts, see Hellhouse, Linking, Rangu, EY (Original Korean Version), Grudge, a Missed Call or Phone <br /> <br /> I suggest that someone got a good fortune to avoid Jasik: a great story to keep up the good work! Just forget this movie exists. Not a thought for it extra!
