This is probably the worst movie I ever seen. Once again I made a mistake in buying a movie because the back sync has become quiet and it looks very nice to cover it (I bought this review and after the "Malvolence" movie, I learned my lesson). I love horror movies performed in the jungle or desert or in a farm. This probably took place in the forest of Texas, but it was probably illustrated in the backyard of the director's house. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actor was absolutely great. There was nothing to do with the cover behind the story. I tried to sell it at F.Y.E and some other "mother and pop" stores which bought and used DVDs and would not accept it. Thats how terrible it is for these poor unfortunate excuses for a movie. I've seen some bad movies before (for example Troll 2) but it certainly takes a cake. I do not think there was a bad movie than "Troll 2". The boy was wrong! If you do not release it, you will not buy this movie apart from stuck with it until you can do it!
