... and I never thought that a film should be given the 1st prize! But this one is the worst movie I've ever seen. My wife has chosen it because of casting, but the story from the DVD box seems right. This is not a mystery, nor a teenage movie. It does not include any significance, if the title remotely gives you a suggestion. This is not just the total number. Do not waste your time or money until you want to see young people in a large Gothic setting, where a killer is going after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. McMoscow makes Nic Stahl the worst.
