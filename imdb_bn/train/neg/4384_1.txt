Anyone actually spends the meaning of such a bad script, is beyond me. This should be one of the worst movies ever, except for the "Hunted Highway" I have ever seen. BAD actors, and a really bad story. There is no normal response to any event in this movie, and if it is Halloween, even if normal people testify to their father's death, being wasted, tapped people will be covered in the air, and will be a big reaction until they are able to breathe. (I can add at least 50 people to a room) and some people drag the devil out of his house to the dead, even though the 8-year-old can see the difference between a puppet and a person. Like this child, not to mention that no one can be innocent and stupid to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus' presence on the same day. At the age of 8, I was sure that there was more brain. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid thing that everyone else seems to be looking at this silent devil, did not ask any questions. Is the question in the film really devil, or does it kill some crazy person when he feels it? Well, man's arms, arms, made and whatever, so I think he seems to be in the movie, otherwise they hide it. Then, this man was able to kill all the people and all, he was an elderly lady, a man and his daughter, 5 (!! !!) police (I was able to kill everyone with guns and training) and some other people. .... and apparently everyone was standing waiting for him, right? <br /> <br /> The whole concept of saying the story and the way is the worst thing that I have seen, and I would never recommend that anyone spend 1 hour and 30 minutes watching this total shit.
