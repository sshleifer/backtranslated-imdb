What was the idea of ​​making this film so attractive that it brought the brightness of the Charlotte Bronte in the original classic tale? I was very disappointed that this movie, which seems to be very early writing or filming, was not the main quality of the novel that was not so powerful. The most notorious drafts of the main character Jane Jare and Mr. Rochester are left absent from the pornography or left in the cutting chamber floor. There was also the absence of Jane's autobiographical soul, which enabled him to suffer through his instability and victory over everyone. The original Zen Zener was a hero. The General's film does not seem to have much to win, when Jane goes away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. His struggle for looking for food and shelter, seeking forgiveness for bread, threatening to die for cold in the cold, moving away from people who love everyone, in my opinion, the mad part of the story was easy, which was easy to remove from this movie. The title character looked dry and uninspired. The story was unexpected and for those who did not read the book, I could not imagine that this story would be a bit bizarre. The classicplayer story has no credits if the screenplay and direction did little.
