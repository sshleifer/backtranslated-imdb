Unless you're mentally ill or the most deadly hard seagull fan, you'll be tired of this awesome excuse for a movie less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Plot - even for a sigal film, the plot is simply stupid. I mean it's not just bad, it's very consistent. <br /> <br /> acting - incredible wood. Actually played well to see acting. Surprisingly, the film tries to cash in on these audiences, which is a 'lesbian love scene' which is totally worth croaking. <br /> <br /> Special effects - Do not jump to 60 floors of sword and museum. <br /> <br /> As long as you suffer from insomnia and do not end all other healing, I do not make the same mistake and do not buy this DVD because you will ask for that one and a half hour of your life. .
