Bela Lugosi is a malicious botanist who has sent briden toxic orchids on their wedding day, steals his body in a fake Ambulance / Shonos, and takes home for his Midget Assistant to find out the filling of the granliser juice to keep the Bela's wife forever. Some second rate actors playing the detective try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bella Lugosi Hammers it nicely, but you can say she needs money. <br /> <br /> This picture is completely awkward, and most actors were stuck waiting to be waiting in the table, but the plot was astonishingly ridiculous. Tell anyone to happen it and they tend to quite a lot smile and demand to see the film. I got a DVD at DVD Store 2 for 1 division, which I think is a fairly good evaluation, for which someone who is paying more will be out of their mind.
