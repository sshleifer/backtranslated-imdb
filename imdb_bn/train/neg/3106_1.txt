Whenever I've ever seen a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, then this movie is always there. It has no redeeming attributes. I used to work the whole thing to sit, and I once again used to eat my blood and wanted to sit back again. <br /> <br /> Is this wrong? I tell you my travel story to see in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on Saturday night. I was the only one in the theater and aloud loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly aloud They probably had a good time on Saturday night, and came to this "comedy" for some smiles. Before the film began, they were lively and fun during the previews and made a strong comment on the huge old time. It was an unlimited border; They continued their stupid interest in real movies, I might have said something, but I feel encouraged and sympathetic towards them, so I left it. After the movie began, they became fixed. <br /> <br /> Why am I saying all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" not only on yourself, but on this terrible bunch. <br /> <br /> During the entire movie the person did not laugh at the theater. Not once Not yourself, not excited kids. The perfect silence next to the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and the light came, we all gradually filed silent, neutral, neutral silence slowly out of the theater. It could be a funeral. <br /> <br /> This effect was made of this "comedy" produced. Not laugh, not enjoying, but absolute depression. It's a sad, depressing movie, and not the least fun. Dear, self-motivated, depressed, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks '' Blazing Saddles '' will sometimes be in the shortlist of funny movies. It still beat my mind that perhaps the very gentleman might be responsible for perhaps the least interesting movie. <br /> <br /> In brief: if you feel very happy, then give this movie a cyclone; Otherwise, I do not say to warn you.
