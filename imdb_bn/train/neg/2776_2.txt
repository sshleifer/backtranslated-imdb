King Maker is a film about a real movie (citation needed) that took place in Portuguese profession in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the direction of clothing and art is pretty, the film still fails to impress the viewer. Acting, especially, was very poor. The actors are giving some tears and trying hard, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The storyline was too stupid to be too stupid and true and it looked more like a history lesson. The film could not capture such a royal and century old wind, and it looked more like a conventional effort to create the Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> The final word? The direction of clothing and industry breathed new air, but the death penalty was very poor and the actors could not even have an emotional natural explosion. In short, the film makes more sounds like a script than a script.
