I did not really expect this picture to be so much, I found it in five movies, all of which were terrible in my way under a fire, so what can I expect? And you know that I was right, they were all terrible, this movie is interesting (and some are expanding it) interesting points, sometimes a wonderful touch of Camcoder's view, the drummer is like a drummer, which is frustrating. Actually, the problem is that it is very annoying, which I can guess, was an effort to pull the tone, absolutely nothing happened and when it was completely tedious (I had my thumb in front of the forward button, ready for most movies. , But lets give it a go) and the band's superb lead singer who is looking for the best, coz they star Dheka that he does not mention how the heck, I thought he looked a little like a mekarata, all this and I will not even mention the killer, I will not even go into it, it can not be explained. Since I think Star and London were the only reason to see it and London (actually quite funny), it was not due to their acting talent, I have seen many things bad, but I've seen so many good. Avoid the best until your dry color is dry watching.
