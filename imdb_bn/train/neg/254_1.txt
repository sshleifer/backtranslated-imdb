Ah, Bate. How do i hate you Tell me the road. 1. You try to be funny, but are crazy and unjoyjoyable; Each joke is expected and expected, and when it comes, smile does not inspire. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are incredible; The woman overacts over terrible degrees, and looks like "bad guy" Bill Gates, and as scary about ... Well, Bill Gates. (Just try to threaten someone with a gun by Bill Gates, it does not work, a lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Not suitable.) For the jammy fox, all right, try a dramatic and sincere conversation. Ridiculous, and want to lose me. 3. You try to be action-packed, but rather dull and drag many times. And when the action gets warm, the tripod must be lost for the camera, because the scenes are more humid than the Blair Witch project, and I feel disturbed and want to reduce it again. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! I used to walk barefoot on Saha, fill the beef pack and any water, no sunscreen and only Merle Strip for the company. The hell will show the ballot for more than a minute, and everyone in the marriage has shown their way through a silently written story with Bill Gates for the bad guys, and do not talk about the huge bomb of the jammy Fox's character. Only a cliff has been run, but managed to run anyway ... kill me right now, or do the right thing, and I do not have to show a movie that is bad in this way, again.
