We have a lake. We have an animated metro crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. All right, so let's call this movie Crater Lake Mester. What else can we add? Hmmm, Arnie and Mitch are said to define the final definition of "Comic Relief" for two cats. We also got a sheriff who does not really do anything remarkable in this movie, and no one can hear of it. O shit, we're halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! There is no concern, let us introduce some people to Musa, he has looted a shop to signal a bad person, then he has popped somewhere near the lake, he has thrown him through the jungle, and dinosaurs to meet his only purpose As snack food. That should work. <br /> <br /> A complete, weird mess, this film. The logic of this will force your mind to laugh. First film to mark Dave Allen as the "Stop Speed ​​Supervisor" After this one, he joined forces with Charles Band until the mid-90's, when the band ran to pay him, I guess. Dinosaur effect is charming and the whole film is curiously funny. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing that can be called for. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes There can be reason enough to put a low-level argument in the story. If not, Arne and Mitch will be strategic. 3/10 and 8/10
