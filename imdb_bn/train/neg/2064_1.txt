Oh dear Chavey Chase and SNL sets new heights with the gang sketch show format, although it fails unnecessarily at each level. Fortunately Chevy is barely at this point and can not be blamed for this impressive. It's seriously bad. The political comment of the United States of America's release (1974) means that it is not yet funny or intensely. Sketches are too long and they can have any satirical impact dragged into the point of complete frustration. It is credited as the debut of Sheveer film and I am happy to say everything better after this. Avoid even if weird.
