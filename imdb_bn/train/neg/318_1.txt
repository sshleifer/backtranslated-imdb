When I was a college student, I stole this movie. I tried to see it three times, because the second two friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I have never heard of this movie, but since he is so funny that it will be fun." Wrong! After the boxing match / humiliation of dreams, I can not see myself in this mood, where your opponent has physical pain due to burning a good Jinger. You will feel disappointed to hit that terrible comedy, but after watching this you will know his truth. I can not pay for the price of this movie. I saw a ton of Steven Segal movie, and I even saw crossroads twice ... but I still could not see it.
