Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) This Christmas is not scheduled to be lonely. Not just a millionaire drill; But very terrible and very grandi is guilty. Drew returns to the home of the house and supplies the resident family there, Wallco, with his $ 250,000 Christmas season being his "family". Tom Walko (James Gandalfini) is reluctant, but enough greedy to take the draw offer. Christine Wallco (Catherine Oahara) has nothing to say about this, but learning to love around Drew ... does not have similar feelings with daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but she also has room for change. Drew girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) tracks Drew and his people meet his family. A delightful fun shop as a happy Noyle becomes a sunny unusual nightmare. Cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Messi, David Selby and Stephanie Farsi. Affleck is weird though, ridiculous.
