It was meant to be a parody of the LOTR-Trilogy. But one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad screen, everything bad. This is my personal opinion. I do not doubt any other person who likes this idea of ​​"humor", but there are good parodies in the films of acclaimed directors such as Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I was working in movie theaters and DVD stores and the success of this movie was the same for both of them: it was not a great (but bigger) success in the first two weeks of the movie, but then the reviews who viewed it were not very good, the movies were very fast Dropped out It was good for a short sale in DVD sales but then nobody asked for it. In the last ten years, I see two bad movies ring rings and torque. I can not determine what was bad, but I'm happy with the happy movie so I do not have to worry too much about this question.
