A good way to stop the wall completely, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uncomfortable mix of science-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. This is what a stupid and completely inconsistent film equals. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that if the script is there, "pond scam" is complete. I do not want to say it weird, just like "total idiocy". This movie is frustrating specific, and you have been warned. There is no reason to waste it at this time, and if you do, the intense smell will be like a leaky fish .......................... ... ......................................
