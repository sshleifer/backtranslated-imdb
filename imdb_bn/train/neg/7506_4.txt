Good actors and good performances You can not worry about any non-skippable scripts, bad conversations, and behavior patterns. The most striking character is David Berkowitz. There is no development of the character - there is no increase, no interest, suffering for some special reasons, not teaching us anything and even not disturbed for entertainment.
