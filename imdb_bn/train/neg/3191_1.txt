There are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are so awful that they are long forgotten and unwanted. Also, add lots of violence and bad stuff (not only Chess stuff; you know what I understand). What is the result of bad movies with this kind of raunchy content? Why, "the final judge" of course! <br /> <br /> Do you remember Mitchell? Joe Dawn Baker was the star of the movie, and it was quarreled by Joel and Boats in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now at this time, with Mike Love's satellite Joel's place (but with the same bot), the three had to make fun of MTT3's second Joe Dawn Biker movie "Final Justice". Of course, most of the naughty stuff I mentioned were removed for publishing television, but I still want to see that episode (and "Mitchell" as well), because Joe Dawn hates the most? Why, without any other "mystery science theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a big lot near you, check that shop for an auto-tape! Another user that has happened to the LG!
