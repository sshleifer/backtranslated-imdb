I respect this honor that is a very popular show in this. However, compared to Robert Oatman's impressive, ridiculous, janie and movie classics of the 1970s, this show was probably thought to be low-middle ... even if it continued for 11 years, it is not necessarily a good one. This event constitutes a very integral part of my childhood childhood (it is run every night and guesses whose parents see it and laugh), but I do not miss one of the memories. And now I actually saw the movie, I can give the right criticism of this series. On my own, it's not nearly 10 "2 out 2" bad. However, this show's character is nothing like a movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they are the same in the name. For example, what is Alan Alda Donald Sutherland? Her style of humor is completely different as its character and perspective. New characters that are not great; They just serve to Miss Miss that you're replacing. It's the same with new actors (including Jamie Farre). Radar, the only thing that has actually been transferred to the series, is still a pale imitation of the original (though played by the same actor). What else And well A sunny track (it does not matter whether or not it is used in the surgery scene), it is strange because of what is happening in other settings. And it is almost four times more permanent than the actual Korean war, but it brings the spectators to this wonderful temporary transversal which does not work outside the world of cartoons. I did not like this program, and I will never do it.
