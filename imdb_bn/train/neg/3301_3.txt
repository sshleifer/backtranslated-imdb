Today's method for Swedish movies seems to start by filling the width of the window and starting the path for the rest of the process. A very fine example of Ranbir making a film. In a very low sense <br /> <br /> Stockholm banks are being robbed by robbers by a highly skilled "military-style" gang. The two police officers started the investigation, which would soon become more complicated than it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> In the past few years MacAlle Perbrandt will be in Swedish film! But okay, I guess there are some of those parsebands that are firmly executed here (as they usually do). The problems of this movie are mostly moving around the story. All robbers first feel like most backgrounds. Rather, it is a film that has not been made more than a movie about fighting a male man's male to prove herself (i.e., rather than a modest actress instead of Sophia Helen). There is also a completely unbelievable plot point at the end which appears to be visible to the alien landing. But still, I think it was a pretty good touch, I was almost half asleep. It's a bit spicy (and actually stores the ratings from another step drop). Finally the main problem is the same with other similar Swedish movies Just that action and suspense we do not live up to the standards used in other movies like this (mostly Hollywood). It seems cheaper and rather weak than it is. According to me, Swedish filmmakers try to focus more on plot and acting and forget about trying to create such a "Hollywood-Action Light" now. This became another forgotten effort from the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
