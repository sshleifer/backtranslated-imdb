A Blair Witch-War movie that is a bit disappointing like a bit! Save the title, save your money and your time, and spend it on a good movie such as "Once upon a time in America", "The ShowShank Redemption" or "Enemy at Gates" (If you want to look a great "War" movie Etc.) <br /> <br /> If this movie was the baseball team and the major leagues, then title and singles were Rocky, then this film was a ball in high school. It was painted as it was drawing a high school drama club with their parents' old camera. Surely they went into an unfavorable area (made in a film) but I do not call that brave, almost here we call that plain stupid! Pass all this way! Now look at it and then tell me what you think.
