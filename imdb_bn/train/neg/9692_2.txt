Bonjour Tristesse covers the same ground as 'wedding member'. Intelligent, a devoted girl tries to prevent a relationship from the structure of a beloved family member and an interloper. When I love the 'wedding member' of critics, I think Julie Harrison's junk-drag and everything in it is an audacious, scenery-champing thespian. It shows such annoying, rich idiots as Marinism last year, but this time it is a itinerary. <br /> <br /> This pre-release movie sequence develops, but not the characters. For the first 30 minutes he disagreed with the content of the relationship between father and daughter between Seborg and Nivon, which is possible to read uncomfortable sex. Once the clash is triggered, Seberg can not provide the required depth of part. Carry the rank rank and make the film 'Endless Love'. Seberg's grin statement, like something out of the strange interlude - it's not good. I really wish someone else than Niven had her role. He spent so much time in normalizing British behavior in all of his movies, he never got around the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable continuation, dance becomes free in the evening. . Bartolooki steals the entire scene for his bare exercises, 'Confucianist.' Care has hugged his hand and revealed another major pain (such as Black Narsisas, Igna, Knight of Egana, King and I, Heaven, Mr. Allison, Tea and Sympathy etc.). Really, Care was an awesome actress. I want every movie with it to end with a deadly car crash, or better, can start with one. <br /> <br /> People should be uncomfortable with ambiguity, it should be avoided.
