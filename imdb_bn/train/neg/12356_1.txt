There was a waste during watching this movie. I was tempted to leave the middle of the movie, but I oppose it. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that men in the army become stupid like men. They learn to fight in spit, humiliation and war, and this is also the waste of time (my opinion). And, however, what was the final scene of Libya? Are they still fighting against Gaddafi or is it easy to believe that Islamic people are always at risk?
