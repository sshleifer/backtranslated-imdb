Seriously crappy movie. <br /> <br /> First off, a police and a partner / furniture store starts out with his partner in the park. The "bad" police capture a girl, which they drag, in the orbit of the warehouse, when the newcomer is sitting outside the police and thinking about what is happening there. The "bad" police finally comes back with a heavy Duffel bag, and the newcomer does not think of his problem, but he still surprises what was in the bag, so he asks, he gets a bullish response and then he thinks everything Okay (for now). <br /> <br /> "Bad" Police repeats this process, even once in a sharp view (it creates a little better). But finally, people began to get caught, which took some time, f **** there was nothing. If a girl dies, then she receives a voodoo curse on her. Now, the "bad" police eventually killed this magic-protected bitch, and then he was released from Duffel-Begum's body. <br /> <br /> She had a lot of magical magicians, so she came back to the eyes of many eyes, which indicates that she could be a zombie ... Also, magic curse can be the "eye shadow monsters" of all other girls . Some girls meet a father, who is apparently a currency expert, and he offers them a ride (they apparently look normal to him). But when a girl sees a husband and another person sees other people, she is frustrated because she is very hateful (some people are scary, but others do not even notice) .... a huge plot hole. So, wrap it up, eye shadow monsters kill "bad" police, who finally end up becoming a zombie in the last scene. As if they were trying to prepare us for a signal! Anyone want to see this cow drop part 2.
