WOW if I can read it but it is to read or think about it. Believe me, see it! <br /> <br /> I have played such a part of this movie in such a tragic way! I do not believe they imposed school sign! I will laugh at that scene every time and again more and more often. If a movie like this can be made, it gives all hope of making our own films. Even the dress was bad. It looked like my 7-year-old cousin could do a good job on making it. Hack I bet he could write and work well as well. I know that I will see the second part so I can see if I was as bad as the first. It might be a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a good job has been done. Hopefully another killer comes scarecrow movie, not just like this one.
