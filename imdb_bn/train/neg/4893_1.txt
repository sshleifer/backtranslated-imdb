The movie is actually very slow. There are some nice pictures, but it's really annoying that it's not really annoying. You see many watermelons and sexual intercourse in sex during a watermelon and a little more eating. It can be even attractive to anyone, but believe me to see it for 2 hours, not all the fun. Although you may laugh several times but this is not really enough and it can be more interesting than disappointment and beyond the disbelievers. The annoying director tried to keep some movie video clips in the movie. They are probably the weird song color clips since the 50's but it's hard to just say and it's really sad that they are trying to be so funny. Several times you think that this plot may develop a bit, it is creating a powerful scene, but ultimately it is evaporated and it is evaporated. Very few conversations on the side of the clip give music alone. The director is trying to be costly and artistic at all cost. Personally I can not recommend movies. I believe art is something that should not be boring. During the projection circulation around the movie that supports my short review.
