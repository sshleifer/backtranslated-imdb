This picture tried to do a lot of things together: political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sad romantic comedy, family pricing ... The list is underway. It failed miserably at all of them, but in the end it had enough interest to save me from closing it. <br /> <br /> Although I admire the soul behind War, Inker, it is hard to see me, especially in terms of poor writing, instruction and the production of this particular film, due to its lack of serious criticism, its goals Will be. <br /> <br /> Criticizing the war criminals will be criticized. But this way of fun reduces the real torture of this incident. Remind me a bit of the three kings, which likewise neglects a real cause for concern.
