Ireland tourists travel to school to learn about drudies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the film is dead Elive, Evil Dead, the wrong one is united. It is very bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep an eye on it that nobody will see it lose "fun". The film has many random "awful" nudity ... although there are four porn stars, even four stars, so much more can be done. Reproduction also showcases a good amount of Gore. <br /> <br /> Evil Bread with ridiculous dialogue and awesome acting has been a terrific start. It is directly offered in a video horror film, but it takes a cake. I really do not understand the main character, since the "living" woman in the end is not really the movie. To say the end, it will be the most random and stupid end in film history. It does not have any purpose with the rest of the film and changes the film's fullest perspective. <br /> <br /> You must watch this picture to believe in it, because there are some great death scenes. I have two death scenes in my mind, of which the genital killer has broken the gut from inside a nude woman through her chest .... yes in her chest, do not ask me. When another ID gets its intestine, again, it ripped out through its asshole again. Does that kill people? No, the man hugging the man with his own intestines. In this scene, I have reminded me of the dead and the dead, each one has the right amount of humor. I got the idea of ​​Evil Dead, with scary movies and the uninterrupted mention of Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is shouting for her life, she is trying to cheer with the killer; E. <br /> <br /> <br /> While poor and nudity is not enough for poor audio and visual film quality. When the teacher wakes up from his bed and walks through the stairs, loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly pushing him down. Indeed distracting. Along with the same murderer with the murder of the film continuously? As well as any character who died at the moment. I could not tell about breast implant chick Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I can not remember. Random naked chick with a dead baby hanging from his body as well, still attached with the nervous cord. <br /> <br /> The terrible edits are confusing as well, opening credits are very fast and unconscious. It got a bad start and got better, but eventually the film brings back an awesome level. Perhaps if this film has good production value and more faith, then it has not been severely killed. Stay away from this movie, unless you're happy with the bad budget's horrible bad movie with the budget below.
