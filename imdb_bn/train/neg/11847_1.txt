I am amalled at how bad this film is At the beginning of the 20th century, Hollywood artists set up a new location - even the Modernes or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock and even I did not even think that I'd see a movie worse than them. 2. They have a slightly different millennium & duration Yet the purpose and the results were sadly the same. <br /> <br /> The first awesome cast is: Eddie Ejardad as Chaplin? please forgive? Peter, do you give some of this man? Jennifer Tilly as Louella Parsons ?? Kirsten Donst as Marans Davis ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even try to capture the appearance or word of their description. Well, the last picture show was a decent movie, but it's a disaster and the rest of the pictures of Bogdanivich have not been much better. Wells and Hit and Ford have been infringed objectionably long ago. Even though TCM is still good for hosting.
