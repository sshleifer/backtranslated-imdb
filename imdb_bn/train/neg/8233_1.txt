This was probably the worst movie, seriously. I could actually do myself well, it was not set up properly. This movie was like a $ 5 budget and was left with a change. Do not see it. I did not get all the way through this movie, it had to stop. I gave it 1/10 because the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but it turned out to be a bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of that car went after them. I saw that a girl in the bits was saying that girls loaded off taking all their clothes, what the hell? It will be some kind of fat porn movie as well.
