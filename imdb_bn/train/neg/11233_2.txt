As far as I can tell you, despite the previous comments posted by other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. I found it just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's worth a DVD label and I'm paying 98 cents and the gross total tax for it. I found it at 98 cents of plastic bowl and disposable chopsticks rack. Now you have not been able to attach the BUO coup bucks for the limited edition version of the Swedish import importers like you ??? I think so. <br /> <br /> This image was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I might start to argue with you. But clearly the price of 98 cents. And remember that you are talking about paying for that. For slashher film mavens only.
