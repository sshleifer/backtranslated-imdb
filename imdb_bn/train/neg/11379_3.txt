When I saw a small scene of it in some announcement, I found it to be entertaining to watch the show. The small robot guy kinda look cute. Animation styles look familiar in some classic shows. Before the show was presented, I studied it through a few sources. There, I became a little disappointed. Three children (Tommy, Guus and Lola) are in a loud voice, but Robotab is an exception. It has been much inferior if he is portrayed by a young boy. Robot Jones, Robot Jones is a good example of a robot character "Anyway with Robot Jones?" The show is not really bad. But my only criticism of portraying robotbike on the way. So, I'm not seeing it a lot.
