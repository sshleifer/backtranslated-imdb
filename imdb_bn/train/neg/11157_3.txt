Hip Sexual stimulant Wicked sexy ... whatever. It was the "Terminator" breaking down. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. Police rescue the girl from a big giant (waitress!) And calls herself a 'protector'. Chief actor Ryan Aloosio has done a wonderful job of imitating Kyle Rice ... There is a massacre in a predecessor ... Bad guy's muscles with red eyes ... and also you talked about "You said it yourself, he will never stop. No. "The terrible script comes from the screenwriter for the first time, who has thanked God, did not sell anything from it, and it's all bad Phridamyanera director Richard has managed to throw together. <br /> <br /> The image opens on the strip bar (always a good sign), and an average looking biker guy follows by three police, bursts for no apparent reason. One of them is black, and (shock horrific!) He was killed in the first five minutes. After the next hour or so, the image is reduced, then begins to take some pictures of some decent steps, and it ends up to the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, willing to sit for the appropriate actors, which is a bad script and which is less than the director. If they do not do anything else, they learn to learn how to work in this movie and Aloesio, some supporters show signs of talent, including cast. Cain Holder, starring in his human form, is famous for numerous screenshots of Jason Bharishish in 'Friday 13th'. She is not sophisticated enough, especially she is not used to say the role. <br /> <br /> It has become famous among horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bougert and Sasha Williams, who closed her kit. The former 'Power Rangers' actors' grand tradition couple times. And it is weirdly clear that the editor spent a lot of time in that scene ... However, the main incognito feature is the effect of physical fiddle rather than good, and the wolf design is not bad at all. CGI Bad Just plain bad. I seriously say, if you can not reach some level of reality - why bother? Just throw a little extra money into make-up! Apart from horror scripts, this movie has its moments, many of which are funny funny If you are not good at anything, it's good for laughing, but do not spend any money on it. Please
