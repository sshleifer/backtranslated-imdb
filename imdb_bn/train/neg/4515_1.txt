The "piece cake" is the Almighty, the worst type of revisionist history, whose only point is to destroy it properly (fictitiously fictional) pilots' fame. It left a tremendous bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> In March 1989, "Biman Monthly", Roland Beamant strongly condemned the way to illustrate the RAF fighter command in the Mini series of TV. Some of his comments are worth repeating: <br /> <br /> "Any squadron I saw at any time that there was no sense of defeat at all, and there was no total absence in the Lawsuit described in the cake." It's a moment to bear it It would not have been ... ... the existing environment in a good rugby club was even more similar, although there was no more discipline, even death or glory was not. RAF stressed the training It was that we were there to protect this country, and now we have to do it - and not much less. <br /> <br /> "Talk about bravery" or "ugliness" - people were disappointed or not - but mostly They did. But we knew the fear, recognized it among ourselves and each other, to control it in our enmity, and then got along with the work ... <br /> <br /> "I feel no 'glory' Can do ', but O greatness was a sense, and none of this was a little similarity to 'cake cake'. <br /> <br /> There was Beant, in his own words, "There was a warrior pilot who was unlike a writer and producer of the latest TV series, at that time". <br /> <br /> Both of the 87 squadrons in Beamant France and Bouquet became the main producers of typhoons and earlier Tempest, and a post-war pilot pilot. <br /> <br /> "Cake of the cake" was an absolute, total misrepresentation while piloting the pilot's command during the presentation. This is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace ...
