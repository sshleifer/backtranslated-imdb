This show is that incredible. . . What it represents and what it focuses on and on. . . The word can not be described how insane E. They will report something. If a celebrity is even directly involved in the story indirectly, the ET will report it. They will report a dog's rope in Tom Cruise's garden. If a celebrity dies. . . At the end of the week they will talk about where celebrity envy is public. If a celebrity is judged. . . ET will eventually report it to Munthas. This show will show no end and no time frame will focus on any story. Even validation reporting is considered? Reports are very annoying, very strong, strong voices and a sense of importance with an unnecessary break. I can not see this show without questioning the existence of humanity. It is a common reason I generally avoid pre-evening show. I'm sorry that IMDB can only offer the lowest one star rating and is not zero, even in Negative. For this show -10 stars deserve.
