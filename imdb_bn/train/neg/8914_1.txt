I had to stop to see this picture (a disguised-film-intensive product for a chaotic film viewer) Twenty minutes in it because it was fair and neutral enough to inspire loud, it was not mentioned that I was soon tired of $ 3.99 tears Blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's acting and her wildly slavic accent are terrible enough for a set of gritting teeth. I knew that it would be two hours more than two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are strikingly played by some talent unremarkable actors. Although we have talent issues, Bruyer's extraordinary assistant seems to have come out of the local acting document. He clearly did not learn his craft. In fact, he's really quite terrible. All the public views looked at the stages, with their extraordinary walking mechanically about their best. Turning off this film was far more satisfying than it turned on. Do not rent this terrible movie. You'll be sorry to spend your money.
