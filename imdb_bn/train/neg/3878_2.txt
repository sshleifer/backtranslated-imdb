In the 1950s, primarily due to the scientific concept of traveling outside the orbit of the Earth, humans can not transform into a monster, and the first film to use it was the only modest scientific-film, "Astronuat Returns to Earth as a Changing Monster" concept to use the QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT. So the idea of ​​returning unrealistic plot was destroyed from the beginning. The helpless mailing man looks like the plots are at the very least of his problems <br /> First, this is an incredibly bad movie. Budget single figures and I'm not talking about lira dollars. There is no cinematography to speak and there are countless editing blunders. For example a photographer takes his (rarely legal) model for a photo shoot. Cut a shot where the sun is directly behind the model, then cut the photographer shot where the sun is directly behind its back, then the sun cut back to the model where the <br /> <br /> The budget also drags the film down to other aspects. According to the triangle page, the budget was so low that producers were unable to get any stock footage from Saturn, so astronaut Steve West noted that the footsteps of Saturn's Sunrise show how beautiful it is. Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance of the film, since human actors will not be employed in a porn studio. If I had been in it, I would not be scared by the anonymous giant - I was afraid of splinters from the rest of the cast. Perhaps we should be forgiven for a bit, though the obvious lack of budget reveals itself in actors wearing their own clothes. For example, with a medal he does not wear his fine dress uniform - he is wearing a denim jacket and baseball cap <br /> <br /> A film like this should have the suspension suspicion but it fails on every level. The tone started very early in this movie, where Melty escaped from the hospital by killing a nurse. Instead of calling on the police for the murder, Dr. Nelson decided to monitor his patient's own self, because he looked for a missing cats. It is strange that a strange violent demon can walk down the street without any person's attention, but it is the model of a movie where the 70-year-old people disestablish their cars in the dark streets in the dark streets, and people honestly mention that their wives Pregnant saying to say that the police have a giant on the loose <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > I understand why people enjoy this movie because it has reached the height of "it's too bad", but sometimes it's not much more than a very guilty bliss beyond Rick Bucker's dominant make-up effect
