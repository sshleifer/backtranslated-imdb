Having seen versus before I was high expectation for Alibhai. The movie behind the DVD jacket is committed to the description. Not alive. Very slow development Possible Load with Cast and Cool Visual The court was chic but the moneylend did not offset the build up. The end can do much more. Movies are mostly "almost sitting". To make it clear, to sit three of us and see this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were finally going to struggle for it. It really needs more shock components. If you are looking for an Achi killer or a type of battle, load some dollars and frustrations for yourself.
