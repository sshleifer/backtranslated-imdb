The real movie, Man of Snowy River, I saw the best one, almost perfect. A Lady and Trans Sense Two senses - Rich Girl / Poor Boy, and Power vs. Blood Pressure. However, this series is not merely a shameful attempt to capitalize the good name of the original, but it is ridiculously ridiculous, that too much Disneyfied zodiac is summarized as "Rambo Matt the Black Stallion". Without the charm of black stallion. The young hero comes back from the lack of 3 years, and suddenly he's the Superman on the horse; In the original, good movies, he was real and credible, but sadly, Segal was reduced to a curiosity. I have rarely been disappointed in a movie, and occasionally this thing has made me angry - they rarely miss the clip. Brazil audience manipulation - The head of the studio thinks that you have to have a beautiful horse in front of horses and boycott audience? A movie is a zombie.
