Adrian has just left this shelter, has become rich and has no parents, his life seems empty. One day, he met Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother's mother had fallen. Interested in earning some money, Gonzalo Adrian helps his life and his parents to search from anywhere. It is a film from a new director and it is quite clear in most of the movies: Scenes are not properly directed, conversations are a bit strong, there are some inconsistencies in the script ... However, the finishing process is done very well (well, just a little) and that little save the film Do it. The actors are familiar and with great quality, however, they are not inspired to make the movie attractive interesting; All their other films made good papers. The film will have boring results and will probably spend most of the time in how much time you will pass it. Of course there are mostly bad movies, but sure enough, many are good.
