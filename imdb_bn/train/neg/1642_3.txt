A few months before the release of this film, you see it in all types of print media advertisements, so I slowly waited for the release of his video that what was the campaign. After the end, my travel companion apologized for the capture of VISI for the last one and a half hours to watch this horror movie. This essentially fails because it is a character-based movie about characterless characters. Amanda Pitt's possible exception (whose only compensationable quality is Amanda Pete) you can not stand them anymore. The film relies on its dialogue which is physical, neutral and crude. The only funny character is Eric, whose picture of the only married member of the film has died. The final twist, designed to make you smile to the three main characters, only inspired similar to similar to Pete instead. Above all, rent only if you are frustrated or have a sense of humor.
