Rookie suffers so much. There are random musical tracks included in the film, enough scopics to blur long scripts and Jerry Lewis. Nunan and Levit do not know just leave. The story finally takes the whole hour before reaching the main plot and the letters are broken by letters. Then people started playing the Japanese sailors with mental racial jokes of the day. Nunan and Levit fool are playing intelligent Japanese boys when the most fun part of the movie is shameful. However, after two behind the switch in the set of characters and after the switch gets tedious. Then it suddenly ends. Even a nude in a towel can not even save this from Julie Niemer. <br /> <br /> There is really a little sheen in the movie and it is more than half long. The story of flounders with trying to set up the funny situation and fail failed. Martin and Lewis Sticks. At least Dwayne was screaming and Jerry had an animated face.
