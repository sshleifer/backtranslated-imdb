I just finished reading a book about dealing. This movie was terribly wrong. They got a list of names and just like everything is up to the top. Her robbery and camouflage were well planned, down to second - when there was time, they did not have the money left or they left. They had their notes on every road, where they had to travel. Purvi never saw her in the restaurant, after the dealer was paid for the dealer's food. He never killed sub-dealer before the death of Pai Dealing, only his picture. The way his gang member died was fictitious. The dealer never looted a bank by himself, as he did in this movie. If I did not read the book, maybe I could enjoy the movie. There was a bit at the top of the acting place. The action was overdone as well. In the second thought, even if I read the book I doubt whether I enjoyed it much.
