The animation was good, the picture was good, although not the whole original, but the story was too long, very confusing and top dramatic. About an hour later I could not wait to get over. There is no part of the characters that contribute to the plot and do not have any part in the plot, and the film was not really a movie, and it was better than a short series or perhaps two movies. If you like this kind of simple story, you would love it, but in truth, I have been flawed with more creative stories that can actually say a few message messages. Hire a Miyazaki movie and see it twice, you will find more ways than this.
