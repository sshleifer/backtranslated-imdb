This is a remake of a made TV and unreasonable Saifee Channel Baufful story, especially after the recent 2005 film "Bauolff and Grenelle". This film did not really reach the story of Baulef, but through his war against the strange beast known as Grindell, we let him leave a state in full fear and turmoil, when powerful Buddhist warrior, Baufful, called for their salvation. Monster's rampage. If it is done successfully, then the king will not have to sacrifice anymore to survive. After some unsuccessful attempts, it is lethal, but it attacks anger and vengeful mother soon, she goes to Buffef, again, has the power to defeat her mighty courage and strength. Looks like "Greenleal" it was shot in a small budget and CG effects are terrible. I said that this movie is absolutely inappropriate.
