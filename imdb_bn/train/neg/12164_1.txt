This movie is not good. The first had sucked one, but it was outstanding to see it. There is nothing in it. There is zero fear, zero tension or doubt. This is not a horror movie. Do not show anything There is no talking. It can be almost a TV, except for nudity and slight violence. Not very good acting, is not it. Do not start me and dialogue for the wonderful completion. Wonder, there is not one. I think it might be worse, though I do not see how. But again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I guess it's a good idea. It is obviously the cut version of the film. I found it very cheap, but it is still not worth it. If you want to disable more graphic versions, see the Anchor Bay version. : Unhappy campers get a big fat from me 1/10. If you have seen this movie you will probably be an indifferent and unhappy camper. If you are a real fond, you can take the Sleepway Camp (with survival kit) of Anchor Bay. Special features
