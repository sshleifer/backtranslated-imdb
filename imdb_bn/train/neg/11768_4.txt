This reboot is very good for Annie Lee, but rarely like a processed McDonald's food compared to the 2003 "Incredible Huck". <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The HLK" is a comic book movie for the thinker. Hulk takes some time (about 40 minutes), but when he sees the conflict in our hero's core. He tries his best to lose control, but he admits that when he gives his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Compare it to Edward Norton's celebration, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and whenever he is excited and his counter-rate hits 200 bits per minute (not 183, not 197, exactly 200). To these critics, it was felt like the introduction of mid-clonians to Phantom Menace, which says that how strong "forces" can be, such as the mysterious powers of blood tests can be estimated. In the 2008 film, All Ed Norton's Bruce Banner will have to keep its counter-rated under 2005, such as keeping an eye on a device wrapped in his wrist. And for losing records, it is very difficult to lose more than 200 ducks, especially for those with physically fit people running very easily. <br /> <br /> Emotions lead to the hull of E. Rik Bana. He remembered the death of his mother and suppressed his father's role in his early life. He is calm, patronized, but there is a lot of anger when it runs out of Hilk's fuel. But the dictator did not even deliberately even kill his attackers. In most cases, he just wants to go away from Betty Ross (Jennifer Conley). He kidnaps his missing people and in a critical view, a warrior jat, after being confronted by him, preserves it. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, there are visible effects but necessary. The action scenes (and they have lots of) are needed for the plot, in contrast to the 2008 film where the action step is inserted. <br /> <br /> This is a "harmful" story in her search, losing focus on how Bruce Banner feels about Ed Norton Hughes. To him, the hazard is a dangerous side-effects that have a tremendous effect on the test. And director Louis Leiterier, directed by Ed Norton's couture, failed to add any emotional dimensions to banner-hl relationship. The story can be summarized: the banner is followed and takes lightning, the banner is followed, and the hick kick ball. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> What happened against the 2003 film is not true for comic books as the 2008 edition. However, although I'm a comic fan, I like a movie which is not true for comic fiction as a fan, but comic-loyal but created and encouraged by the 2008 version is heartwarming at any given time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps more and more comics will be read. Iron Man, released in 2008, is a perfect example of a film that is true of its comic book roots and heart.
