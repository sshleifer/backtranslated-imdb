I have seen this movie, and hope to do something good for the whole time. So great about a guy with no passion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex's passion for anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that her boy is the only reason she lost her mood (if you can call it), I can get it. <br /> <br /> The letters are used, given enough time to understand the relationships are not. In one scene Sarah says she will not fall in love, and the next time we see her how she really stopped her death, because she was so close? Lots of logic synapses in this movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like someone watching Boogie Night and wrote this part similar to the Little Bill. A scene where he "spoils his mood" Even Little Bill shoots up to his wife's facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Messi was good to portray a person without any emotion - went there - can you call Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This movie was not only emotionally lacking, it lacked substance, had a good script, improved character, and a plot. And it certainly lacks my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ a ~
