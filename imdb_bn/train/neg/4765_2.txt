While developing the original, this cheap rebuilding sensitivity is fully designed to shock. Instead of complex plots-twists, this so-called thriller suddenly shows strange and seemingly random story changes that disintegrate it with only every stimulus development. Replacing the worst, original spicy dialogue, is a flip-floping slotshake opposite the unnecessary four letter words, which is a star, but leaves a tasteless taste. <br /> <br /> The promise was - unfinished promise. Michael Caine hoping of pulling off Keller-to-Sullivan graduation like a patty doc is scary. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor took the role of this reputable review program and then ruined his fame, and then showed expertise only when comparing Jude Law to the amateur period. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the classic roots, then ignore its date view and Geime. Find it, watch it, and enjoy just one story. As remac, the original passes on this insult.
