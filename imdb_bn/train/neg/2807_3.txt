Michael Calan thinks that a ridiculous photographer, however, regarded him as the perfect "catch" by any woman across; Does this film have something to do with this co-production? He is a "hero" with whom it is very difficult to surrender, so the film is in trouble from the very beginning. However, its problem does not end there. This is the price of a TV-movie production (see the soil made of soil or the soil made in the end), and by no means the last fraud that I can not reveal, if anyone wants to watch movies (very unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we know that he knows. (* 1/2)
