... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, do not hire this movie. If you want to see a documentary-esquier "Hood Life" you are also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a ridiculous piece of film, it's a real winner! The acting paper is flat as a piece. The best example of this is definitely investigating by the officer investigation. I can say that he has voiced the 911 operators as well as the flat voice of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh yeah, and "zombies" are their best serpent impressions which are equal to acting in their rough acting (note sarcasm ... how does this win an Oscar for Best Oscar) Quiroz ...... has not any kind of instruction. I felt that I saw pieces of a reform time (this time is more like the LA of 1990), but this instruction, though, I have never thought of the movie being best scripts. I did not hear these beautiful lines, such as an epic "F ** k!" Like the word beginning with "Ice Grill" which was another "city" thriller. This works only with the epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs! After all, what did you expect from a movie entitled "Living Dead's Hood"? I hired the movie to laugh at every scene with the whole scene, and the boy was delivered and more! I'm just saying that people who want to go together in a bunch together and want to laugh in the dark budget for the night (yes right ...). A memorable experience to make sure!
