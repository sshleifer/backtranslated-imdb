A potential 10 out of 2 stars - and that's being too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how could it be missed. I was wrong <br /> <br /> I just wondered what Sam Shepard had dribbled the drugs during the weekend. I suspected for a long time, Sam. Based on his game, this picture confirmed, confirmed it. <br /> <br /> This type of artist bs.s. It gives them an opportunity to make their endless emot as the actors love to sink their teeth. However, there is nothing to love about this film for the spectators who are sitting through this nonsensical trash. <br /> <br /> You have not seen the failed families until you see this group Crazy mad, mother mad, boy crazy and girl, oh, crazy. There is a word of mouth on them, which will make a sailor, especially a teenage girl, especially girls. <br /> <br /> The above was not enough, plots - and it is so thin you can read it thoroughly - it has a hole Alaska size. <br /> <br /> The mother is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. Get it as it happened. Now I do not claim to be a real estate expert, but for the last time I have checked, the ownership of the property should be owned by the ownership of the property. If only the property is owned by them, then the other can not legally sell it, so it will be absurd for the person. Mr. Shepherd likes to ignore this fundamental fact and therefore, his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is for watching if they are totally disappointed to see James Woods full naked nudity and I can not imagine That's why someone wants to do it.
