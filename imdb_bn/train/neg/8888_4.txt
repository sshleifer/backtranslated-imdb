I have the basic instinct of 2 high ratings, yet that movie got less than a rating 4. This image got me just 4, but it has received 7.3 out of more than 600 people. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is annoying, because it rarely lets those rooms in the broken big room drop out. And there are 5 people in this movie. It is almost unnecessary that it is about two hours long. Dialogue is very slow and meaningless The film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch. This image can be shortened in just a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of "how three times" directed by Hauseo Hassien, which is equally annoying, conversations are equally annoying. It has a high rating! I had to stop seeing after the first story was over. <br /> <br /> This picture lacks passion or tension.
