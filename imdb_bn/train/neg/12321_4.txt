I hate to read a long article hoping to find a point and be disappointed, I would say first of all this movie was terrible. Cruel terrible. And not, surprisingly for the reason mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him, because he gave the film his qualification, but sadly he was upset on reading what he had said. I'm ashamed to accept the same thing as one who said, "I obviously lack beautiful women". First of all I would say, "Wow! Certainly there was something serious to be reviewed deeply. My mind does not understand philosophical music about this film very little." Seriously though, the lack of "handsome women" should not be considered essential for a movie. If you are frustrated enough for "beautiful women" you must see other types of films, which certainly do not fall into the science-fay section.
