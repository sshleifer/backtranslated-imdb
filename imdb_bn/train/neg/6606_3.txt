Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, watching this movie, I had a lot of fun, <br /> <br /> This is a movie with a stupid cast and silly song !!! <br /> <br /> unnecessary songs !!! Mehboobba ... the real contempt of the whole one Holi ... well ... it was right! Got one movie every year due to heritage !! Chad Raha Hasha Nasha Anyway ... very unapproved boca music g leh ... listening to a playboy song like silly song ... <br /> <br /> Without singing. The movie was just right with Ram Gopal Varma's own adaptation ... If you think that you like this movie then you will love this movie <br /> <br /> This film depends only on the audience and his judgment is that he thinks the total copy of the movie / She wants to hit her head on the movie seat or she thinks she is the director herself / she is frustrated and look at this movie <br /> <br /> Whatever I saw in both ways, I would like to see Ram for this disaster Congratulations to the people and misuse them ... <br /> <br /> Bachan Buban / Gabbar (Amitabh was the fun director of his movie remake which was director of the film) Ajay Devgan Hero / Veyru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Raj / Joy as Prashant Raj (Special appearance for Mehboob singing for this role) Sushmita Sen Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right, but the role of this role) Nishan Khethari Ghungroo / Basanti ( A I think it could be great if Mahalalal, such as Narisma / Thakur (Mahanlal is very beautiful ... oh sorry, Heyhehe, he was right, I can not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The movie even fails Done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got some credit cinematography from him ... 9/10 script ... 3/10 BAD scripting song ... 5/10 Movie was unnecessary, could have been better, Simple PC on the ear and will be played on iPod and stuff cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> From Syed Shah to Pakistan Ibn Ali Naqvi
