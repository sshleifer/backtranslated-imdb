This terribly bad piece of trash, directed to be racist, sexist and homophobic together, pretends to be awesome, chic and sophisticated. Outrageous performance, a clich√© raided plaplay, and the annoying side can make this movie clear. The two scenes were especially obnoxious - in which among other people, after the kiss, Shane scratch his tongue (it was really rough), and the scene where Kisses the best friend of the Eastwood Shack, who claims to be Russian. He exclaims "f ** king foreign" after he left the house! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that he did not learn more than working in older film director Greg Araki, and this film tried to descend from the stereotype of gay stereotypes and a mirror from Homophobia.
