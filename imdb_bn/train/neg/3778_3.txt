This Animated Horse keeps the flabble at least visible from low animation and some useful character development drummer ... but it stays a bit slower and the story is a little bit shaky. It is the opposite of common cowboys and it is interesting to see. Indian role, but here it seems to be considered as a political correctness rather than a correct story decision. Grade: C.
