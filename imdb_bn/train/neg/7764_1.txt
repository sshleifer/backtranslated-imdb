what is this ? A low budget sex comedy? However it is fully described in Spain. They can come up with a good idea, I mean they have done this kind of movie since the '60s. And people like them! This is not a teen comedy and a family (you do not want to go to Spain for your 12-year old watch in bed on the bed). It should be rated "R", because only 35+ people seem to laugh: I'm really frustrated, maybe I do not like gay (which is a very important part of the film). <br /> <br /> Foreign horror movies are horrific (except for Castro), dramas do! If you want to try a new comedy Talladega Night
