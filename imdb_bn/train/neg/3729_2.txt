After all, I saw this movie when I was present at a Christian Slow at the age of 7. Neglect because I was afraid out of mind. Because it was not scary, because the content was there. Combo ... I'm 7 years old. However, the cinematography was quite bad and the actress was Chacey. It's so bad that I just remembered at the age of 7. There is still one thing that hunt me, the horrible song "I wish we were all ready" where the chorus ends ... "You have gone behind". I would not recommend to see this one. I would probably, just for nostalgic reasons. Besides, I'm sure the remake is a lot better. Although the best part of this movie, everyone should be "tears"; Empty cars are broken, lawnmowers are running their own ... quite ridiculous.
