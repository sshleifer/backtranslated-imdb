I have to admit that I have caught it on the American network several times. There's just something about this, well, this is the flick's stupidity which whenever I want to see it. Yes, you are right about sub-atomic acting, plots which may only prefer seven years old etc. But I can not help the actors to be sympathetic. Then again, few of these actors signed up for even more irrational sequel.
