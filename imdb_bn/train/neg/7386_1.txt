I tried to restart the movie twice. I put three machines to see what was wrong. What is Steven Seagal's voice change? Did he die during filming and make a dub with someone in the studio whom you like? Or the word of the DVD was destroyed? After about 10 minutes, finally listen to the actor's true voice. Although the audio seems to have been recorded in the bathroom throughout most movies. <br /> <br /> If I own a copy, I would be ashamed to give a copy of this movie. I rent it, but I do not have that again. I would check this database before renting a movie of her, which was all good (low or low) movies. You usually know that you saw the movie Steven Sighal. I guess that's longer.
