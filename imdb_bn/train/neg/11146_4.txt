Well, no, not really. This is not really a good movie, but I do not think it was as bad. I do not really think ripped off my rent money, and sometimes that might all ask you. The plot is okay, nothing is brighter or new, the performance is quite bad, but the throw is nice. Instructions are portable, but the effects are terrible, especially useless effects, which are a big problem, a big problem. Nudity was a fairly decent amount, which was a beautiful thing for me, but it was not hot at all. After all, it is fairly straightforward for video films, a bad movie that I have never seen, and if you are bored of a genre fan, watch it once. I want to see it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus factor for awful gaques, why the bush (some of them Jason Vario) playing Verbabal
