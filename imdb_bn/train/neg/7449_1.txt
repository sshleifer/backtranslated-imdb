Very disappointing version of Lorna Don. Many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story lines are present in the small budget. If you are not familiar with the novel, the dialogue is very rare to understand the story. In some scenes, Lorena has a cold sore on her upper lip. I'm sure it's good to hide make-up. I guess it does not want to stop filming until it's exhaled, guess. Probably why this movie lacks kissing scenes. At the very end only one disappointing kiss scene. Lorena Dowon should say a great epic story and the truth. The 2000 version of Lorraine Don's version is double, romantic, much more enjoyable and true to the book.
