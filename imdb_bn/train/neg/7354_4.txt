As Hammer's absolutist, I wanted to spend time trying to see the movie and its followers, on the bus holiday. I watched the movie One by Bass and I saw it in some of the bad movies. It was full of horror comedy that hit British TV screens near 70. <br /> <br /> I got this shame and said that I really laughed some part of this movie. I do not know, because I was familiar with the character now and enjoyed some situations, they knew how to react. I thought that Blackie was particularly ridiculous, even though I could not swear at any of the triangle, she said, "I'll give you the butt", her coffease. <br /> <br /> Seeing the holidays on the bus, Jokes started wearing thin and compared to the three Hummer trilogy, Dick Burton, which is the best of the second movie (though this is probably the only way to compare. May). <br /> <br /> Only people who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series, who will not suspect it and Hammer himself will also enjoy it completely. I would say to the absoluteists that this film is not bad and I can certainly remember something worse than Hammer's comedy.
