Gen. Gen. Gyle (as Mary Burton), General New York, worked with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Burton) in the "Sminny's Candy Store". Mrs. Glandin was abducted by the vendor for the sale and sale of women as a slain slave, and must be rescued by Miss Gayle and her policeman Matt Prior Moore (like Larry Barke), a religiously threatened young woman. <br /> <br /> "Troubles In Souls" is a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not done extraordinary and it does not look unique to a young woman who is threatened by sexual traders "honesty". Probably, it can be supported as a movie that discusses more than the traditional length (originally claimed ten railways). New York City Location Scenes After all these years, the main attraction Panning the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because something else seems to be able to move the camera. <br /> <br /> Spirit Traffic (11/24/13) George Lane Tucker ~ Jean Gayle, Matt Moore, Atel Grandin
