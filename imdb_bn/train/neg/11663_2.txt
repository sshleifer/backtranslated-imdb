Hold white chicks, why they did not wear black girls, oh yeah, they will not be completely different. Can anyone give me a Wain movie where they do not wear clothes like women? Jack White and Michael Costanza do not count ghost, not a single mens, writes that (other Norton Trio members act as a member). <br /> <br /> Among the white girls, there really is no joke. It's just Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. There is no setup, no punchlines and no smiles. There are a lot of "I think I will play some time in crisis 3." There was at least for me (5 times to be correct). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kanye Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Sean, Damien (only talented), Kim, Rakeshas, ​​George W.K. , And Osama bin Wean to stop making movies. This only strikes the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> <br /> among the VERIDIC 1/2 * ****
