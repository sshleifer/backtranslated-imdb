All right, this movie sucks. But let's check why. Any proposed device can be converted into energy, capable of saving it and then restoring it and reconnecting it, at least it is playful. But until they take this premises. In terms of what can happen to someone who makes such a machine, they break the wonderful thing. It may have been a good compound. Responsibility of such power, and dealing with constant temptation, i.e. invisible people But no .. they break things offensive. And want to leave Lembach. Then the doctor brought Jerry-Rigs back together, and tried to transport himself. It is secret only by its beautiful but foolish secretary, (DUH). That will not happen if Lembach does not decide to leave. So now he is killing the people of the country because his little test has failed, and they will not give him money. Wow Then, to make the film worse, to put it into two British semi-qualified professors, to help him drop into dry British relations. Among their loving sessions, they make several half-hearted attempts to find him while killing half of London. All of them can be broken down by suppressing the device, which never happened when it did not leave the lambak. I tried this movie so I could give it a decent 2 stars for the effort, but it would have been better if it broke the machine to leave the lamach, then tried it again. You dissatisfied Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
