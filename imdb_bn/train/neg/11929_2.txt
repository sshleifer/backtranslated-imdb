I saw this before "I" saw it. I really like "The Eye", which is one of the best films of recent Asian horror-films. So, I've chosen this "Bangkok Spooky" because it was the same director, and it was popular round here. But people, what's frustrating ... "Bangkok Hunted" Three stories about love, revenge, ghost etc., which are not frightening, even annoying ("eyes") ... nothing. I can not even fill the 10 lines required for comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% annoying <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
