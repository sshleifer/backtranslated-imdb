How can this movie be in 5.5? The first actor was really bad I mean Chainsaw Charlie was so annoyed. Because when he quickly inserted his head into a wooden house (which was nearly 1 inches thick in length (it was actually cheap as a snowflake piece of wood) and he did not even think it could break it) for the person who created the second set They sucks as * for the supply. The only good thing about this movie is this TVV concept. Show The following line does not waste your hard cash in this scenario ** They make a movie call. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 0.3
