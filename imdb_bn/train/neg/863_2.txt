I came to realize from the eerie observer, especially the genres made by Jesse Franco, which you can not expect to be a plot that makes a lot of sense. However, Franco has gone overboard with this photo; And in spite of a spiritual atmosphere, and the fame of the film as one of the best in the director - unfortunately really awful film. I acknowledge that I have seen an American cut version which runs about 76 minutes; But if it is not advisable to just add it, then I'm sure the more European version is annoying. There is something to do with a plot marauding with a woman; S & M practice and rubbish talking, and it's all really annoying. There is no roar and sexually neutral, and most runtime is taken by annoying conversations, and despite a short film; I finally had difficulty in it all the way. I say the positions look good and Franco has done a good job to use his spiritual atmosphere; But there are positive elements to end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has created some classic trash movies - but it seems that he has made it for the money and overall I recommend avoiding it and seeing the director's more interesting work.
