I saw this piece of work in a film festival in CA. My god, what is the manager thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study about what to do for a small film. First off, this project makes absolutely no sense. The film is run partly in "Weststand", in the middle, some stupid vapor bar, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> This performance is bad. Actually so bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. Reading the main actress Julia is a step down from acting in most amateur porn movies. Those who have one or two decent performances playing Jacob and Fenna, but there was no source of how the Thespian should work or use as a director. The worse thing than acting was the conversation, which bordered on the stupid. The author (whom I guess is also the director) writes each character as they audition for a comic book villain. <br /> <br /> The overall production price is quite good, but to be honest, it's easy to ignore this bad with a movie. While the weststation looks like no ordinary bar, the production design is quite good. The dress and make-up are okay, and I understand the production is working with low budget. When the characters speak, or if they try to move the plot then the film tears a cat. <br /> <br /> I said, this image is horrible to God. He has seen many movies like director / author and thrown away all the parts of Blender. My only hope is that he used this money for other people, because he used to have his knees barely kneeling.
