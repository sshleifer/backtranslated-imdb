This is certainly one of the worst films produced and released by a big Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in the cliche; You can complete a great many sentences for this reason. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron's. "Choreography" is silly and totally stupid. One can only please the critics who saw the dance of 23-year-old Evan as sexual; It's just a very bad dancer Ballet scene is particularly laughable at the beginning of the film. If you live in bad movies and enjoy some Turkish tricks in Turkey, it's for you. I bought a color version of VHS, which made the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, looks like a shoe all his time. And he is the best part of this photo. What is a way to start a career?
