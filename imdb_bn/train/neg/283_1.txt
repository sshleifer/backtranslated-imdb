For the film, this movie feels like one of the school specialties, only a low budget and everything else is less. I guess it was considered to be an inspirational film, but it did not work for me. Such a preacher. There is a very pale shade of flash dance, but what is it? There is no excitement in this movie. The dialog is linked and associated with death. Of course, the whole movie looks like a bad 80. There was much to do with acting (or not in this case), though acting was less than starter, though. Its poorer music choices, on top of it, all actors feel embarrassed for really bad lyrics.i. They are all talented, but you can not tell from this movie. It's just my opinion, but I must believe a flying AKA dream 1/10
