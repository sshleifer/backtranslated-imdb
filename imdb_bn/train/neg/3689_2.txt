In its later stage, the main aspect of the superstar movies was frequency, one movie and the next, Lacuna. Being a well-known star of South Indian film, the opinion that she received in front of Babur was great. <br /> <br /> From Nattukku Oru Nalvan (1991), in 11 years, acting as a huge hero of Tamil, his number was only 11 in 1 year. All of this was a great hit. Many thoughts that he was an image could not easily be brought down. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappaar (1999), he went to a state of hebrionation. His fans around the world, especially South India, were ready to watch any movie with their superstar. So, the Tamil film industry decided to bring Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker thought that fans will accept what they see with the superstar. But this clearly does not work in this movie. Naturally, the media campaign and the expectations from the fans were also out of bounds. <br /> <br /> Photo of Rajinikanth was completely damaged. The fans went to the nuts. Do not meet the expected level of the movie's collection. The honor of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this movie was A and Rehman's song. Rehman seems to have composed good music for many bad films such as Taj Mahal, Kadal Virus, Ali Arjun, Pathhel Parsam, Star, N Sosa Qatar, Hankikolai Chinaras etc. I never thought that this film would join the league. <Br /> <br /> You feel very sad because the movie was not bad, because it's going down the superstar image. It completes five years to return completely to Chandramukhi and Shivaji, and they return what they want in the superstar movie.
