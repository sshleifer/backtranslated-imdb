This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / animal flick. Prehistoric genes are made of a deno cross while manipulation amok. An engineer, Croak initially murdered himself and then got the taste of the man and became a fast-growing terrorist after fleeing. No characters have any depth, but then they are not focal points. We got only a few of the dwarf dinosaurs and only a few small budget movie's best "deadly" scenes. <br /> <br /> A Moroccan character trying to use three of my favorite scenes. Dogs and croc food for rattan become yourself. There is nothing left on the top feet of the heel but the heel. With no real stand-out role: Jane Longdener, Bruce Waitz and Charles Napier. Matt Borlenghi and an overwhelming professional cross-hunter Costas Mandylor is the most kind. Dr. P. I was lonely to Joan Paquula because of the fear of panic like Dinokrok.
