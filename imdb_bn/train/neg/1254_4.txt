I've seen and loved the original movie, and more than expected from a remix. <br /> <br /> Good: Effects and makeup are good. There is no complaint about scores and visuals, they are adequate, and performance was fine (Team Roth was nice, other princes were good and "supporter supporter actor" was very good with a very limited role in hand). The action scene was exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: Escaping from the city of Cape City was horrible. Characters are going on in circles, then suddenly there are tunnels to escape in some places in the middle of the city. Plus, everyone's bedroom will run the way? <br /> <br /> The story was brought down to include as many possible measures as possible. I liked the action scene but the original film had more meat for it and more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally the end was completely irrational. Without inevitable sigs, there is no argument for this. <br /> <br />
