This movie is seen by all fans and even the theater in Bangkok, it sadly failed. <br /> <br /> The visual story writer does not just hold water. Some were definitely missing. In my opinion, why can they see any other reason than the historical historical past? The accuracy of history is not what we look for entertainment. <br /> <br /> there is no substance in the film. The only way to fix this film was to change it in any way where it stood as a legend rather than a story. And there is a legend some elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten about time, such as self-sacrifice, nationalism, etc. are called central themes. <br /> <br /> The movie failed, answer, why would I see it? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, psychic kings, or bright kings like "King and I" were appealing to make a movie appeal. I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> Once got the appeal, the story is the next thing that we paid attention to. In the marketing terms, we call it "must see." People will say, oh, I can certainly see it. Now where is the appeal of the kingmaker? Why not restart the title and call it, "How will you not be a king?" And in the style of "Dr. Strangelove" make a black comedy of old Siamese days. That has been a lot more interesting. Experiences like the description of the King from Fayebel in the first person made the movie very interesting. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < If they do not have familiar characters, but some other films such as Island, when the ad is asked "Do you still believe that there is an island?" For <br /> <br /> or movie, "How to not be King" can be questioned again, "So do you still want to be king?" <br /> <br /> <br />
