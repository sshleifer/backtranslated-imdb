There is no comedy in this film that lives with a family member with a mental illness. So many scenes remind me very graphical of my own life experience. This movie was a human version of "Mummy Derstick". It graphically and accurately illustrates life goes through many children through a mentally ill parent. It shows how easy it is for a psychologist to be corrupt and to act like God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No, I say! It is a good sick humor. <br /> <br /> The movie was so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the house. The best use for this movie is not to understand mental illness or for people who do not believe in the family we live in.
