Dear my ... Peter Vendors were the most amazing talented actors. However, after 1964, his films' choices were very sad. She does not understand how to use her talents. She has done better off working with more Kubricks in the film world than the people of the world. Among his next films, "The Amnestyst of Nine Elms" and "Beijing Athlete" saw me that saw me. <br /> <br /> Earlier, Bollywood and vendors made some pictures. I still have to see "Carlton Brown" and "Above the Cave" - ​​that's too bad that's bad! - In the sense of using good sellers at least a degree. However, "My Girl in Year Soup" is a terrible choice in the seller's part in terms of really poor films and characters. In his films since 1955-64, you can generally expect at least some very innovative bouts and a mysterious firm belief in his roles. Here, you are trying to play a common romantic lead, there are Peter Sellers. It's a vendor playing around a cavity without joviality. He is certainly not satisfied, try as he is, or made an interesting character. He concentrated on such parts as Kari Grant's healthier owners and he was famous for the playful dramatic and ridiculous roles. <br /> <br /> Haun and vendors do not actually establish any real chemistry; This simple, genial romance is not just like William Powell and Mirna Laoy. It's a very artificial way, in all ways - I know that it is part of the character of the dancer that she is a dry collector of women, but she does not really change in what she strongly believes. Vendors are also a great way to play "charm" ... this character actually has no depth, and does not gain the sympathy or interest of the audience. When anyone does not think possible to remember the "lolita" incarnation, the vendors go through the speed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of the most animated, confident, confused and light sham films I have ever seen. The incompatibility of a "car" for the unelected competitors of the vendor. <br /> <br /> Ratings: - * 1/2 / *****
