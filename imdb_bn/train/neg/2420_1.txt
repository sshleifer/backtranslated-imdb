I usually comment on movies I like, "Everyone's own taste", but here I want to make an exception. Basically, this film, which seems to be lost in shambles, has the right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry and disrespect their own friends. Have children Even for cultural sanctions sanctioned, they do not have the courage and do not have the responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they set in motion. After all, "love" is all that important, is not it? Hell with everyone else. Whether things "end up working" or not really points; In fact it is quite irrelevant. The point is disrespect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a position of reliance, this is enlightened by the film and is strengthened by it. This "parents" can behave a lot more innocent, which can defeat an army of social workers from their employees frustrating.
