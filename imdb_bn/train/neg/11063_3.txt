Please have 'Hat' to tell you to inform me, please stay away from 'Dahamara', biography based on the real life story of the serial killer. 'Dahmaar' does something else related to the mentality of his attitude. Jeffrey Dahmar, who killed more than 15 men and ate some part of their body, was probably the most inconsistent serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick people tested these heads of horror filmmakers before deciding to take a green discussion of this awesome 'dhma' project. It is not an easy film to digest, although Jeffrey easily likes it with some shiny 'brainless' appetizers or even some real life' m. Potato peas'. * Failure
