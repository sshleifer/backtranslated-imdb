I'm a black man living in a mainly black city. That said, I have some big misgivings about Tyler Perry's work. I understand that some people feel the need to appreciate him, because he is trying to illustrate a positive image about black and culture. But, I genuively believe that Perry was White, the film had all the donkeys in her film NASSP, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson. <br /> <br /> I was forced to see this film in the whole hell and to make my blood feet look like every repetition. Characters are poorly written and played. Junk is so bad, something I would actually say is supposed to be fun. I'm just breaking this big piece of sh-t. <br /> <br /> Meda = Suction Characters may have some appeal, but it does not exist anymore. When he thinks that the only thing that is torn around children and threatens adult with violence, he is less than worthless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If a husband was so scared of her husband's death, then why would she sleep asleep? Will he try to escape? It does not have much knowledge to leave when she was working. At any rate, the letters of this pressure were so annoying and overwhelming that I hope he will throw her away from the balcony and when she does not do it, she laughs royally. <br /> <br /> Then there are two loved ones. When a bus driver made his round, he asked a woman harassing him. I could not believe it. I did not really believe when I agreed to go out more with him. But, how does the cake seem to be that a big man cut into a window and cut ten year old notes with the fantastic Mega Beach. I do not use this word lightly, but the woman had only two modes. Morose Hunting and Psycho momma However, what was shown in these two faces was inevitable. The bus driver is not going to get any She even married her in addition to sampling - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is family reconciliation scene. Here we have the mother who has loads of intrinsic adulterous taboos, grinding, shirtless, excessive musclebound, B-Ball, plus the ingredient for the great taste of Maya Angelou. When these kids took their boots out and called a meeting, I felt that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. All these shit reunions are going on, ridiculously in a different group, and then they ring a bell. What they are doing when they work, and they strain hardly to speak, just like Pavlov's dog pack - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the film. In it we manhandled the abusive drunk by his long time and almost all the bad actresses. Black people are dressed like angels and hanging on the roof where there is an incomplete wedding - WTF !!! So far it is the only reason to visit, without examining your threshold for pain, hope that the second villain of this story is handing her along with her ass. Guess, it does not happen. Instead, Perry takes a challenging way out of the test and makes it safe, filming the movie in the vowel - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm sure if a day is given, it's probably the movie that I can write doctoral laboratory in any way. Do not even start with me in the rest of the film, Tyler Perry. I'm just going to say this. In my opinion, as a black guy, D.W. Griffith's Legacy Life The mockery is that it is being done through a black guy, who would appreciate to sell our rivers for the nation's birth. I just wanted the Perry movie, so I could jump them in the nut. Thanks a lot, buddy !! Are you going to follow it in 2009, a comedy about rape of slaves and barbarous threats in colonial America?
