Despite the admiration of the adapted version of the DVD, the film was frustrating. Yes, it is much more realistic than the other war movies in the time of describing the mud, ugliness and frustration of despair, but unfortunately, anyone thinking about this film should step away from it. There is no plot and dialogue is boring. It's not that a good fight film will require a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best movies in World War II, "Baro O Luc Hai," is a very small step. But it also compensates with crackling dialogue and stress. The "Story of GII Joe" is a part of the short war (titled "City under DVD"), held in Italy. This is one of the fastest and most intense battle scenes in a war film. But alas, the rest of the picture is not only valuable for this highlight. Another turn-off is private. Dondaro, played Wally Castle, who is called "Romo", but gets distorted. In contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if faulty, man. When Captain Walker (Mitchell) told volunteer for another Patrol, he said: "Each step is a step forward ... at home." But that last step ?? A lot of garment ?? Drive him on the emotional brink. Bad movie does not otherwise do justice to fine touch. As a picture of the artist of Maryleith Pile ... it is virtually comotose.
