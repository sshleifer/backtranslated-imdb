This film actually destroys every actress's character, which can be best described as "Potlabler". Despite this, despite its 'Active Packaged Top Gone' opening, there are plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Queen's Mexican drug-lord role was ridiculous and her 'collaborators' came out of the 1970's Quinn-Martin Police Show. Castner's character is wood and he did not give any reason to believe in falling in love with Mendes's wife. We do not believe that the wife is injured for music and coming along with her first warm body. <br /> <br /> Of course, a 'B' movie is the best and everybody involved is a lot of time wasted.
