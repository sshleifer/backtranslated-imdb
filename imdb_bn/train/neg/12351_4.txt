A woman claiming a military background commented in a recent post here, "A woman's life is not more valuable than human". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not true in history as well. Show biology. The societies have been able to recover from the serious loss of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. After the 1914-1918 war, Germany was ready for another war in Germany in 1932, of which 200,000 people died. Triple Alliance of the Battle of South America (1865), Paraguay took three neighboring countries until its entire male population was wiped out, but in 1932, Chaco fought a great war against Bolivia. <br /> <br /> <br /> Any society, but its female population may be damaged or survived. Only when the life of the nation is at risk, women are sent to fight. Israel faced the situation in 1948, but since then the Israeli soldier has never considered the quad war unit for his defense forces despite the popular image of the soldier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
