Since 1987, I do not like the idea of ​​female tortoises. We know that the TMT is named after their teacher Splintor and their enemies, with four siblings and four brothers each named Leonardo, Michael Hellio, Raffel and the great artist. Donato do not have any money here or there is no significant part on Friday and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one associated with Friday, as we do not like any story of the female turtle story. In 1987 we knew TMT we were new to each There is a good point to some steps in the enemies but there is a weak point in some actions of a female turtle, mango Rant the TMNT series want to see more new but just like the same letter we knew without the women's turtle of the 1987 women.
