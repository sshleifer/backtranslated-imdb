This picture is terrible. Characters are completely incredible, and wildly inappropriate. The plot is awful and the scenes in some classrooms are made to look cringe-worthy and uncomfortable. In fact, the quality of script and characterization will suggest that this image was written by only high school students lacking credibility in the school environment, the authors probably did not attend high school. In most cases the acting was very weak, although it had a poor script and plotted down, but I am not sure if any actor could make this film visible. <br /> <br /> The track was fine, and cinematography was great in places (though the edit was poor).
