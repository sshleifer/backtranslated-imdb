This show looks kinda well Kyra Sedgwick is a right actress and I want a series of deals, but production went somewhere wrong in this program. <br /> <br /> First, writers should be more susceptible than one, you know that it is always !!!!! That makes it annoying. The main character is incredibly annoying and it is not trustworthy in any way. I know they wanted him to be tough, but the meaning of chess, stupid and bad major. The crime is weird and bland, and its just all the way to lam. As mentioned above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> To all, it was really big disappointment and very bad ...
