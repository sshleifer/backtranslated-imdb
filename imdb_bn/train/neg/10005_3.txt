In less than 10 years, the second attempt by New York intellectuals to produce "Swedish" - the first is the result of Susan Santag's "Brother Karl" (which was made in Swedish, Swedish actor, hardly!). It was best said in reference to Oscar Wild Dickens's "old curiosity shop": "There should be a heart of stone to not laugh loudly at the death of Little Nell." There are many similar things here. "Internal" is a full-chocked hollow full chock. ("I'm scared of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am.") Bergman's quotation marks (to use godly words) around the parody. Incredibly self-involved family reminds us of how bright and talented they are at the point of horror. ("I read another poem of another day - it was - I do not know - in New York." "Oh, it was an old poem, I reconsidered it.") Far from taking care of these people, however, I found them quite enjoyable. Most of the conversations from Allen's previous films are just as funny - he only ordered his actors to play straight lines. Because of not throwing herself in the film, her daughter Mary Beth Hurt has copied all herspian ticks, absorption and neurotic habits, which made her an embarrassing stream (like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> Basic conspiracy - Quietly abnormal family with guardian mother - seem to be lifting less children from Burgman's "winter light", the basic family melodrama seems to be deceiving with a lot of existence. It comes through all the store's visual / extracellular tricks: scratching deafening a pencil on the paper, surfing the huge that dwarfs people walking on the beach. Etc <br /> <br /> <br /> Allen's next "serious" films are less embarrassing, but less entertaining. I have to take "internal". Woody has rarely made a fun movie.
