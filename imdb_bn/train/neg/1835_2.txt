Start with the script. I saw cartoons deeper than "jealousy". Anytime the characters were repeating what you saw and not the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which must be "jealous". A movie based on a joke was better to go with her. Here we are a film that goes anywhere. Christopher Walken wants to forget the bomb, especially because his character is so weak. Ben Stirler comes with a lot of good black comedy, "Flirting with disaster" and "Duplex". Make sure that "jealousy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, just total nonsense. Eligible for the rating of "jealousy", because it is content, it is frustrating. - Mr.
