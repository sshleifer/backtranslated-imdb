As a small black / latina woman, I always search movies that represent people like me and life. Of course when I saw this movie in the video store I thought I would enjoy it; Unfortunately, I do not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story is not only properly developed. The film is only dragged into over and there are many characters coming out on the screen and there is a lot to leave to contribute to the overall movie. The director used to do good work in connection with the film, I would probably enjoy it more. Sincerely, I would recommend a movie like "Victor Rising" any day. I was not only very impressed.
