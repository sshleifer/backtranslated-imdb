So this guy, George, was sitting alone at his birthday on his birthday. When George's wife took care of her son at the hospital, when she went to the house, George Bushbud gets a Gosal and loves both girls. This is not a spectacular scene because it does not really show anything. Then the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still in his room. They make him an excellent breakfast but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and he tries to poke them, but when he returns home the girls are in his house. Girls had enough with old jars and no longer want to cook for them. They both become the main psychopaths and use their little crazy game George. I love that the girls just want what they want sitting in George's house. George was not really that great of his two guests. When George said to a married man, he did not really understand its meaning. The George Family game looked like Tom Tucker. I was a whole time for the whole girls.
