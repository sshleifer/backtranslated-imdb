Tarzan's character influenced so many checks and many bad interpretations, who are expecting different versions (people like me, I mean, those who like Tarzan books like kids and always wanted a movie version that followed a few books) It should know how recent revivals are up to the stack. Some reviews of IMDb are reviewed at this point, but here are my $ .02 <br /> <br /> I have only two - pictured with the Carnegor Lambert and Disney Animated Manifesto stage. The version, which describes an interesting character rather than Edgar Rice Burrow (son of a great English couple, who raises himself and is "Lord of the jungle") after his death, was selected after bringing the Humanist back to England and his other Instead of claiming identity), he is transformed into the jungle-man's miracle of Hollywood and whose tr The idioms are his famous fascinating words, his secret ambiguity, who can not speak properly in English, his language of language junking, wine, his strength, heroism etc. The only common name for these two characters is Tarzan and both of them have a wife named Zen. Ron Eli's TV version is a subject of compromise: Like Bruce's character he speaks well English and is similar in both cultures like James Bondish and is satisfied, but he is not Lord Greystoke and no Zen. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the third section of the Tarzan films, and I hope this is a terrible cause for a division. This section is used for all things, as a character for soft pornography. Knowing the actor, acting actor Dee Derek, in Africa, he is looking for his parents' missing psychological professor, who combines with the jungle to search for certain things. Although his father seems to have been missing for a long time, he found him easily. Richard Harris as the father's best thing here; He saw that the picture is stupid, so he's funny, fascinating and hamming, which Peter W. Owol deliberately reminds of the new pussycat's stupid performance. Father's son Tarzan's legend ("some ghost or spirit" says - stealing from him, or paying homage, King Kong), his daughter is unknown to this moment. Shortly after this, we heard Tarzan Yale's notorious kelly. Dad dies, which is not strange to his or her fianc√©e daughter. And then ..... <br /> <br /> Then Tarazan appeared, but nothing said. Actually, he does not say anything during the whole movie. She and Jane fall in love, and she often does not wear, until she closes the dog's love-poem. The end That plot <br /> <br /> OK, not right; There is also a scene where Tarzan fights illogical wrestler with Buddhist contractor - it is a wonderful wife, because it can sometimes be seen as the only toxic. Treating bites with the help of Zen Chip, which helps to hang the garment cloth and hang the tears (I'm not making it!), And it's just a lot of excuses for taking her clothes. <br /> <br /> I always want to finish a review by saying something positive, but this time it is difficult. Let's see ... Well, it is not wrong to criticize this movie for the feature of Aurangootan, although we all know that Orangutan does not live in Africa; After all, all the Indian elephants used in the classic Tarzan movie, are they? Also, you must admit that Bo Dearek is quite face and form. (But in that case why did he not make a career as an industrial model? What does it say about a movie when it is uncommon annoying to see a beautiful woman? I really do not decide whether it is positive or a negative that she has never shown her crotch. ) But now I understand: try me, I can not finish a positive note. <br /> <br /> See this image if you buff a bad movie. I'm here.
