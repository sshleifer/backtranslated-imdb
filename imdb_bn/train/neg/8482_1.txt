Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie, but I recently got the chance. I had a lot of hope to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a high-speed garbage camera angle corner. I did not understand what was the message deprived of Hinduism. I am like many religions, but I think that Kamal Hassan has a humble character to identify such thinking. She could create a scary movie than this shit. He tried to add the generator's virus to the Hollywood and God forbade that he did not convert that person into a mutant and would eventually go for world domination. It is a very suitable movie for a film school versus regular public. She does not hold her talent up to her shame. As the story started, Kaiser tried to hold ideas from butterfly influences, then in the slightest religious harmony at the cost of humiliating Hindus (Again, I insulted Hinduism but this movie is not equal and my insult is generally one of the same intellectuals of religion for religion.)
