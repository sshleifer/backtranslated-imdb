I was not expecting most of this picture- a funny little diversion. Wuthering Heights may turn out to be a wonderful modern story - beautiful and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But the film has decided to cast a genius in a rich version of that which poured down water from the source material, it is surprising that it was frustrating to call it Worthington Heights. It ignores the fact that it is the story of stories that are irrelevant, mostly helpless, and cruel to each other. It changes the very nature of certain characters- for example, in Ishwale's novel, there was not a definite bone in his body - they severed his blind idealism and made him a planned whore. Heathcliffe is a terrible person who mentally tortures most people on his way, but in this version, Kathryn leaves his daughter out of his care. The dialog is frustrating and a wonderful performer is directed to give it directly to the face. In depth or real emotional place, we know that when they shout at someone's face then they mean something. I read about the criticism of the 90th edition, "Emily Broth's Worthington Heights", which shows Ralph Feenes and Juliet Binhake, saying that it has turned a dark, dark Gothic story into a Sudiis Badis-Ripper. A little legitimate opinion, but the MTV version actually moves a step, using the basic story structure to give bad music cavorting chipper beach bums.
