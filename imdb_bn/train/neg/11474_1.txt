The process of trying to get a driver's license is going on with the start of a small film. It is quickly upset about each imaginable issue related to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> Topics like dive, drag racing, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. It often tries to be ridiculous, but the film is soft, painted and even sexist. None of the film is actually heard. Instead, everything is described and done in Voiceover. Sorry, but I can not stand that. <br /> <br /> "Dad, can I borrow a car?" There is nothing educational or interesting about it. It is another part of the stupid fillers to take time to watch their "Wondful World of Disney" TV show. 1/10
