This movie is certainly one of the weirdest themes in history - right-hand side of "glen or glenda" cross-dressing Ed Wood's protective defense. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Park Avenue set it; Bohemians play it The Russians - who speak very suspicious "Russian" and they speak mostly in English when talking about uncomfortable - they play the restaurant they work for. <br /> <br /> If anyone is not interested in the bridge, - even with great cast - this can not be more interested in malignant movies. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Luca are good. (Well Frank McHug is an unlikely scrawl author - Lucas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are shrunk by all the imaginative script.
