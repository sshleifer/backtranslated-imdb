Well, what can be said about this disaster? I saw it because it circulated on cable. I'm sorry for wasting my time but at least I do not waste money. <br /> <br /> Lively is what you can get! Please, you will be very generous to be offended by CHEAP Halloween costumes. Oh well, have awesome acting, f / x, and display dialogue. Conflict with animals is incredible, you can not get more sad scenes. <br /> <br /> You can get it directly from Video Flick. "Animals unknown" are completely silent movies like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only "positive" thing about this trash is the sexy woman.
