Can a picture destroy the fake scene? You do not think so, but it's actually here for me. Listen, I have many classic-era films and know much more than I know, such as driving an ambulance in front of the screen, etc. But many hockey businesses have to work with the scene. There are fake scenes, fake shots fired after the shot seen in "Bridgundo" and flowers are abusive after some time. <br /> <br /> As long as the music goes away, it is always intelligent. What a person likes a song, the other can not be so that a film should not be a big part of the judgment (which likes songs). I could have exploded this movie for the 1950s song, dance, romance, and character but it was in the '50s and many people liked these things. Musicals did not do well in '50. I like the '30s and' 40s with great taps. In the '50s, tap out and this new stuff - which I could stand - was it. Is that this a lousy movie? No It just makes one that I do not care too much <br /> <br /> Despite good actor, good director and high expectations, this film is bombing with me at the box office and with me. I liked myself more, being a visionary and it is a wonderful part of this story. I do not think of the brutal kind and a beautiful city and the beautiful people appeal to me awful sounds good. So why could not I get involved with this photo? It was also part of the dance. I do not care for the stuff that replaces the dance dance on the screen. But - no - it really stopped me staging. No Scotland, there was no highland, it was a sensual background to see it and turned it around from around me. Score a point for today's realism where they "go to the location" for most of the time.
