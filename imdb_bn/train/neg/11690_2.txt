It's a waist to indulge great actors at such a weak and annoying movie. Apart from all the inappropriate questions posted on other comments, what is so hard about catching robbers? Just drop the staff of the bank, see the footage of the camera was in Angels K-Bank - before the robbers entered and there were 4 more robbers among your detainees. The mystery is where all the body is talking about? At this moment it was so clear to change the guns to this uniform uniform that they were all going to the front door ... it had seen many times. At least Mr Spike Lee may have some good music scores and movies with artistic shooting season. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
