Some people may think of this movie as part of the artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film, able to create a movie to counter the pain and death. I personally think this movie is frustrating, which should never have been released. . This movie is repulsive, irrational and meaningless. This is not only the complete waste of time, but it makes you sick for tomorrow. Wonderful images shown in movies do not only make you realize for air but they set you in mind and it takes a few days to forget it. There is another example of "bill bills" for people who blame their imagination for such inhuman grief, but at least "purpose of bill" is the purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
