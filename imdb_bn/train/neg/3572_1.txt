Los Angeles's wonderful "Z" channel shows the movie after six months or so after "Butterfly". I was so much optimistic for the actress, and then she continued to work clearly from the film on the bad. <br /> <br /> At the age of 80, I told you that Harold Rabin's work was accepted by smart authors. . Jacqueline Susan entered into her (she hated him for writing women), Irene Sher had been caught with many women, and in the end of the 80's, in the late 70's, Sidney Sheldon ruled and then Jackie Collins came, Strong and equal. In his book, even more to men. That's why this work smelt. Harold Robbin's work was not caught by the audience in the 80's. Pia Zadora acting in ryabin's action is like throwing kerosene in the fire Supporting cast was not a help. <br /> <br /> Ooh ... it was terrible seeing and even more than 20 years, it looks worse. I was optimistic about Pia as an actress and it was a hit after it ended. Pia would be difficult to relieve herself as an actress (though John Waters was casting her "Herpes") though she was singing fine songs. <br /> <br /> Hey, Piya, wherever you live. Harepri tour can go! Join the show. You can still be the biggest returning story. <br /> <br /> I hope they will burn this movie for you.
