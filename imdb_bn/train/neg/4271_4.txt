Usually the thriller has been done long ago. Simple plot outline; Kop Leota Russell's wife gets annoyed, and she tries to stop the good ol 'cart so that she can get him. It is not predictable, it does not even try to guess you, the plot is plots and there is no thought outside the box. I think it is the only reason to see the development of it, but how it is developed, nothing is done in the original or interesting way. There is really nothing to say about this movie, this is not particularly bad, but there is no good point. Russell plays Russell and you know what you see him in a film. Dito Litta Stowe has a boring Cher-esque voice. I read the plot outline and I could see this movie on my head, it was very obvious and basic. I have seen it and like my imagination it has penetrated into my eyes. I felt a drop of emotions across. I have no feeling about this film, as I have never seen. Considering this, it is not a pretty unmatched film? Still, I have to pay 3/10 for some reason.
