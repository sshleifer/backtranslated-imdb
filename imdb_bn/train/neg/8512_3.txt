I like silent films, but it was very little. The more I wish, the more I could say that I am standing, I can not wait for hours. I do not think any version of the movie comes to the book. And do not try it on kids, they can be fantastic. And how old was the woman playing in the village? 38? I know the labor laws were different ... but they came to the people.
