The more I love the Japanese film, the more it will not be cut ... The film about being a rebel and the survival of a royal bloodline has turned into a very slow film with a suspicious plot. << br /> <br /> Photography is okay, even though I have seen better visuals on Japanese sharp films, cameras faster and the way they followed the characters did not satisfy me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice its presence. But the way the plot was developed is worse than the worst. I must admit that sometimes I was hard to understand who and what is going on. However, the main character and the platonic love between the others was completely unnecessary and came from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> Everybody, if you are looking for a job, this is not Japanese film. Very slow, very short sword scene and very sensitive ... on the bad road ...
