I saw commercial for this, I had all to see it. Now, forgive me, but it has been so long since I did not think how it was going. Not saying that the movie that I saw has no similarity with "movies". They sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed, and incredibly frustrated watching this movie. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink further with that terrific rage music. Just do not have music setting for a horror movie, is not it? If you have never seen a commercial (or trailer, I think), but I think it's hot stuff. For my money, the commercial way was good.
