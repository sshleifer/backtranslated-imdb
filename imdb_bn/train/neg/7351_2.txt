Sometimes you will see a bad movie to appreciate better ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This will always be in a bad film section, because only Shu-Ki's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martin said about Angel Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief went straight after leaving his lover, Chi two years ago, Lam (Julian Chen) But the company's category security software was kidnapped for ransom to return to its past as Che lam. To rescue her, she called her old friend to save his orphanage days, six other righteous women from that day to save him ... <br /> <br /> I could have heard it impressively, but it's a Chess story. In fact, the whole script and direction were lacking in any quality. Most conversations were meaningless and were combined with a plot that was thin as water in rice paper. If I could add it, take a bad Jackie Chan film, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw the budget, and have your Marshal Angels: a formula of the work without any imagination. <br /> <br /> You have to remember, credit should be given due to credit and Shu was probably the only person to emerge from a terrible step, because it was his performance driven by him. Well, you can not say that he was nice - there was absolutely nothing to do with him - but he was able to dig some character from his role. Even more, Sandra Ng and Kelly Lynn made another impression - though it was mostly fascinating and very short. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the film is only broken into pieces. Scenes and dialogs were completely irrelevant and incredible, special effects were done cheaply, without any effort to clean the mask of individuals and blue screen, bad incidents, bad edits with numerous inconsistencies in the war scenes, primary and obsolete camera angles, and I saw better aspects than lost dogs. . <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a lot more cooking. Most likely, the budget appeared on the interest of having seven children on the same silver screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Angels, it is not. In reality, sisters can do this for themselves, none of the places here were clear here. <br /> <br /> Surely one will forget.
