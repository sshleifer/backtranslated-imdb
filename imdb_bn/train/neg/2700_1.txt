In spite of the use of music shiny to underscore the motivation and ideology of the main character in some parts, or perhaps in some parts, perhaps there is a somewhat delicate and characteristic characteristic inside a delicate movie. <br /> <br /> One understands that John Singley is firing in post-structuralist literature theory because it was a day's smell, and "higher education" is a significant result. The low point of the film is the "Peace" rally, in which the symbol of the 1960's "free love" movement has been reused with the "Back Back The Night" rally, which identifies the identity-conscious musical activity in the hat. Perhaps the director of his initial revisionism says that identity politics is new Vietnam? Oh, how is Adrienne rich? And a nice touch of bullet shot in the rayei, if you're in Rich's political posting. <br /> <br /> I hope I can give this movie a negative star. I can recommend it to interested people only in the history of the 1990s, at a time when radical feminists bring academic trinity to ethnicity, class and sex in popular culture and declare human hate "an effective and honorable political alternative". Where does he need Camilo Paglia?
