To be honest, this film is another series of frustrating series ... Most of these so-called "horror masters" movies are terrible in the line of their sub-performances and funny story ... Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie can not work to save their lives ... Some of the gunmen seem to be inferior to Father-Mike or something and looked totally unreal ... Strictly, this picture is terrible as home ... Cigarette burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pultus ... The only good managers do not know how these managers can sleep at night, how they knew that they destroyed the style that some of them really could understand. .
