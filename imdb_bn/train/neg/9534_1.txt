I am the best actor of the best films But this one was awful. I wonder if there was such a difficult time finding it. I've tried 4 video rental stores, until I received a copy of this movie. The act was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the work was also bad. <br /> <br /> I really had Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the original kickbacking character and theme that was the first movie with 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
