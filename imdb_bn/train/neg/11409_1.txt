Masquerading really as a "horror film" starts the trend of 80's of hate violence. I was the target audience for this annoying piece of trash and I was hated as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start? Let's see, setup: If you can bring people back to living, they die in violent deaths. So the laughingly poor courtyard is an excuse to slaughter people in a terrible way, because they need to be brought back to their lives! Black la laughs a la re-animator or it can work if you play at the top for doing something. But no, it played directly. A horrible family is a terrific family that becomes prey, at least in some scenes where their screen of death is closed. However, just everything else is on the screen. Actually a scene where a young girl walks and killed the zombie townships, all who are filming it and making green with several cameras. Then, lovers of filmmakers - and their mouth closed while spending time - in the time-filled photography, their face was torn down and re-created to look "normal" again. This, of course, is accomplished as a mortician behind it all by a slumming jack Albertson. She likes to hang out with ambulances / sounds, the old Tommy Dosque, I guess it can be beautiful. <br /> <br /> To the end, Sheriff even spare and please the doctor please fix his rolling hand. Why Sheriff is not coming out with other residents, killing children and closing their faces, hurting in the sight of the victim, etc. <br /> <br /> I wonder, surprise, people see a geek show like this to give it any sort of rating. It's not scary, twists ridiculous, and overall it's kind of sick. Enjoy it even "look at it in boldness" or at a level that is not enjoyed enough so that you can see a bad HIV luv film. It's just God-awful trash, who comes out of such a dull knot and creates slim for a picnic. <br /> <br /> sorry that Albertson was also involved.
