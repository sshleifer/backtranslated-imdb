I work partly miyajakira a fan. I say "partially" because most of the film is divided into two parts: the bright and annoying. Unfortunately, this film falls in the next section. <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from the same basic problem as the recent movie "Haoul's Moving Castle" by Moyazaki. An intriguing compound is set up, but then immediately to explain it rather than confuse the plot to reduce more less than a backdrop for some illogical events. /> <br /> post published the first third of the film <br pokyalipatika story set in the world, and is actually a very funny story is expression. Since then things went down hill. The middle of the film is mostly composed of thin-holesome eco-propaganda and the last unrealistic spirituality destroys a large number of animated animated films. <br /> <br /> think that as a whole the film script before sending it to someone ayanimetetaradera every other page is blank. Something which is visually stunning on the left (though sadly I saw the version was a copy of the North-generation, which was poor - which raises the general myth that the nerves flying under its bare air), but it is a little intelligent and finally left me confused.
