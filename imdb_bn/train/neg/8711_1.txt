OK ... the third in this series of Kornos. Dinosaur gives star with dolls! At the beginning of the movie, when you start counting on the reason of Dino, you can not see only Dino's eyesight, it is quite smart to hide bad dolls! And in 16 minutes, Scott has led some special forces team with Valentine in the film, walks in the warehouse, and then they begin to find body parts and bodies after Dino rage, after a while the big box comes in the party's failure and you can hear a velociraptor scream Fantastic, fuzzy !!! And then a black girl is walking forward and now a blooper is available! It pops up a raptor's hand and slashes its face but if you breakthrough when you come to the hand you can see that it's a guy with only a hand doll! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some trucks attack some terrorists because even though they wash some arms there. 2. Where they die, it can be a ten-ton rapter and a giant T-Rex! How to fit T-Rex there ??? 3. Rand and some nerds will kill dinosaurs! Sadly, some stupid blonde girl asked her to catch the living one. (4.) There is a wheel on the credit of the holy Jesuits! 5. Dino is now in the Pacific Ocean 6. I do not know that T-Rex was a weird thing on the neck 7. 7. If you want to laugh then the film is good. 5/10
