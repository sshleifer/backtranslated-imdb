This movie is really awful. After advertising for this, I thought it could be its character ... but it did not. Girls can not work, and they can not sing. The soundtrack of this movie is full of their tracks, and it's a beautiful scene, awesome story lines, incredible plot, it's one of Disney's worst movies by FAR! Ally is not a bad actress in "Phil of Future", so I do not know what happened to "Cow Bells". And her sister, AJ, seems to have just woke up a journey with the "fame" of her sisters, and she never exhibits any talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls are finally to learn something moral, but this train relics are delayed in the censored movie <br /> <br /> terrible
