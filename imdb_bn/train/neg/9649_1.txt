Whom were they kidding? It was difficult to digest which was too much in this film. Since then, Arjuna (Ajay Devgan), when his uncle (played by Om Puri) reached London, unknowingly asked for forgiveness on his father's death. The only problem with that theory is that anyone who has ever passed through London Heathrow, knows that such a burst can not be possible and especially not by Indian. But the film's problems do not end here, two main characters (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) are going near the rock-rays of their dreams. I mean Yes we have seen Susan Boyle (a woman from the United Kingdom has had her dream at the age of 50) but this is a rare event. It was really difficult to suspend my unbelief because I felt that Salman and Azar Casting were just sick. They will never cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi in ​​order to play the same role, why should we keep watching Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan (40 year old male) creatures in our efforts to postpone the age of 20? Let's not talk about the most self-conscious actress on the screen today. This is his second film (which I saw) and he is simply hopeless as an actress, he thinks he is concerned about showing good and curious interest in the camera rather than giving good performance. It is very hard to believe that he has canceled all the other film roles to star in these films and then became so silent as the actress, there is nothing to write about it. And above all that, the film just dragged on annoying. There is nothing special about this, believe me that every prediction of what you are going to predict.
