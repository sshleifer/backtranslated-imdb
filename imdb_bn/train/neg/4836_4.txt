Let's start with its simple line. From the side of the audience, some good directors like "Director's Details", there are some nice things in the movie scene. Special effects are good enough, a good performance / good scenery also. But the story is very easy way. It shows how the life of an elite army bomb squad unit works, and sometimes dies. It shows the drama live in war. As a serious action movie "addicted" to my movie experience, I missed the eye that I was stuck on my eyes and mind screen. During the implementation of the movie and in the film, the audience needs to be present in a movie submerged. It did not happen to me. I am "aware" of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie has gained fame based on American patriotism, "subconscious" appeal of healthy and true feelings. Not enough use as a movie fame generator. More than a movie about war, it increases its popularity. <br /> <br /> A common thought: If it is a World War II or I movie, change only over time, everything is the same but this award will be given? Not sure Why? Because many big people repeatedly increase height. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Oscar rivals, I do not think that the rewards of the prize are properly rewarded.
