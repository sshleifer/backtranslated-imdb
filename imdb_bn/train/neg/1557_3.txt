The film is basically a boring string of extraordinary clich√©s that does not provide real cross-cultural insights. The Middle Eastern circular of the journey has been particularly described in a pirate: possibly mud bricks, dirt tracts between the desert, women wearing black dress and beaten dancers. I wonder how the camel and date palm trees were absent from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is sketched very complex and most of the conditions are very reliable. <br /> <br /> The original idea might be interesting, but if you are looking for cultural insights at the end of the day, then you have to skip this movie.
