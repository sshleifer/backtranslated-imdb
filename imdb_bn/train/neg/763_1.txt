I love Colombo and have seen most of the episodes but it is undoubtedly the worst. Strangely captivating, uninterrupted, unexpected drill headaches, which both of the time wasted during the audience's time and too much annoying Peter Falley's performance. Just as 'Plot', as it is, it seems to have been made that the film started without giving a slight indication of the elements of the formula, which the show achieved such a great success. What I found very annoying (or perhaps annoying) was that part of the proceeding was the character of Peter Fawk presented as the guest 'Let's Colombo' at the wedding ceremony. If the producers strongly advised to keep Colombo's first name confidential, why did they exclude this line from being considered ridiculous? Like I said, it will work well to avoid the pit and all true Colombo fans like the plague.
