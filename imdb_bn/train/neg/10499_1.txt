All right, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You are loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie. This is the "Crocodile Hunter" TV program poor performance, bad scripts, and Steve's teachings about animals or bad directions with bad directions. She was in search of animals / entertainment as a specialist. Millions will miss him. But the idea of ​​the whole film was a big mistake. Plots were so broken, almost existed. Casting was horrible. Acting primary school level actors were not even worth it. The sides must be blamed as well. If you do not get half of the best performance from your actors, then the script will not be so bad, you must first do it well. I could have written a good script. I did not wish to see this movie. Of course, I saw it $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son). With friends who scoffed at this instead of seeing the live action of Scooby Doo. My son, who is not so discriminator, has liked this movie, but he has never asked to see it again. If you like Steve Irwin's lover memories, buy his series of DVDs. Avoid this movie like the plague. I was Steve, I know I do not want to remember for this movie. Respect him: to avoid this movie!
