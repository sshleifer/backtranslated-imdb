What a rebellious story, the murder of blackmail, child sexual abuse, Gays and Catholic church ..... Absolute trip. How UK-based TV plays, boss coms etc are included in compulsory gay, it's really being really annoying Everyone acknowledges that there are gay people in society only minority groups, but we do not want it to fall down our throat (I will pass this one) every single show. Apart from the above, the drama can be a catchy little story in a pantomime, the pastor was a parent and there are gay people everywhere, oh yes there was a whole PC of gay couples who were gay I am surprised to be surprised at c ecclestone when he reads the script.
