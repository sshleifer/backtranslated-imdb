This movie is Fonnie Avatar, Fonnie 11/10 straight on the scale. The fakeness of the titania of the card igan spandex pants as well as the activation is just amazing. Although yankees can be real colorful only in Scotland, but if you go there do not expect the opportunity to "dance" with the locals. Also, otherwise do not try to get local opinion through one of the most delicate industries of the survey. <br /> <br /> There are some contagious singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is very sugarful and linear and dialogue is often very weak. I suspect that I want to stop in New York City, 18th-century Scottish village of Bondox. Perhaps the priest did not have such a big sacrifice to leave Brigaduna, perhaps he was trying to get out of that dump. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A Christopher's Day-parade in Scotland will be seen in LSD. Other than I'd recommend it only to the Hollywood music completists.
