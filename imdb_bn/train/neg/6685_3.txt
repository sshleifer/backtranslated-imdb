Although the film was held in the "Ivy League" college, it was actually shot in North Dakota of Northern Ireland at Flagsstaff in 1976. I was involved in the theater section and in most of the additional films the members of the theater division were then members. <br /> <br /> This picture has a ridiculous view (if you know your Arizona geography) shows a lot of cast member members to drive from college. We know that campus and decree cricketer (actually Oak Creek Canyon) is about 35 miles away, and when this journey is being reduced, it will be impossible to run a bike that is returning to the same road UP!
