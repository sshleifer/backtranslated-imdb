John Haidar was absolutely awesome in this movie. I felt that I saw a bad college child's child work for the first time. Anna Faris was equal to the course, not good, but not terrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should be well known. Jeff Daniels was the only creator of the film in the film (though he had a poor judgment on his side as well). <br /> <br /> I will spend so much on all. I'm so glad I could not see it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
