If you enjoy the original SNL Cast and Shows, avoid all costs at this moment. This is the first time my friends come out and I wait for an hour to line up in a sold movie movie. The movie was half-way theater 3/4 empty. We refuse to give up thinking that we would get well. When we finished the movie, we were left alone in the theater. The movie lasted only one day in all the theaters and disappeared from the scene. In an interview with Mr. Mike, he declined to comment on the film. The film was an internal joke in SNL episodes, which came into play once the movies were released and closed within a day. We tried to contact Mr. Mike with phone and mail to send everyone back but were completely ignored.
