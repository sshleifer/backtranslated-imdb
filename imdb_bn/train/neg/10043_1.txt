I liked to write about the story, but there was no one. I liked to quote a few hard-hitting dialogs from the movie, but "Hinglish" is just as fun as 5 minutes, with an extra amount of it later. I liked to scream about 'up-you-guessing suspense', but it was expected ... um mm, a romantic movie (?). I liked to talk about the seat of the seat action, but I do not like cartoons. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is perfect trying: 1. People are trying to commit suicide - I promise that it will push you to the end 2. Sado-Masokist - This movie is called Dub-Vindy Code Silas man is more effective than tied wire. 3. People searching for alternative ways to spread terrorism - The viewer I swore is the mood of killing someone 4. Movie Pirators: Their more power It is worth not to spend money to visit any movie viewer - if it is. 5. Burnaby, plankton and green algae are of most types - because the IQ factor for almost all other living things is slightly more than movie offers. After the thought: director of the film, perhaps, his own species. (And I hope God is the only one ...) enough <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can create a good movie which is: 1. A story 2. A dancer 3. A screenplay writer at 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (I already said?) 6. A director - especially someone who did not compete mentally (even though those who are challenged can do a good job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - All costs are expensive Let's go 8. A statutory warning - "Yash Raj films are harmful to your mental health"? <br /> <br /> I like about this picture: 1. Kareena Kapoor - 2 English sub-titles for obvious reasons - "My heart goes out" - "My heart has become ineffective", has become "run away" I'm a flirt, I'm a lover, I'm a weird ". <Br> <br /> In short, a solid rubric of a ruby ​​to me is inverted - the cube is supposed to increase the player's IQ, Tasan promises to reduce your IQ, and that .. only 2.5 hours! <br /> <br /> <br /> I may have mistakenly warned you in any way.
