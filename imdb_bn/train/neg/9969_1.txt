I have joined this site so that people comment on the complete disaster of this film. I was not even drawn for a second. All of the letters were one dimensional. They throw things that they think will be a stick. I bet (and hopefully) all the teachers involved will come back with shame. Here are some great actors but you never know it. Thanks to God, Morgan Freeman or Jude Hirish or Nick Nolt or Laura Darn's career did not ruin. There is no vision here, there is no labor of love, just a terrible effort has gone wrong. BTW I do not think the authors ever set foot in a real school.
