Hey, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and tell me, this version SUCKS! I do not know that all the people have spent the money for this flotam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and turned into the most annoying melodrama imaginable. This version is quite literally so bad, the presence of a great thesis like Maximilian Schell in the title role can not even save it. The only release quality of this movie has made it a great pot for "MSST3K"; Mike, Serve and Crow have made fun with this fun. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I'm sure Shakespeare, when he was alive, he did not want to add his name. It's about This "hamlet" is not so bad that it is good; It's just plain bad. Absolutely horrible
