Five minutes later you understand that you've seen it before. It's boiler room. It is in FIRM. And it's Devolls Advocate. And there are no new elements here. Except Bill Gates-Fairytale. Constipation is always a good thing to make films, but why is it so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because it - at least a time - seems realistic. Everything in Antitrust is wrong. For example, do your boss work hard and pay someone to get your girlfriend to control you? I want to give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
