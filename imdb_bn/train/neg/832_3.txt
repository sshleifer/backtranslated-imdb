I suggest this movie that it is very well and reasonably well played. I can not find the impossibility of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, a game created around the concept of "Russian Roulette" which must be filled in the hourly. The big problem is that if you're doing "live" show, run the possibility that your first contestant will be sufficient to make "real" bullets. Then what do you do? There is nothing to fill and show up for your 50-minute show. In short, it is said, OK, you will end and the first five contestants will survive, which means there are six number of impressions and probably can not be paid. He is not going to shoot himself at that time, so it is anti-climate type. <br /> <br /> The second problem, almost bigger. Human nature People are going to work flinch, panic, their underworld soil and which otherwise would not make television very well. Much more shuffle For this reason, "real" reality television is strictly scripted and even more tightly edited. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Let's announce that the rate of rating will increase when it announces every morning (unlucky) female rating rating to boost. <br /> <br /> A point of race and gender. Big surprises are a movie of two minorities (one homosexual) and two female contestants who survive. So we live with two white men, and, of course, buy it a little less than them. The purpose of this type of event is randomness, but the person you least prefer is the person who dies. <br /> <br /> After Clayx is spending two hours on television for suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and played this thing, so there is no one to blame for his own) actually someone dies when a conscience increase. What does he think is going to happen? He was immediately shot by an enclosure by angry about the whole thing (the purpose is not explained) and the show is going to be a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> The issue of rebellion against the media is actually a bit of a ground reality, or it has to be rude (like a network). This is not the case.
