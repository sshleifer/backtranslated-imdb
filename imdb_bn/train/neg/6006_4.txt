I do not agree with any religious belief in the left-hand series, but still I keep the books confidential and I read 8 of them out of 12. Uncertainty well written and interesting stories However, I did not have too high expectations for the movie. The mainstream Hollywood was not taken up in a Christian series and there was no way to produce a big budget movie. So it was done independently ... and I felt that I was really watching a long tv show. It just does not feel like a movie; It's not that movie was "experienced", if someone knows what I'm talking about. So the film was suffering due to this, and low budget, poor special effects were another disappointment for me. On <br /> <br />, I think Gordon Curi Nicolae misbehaves as Carpia unfortunately. Reading the book, NC was impressed with my impression that he was supposed to be this charming, pretty, wonderful-looking guy, who spoke English with a pronounced traces around zero. So I imagine someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some clay icons pencil-throat who looked like an employee by the best-by-month month and gave him a really bad fake accent. So that's a few for me they lost. The movie is not only believable when the main villain does not look at his views or see the word. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, but there is nothing to write in the house. Some of the scenes - like a transformation scene (can not remember) - the actual seat-squirrels for me were. And some Christian rock music or whatever it was really a place for some scenes, one with Kirk Cameron's prayer in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Briefly, it was not a bad movie, but it's not it for me. Books, stick sticks, it's a lot better.
