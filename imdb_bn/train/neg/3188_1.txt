Joe Dawn's inaugural line tells everything about this movie. It was held at the island of Malta (Island of the Islanders of the Islanders) and involved Jodi Dob Biker in search of the Italian church. Joe Dawn's character is named after Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all of what happened in this movie shoots people by shooting them. Everyone in the movie hates him, as everyone hates Griden Clarke. I liked a previous Graden image, "Angels Revenge" because it was a shirt for three year old boys. Avoid this movie at all cost !!
