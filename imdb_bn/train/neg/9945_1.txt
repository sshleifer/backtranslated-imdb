I've noticed a bit strange about half of this movie ... I switch to watching TV on my own channel - not just a good movie feature. <br /> <br /> This film is a series of successes, and I must say it mostly failed in Mrs. Through 80% of the movie I see an old repeat instead of switch. The following line - the whole film feels that the makers do not know exactly and end up with a clear taste concoction.
