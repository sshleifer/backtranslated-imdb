I have seen this movie, as well as other adaptations to show the plays I can get my hands - to prepare for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as music. Unfortunately all the stories of life were taken out. I have never seen such a terrible screenplay of Mr. Rochester. All of its most basic features are gone. Where is his intellect? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester is closely related to Rochester foil, St John, more than the novel's character. Indeed, in this adaptation, Saint John starred acting actor St. Johann, while Scott was looking at some things for breaking things or just ceiling (which he always did). I did not think they had any idea. I want to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and film, but because of the performance of George C Sket I can not see this movie for a long time.
