The Earth is called a non-genius round or poly shoe to make a movie call bad for "thinnar". There is no news, but how they know how they know it. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie .... the book was good, even if it was smaller than other stories "Do you want to be careful" section. Bark plays an overweight lawyer who kills a Gypsy daughter and his father (TV "Room 222" from Constantine) curses a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> I said, it feels good, but why gangster (Montg√©n) is involved? Why automatic fire fire so much? Why are you so dependent on FX? I think it was more effective if it focused on weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such delicate harmful. <br /> <br /> But no, it will not be. Remember, this Stephen King is talking about us. <br /> <br /> And the end is almost the same as the book, but a little more talk. In fact the whole film is very much talked about, it seems like we have to turn each of the plots. I do not expect "the dead zone", but I could work without any other "pet commissions" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> However, the rest of the movie is left ... tell me ... "thin".
