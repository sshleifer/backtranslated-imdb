In order to create a movie of the precedes and "real" Star War trilogy, even a great filmmaker will pay ... .... Mr Lucas is not the film's maker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good people in the darkness need a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes of light saber fights are annoying boring with only a few pockets but there is a lack of edge because you already know that there is no original character alive in the original Star Wars. Count <br /> <br /> Duke (Christopher Lee) has a very quick introduction here and the best idea to keep Jar Jar Bing silent! <br /> <br /> No movie only turns out to be obstinate with Chandpur and there is a large (overlapping) sequence of lava fruits.
