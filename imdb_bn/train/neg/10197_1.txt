Completely ridiculous. If you know something about poker, you will find it absolutely unhappy but also entertaining because it's so stupid. The deity who created this movie must be very religious and inseparably aware of the game of poker, but I suspect that he has ever played over 3-6. (I think he knows nothing about golf.) Where to start. I saw good production in the film Strastry article, I took a new year to film school. Actor actor Queen Moma, Ski Nguyen, and the victims who can not win poker in this movie. <br/> <br /> * The Splellar * is the only reason that the movie started with the opening of the first movie. He is a railway board who does not play poker and never lays the dialogue, but the actor is the person who paid for the film. I can not seem to mean more meaningless waste than shelling out people for this stupid product. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are very few poker in this picture. Most of the time the fake side is spent on the characters whose plots are not resolved in the slightest. Queen Moma has a show-stolen scene where she threw her harmful boyfriend with a window and tried to shoot her brain. Also, when unnamed Arabs of the convenience store dispute the killing or killing a barbarian woman who kills them, they give brilliant performance. Their fine performance is easily in the film's highlights. It makes you wonder why they bother to let these white people play leads. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, complete nonsense. Planning from outer space 9 has little more coherency. You might want to laugh if you play poker. If you are a Christian then you may enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious conversations that make the movie look like uninterrupted peppercorns. I hate movies made by religious people. Especially those who think that they know something they know nothing about. It is unfortunate that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen are involved in this travesty as I can not help but feel less of them. They must be jealous of Johnny Chan for getting the rounders.
