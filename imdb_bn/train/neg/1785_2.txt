.... and after seeing this fork, you will not be surprised that it has not been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPILILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a horror film by a standard. But when I think it's one of the worst movies in the credit of Stephen King, you can imagine how bad it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The camera pans out of the house where hundreds of cats die and explode. The person is right, someone hates cats and that should be a policeman. Oh, wait a minute, he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a policeman oh so obvious observation you know You are going to watch a bad movie <br /> <br /> Because SLEVWALKERS bad, it is very irrational and confusing, we finally find the need to survive the title of the monkey, the virgin's blood, do they replace the coastal city of America. Do not look for a virgin on the Midwest Bible Belt - at least we know the purpose of the monsters - the only thing we learn, they will never change the shape. The cars can not disappear and we do not think that these poisonings have been stolen from the Timer. The mother of the monitors killed several policemen with the help of her neck or blowing the police with handguns (!), But her giant dynasty if the police If the fire is protected from the fire, then why is it necessary to change the shape of animals or disappear? Animals are thought to be equally sick of the death of animals as a result of the cat's ass attack. They could be killed by cats, so why did not all the cats around the garden be killed? The moggies sitting around were a complete horde but the monsters did not think about killing them. I guess the production team will end. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this is the reason that whenever a struggling unknown actor script When they read, they immediately decided that they would not be in a bad movie, so Stephen King had to call his deadly friends to get admitted. Throw out <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The worst line is - "That cat saved my life"
