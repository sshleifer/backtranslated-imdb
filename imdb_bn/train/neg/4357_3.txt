While camping in beautiful German countryside camping, friends face a group of hateful cannibals. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​'mutant cannibal family' is old like the old hills, often calls home, so any director needs to come up with something superbly fantastic to try to breathe new life into the sequence. With Barricades, Timo Rose tries to give a tutonious twist to the well-working routine by replacing Black Forest and giving splatters treatment in Germany's low budget. The result is a very bloody, but totally irrational effort has made almost obscure some awesome instructional decisions? In particular, non-stop use of fancy filters and annoying editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Timo Rose did not like to use every NF trick to supply his editing software, then the barricade might be a reasonable leisure event: his inexperienced cast is doing well; Bloody effects are murning appropriate stomach; And one or two scares and even has some good imaginative moments. All of this, however, has completely destroyed this movie by the camera-work, sticky editing, and the visual hostage of the visual hostage, which is so vaguely popular with today's filmmakers. /> I completely give 10 out of 10 outsourcing for Gore, in which there is a nifty view where a person is forced to drink acid, due to sharp applications loads of harmful wounds and some good shotguns are damaged.
