I recently saw this sister together with my sister who liked Sofia Lorraine's performance. I am a man who they call a cultural barbarian. I hate art of any type of form or form. Rambo is more like me movies, action, murder, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself to avoid this movie like this plague. No one dies, there is no action, no nudity, nothing is of type. Let me give you a Rezuma in a few sentences. It starts in 5 minutes of black and white Nazi propaganda. Each Italy in a housing block joins a parade in honor of Hitler, housewife, fascist and caretaker. Housewife who cheated by her husband, met the anti-fascist. She falls in love with her, wants to love her, but anti fascist gay Despite this they also love each other, they love each other. At the end of the day, the housewife read a book from her gay lover, and that person was exiled by the agents. The end Do you like an even small resume? Annoying ... is that short enough? At the beginning of this movie, the man should use guns and should be shot to protect the audience from this persecution. As well as my sister likes this movie. I said, I am a cultural barbarian ...
