Contrary to my principle, let me first get a conclusion, because I saw this piece of "art", and still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excite my strong vocabulary. Well, this movie is terrible, and I would never be annoyed to write a single word about it, if it is not true that "44 minutes" makes me sick in death, which rarely happens to me. The money I paid for does not make me feel better, as well as the movie is entitled to a high user rating here. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the film? This is a fashionable title - "44 minutes". The first one thinks about "15 minutes", which is a lot of good movie, but my book is still bad, and actually can be compared to the two. But, as luck has it, the things they share are their worst characteristics. They are both Mr. Oleg shows the characteristics of Taktarov, who, with his strong Russian accent, clearly meets popular expectations and ancestors. Its purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind. Ah, we miss the old times well. Now, I did not say that he is a bad actor, I still can not judge his true performance, but he is not just a real person here, but it's like a genre. Anyone still can indulge in such things completely out of my understanding We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. When Takedarov explains to the filmmaker that the Romans are not German and they are really ridiculous in America. Do we think that the best of both of the wicked will become "true" American? <br /> <br /> then there are media problems. Yes, it seems that what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and journalists. The director remembered for our 44 minutes. Instead he bores with interviews throughout the movie like a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. Within 15 minutes the media is central to the issue. A teacher is presented in a way that addresses the student in a way, but deserves a different comment, we are now paying attention to 44 minutes. So, I'm trying to identify the purpose of this movie. what is this? Give good time to the audience? Do the weapons glorify? To glorify the police? Illustrate the violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the underlying criminal the Bible. So will everyone have to maintain peace and intelligence? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I just know that I did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madison. I admit, I'm a big fan. I hope he would have a brilliant point, but I was wrong. It's not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing "power" to "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of my worst lines. <br /> <br /> Scale to minus 1-10, I give it a pure, unadulterated 1.
