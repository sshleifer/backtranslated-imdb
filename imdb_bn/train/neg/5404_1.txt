Will you ever do such an hour or two and see the movie so bad that it denies the argument? Well, on weekends, I look at box art for this and see T-Rex. Knowing the package's dinosaurs were T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I knew that for this bad reason I was in this mood. <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What am I styled out of the movie? Rex's hungry reference is not sometimes ... not satisfied. He is not hungry because he is out of my neck (he really roars when you are down his face, it is difficult ... like toys or something). Now, I like to watch incredibly bad B-movies from time to time because it reminds me how good the blockbuster film is. This one was lovely. I'm not sure that it was supposed to be a thriller or comedy, because there are scenes, there is no mistake, you laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the movie budget ... yes, but the act also did not help. All right, Tony Todd was really good, like some women's role ... When you cry, "tears" will not come out? Meh, I'm not going to be angry with this movie, I knew what I found and if you are looking for a bad movie to meet friends, then I recommend that here: see this movie, then see the Jurassic Park immediately and then return back Lost in the world You'll write Mr Spieberg the next letter thank you letter.
