Sincerely, I was disappointed with the "expiry date". Super cute headline and interesting compound, but I do not think it's delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with its original roots? Or, perhaps, it was necessary to overcome his fear of death. But, he did not become like a man who was afraid of his life - it seems as if his life has been healed, but since the Day of Judgment, he will now start worrying. I do not buy it. Meanwhile, the movie's supporting characters do not seem to be a necessity that is mixed in a lot of stories. They are just running their character parallel to the main character. Also, it is treated as a "curse" and looked more like a coincidence. Who has curse the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those who criticized me, but I loved Seattle's shot, cinematography was nice, was not outstanding acting was good.
