I actually went to see this picture in a theater, but the complete waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say, this helped not to enjoy the rather sticky playplay. <br /> <br /> Some friends saw me and said, because the author of the book, James Redfield, was involved in a very heavy screen. They really enjoyed the book, so the movie was just to be perfect. Well maybe I had a little more hope, but I absolutely hate this movie! It was really very sweet at one point, which I actually left and all of us are going to be the worst sign! Make a favor in the world and stop this scary crusade.
