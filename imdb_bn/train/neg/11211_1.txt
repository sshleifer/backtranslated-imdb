This is so wrong with the movie, but to add it: The terrible acting - so bad it will be intriguing. Poor script - They may have some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story. The tragic ending is bad - in some cases it is finally managed to save the film-not in this case. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, then you want to end yourself because the end is not worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Through this movie it was full torture, I warned me in advance. So do yourself a favor. If you see just this film not only good at nothing. Even then you will regret to keep yourself through illogical torture.
