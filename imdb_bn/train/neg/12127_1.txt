Sorry Fulci fans, but I could not get through this one. Soundtrack They were so annoying as they were, the acting was complete, the story was completed and the work was done and the direction existed. <br /> <br /> Genocide looked like a child film project of honesty. But I saw some of them, and they are really looking better than this! Looks like they are not able to afford anything ... something! There is no DOP, not a director, there is no one who played far away. It was a very poor cinematic experience; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not have anything else to say about it. <br /> <br /> It rate a 0.1 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br />
