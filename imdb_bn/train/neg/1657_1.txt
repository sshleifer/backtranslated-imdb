This movie was my 5th punch price of "Hatter Card". This was seen in Virginia in the mid-70's. I was not confused when I saw it alone so I saw it alone. Sucked it. It was the most ridiculous, the defeat of celluloid that I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who reviewed this film thought that it was great. I offer you this: If this was so great, what was the box office? End of discussion.
