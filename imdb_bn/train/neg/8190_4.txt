Take Me: A Tired Formula Christmas Comedy Laughter has become tired and the genius behind it seems to be very much. <br /> <br /> I love holidays as the next guy (even if I often see bad cases of holiday blues too), but it seems like it's a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that will only be bad movies of the year, but it's a season Does not make less painful. We already had enough Santa Claus movie (three and * gulp * still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? A plot in the house with the Santa Claus franchisee of Disney (sometimes funny humorous and the "Little" helper, wearing a small skirt), is a fun acclaim for Fred Class 116 minutes. Of course, Jolie Ol 'St. Nick is a brother, but where does it go from? <br /> <br /> It's really shameful. Fred class is blessed with a cast that it can create a usable Christemstime comedy that will probably melt away with ice, but it was even better. Vince Von is your standard snake, but we believe he is really the long-lost brother of the older Santa (Paul Gaimatti), who invites him to meet his best brother. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant and more of a bad expert (Kevin Speacy) to visit Father Christmas, and it has stopped being closed. Hah! And the mother of Santa plays! Of course, Cathy Betts. Elizabeth Hughes, Charleston of Elizabeth Bank, one of John Michael Higgins's Elves, and Rachel Washes Fred's girlfriend! I do not know whether to compliment casting or bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to join a touch, but they are given very little ways to work with. <br /> <br /> For comedians, Fred's class could probably come with Santa's brother, with the exact opposite of a DJ LF and some jokes. I acknowledge that there are some gigs involved with Fred's celebrity brothers (where he joined Stephen Belvedwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone) in a group counseling, but the giggles begin and end. Even worse, the film is encouraged even in feelings that teach us about "feeling better" and telling us what "Christmas means to say". Obviously, Christmas in Hollywood means that the rest of Christmas Christmas shopping is being made as much as they can. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** 5
