I recently saw the revival of Brazil "Blith Spirit" actor Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ibersol and Jenny Atkinson. It's an awesome product, and looks better than what a good actor can do with a game that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is very funny as Madam Arcti. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake, so that the film version of Rex Harrison acting drama can be examined. The film does not have the power to produce or smile at a good level. <br /> <br /> "Blith Spirits" is probably one of the plays that works well with live cast, with those who are laughing with the audience. Actors can touch and signal for their performance and lines to be supplied, and may include an audience at a personal level that you can not get in the movie house, or to show a DVD, which is different from viewers. Story "Fourth Wall." Story: Charles Condomin (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives in a house in the English countryside with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummins). To search for his next book, inviting a book of the supernatural church, Charles Madam Arcti (Margaret Rutherford, the rebuilding of his role from the main role of London's production of 1941), is a local spiritual medium, which is to run a soldier in his house. Charles believes that spiritism is a shame, but hope to take "trade strategy". However, Madame Arc brought the ghost of Charles's first wife, Elvira (Kay Hammond), who died seven years ago in pneumonia. Elvias refuse to leave and Charles raises an ironic rivalry with Ruth (only Charles can see or hear Elvi). <br /> <br /> On the stage, actors can act like those who can invite such humor. But on the screen, "Blith spirit" actors drag through the lines so that they do not know that someone listens to them. They have been designed to get laugh at the level that the box mumble. Harrison, Cumming and even Kai Hammand's performance flat and lifeless Just like Margaret Rutherford Madam Arcti seems to have maintained his spark and humor. <br /> <br /> Oscar winning visual effects in this movie are not possible - not just today's criteria, but by the criteria of 1946! They are mostly walking around Kai Hammond's florous green document and makeup, taking pictures of them looking like an illuminated ghost in special illumination. <br /> <br /> The movieographer deserves some credit for creative discussion. But the real influences of Disney's "South of the South" - compare the visually impaired visual effects of "Bleep spirit" - which was eligible for the same year's prize. "South," people and animated characters share the screen together for one minute at a time. Compared to "South", Oscar received "Blit Spirit" for special effects was completely ineffective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's close. For the film with Rex Harrison, exclude it.
