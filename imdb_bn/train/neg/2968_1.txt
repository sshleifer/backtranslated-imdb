Ignore (if possible), the cast of this film gives a reasonable credible performance to severely marijuana smoker (which seems compulsory for Australian government-paying movies). It's a far away from it. The rest is just horrible. This plot has a lot of burden with "wow" symbols that look good in movies but can not go anywhere. A grave example is to float the giant pitch, possibly left from a city pard and donated by the local Canning factory. It is expected that it was open for destruction, but it was irrelevant, prop! The pitch is given at a stage under a vague, obscure wash, but where it ends. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Stefan's father-in-law "black spot" killed by the road marked the road to mark the road as its symbol, but what is its turn? He made a great deal of care especially to care for his visual obstacles and helpless, loving patience and care of his old female guardian. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allan's characterization. Alan successfully played a successful role in the main office of the trade union's trade, but "rats" on his fellow workers became a supervisor for a wicked multi-national! Whistle! As a supervisor, Alan plays the wrong dirty work of Boss. Finally, he avoided, surprisingly, the whole tree closed down and Allan left for himself because of a helpless, unemployed failure. No clich-free area here, companion! Not only this, but Alan has lost the seductive stifle from the most unlikely relationship you have met. If you think the plot is malodermatic and diabetic, do not ask for details. What is the importance of Steve's tempting legs shaving cream? Why at the hotel, where the couple does not love, at the end some of them get one of the biggest entries in their biggest bedroom, and among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly dirty - quite spectacular on one occasion. Take this picture in one word: Skip, Skip, Skip, Skip.
