This has got one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a series of nervous breakdowns (I think) a rebellious college basketball player, his tough-performance coach, his girlfriend and fellow student (played by Michael Margota). The story does not go anywhere, there is no development of zero characters, no one to take care of, and performance is terrible except by eliminating Bruce Darne as coach. It's hard to believe that a talent like Jack Nicholson can handle such a horror movie. Do not forget to avoid this turkey.
