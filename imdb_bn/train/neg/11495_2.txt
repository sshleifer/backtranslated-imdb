Over the past few months we have seen that it is a perfect plot line and quite a bad performance (mainly from supplementary characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie in DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie ... <br /> <br /> Hog Lauri made a lot of effort to learn to dance to Samba, but the scope of her character only required that she submerged herself at the end of the pool's kiddie. The movie is based on the appearance of a beautiful girl and great music but it is not enough to entertain it well. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rio or British banks, then this movie is for you. 10 out of 2
