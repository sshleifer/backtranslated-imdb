Although many people here praise this movie, you have to be careful. It has no logic. I think there is a good work in Basing's acting, but you can not make the thriller when there is an impossible lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene can draw a good picture of the movie for you: Basing is followed by the killer joke, he decides to sit on a picture found from his pocket and look at. The photo comes from his daughter and it is "we love you mummy" Who does something like that? What iftar? And when I say that it's almost stupid like some other movie scenes believe me. Someone said that it is a "hidden gem". Well, I must strongly disagree, this is hidden for the cause of the movie. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to comment on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D, the lack of logic does not bother me small amounts, but this film is largely possible due to the lack of logic. But, I can still give it 4 because it's a shameful logic, but it has some moods that I'm seeing at the end. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see it, you know it has been warned.
