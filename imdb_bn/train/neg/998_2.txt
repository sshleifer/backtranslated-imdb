Generic Movie Sinopopis has more information than the movie, but it is quite bad. There is a description of the paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page, which I could not move away from seeing the actual movie. I found myself trying to find out which one I missed, I did not know that I could have been asleep. Well, there is no profit - if you could tell it a story, leave this movie a monstrous piece of story. It seems that they are trying to fool us that there were such films, which made a lot of filming so that there was an analogy of the story and the rest went into our fantasies. Newsflash to the makers: I've paid you for making a movie. I can sit at home and imagine plot and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? I have not given enough attention to this person to give me a name, and I can see why. I have never seen any movie, A, or B for any major role, in one of his most artificial performance. I think it's okay, he really does not want a role, just got a great offer for a movie that he was not in? Wrong He is listed as one of the producers. The next time you create something, if you can not work, do not lead yourself to yourself. If you can really make a decent character for you to become. Also, here's a white / Latino problem - yes, I'm not interested in saying this, but this film comes as a revenge work against white-age men, who wear baseball hat. There is nothing funny about the audience in the film Latino characters. The Adrian character seems to be a cakery coroner, which is not better than the protagonist of the story. For the character of Maya, she does not feel like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie is even made.
