I love the song of collision and I like Joe Storman and The Messelleros music. I went to this movie which most of the people would like to know about the people behind. But I came out of the theater, I did not know much about Joe after reading the Wikipedia entry already. The film never gets by the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was to collect their little material, shiny blurry videos and some interviews about Joe Strama in the camp fire. This proves that most of the people do not know him or not, and the director only wanted them to tell more celebrities in the film, "Oh, that was an inspiration for all of us". Like Bonnie or Johnny Depp (whom they apparently call his pirate costume to benefit from the current success of his career pirate). It seems as if the director could not wait until his body was cold, he did not really know the person who lived before selling his version of "The Best Punk Rocker and Hippie Heart". > <br /> Of course, as a fan I used to listen to the images of the band, listen to the writing on the back of the song, and in the end I thought it could be said to be 60 easily as the portrait of Joe Stramar. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < One rich word melts all its rich influences together.
