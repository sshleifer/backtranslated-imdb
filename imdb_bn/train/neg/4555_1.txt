These pictures book fails to capture any of mysteries and conspiracies. The main aspect of the book, the insights did not touch clearly, the spectators wondered why everyone made so much big deal about them and why they wanted to risk their life. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. Do not leave a background or personal development to the viewers who are not really taking care of what is happening to them, and so the sequences of actions fall flat. <br /> <br /> The search of the manuscripts suddenly disappears and without any real explanation, without any feeling of satisfaction that what was for the full search. <br /> <br /> One of the worst adaptations of this book I saw was It is awesome and time wasted If you do not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and it will be relocated. <br /> <br /> It was like removing the book about making the movie, how bad and ridiculous this film is. This is very embarrassing because it was capitalized on the success level and they were probably able to get a good photographer and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time, read books !!!
