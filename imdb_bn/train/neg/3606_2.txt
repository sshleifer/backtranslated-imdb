This movie is the worst movie, but it's too much for me. How it should be in a slasher movie It happens in a university where only a small number of students are present. The teacher hammer is dumber than a tariff. This is a good Catholic pastor, filled with smiles of sexual abuse. Bad hair, bad clothes The conversation is so clipped that it was difficult to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. Slashings have some creativity and think that genitalia people turn around the holes. I lacked the soundtrack and the continuity of the characters that they deserve to die for very bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Cheap beer and some friends get a case, see it and smile.
