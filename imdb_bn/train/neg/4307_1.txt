Apparently being a sunny movie is supposed to be a thriller in the air. It called me "O my God!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Deduct some paint for some time! <br /> <br /> (This movie released in 2003 is already shown on TV in July 2003, which indicates the quality of the film)
