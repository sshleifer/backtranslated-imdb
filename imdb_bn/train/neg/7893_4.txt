At the beginning we can see the start of some kind of secret council. It looks very promising to get it all. With some occult cast cast, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. A good block seems to be that the main character is demanded for his hardship and for other reasons. You really empathize with the guy and you just want to know what's going on. Usually a person must have different options in his situation. Because he does not have those options. This film seems to be the only solution when it is clear that it is not his fault. From the blue he encounters the letters of the church, prayer and those who talk about God. And they answer for their problems. At a point in the movie it must be obvious that what this solution is about. Now tell me that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always helpful. But in this message disguised it was really necessary. This religious element actually destroyed the experience of seeing for me. Although the message is good, this simplicity can not be needed to do more in real life to solve the problems presented in this movie. The mystery presented to us is never resolved. There are basically nothing to do with the plot that is forced to deal with other issues. Do not fool Malcolm McDowell Once the brilliant actor is adequate, but if you watch closely, you will see that he is not serious. She really will be frustrated for the money. Otherwise what would be the likelihood of an actor's ability to play a movie like her.
