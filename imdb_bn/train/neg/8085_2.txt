Hello shit! Hello joy Another picture that is so bad! Or, so I thought. In fact, it is "the best is good enough" to be straight with phejati missed and sorrow, "it might not be so bad, but they destroyed it and makes it worse." <br /> <br /> On its way a very long way too long. Cut half an hour and it can be more tolerable. তারপরে এই ধরনের হাস্যকর প্লট যেমন "পৃথিবীকে বাঁচাতে মিশনটি চালাচ্ছে এমন মানুষ, কারণ তার সমস্ত খাবারের ভাণ্ডার আছে এবং যদি মিশন ব্যর্থ হয় তবে সে ধনী হবে!" Duh! Or the "Conversation Bombs" plot device was last seen in the Dark Star. Guess ... Like the Dark Star, the bomb is a bad thing ... Hmmm. Add a dash of "We can not do our job outside of a kindergarten game" and your brief description is a solar crisis. <br /> <br /> জ্যাক প্যাল্যান্সের রূপে হালকা ত্রাণ আছে (অথবা জ্যাক প্যান্টস, আমরা তাকে এই ফ্লিকে ডেকেছি), যার একমাত্র উদ্দেশ্য মরুভূমির চারপাশে একটি বাচ্চা চালানো এবং বাচ্চাকে টেলিফোন করার জন্য টেলিফোনে পাঠানো .... শেষ পর্যন্ত। In driving and phone firing, Jack distributes non-drill drill and layers and many cakes, but contributes little to the story. In short, he is the best bit of movie. <br /> <br /> "Most e-ronic delibhreda straight-line phyasda" This is my reward hesanake Charlton, who in his remarks at the first showing of his eldest son, his son, a "shaped" Looks like he is shaking belt And Captain Kirk is standing there for a terrible need of corset. The top HENCHEN, which has a bright white hair hair, which reminds me of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to this Hillary, there is nothing to suggest this movie. The closing is a sequence from 2001 to the last sequence (but less hungry). <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie more, if you are too stupid to see it, as I did: <br /> 1. Imagine it's time to talk to the bomb (imagine it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever the screen hyastana chalk and talk, to read a line from Planet apps, such as the pre-release "Get your dirty legs off me!" Or similar. <br /> <br /> 3 Whenever women have to look at leadership (it is most of the time) hope that she is enjoying an innocence and will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. Wonderful Time "The ship is broken again," Hold scenes, Technology / Engineer will be shocked as they hope Scottie-ismera "You can change the laws of physics!" Or something like shit <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do something else that you want to do through it. I crossed half way and realized that I did not miss anything, I did not even have a plot (though it was ridiculous) any better. So do not worry about tuning for a few, you will not miss anything.
