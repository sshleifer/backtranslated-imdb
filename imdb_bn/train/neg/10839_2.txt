This biography was shown on the channel and was about as informative as a child comic! I gave it 2 out of 10 detailed explanation because it felt at 70 percent in most parts and the three women who played the three angels were like them, so that the makeup is good. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a biography biography channel, but it generally rejects everything that is usually seen in their biographies. Living interviews with living members, crew members, production team members etc., or their biographies of any of their friends, family, and people. In fact, as far as I knew about this concept, I saw this movie based on the (presumed) biography book. In fact, to learn something that was not known to a program and there was no general knowledge that never happened.
