I recently bought the DVD, forgot that I hated the movie version of "a chorus line." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers sped up and ran. The show's hit song is completely cut off if given the full meaning of the Casey Case. <br /> <br /> Because some of the great numbers are still able to enjoy despite the efforts of film to shrink joy and spontaneity.
