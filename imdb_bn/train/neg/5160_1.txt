You get a gift It is fine wrapped. The box in it is made out of wood and shows the skills up to the smallest detail. Then the most talented people of artists paint gorgeous paper, handmade and hands. The whole thing is covered in fine tails made from fine silk lace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that Toy's. You enjoy packaging, or forget it. <br /> <br /> The image is without its point and purpose: war is not a good thing. Well, not real! The moral is so clear that it is almost embarrassing. And even that weak insight is covered by a story that is a battle of warfare - especially a bad thing, as long as they need an exciting climax and follow a war using movie innocent toys. It's like a person who is preaching harsh, sophisticated speeches, just by saying "just kidding". <br /> <br /> But as an empty box, the film failed to investigate closely. Yes, this is the scene to meet with some amazing, interesting images. Fantastic set and cinematography catch colorful scenes with efficiency. But the picture is cold and emotionally emitted. Like plaplay, the look of the film is lovely and sometimes aesthetically brutal and spiritual. It is a film that wants to praise the toy as commendable and special, yet it creates them in the empty and cold world. The film tries to be funny, a thick sort of way, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as a helpless heir to a toy production empire, tosses his ad-libby into shotsick, which seems to be the only living, cold-structured world inhabitant. In fact, overall references and colorless sex which is spread in the scandal, it is a disgusting contradiction with small stories, film trying to vaguely. This film needs to be done, or in the sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an oz moved away from Kansas. Each time Jokes blurred us in reality, the movie's playground was gradually becoming a clear narrative. <br /> <br /> It is believed to be director Barry Levinson's pet project, which he is trying to create for ten years. It is tragic why he had problems getting backing. Like most pet projects finally created (Raidoland Murders, Radio Flyer and Battlefield: Earth is an excellent example) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's perspective. Probably directed by Leivinson and redirected Taiys to his head, he eventually did not get a new perspective on the soundstage. He had already perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the movies featured toys clumsy, mechanical, wind monstrosities. So the film itself.
