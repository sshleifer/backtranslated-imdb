I could not believe it. I had rubbed my eyes several times. Was it true? Yes, there Billy de Williams, Jeff Convoy, Maxwell Colluffield and Tracy Skogins - all of them had some talent but here they were adding a sparkle of cinemax-style skin, set a spaceship on the board! Sorry, "Alien Intrador" is unique, Computer Virus / Alien Dennis / Harpie / any other name you name is Ariel (Scoggins) around a high-virtual reality station on a spaceship board where four people have their fantasies Are allowed to survive, because the system is seen by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here everything acts like a good padded episode of "Red Jewel Diary". Williams is everything on the right and the left side, and it looks like he wants to do something else, elsewhere Ah, what people are doing for things ... <br /> <br /> FX is quite static, probably less than what you expect for such straight-to-video cheap. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you expected. SEXUAL INNUENDO Here's the real star and of course, it gets the best view. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that does not have all the lively and no brains, then see "Allen Enterr". Of course, you might not see any picture in the morning at 2 or 3 than the signature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Leave space one of these lost.
