Sergio Leon is the spin of his grave ... If there is such a picture that a person has a trumpet in life, then it works. The lead character "Lonely Sheep" of Bravo is vague and hair, and this script was apparently written by a monkey with eight grade education. Anyone who had this idea should whipped the horse. The only reason I'm spending time is because it's a minimum 10 line. Sergio Lyon's family should not be sued, because of his shit, but now it has been immortalized as a shit by MS 3000. Sham Disgust I blame Hollywood ... At least Gary Busy creates such dummy that does not insult anyone of cocaine users and weapons experts ... This film is pure condemnation.
