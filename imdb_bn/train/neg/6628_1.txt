I would be happy if the scale went negative. Sushmita Sen looked beautiful, Nisha Kothar has a bright future, but producer and director has lost some enjoyment in this story. Concepts from the angle choices, light choices and good things to keep in mind to remember. Oh, if music and dance do not tear you off your ears, the first one. The film could have been made 1.25 hours twice, and was quite good, like "Seven Samurai", but if the director and writer "Direchersfolk" eventually did not go to that direction even if they want to find and get their backbone. This movie has failed in so many levels: editing, writing, photography angle, style, light, script - name any aspect of this movie - it was BAD - probably the caterpillars were bad. I've never seen anything bad in Indian (Bollywood) movie for 6 years.
