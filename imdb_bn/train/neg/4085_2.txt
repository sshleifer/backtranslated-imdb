"Sir" John Gilgood has become a silly starring star in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of these movies, I think it is "art", but Don 'it's a fool ... it's trash. Stay tuned for the story that you can admire in "frames" because such labeled movies are usually such an out-of-date fraud. <br /> <br /> In this great compilation, Goghud reads Shakespeare's "The Tempest" when camera pans are nude people away. One of them is a small child in a swimming pool, urine. Wow, this is the title material and the real "art," not ?? That's just an example. Most stories are not understood, it is impossible to follow and therefore, Liberal critics fear that they "can not understand", so they give high marks to protect their phones. You want Shakespeare? Read his book.
