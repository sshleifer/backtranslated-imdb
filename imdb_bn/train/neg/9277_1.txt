I watched Omne at the age of 11 on TV. I enjoyed Trilogy. So when I finally saw one of the movies, I did not pass it. I went to the movie to know that what I was going to watch was not a movie, but it was made for TV. But I can not resist being a fan. But in the middle of screening this omen film does not cool down. Opinion dialogs such as "It is written that if the child is crying during baptism, then they reject God there." What nonsense No modest set pieces. Fear Grant is so good with this script from V. Hake to scrap it. No suprises and no fun However, I laugh loudly most of the time in our worst times. 10
