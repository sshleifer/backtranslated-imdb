What I can say about this movie is that it was occasionally fun, and it was a sufficient time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I want to slap those letters around. It is a sweet film that is very sweet, it hurts your teeth. The motives were good, I think, but when conversations are very annoying, things are tired. When two leads are not screened together, it's not really bad, but be afraid that the couple starts to talk to each other for a long time.
