Prior and Gleason's comedic ability This dog could not perform this mess with tissue-thin plot, weak script, uncomfortable acting and humorous continuation. It has a very few memorable moments, but better to dry quickly. As a child, I think these two actors-comedians are remembered as a hidden hot car, but in each scene there was some curiosity about what was meant to flow and the feeling and overall relationship with this plot. Seeing it again after many years, it screams at Scolc-a-Mania. I am not so concerned with racial debate, because I do not think of taking a film with a little less. The most obvious drawback to me is that the scenes have been presented in a 2-minute situation, like a lazy series that is not related to the comedy bits (any very good series), which was then collected by the editor after the local water hole. Characters change feelings, motivations, feelings, and scenes, without any rhythm or reason, and it does not seem to have any idea how to get out of any script. It did not start any gem. I feel bad for two actors whose legacy has been damaged by the disaster that should never have been. Maybe my sense of humor is very refreshing ...
