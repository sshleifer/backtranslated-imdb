Clearly, "social comment", "nightmares" on racism and prison conditions in the 1970s is full of bad Southern stereotypes, which are complete with Phoenix accents. It will not be objectionable for most American Southern sensibilities, this Toadry piece of work comes just like a thin-incognito "Prison Children" film - especially in its ineffective original version. However, acting is generally more than average and late chalk cones, especially in viewers, do a good job of hating him - though he feels somewhat uncomfortable in different scenes. There is also a dynamic role for the change of late Robert Reid, who has been changed to Letter Warden and Tina Lewis (formerly "Gilligan Island"). My grade: d. <br /> <br />
