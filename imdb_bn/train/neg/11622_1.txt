Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back in his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should fix it over the last girlfriend. He remembered the end of the day's relationship. Dream order lacks only lazy transit He sincerely remembered their favorite songs and the place they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe there was something to do with a failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets his half-brother (also divorced) a lady who begins to be interested in her instead of being "stopped" by her crying. How Do I Dave Reveal? He sometimes refers to himself as a third person. When he walks he does not undergo surgery. It's just weird Make a long story, kill Dave Plot Mary (old girl friend) and kill him ... wrong ... I face him. He does that. Which was really unclear. He believes that he will get married, yet he takes half way across the country to meet him. Before she "drops" on her, she alone, stood out of her house to make sure. He has a strange conversation with him that ends up sharing the Gospel of Christ with about 10 words or less and giving a new young girlfriend back. We mostly enjoyed the movie for the weird comedic quality. I'm still entertaining wife with my Dave Impressions .... "I heard another Dave and Mary song!"
