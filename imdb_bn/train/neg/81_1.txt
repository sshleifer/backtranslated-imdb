Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait to finish. The plot was stupid. Acting was terrible! Especially by teenagers. The story has played thousands of times! Are we just disappointed to give actors a job? The previews were interesting and I was really looking for a good thriller. Life on a moment brings a good movie, it is not one of them. Until I do something else, I can not avoid it completely. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would tear my face against the brick wall for two bricks, then put it on the paroecaide. That has been more entertaining.
