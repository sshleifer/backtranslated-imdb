Well, in constant search for horror, we'll come across this movie, apparently being re-released in DVD for some notorious reasons. The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. I do not think it's a bad remaster or for some reason, I just think the film is done badly. <br /> <br /> There was definitely no doubt on the cheap beer which was painted in a abandoned school with a budget and no talent hack, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not take the speed up to an hour long. At first, we will see a 'nerd' as a group is selected ... I actually 'knew what they might be ... jocks? Charming, he was very ugly with his hunch, he must have been cast as silent. Then, a 'big guy' and some mobile phones and girls are considered 'hot' but it is not. This is a mystery why this group is rejecting their own, but I think viewers seem to be picking out a 'cool kids' one. Casting choices are horrible, because most high schools play thirty-three. Here other critics have mentioned that the actors (if you can call them) are a bunch of broats, whose accents are slip countless times across this part of BRAC. We are left to assume that this 'child' was the only student of this group, their 'reconciliation' was only shown to them in schools, which are now abandoned, only theirs <br /> <br /> The killings are not good, hair is not good, and the script is similar to that of Scott's Scooby Doo with the real man; Like the line: 'This place gives me cripps ...' and 'someone is giving a beer' highlight ... this is not right. If you get lost with some friends and do not want to have a slasher laugh at a real lame effort, then leave this one. If you want to look good, get Bawa's "Bed of Blood" 14 years ago and get a great deal of good hack. If you want to see a good BAD slash see "Just Door" or "Burning". 10 out of 2, kids.
