After the 'Paris, J.T.Ime' love, I have hoped for this movie and I admit that I went to high expectations, but due to a number of reasons I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> Although I was not expecting the reconstruction of New York's Paris, I expect the same structure. What I like about 'Paris' is the neighborhood breakdown. You got a style each director styled and story they wanted to say. In NY, there is no clear separation of stories in various aspects of the film, the characters of different stories move to each other, which was watching me and confused about what I was watching. Also, the switch was clear on the instructions but there was no flow from the confusing. <br /> <br /> I like about Paris's film. Another thing was different love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unpleasant love, an inferior, middle-aged woman of love for love, discovered many levels of love complexity among humans. 'NY' only seemed to go for a radioactive, top-top sex. Some redeemable shorts (the old couple lived together all along, Julie Chris's short), but the overall 'NY' film did not express any emotions for me. I'm not connected to Paris with any letter. I remember seeing in Paris and deep sadness, loneliness, desire, confidence, surprise ... it was just so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went to it without lounging Paris behind my brain, this image might have a more favorable response, but 'Paris, Jay T'aime' was reeling as a self-titled I was extremely disappointed .
