Terrible acting, bad story line, Chess makeup, and this is just ice tip. I have never seen a bad movie in my life, within 5 minutes, I decided to make a decision to go ahead whether there would be any redemption ... It was not. (In addition to a beautiful breast shot) the film was portrayed in some furniture warehouses, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the set. You can see this same red chair in different "locations", but if you rent at least one office building and an apartment, then no warehouse will echo out all your actors' conversations .. (Note to manufacturers) Small office space and for one month An apartment is much cheaper than a complete warehouse, and both are quite a bit versatile and trustworthy) Spend your money to rent these people, but I hope you've got this return guarantee ... you'll want to get your money back ... I spent $ 2.99 on rent this night and I remembered.
