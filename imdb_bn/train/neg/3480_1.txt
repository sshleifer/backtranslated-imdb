This movie is terrible. Terrible One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine that this is going bad. The previews made us "no", but then to find something there, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> Stupid US <br /> <br /> Affleck is not an actor. He can look good with a picture and explosion, but Bruce Willis did not even get into "Die Hard". If he hijacked his shirt and ran into a fight against bad boys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part is Catherine Ohaara - she's always good. Gandolfini flops again (if it was not for Sopranos, he would be washed) like he is in "Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck said each scene hogs and others - someone has no motivation for their actions in character. <br /> <br /> Take away this movie from all costs.
