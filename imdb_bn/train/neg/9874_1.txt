A fairy and his family who are a foxs about a fabulous book. That is being stolen from the farm and killing the victims. Until one quarter of the peasants they did not have enough of this fox and tried to solve the problem "solutions" in different ways. They must be "fox fod" at every turn and the family disperses against three farmers' land when the three are out of camp in the Fox hole. <br /> <br /> The "film" version, and I use the film is, of course, a horrible pastiche of American films, especially the ocean movies. They also led George Cloning to humiliate even with the story of Mr. Fox and even misses the story. So they have to do so. They will earn a lot of money and another classic Road Dahal Children will destroy the book.
