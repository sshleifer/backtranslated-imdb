Long ago I have commented here, I say this movie is bad, but what I saw is not bad. This comment will not contain any direct reference to movie plots or sequences, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I got a feeling that I was watching a TV show or some episode, where they kept some extra $$$ (I look worse than them) to spend in CGI ... above all, the audience It is very humiliating to you, at least if you have any knowledge about your computer and / or technology. There are many of these moments of humiliation to comfort me, and I've been begging myself to begged for the last time - through a quick half-way through. In addition, there are countless "easy way" scenes, which seem to insult your intelligence as a thoughtful man ... <br /> <br /> This movie has been fully exposed to the old "Wargames", and I think it Have a shameful shame, even call it a signal. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, one thing and one thing only: the performance of the actors is not bad at half, considering they were working with a script regurgitated shit. However, they do not have to sign in to this movie. Not really a career-taking, but I guess we all have to pay bills. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < My only explanation. <br /> <br /> All of those who did not see it: Always look and build your mind. But the floor is less than your expectations (and then some).
