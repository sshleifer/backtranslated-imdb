This is actually chicken rider and some Indiana Jones, comedians, and acting. But after all it is a soft core movie, which is expected and does not matter because you are actually wanting sex. Which is the biggest problem I get, it's always there anyway. Which one do you think you are watching TV at 3am and independent films are going on and it has been made by any college kids who are not going anywhere in this industry. If you have a very long time left to wait for a real sex scene, you think you're going to happen, then just hanging left. One (probably two, or one with two parts) is actually very happy though that actually goes anywhere. If you can not find a clean out bout for a dollar or two, personally I can not recommend it. If you are lucking up for a good movie with a plot and well played, you do not want this. If you are looking for a good soft-core lesbian film, you do not want to have this.
