In recent years, I saw one of the worst movies in the world without a doubt. This story is directed to loot banks around four women, whom we consider to be sympathetic. It is difficult to be sympathetic towards such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police have us, they know who we are, what should we do? Let's loot another bank, then we're here! What!?! Each character is a stereootype and it's easy to say who's dead.
