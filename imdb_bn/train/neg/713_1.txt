At first I can say that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up on IMDb to review it especially. And my review? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film summaries seem to be striking - Nazi, secret, time travel, but the plot of the film failed to bring these elements together. Remember the South Park episode, using the 'Concept Ball', the manaites wrote the family Guy? Did these men write hail? The author wanted to include all of these ideas, but there was no idea about how to link them together, and then to make things less sense, the tourism theme was finally finished during Donny Darko-Esquiera, br /> I can quickly say that this is a bad movie. Special effects were very low budget for some better than direct DVD. Acting was not great, but justified I've seen bad. I would appreciate the Nazi picture, they were frustrating, but the Bad Nazis were a joke just by the guy. <br /> <br /> I have no vengeance against this movie, but to be honest, I am even in horror section. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or play. If this story was well told, it was a good movie. But it has been on hyped. Waaayayay on hypocrites
