I saw it with my mother and we were ... <br /> <br /> What? We do not do it at all. I could have done this wrong, but there was something to do with this woman's father's death in a chair. That movie was terrible! This is not a movie that loves movies like this. Bad mystery movie! * Rattan rocks in movies * I do not see it again. And I'm a big fan of lifetime movie, too! They must go out trying to make movies outside the book. It made me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> Whitata was ugly and yet, she loves more than Hue, which was very nice. <br /> <br /> My rating is 1/10
