Mother, I do not start with this angel horror movie. Bad bad story is saying. I do not know what the director is thinking about creating this movie. Nostalop London was quite enjoyable movie to be honest. Even the soundtrack was good. But this one .. my best .. a movie which is supposed to be a musical .. song soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /> <br /> Two great actors should have done a lot of good work. Although the first half sucks, the movie ends 30 minutes OK. Salman and Ajay's performance protects the movie from total disaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the last Bollywood movie (and I see a load of them), Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
