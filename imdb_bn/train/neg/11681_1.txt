This movie was better than a trailer movie. What is the talent and meaning of waste? I waited for this movie to come in the DVD because at least I did $ 9. The movie completely misses the mark. What could be a great movie for all actors, it has become the best as a B-movie. The film has gone too slow and when I think it was going somewhere, it almost happened, but it was not so. At this day and age, our film requires unpredictable plot twists and closures, and this film is not even given. The whole thing about how everyone is suspected is good, but if it is not guaranteed, if it is indicated, light, line supply, writing or what, nothing comes from it. A lot of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this film, and I do not see everyone see it. The whole Saxophone music movie of the chaos has been worse as well. And there was nothing to do with the rest of the last film. What a disappointment
