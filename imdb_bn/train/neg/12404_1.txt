I must say that this movie has been blocked by a murky and middy, when it was seen that I was cold, even I had a bit of a bit of myself. When the Korean man kicked him with a spider on his shoulder, I was like him my lord Asian people smell and suck because they always eat dogs. Chalk was somehow terrible performance behind the track and there was no non-robotic human intelligence. Some people will compare their days when he was a car wash analyst and believed in ghosts of holy ghosts and Christmas past. This movie is so bad that I kept my new child in a new box and Mr. I left Norris Mailbox. He can raise my baby. I'm taking him to a world where he thinks Chuck Norris is a cart expert who was ill, let's see how his life was in the real life for the rest of his life.
