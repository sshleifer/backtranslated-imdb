I hate this movie. I hate show. I hate everything about it. It's so annoying and stupid. Nat and Alex Wolf are all the heroes of the music world and they're going to grow it up. What kind of drugs are you accepting? !!!?!?!? !! Nate and Alex will end as Hobbs or will end like Jenny Hodson's "What happened to the baby?" From I did not see more than 30 minutes of the program, only 30 seconds to listen, and I could survive half an hour of band's war. In the Kid-Choice Awards, how can anyone be happy about this boy in the audience, I have no idea. A few days before the movie premiere at Nick, most of the teen daughter actresses of Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) were influenced by how horrific dramas and the effects of Alex Wolf on dead brains. First off, they did not tie me, and secondly, the drama and Alex probably dug them or paid them a lot for their money, because I did not see anyone watching this show / movie entertainment. Music is just awful The musician of the drama sounds like a sick, dying on the cracks. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER. He's not funny, he's boring, he's really weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he ever managed to get laid. You know that this show is fake when you find out that some characters (in real life) do not even exist! The character Jesse was actually played by Nat and Alex Cousin JC Dropper (he had some budget problems). Their father is not a single, he has married a poly dropper, but he does not appear on the show, it seems to be less than the mother of the wolf. Rosalina does not exist. His name is Eli Demeko. I would say, wolves will stay in the Brothers deep ** when their "fans" find out the whole thing. 0/10
