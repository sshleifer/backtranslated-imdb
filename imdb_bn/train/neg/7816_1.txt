It's really that the Superman comic book is incredible naive and their goal is not ten-year-old matter. What matters is that "Superman Returns" bad movies. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, a question for you is the favorite reader, how many people do you believe that the superman will defeat Kevin Space? anyone? As I thought. No spoilers here So now come up with some big things right now. First of all, this movie seems to be commercial (see Superman / Clark Kent on the scene at the bar, Budweiser is the only view which it is supposed to be). Imagine Superman's commercial, two-and-a-half hours long. Let's say it is not "amidadas" or "stuck". You actually think, this movie is a very long way. And special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is silent. Sometimes some of the comics are acceptable, movies, it just looks stupid. And it's like that in this case. Of course the dialog is insulted. I can not believe that someone took money for their writing. How often do we feed villain with villain lecture? How many times will the laws of physics be rape? (Jesus, it's not just about Superman's power, but also in relation to content related to him.) How often will Louis Lane be fooled by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers seek a story of a trash comic book? It's hard to make a good story, why having a weak story for starter? It just does not work. Friends, get a grip Please try hard. Or just stay on this strike forever, who care. I think that WGA is a permanent strike. There is no crime. I'm not asking people to pay people's money, but they provide quality of products. There is no quality in this field. (At this point you can ask yourself: is it bad? Yes it is.) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting weakens, Brian Singer (general suspicion) indicates that it is quite surprising. Kevin Spacy is having fun, but he is the only one. The audience is not the mood for joke rather than joke. Things are that comic book, including the clear motivation of the hero of the hero, but doubts, fears, can be developed in real personality with some depth. In this case nobody has done that, and the letters are not really interesting. Finally, the makers of the whole effort turned into this movie parody. The second unit is so bad that draws attention, since there is nothing interesting, whatever on the screen. They try hard (if they try), it gets fun (but you can not hope you can expect). <br /> <br /> final decision? One word: shame <br /> <br /> This special movie, Women and Ment, Camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money. Stay at home, read a book.
