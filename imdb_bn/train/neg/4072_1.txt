I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be bad movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, it was so bad, I actually did a review to try and save others from a completely annoying mess. <br /> <br /> I am spoiling my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> Even using a clean room, even hair. So annoying. 'Bloody Freaks' or 'Shock, Shock, Shock' is completely sticky, which has some talent in entertainment. This dirty looks awful, awful, and anyone should feel it horrible.
