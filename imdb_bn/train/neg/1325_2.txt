Richard Dreyfus is actually this flashing, but in a small part. He is not a "obscure" film maker - he is the businessman of the group / accountant. Even the box incorrectly describes the film. There is no erotic scene with Sondra Locke, as the advertised, unless someone uses the word "lover" to each other. Besides Richard Dreyfas, I did not consider being a big character for watching the film. However, I could understand that Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne" was an artistic influence in the famous 60's, Lyonard Cohen. Apart from the short text of the line from James Joyce's "Ules" and without a striking visual reference at the end of Angerman Bergman's "Seventh Seal", I immortalized symbolic elements and moods in movies "last year in Merianbad" and "Yu Chien Andalou". If you like the idea of ​​brilliant art, there are a lot of higher films that are available from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Sicil B Deamedade".
