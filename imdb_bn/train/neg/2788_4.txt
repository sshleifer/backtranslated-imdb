Most butterflies have been written about rain, "Quinn-Essential" musician Bio Cinema, although I'm here to tell you that the film is not worthy of high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all let's get one thing is a great musician directly in the Prince and an area where the music excels a violet rain. Even the score is becoming fun and if it is shot entirely as a concert film it will be a great experience, unfortunately it is not and the movie has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, the violent act / author, the character of the Prince, seems to be terminated as the mysterious lone of some words, "unfortunately" it simply stops sculpture and shallow. The character of the good Leoner must have at least some conversation moments, unfortunately the character of the Prince is rarely on some of the film's conversations and it is hard to believe that she can get the girl in the same way. Everything seems a little over here, which is shameful because you can say that it is a character that is very contradictory and lives very complex, but we are not allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What a wonderful view of this movie is about the concert? The life of Prince and Morris has put a seat behind the performance shown here, which I think is understood from a business perspective, but it is tedious for 2 hours of movie, where apparently half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character back stories are available <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,
