Julia Roberts has apparently made a concerted effort to reducing her cotton wool's beautiful beautiful personality with the COP virus abuse thriller, but it is hard to imagine that she is strong and determined (and winning Oscar) based on this garbage Erin Brokovich And do not make any bones about it, it's not much more than Julia Roberts's car, but unfortunately, its performance is not the worst case about it. <br /> <br /> The last night of this plot has all the signs - for the wire, and do not be under the impression that it will provide insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because the lack of letters is not enough for you. <br /> <br /> Finally frustrating and unhappy, except Roberts's name on the title, I'm sure it will be completely flopped.
