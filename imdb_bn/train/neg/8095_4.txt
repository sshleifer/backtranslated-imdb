The point of the original novel of Wolf - in fact, is the point of the whole story - these are due to calculation of costly attention. The goal is to survive in a particular type of life style. The novel is scarce full. Relationship between emotional relationship between Sharman and his daughter Campbell depends on the only relationship. Then, everyone is out on the way to preaching, power, money or self-esteem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His reaction was a denial. Finally, he lived in New York and was a member of the Improvement Committee and other praiseworthy organizations, who qualified for denial of denial that he disliked New York. (Wolf has American Studies PhD in Yale and there is no dummy.) Those supposed weaknesses make the novel a memorable one. Nobody was good And Sherman McCain broke down, a professional protester for social justice. This film throws everyone down and imposes moral structures in the story which simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was originally in reality. Each event was not only possible but thoroughly credible. Wolfe might have created a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get inside a system and record his story. <br /> <br /> Yes, we could have found ourselves ourselves, as Sherman and his mistress, stuck in the South Bronze, threatened by several black kids, and created a holiday after bumping into them among them. That scene is transferred nicely from celluloid to printing. <br /> <br /> After that scene, the film can not believe in its audience, and sometimes it becomes terrible to try to make the message, but the message is absurd. <br /> <br /> Sherman can accidentally kill some children and may be arrested for him like a novel, but after being released from jail, he does not immediately go to his expensive expensive condo, take shotgun and start shooting in the ceiling, he is moving Not as It is supposed to be a fun scene, the ceiling plaster falls on all the party guests and they scurry, shrieking. It just did not happen. The film has kept the vaguely detailed reality behind the novel. Oolph's sensitivity, he lost the work he had in reality. We instead get a cry, pretty, and silly scene that does nothing to wake up the audience. Following similar scenes, shouted for Wolf's impression. <br /> <br /> This film also fails because it offers many sins and releases in an entertaining story regardless of moral. Here we look at the opera "Hark don Juan" We get liberation lecture with the poet. We see many crimes in Sherman. A black judge spreads from the bench and gives us the final lecture about how we all begin to behave nicely again. Sorry for Sherman after a reporter who turned him into a varnish meat. And a happy ending that Sherman is breaking off the law with a stupid Green. The scene is sitting in the movie like a hat on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film does not only create some points that are already quarterly and irrational, it upsets them, as if the audience was unable to absorb any benefits. <br /> <br /> It's not acting or poor that direction. The movie is not bad at all. And the photography is also quite good, with two spectacular shots - Crisler's building's garage and condom landing. It is the script which is thoroughly botched. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie, concept and execution, okay. It keeps some details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog names are Marshall. Who will give the dog martial name? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guess out. The authors and producers did not have the courage to take them out and created an opportunity for interesting study of New York.
