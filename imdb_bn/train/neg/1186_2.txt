Wallerian Borouczix La Bate (1975) was clearly taken in different ways: Some were frustrated, some were frustrated, and others praised their courage. Although I am completely obsolete, disturbed and unable to stop asking myself why the display of intimate, incoherent images is displayed around the central theme, showing a subdividness of intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie actually? Increasing sex in a woman? I saw great movies about this, but it's not one of them. A girl can try to illustrate the growing sexuality of a girl without trying to play her role not only as a descriptive device but also as a descriptive device for growing animals (in the nude). Where there are no characters, there is no character research. The woman abused by the beast is not a teenager, the girl had sex with Black Butler (she identified as a beast?) There is a very big attitude about sex, so where is the continuity? Is it a movie about religion? If yes, we need more thematic material than the priest without our deeds, character and charisma, but a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Is it lively? The metaphorical feeling of the film bans a practical experiment of life, especially the realistic characters of realistic testing. So no real animations here. Some mythological animals and two priests talk about the sinful sin with each other. Is enough topic for a college essay? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> What is it about sex? Is it something about me I do not know. I only know that a film showing a fired gun is not a fight movie. Working on a topic should mean more than displaying your associations with the theme. <br /> <br /> See the debate. Do not be afraid by supper, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and ingredients. I do not See another story when you see it and you can discover that it is a bad, bad edit, bad work, really bad writing (ok, some pictures are quite beautiful, and the main character is really looking good girl) is a director who is slowly developing the brain Slowly thinking about killing Bush, Sevral masturbation will create an intelligent story. It's not It makes annoying.
