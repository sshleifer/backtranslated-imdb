If you hit your teenager at the age of 70, you probably remember stories about Studio 54 whether you liked disco or not. An exclusive club, it was a perfect symbol of cultural overindulgence and self-absorption of the 70s; There is also a wonderful VH1 documentary about the club, which can tell you what to ask for your wishes, and the stories are very interesting enough for an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Sadly, this is not it. 54 Some of his staff members, Shane (Ryan Filip), a barber, Greg (Brein Girl), a resident of his wife, a coat-check girl, Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course master show, Steve Rubel (Mike Girl) Though the club-goings are well-presented, this movie makes Chen's story more concernful about the personal life of workers. <br /> <br /> works on film spirts. Sometimes it is the solitude of nightlife cult (such as Shane being taken to a dinner party and does not know 'Errol Flint'), it is completely captured, and on another occasion it becomes hakki melodrama. Something that is implicit in the premises ?? Do they rotate because they are mixed between the rich and imagined world? But due to the many child-glued treatments, both clubs and rubles are offered throughout the film. Raul, in New York, certainly showed his reflection of visibility and every night with his scenes of public hype, although drug and sexuality in extreme quantities only touched little; And ruble itself, when its torture is mentioned, then there was a strange positive effect on a person who was a liar, deceit, drug addict, and diverse as all hell in life. I was not looking for this man to be astounding here, but his ego directly contributed to the collapse of his club and the reduction of nightlife culture which he helped improve. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Effective but he is good, and he helps film anchor. Philip, whom I usually see as a good actor, is hammsted by the stupidity and stupidity of his character; He is limited to a deer-in-headlit smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he can not translate that into a strong performance. Heike and the girl are both OK, again, behind the writing, and Neve Campbell ?? Mainly featured on DVD cover ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is also not a film that specifically attracts me, Despite the prefix to choose it. I want to say that the era, or that club, is interested in you, but look for VH1 specials than this middle middle road.
