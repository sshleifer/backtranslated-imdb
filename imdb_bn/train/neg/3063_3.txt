It usually means that a hero is glorious. For example, Bunny and Clyde Dynamic Bank gave glory to the robbers and you felt sympathy for them despite their bad deeds. Why? When people were desperate to live, two people were depressed. <br /> <br /> There is no substance in this image. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon appeared as a guy hero. Why? He is going to the hospital at the speed of Idaho where he is taking his dead wife. Nobody understands why he is trying to run away. Even worse, when realized that he is not a red-throat terrorist, the government does not want their help because they try to save their backwards. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestly co-stars built on the story of emcee who empowered our hero <br /> <br /> The incredible ending.
