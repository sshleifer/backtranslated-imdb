I'm out of the library right now in this library and I did not see it. It's too bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had completely lost his talent, though he did most of the 'Robin and Maria' finishes. The worst thing about this overwhelming stupid film is It was really a cause of interest, because it was her last feature film and Dorothy Straton was present before her death. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but separation between Gaza and its chronologies. Little signals and a little trick and a real sculble comedy which is the smallest, feather shadow. <br /> <br /> Who can believe that there are some people in the Manport that Hepburn has lived so fascinating and even mythological in the 'Tiffany Breakfast' before the 20th century? The soundtrack of the old Sinetra song and the Garshine song, which is taken from the title, is very loud and clear - you definitely do not have to wait for the credit that the picture is squeezed in cine-muscle when the songs explode to you. <br /> <br /> 'Typing back' means returning and returning means again. In this case, Audrey Hepburn Chico's European lady you see before anyone that ever was an actress and always a star. Here he has lost his talent as a star. If his genius continued to grow like an Ann Margaret, as he played a role, then he had some life, even incredibly bad elements and the circumstances of the Mongoloid level were also given. <br /> <br /> Hapbaron was a great person, of course, he had more dreams than most movies, and he was once one of the most engaging and beautiful actors of film actors. After this terrible performance, he created Robert Wagner with an obscene TV movie called 'Love in Love'. 'They all laughed', though he is still playing a role in his 50 percent. Even stressed to do this work, like Len Turner, was much more intelligent and clearly less intelligent than the actress Hipburn. Even when he was bad Turner took the serious acting. Hepburn does not take it seriously, it can not get disturbed; Even her hair and clothes look tacky. His last truly good work was 'Road to Two Road', probably its most perfect, perhaps if it's not his best in any way. <br /> <br /> And the girl who plays the country singer is just sick. John Rutter is terrible, there is nothing to suggest this picture that saw Dorothy Stratane, who was really beautiful. Otherwise, the critic David Thompson's 'used to lose his talent' has not gained much knowledge using the term. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Ben Carrots lost all sexual appeal, so we have two pictures of Gajra and Hepburn who can ask for something ? Two years later, Sandra Dee's last, beloved movie 'Lost' was nothing short of budget. At least Mrs. D had spoken in his own voice; Audi Hippbaron's pronunciation was just fooling in 1981; He is going to PDS's 'Audrey Hepburn's Garden of the World' and he was going to do a somewhat nonsensical pronunciation while he was walking through the English garden with the nobility, 'the most liked of me when I return to the nature of the flower!' 'As a daffodils of nature, but a real fantasy movie, she just seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It seems that 'Tiffany's breakfast', such as Audrey Hepburn, was the lightest poetic thing in the world with the deepest one - she must meet Garbo, one of the most beautiful screen appearances of 'Maya's Fair Lady'. Delphin Sirig 'Marinbad last year'. And then this! And in Spielberg's film 'Always' the angel had her final brief role as 'Happ', much more of the lady's knowing and stifling. <br /> <br /> I went to her memorial service in the fifth place, Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that includes a song 'simple gift' to the singer of a boy. The only thing listed on the show is that the song 'The Moon River' singing the Hepburn was suddenly playing, fleeing the 'Tefan's Breakfast', and there were many emotions in the church and some real tears. <br /> <br /> is a great actress ('The Noon Story') between many 50 minutes and 60 films, and one of the biggest and most beautiful movies in the film, who was a real bad actor. That's common And perhaps this is a great man who took a strong uninterrupted mindset to create small things like the performance of the film, which wants to highlight the flaws - all the work in his late film is in abundance. Most of the talk about Haupburn is about 'My Fair Lady'. But the main actress should have been 'The Wet of Dark', which played Lee Remik in Broadway. Never been celebrated as the Hepburn, she was a good actress in many ways (The Hopburn was actually completely unable to play), although the Hepburn was at least adequate enough. After that, all of his acting went downhill.
