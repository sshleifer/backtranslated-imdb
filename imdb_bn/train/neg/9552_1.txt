Just plain old stupid good. <br /> <br /> I'm not really stupid like a fool, killer tomatoes or Ed Wood, it's probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. An insult to Turkey to give this movie a golden turkey. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American film and art, then we start the real world war 3 and 4 at the same time and make cockroaches better. Afterwards run the show. <br /> <br /> Now, to stop this humiliation by closing my single Brainsel, I have to be drunk .... <br /> <br /> If you are suicidal then this is a really good movie.
