Comedy has been successful with the real programming using Central Professional Comics. Chapel shows, Mensia of Mind, The Daily Show and the very popular Colbert Report were all tough guys, in the case of professional comics and all or Chapel shows. Sarah Silverman was one of the best female comics in the business, when I was tuned I was expecting good things. <br /> <br /> I was very frustrated <br /> <br /> Somewhat gently was the fun continuity, but the star that Silverman's sophisticated could be more than that. It was just a pilot, and hopefully the next week's show will be better. If not, get some help from her in the form of a good writer for the show.
