Well, what I can say, there are B-grade movies and B-grade movies, and it certainly comes later. It is obvious, however, that filmmakers also know that this is not a creditable film (watch out for closed credits), it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot was originally killed by a convicted murderer. . He accidentally mixed his genetic material with some experimental acids and then got lost in the snow. The killer now takes a snowman shape - you can believe it. Snowman, Jack Frost, who followed him after the country's city Sharif. In this way, Jack Frost finally killed half of the city. <br /> <br /> There is no real fear in this movie, and these effects remind me of 50's B-grade movies. This alone makes it worth watching for a smile. Pass a movie away time.
