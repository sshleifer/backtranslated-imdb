The plot of this film, character development, and Gaga are all very weak. It's a waste of time. The conclusion of preservation grace is bright and vague, although the letters grew through their struggle. Such a blurred feeling was not such a development. Drugs are clipped and most of the films do not seem to be true. The plot is supposed to be tense but the build care is not enough enough to improve. Then, when leaving the feeling of viewer, it wastes their time by resolving all outstanding issues within a minute of the screen.
