Horror movie 3 is hard to keep in words that are difficult to keep in words. It makes Mali's most popular choice, like Oscar material, just to say it. <br /> <br /> The real horror movie was a great fun, one of the more than 90 extraordinary films, which came from a wonderful team who would not have a Maine in the South Center while drinking your juice on our front. But what happened ?! After the tragedy of the horror movie 2, I thought casting and crew would help matters, but worse than that. <br /> <br /> I started to laugh twice in 20 minutes. One does not laugh, Jokes are recycled and the originality was probably no factor. At this stage of writing, most of the people in this site voted it, 10/10 I felt physically ill. While there are great flickers like the School of Rock Out, which are really funny * Gasp * fun, so anyone who waste their money wants to check their heads. <br /> <br /> No star / ****
