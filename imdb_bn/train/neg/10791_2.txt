Terrible movie If there is a Turkish movie, you should not avoid it in 2006, it must be done. What a waste of time. The movie does not achieve anything other than a cheap laugh, Nada, Zilch, Blue. The dialog is cheap, and sex clinics are on it. The director needs to see more movies before directing his direction. Red-headed women show an example of what an actress should not do. Interested in learning if you do not want to work but a perfect example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the film is to wait, wait, I can not say anything about it. I really really dislike it to write it about it. Tell me!
