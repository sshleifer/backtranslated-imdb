Please do not fool you of this movie's cover. And you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: It's not it. Usually it would be funny if I went to the stupid, but this stupid was almost stupid (or possibly) fooling me. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < These problems should certainly not stop showing a horror movie, but add this amazing (tears) cast and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is about a person who invited his friends, weekends in the family cabin in Texas. He extended his invitation to crush his lady in the office. On the way they meet a woman with difficulty, then she is invited to come with other girls. <br /> <br /> There is sex and nudity during the cabin and soon everyone's children are in a bunch. The girl disappears and the strange thing goes around the house. <br /> <br /> Try to determine what is happening to you (the audience) and the body, um, the actor, and they soon begin to disbelieve each other. Overall, I think it has made a good word out of it. The main fight of this film is that the characters are very less subdued, the plot is compressed, the acting is bad and motivations are shameless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie will not be created in this sense anyway. Do not let this review stop you from the amazing scene of Shearer of this movie. (Oh, my nose has increased just eight inches.)
