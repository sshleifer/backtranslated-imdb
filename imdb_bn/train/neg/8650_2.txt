If this is not for some overwhelming fools, I know that I see this "documentary", I have never seen this comedy! This picture is full of bad scripting and ridiculous moments. Especially one is where Afghan police / soldiers arrest Dawn Larson for the filming of the street and allow cameraman to carry the picture of the arrest and then go away, still filmed, perhaps in his Polish hotel. Then a scene in which a car gets upset in another car which is parked neatly on the road and it is parked without any evidence of a crash or explosion. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that currently gets the rating (5.8 / 10). I thought the IMDB users had more knowledge
