Drawing Restraint 9. Deer: Matthew Barney <br /> <br /> How do you know when you are in the middle of a provocative artist? There are only 8 lines of dialogue within 140 minutes? What is the shock when an incognito-Asian show is showing a giant fog on his head? Perhaps when used in superb turds and spine columns in a whale blubber test. Or, when you're ready to kill the composer to create a short, and still boring, of a Phillip Glass Score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is most prone to modern art films. In 135 minutes, it adds bitter to its boring and adds its tendency. I call the stunning use of colors, and the opening sequence is interesting, but the rest of the film is portrayed as a discovery channel documentary. It seems as long as they try to portray the version of P.S., but it is coming later. <br /> <br /> In fact, the documentary-aspectier part was the best part of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ceremony to make whale fat. Then, guests like Bijoy and Matthew Barney welcomed them with a show of despair in Dhaka, including pass-head heavy shaving, nicotine patch, and giant fairy beta cap. . Then do not forget mutual deportation, cancerism, and giant Turkish. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney writes about "the relationship between self-integrative prevention and creativity" It is almost like saying, "If you do not find it, you are not creative in your explanation, so I'm not an artist." Oh, wait, this is post-modern explanation of that sentence, and what will happen if it is post-modern. However, it is supposed to be the modern industry. Which itself is about art. <br /> <br /> So, start the whole interpretation, right? The following lines should not be taken in only 3/4 serious and in the real effort to explain the movie. <br /> <br /> The first half hour reveals the pearl divers and the construction of a giant ram. Obviously, the ramp identifies any of your values ​​as a symbol of self-reliance and pearl divers learns the pearls of knowledge. Then, on a wheelchair ship, they made a piece of look like a cane shaped shape. Clearly an essential element of forecasts. <br /> <br /> On the ship they make whale fat inside the size of the air and exposes the part of the bird. They replaced this with a spine column and later a giant turd. This movie is supposed to be the kingdom itself. When its fat, it's entertaining but bad for you. When it is the vertebrate column, it can speak "important" parts of the movie, or backbone. Then, the giant tune is the heart of the movie, or when the movie is reduced. <br /> <br /> Wisdom and Matthew Barney are inserted into strange abusive parties to reach the separate ship, which is not well-formed or SYMEMETRICAL, they were trying to quit smoking and suspect that Barney smoked. So, they put patches on his head. They follow a custom and know about the ship from a Japanese knowledgeable person who says that when the ship hits another ship it decreases; A crash or intersection, if you It inspires Baikak and Barney, who are different from outside, start cutting each other's legs and eat so that they turn whales into themselves and become the same person. They intersect Oh, did I forget to mention that it was done in Robi Williams video? Then, the pearl divers come back with their mouth, the knowledge is full of pearls, which they fall to paint a stupid vane. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, most likely. Or, at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have forgotten the Ken-Gazing-to-Mary-score wizard? Sometimes it is hypnotic, but to others you just want to kill him. <br /> <br /> Art art is one thing, but when you throw all kinds of emotions in hopes of getting people's response, it becomes a self destructive joke. Do you cross the line in the art form becoming a joke? Dali and Bunuvell often used to make minimal pieces of bokchandra but it was more coherent and / or more entertaining than the trash piece. Un chien andalou could be as less as half an hour as the increased sensitivity as symbolism. <br /> So, can I recommend it? Only if you prefer high-hit ART film with lots of symbols and flat imagery. <br /> <br /> D +
