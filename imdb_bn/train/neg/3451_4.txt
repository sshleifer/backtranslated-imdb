Frank Sinatra was far from ideal actor for the West. He was a great actor, from where he got evidence of Easternness and the Man of the Gold Arms, but he did not have the body of the Western hero, you identified him as an urban man. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Conako, which was not a fault on the box office failure. I blame it for two reasons: a) The story was very unusual, in particular, the senators behaved like villains all over the whole movie. In a way where a specific pattern expected from humans is expected, the film will be very good. B) The story is not trustworthy, it is difficult to believe that the whole city will allow the city to do what she wants because she is afraid of her brother. Also, when a man shows him a special holster who opens the roadway, he will not be able to make a gun that if you make him unbeatable, then why did not all gunmen accept it? I think this film should not have been withdrawn because, because of any film with Sinatra, and it is still enjoyable despite its losses.
