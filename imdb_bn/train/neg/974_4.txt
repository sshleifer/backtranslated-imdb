From its description it seems to be entertaining and attractive. But to me it was a bit down. Very slow and hard to follow and see what's happening. It seemed as if the filmmakers had split the film into pieces in the air and collected the way they landed (not explicitly in sequence). Also, no results are being filmed at nothing. I have seen a few different Korean movies and noticed that a good part is well-made and needs to think about part of the audience, which is usually different from Hollywood movies. But this one befuddled me ultimately. I saw the image second and third and it still did not do anything for me. I still can not understand what the filmmakers are trying to say. If only a normal human part of a person's life is shown, then I guess he is successful. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
