Yes I saw rough cuts. Unedited sex scene Awesome cut scene. The film is almost equal with 'The need' for terrible acting. This movie is as bad as bad movies. It's bad scripts, bad acting, bad effects, bad positions, bad stunts everything bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its extraordinary ability to run the car badly, when it is apparently reduced by humans in the bunete (test the windscreen image), The inability to rotate on its left, the class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. Plus its a remarkable use of a toy gun in its props which guys are not even bothered in the disguise as a real gun. Other actors on screen could only have supplied their lines. It was not a half-time waiting for a line! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who do not deserve it do not pay.
