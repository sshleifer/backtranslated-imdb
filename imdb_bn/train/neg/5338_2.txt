Elvis Presley plays a "half-line" native American ("Indian"), who has been able to protect his reservation from a nasty business tycoon. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight, and make babies. War, wrestling, and "how to tear" each other replaces "how" stereotyptic hand-raised expression? <br /> <br /> Although he has made up, Alvi is better than appearing in the previous movie. ; Most likely, he was ready for his famous "return". There was nothing to be excited about this movie's script because it could not be. Joan Blondel is trying to fight Alice and Bur√®ce Meridith with "war paint", should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song "Stay Away" (Actually, "Green Slave" with various songs). The most shameful song is the "Dominic" playing the love song of Alvis. There are some spiritual scenes, but it is not enough trappies to succeed in that style; Although, "Stay away, Joe" may laugh a little bit if you are right "moody". <br /> <br /> Stay away, otherwise. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter TechSabby ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meridith, Joan Blondel
