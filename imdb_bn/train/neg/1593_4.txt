Hadio gosara 1969 film "hitokiri" (myanasleyara; uka "tenacu" - Heaven punishment) of the main characters, many real historical figure ( "Western" name-command format): Raima sakamato, hamipita takaci, simabei Tanaka, Ijo Okada, ____ Anenokoji. The historical term "hitokiri" known, refers to a group of four super-soyardamyanera in mid-1882, the ruler who led the killing tokuga soogunete of the personality, "layalista" (ie ultra-nationalist, pro-Emperor) Group Group Group. What was this struggle? Sorry, you can not find this image. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Than the actual history publication. For example, Sakamoto, was considered to be the father of Imperial Japanese Navy, who was someone of historical significance. The nearest Goshna comes to provide a history lesson, among which Taqami believes the treacherous traitor is a Sakkamoto, trying to run him ideologically in Tarek's palace. He started with talks with Japan that is very weak to defend against foreign war crimes and Japan against the Japanese ports on international political situation. Want to know more? Sorry Stop this potentially impressive lecture in the middle of the rose medium! (!). There is a lot to tell about his audience about a curved point in Japan's history. <br /> <br /> The movie confused me with the aim of these two sides in this struggle. Shogunate Japan was an institution for the prevention of social change in Japan for the defense of feudal relations of society for more than two and a half centuries. It is fearful of pollution outside both physical and technical. In maintaining this spirit, it banned firearms, the "level level" machines of Europe and America, with which a farmer could stand up to the samurai. In this period, the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead. but <br /> <br />, feudal fiefdoms in the city in the neutral zone, which is a new class of business, landlord and artisans were developing - - Europe, its French name, known by the bourgeoisie class. Uncertainly, this new class gained strength, it forced against many borders of feudal society. In Europe, the King (Emperor) became the central character of feudalist imperialism against the bourgeoisie's struggle. But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class that it works in. When the outside world reached a bank in 1853, the Japanese admiralty of the US Admiral Perry "black ship" was thrown into crisis. They did not match for their foreigners. Also, they heard the debris of British and French imperialists in China. What will Japan do to save yourself from the fate of your weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements were generally interested in opening trade with foreigners to acquire some of the advanced technology of separatist shogunas. The film represented the scene by Sakamoto (just barely). On the other hand, takicira ultra-nationalists believed to represent the emperor-faithful that they might be forced bidesiderake if they are "selling the country" to detain another team. (Known words?) In this way, the orders of the killings of the Shogunate are properly done - and we go away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The inspiration for techchi is for me, the biggest puzzle in the film. Gosa proposed that he was fighting primarily for personal progress instead of loyalty reasons. Can we take this to fully represent the tenor of loyalists? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the "goyokina" a kryakalim, suspicious, adventure yarn, worthy of sympathy with a hero, "hitokiri" is plodim, is nowhere near as soft and There is a lack of such a hero. Sakamoto could have been the protagonist of this film, but we did not get permission to know him - nor did he stand for that - enough for him to achieve that. /> <br /> good score for its previous five <br kurusaoya see movies, Maseru saotera score here was very disappointing, "bananaja" from the episode felt a bit rejected. <br /> <br /> Barry is free
