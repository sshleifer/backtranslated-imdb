You will get 5 authors together, each write a different story with a different sequence, and then you try to make a movie out of it. It works, it's adventure, it's science-fi, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie stinks absolutely. 4.5 It is giving an extremely high rating. That said, this is a movie that makes me think I can write movies, and I can rarely write.
