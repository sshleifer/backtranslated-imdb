Can anyone make a good CGI movie without Pixar? I really want to say, the animation was old by the standards of 2006 and even the Tao Story Standards of 1995. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat is flushed down a toilet. Yes, I know, seems stereotypical. But then the seam mimicked the way of London - at a level. Jewel (????) and an evil (??) frog throw in a promise and you get a compassionate effort at recreation. <br /> <br /> I want to tell me some entertainment. Maybe hook up in the picture? Or maybe happily-ever-after-rat relationship. But nothing did. It was a genius, but blew it. D-
