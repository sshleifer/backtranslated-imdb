All known characters were nice to see again, but the story disturbed me. We love the first movie Ariel - so why is the second girl centered on her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like this plot. Worst, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Arise's voice! Disney, stop removing classic cinema with this shoddy imitation.
