This is about the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie coincides with the quality of movies as "Thiey" and "Cabin Fawwor", but even the name of the actor was where it was reduced. The film's "eye candy" shows up to 50 women with a bad mouth lift. (Just an example of the quality). If possible, I could negatively rate this movie. I want to tell you that men were not bad at seeing, but not much. If you plan to watch this movie then I would strongly recommend saving your money.
