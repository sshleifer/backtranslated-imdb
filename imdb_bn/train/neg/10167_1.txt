This TV movie shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw it was that it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. This is Super Bowl in New Orleans Superodom. However, there are no football games and we see basically nothing to see behind the scenes. There are no differences with many stars in this movie. I do not really know why it's seen.
