Kazam reviewed and it is not difficult to say a bad movie - Finally, when critics came out of it, they overthrew this picture - said that it was among the worst movies of the decade! So I'm sure that it is bad to say it or someone else thinks it's bad. It's someone like to talk about WWII - actually someone was saying that was not a good thing, right ?! There is no question in my question and IMDB, it can answer "Why did they do it first?!" Finally, it is clear that anyone who is seriously harmful for the brain will be awesome in that film. However, Edie (a baseball playing chip), QOL AS ICU (popular popular vanilla ice), Troll 2 (it has no triangle), Babi Jennies (superhero children like Einstein) and movies outside Pinocio (Hah !!!) It proves how stupid a cellphone can be, making it bigger screen! So, the idea of ​​the best basketball player of the day is neutral 'natural' by acting as an overwhelming little brat genre! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like a free willie, this child somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words, total brat) and you know that any selfish and fearsome Although it is not the case, he learned something at the end of the film and. Just once, I want to see a hijacking child, at the end of the prison or after death! Eventually, when the surrounding bully kept him in the middle of the pamiling, Jonie Kazam (Shuckle O'Weal) was released accidentally and strongly advised to give three wishes. However, the child does not believe in him and jeans magic seems to be a tidy rusty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, unlike most children, he avoids his will, whereas, Ghazam is forced to follow him everywhere - for example His own personal servant And, according to Clichy, you know that at the end of the film, Max and Kasam will be friends forever and a bunch of tears will spread. Oh, and Mac will talk to his absent father and mother drunk (I'll gag). This gene is obviously a bit of a social worker. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very weak. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think maybe maybe at least rap well! She is an amazing basketball player and I heard she's a nice guy - but a rapper ... There is no way! As far as his acting goes, he was not great, but there was such a wonderful personality in the film that it is hard to hate - even if they make him a lot of fools. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard that the movie is so terrible terrible? I did not say the first two-thirds of the movie. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikely child and a bad script However, later on in the film, it gets worse - Karzam seems very concerned about helping the child when he really needs it. And, nowhere else, the plot really gets, really strange - the guy who wants to make Kaizam a rap star (?!?!) Becomes an evil gangster! And, maliciously, this man confesses that the jen without any hesitation! In addition to <br /> <br />, the end of the film attempted to kill Max and his father. I know that the child was boring, but it seems to be a children's movie! The writer does not understand what the child is trying to kill ?! Then, by the end, it probably creates the worst children's film that ends in history, Kasam God or something and drug-inspired hallucinations! The end was even less than the one in the black hole and the higher ... and the boy, it hurt my brain! Ughghh - There was too much to bear the horrible dialog !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a horror film that most writers crave properly. Yes, folks, including a messy up message, are weird non-friendly friendly elements and awesome characters, it's a naughty film. Sadly, given the idea and actors, it is hard to imagine making the final product worse! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ready for the British TV TV's "Bernard and the Jenny" - starting from the beginning Charming and exceptionally well-written films.
