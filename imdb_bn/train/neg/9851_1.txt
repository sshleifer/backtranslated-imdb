Even worse, worse than the David Lynch "Kupusathan", "the brain dead" does not make any money. Disgracefully deprived of talent (Bill Palman, Bill Paxton), they roam like acid "Tom and Jerry" cartoon. There is insignificant character development. In the roughly chaos, it only begins to climb "weird scale". The above fine actors do not sucked in due to this. Nothing is given to work with them, and you will be surprised that the whole world is impossible for 85 minutes. I refrain from avoiding the "brain dead" at all, until you spread your brain into a total fool. - Mr.
