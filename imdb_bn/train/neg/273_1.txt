Sign of a classic movie It's like a fine red wine-like age. This movie is no Cabarnet and of course no Casablanca. I agree with other critics that the children of this film are unfortunate changes which now affect us in the night, and the conversation is low and propagated. But let's look at the movie's obsolete theme. <br /> <br /> The history comes with 60 years of history. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been released from his book "Pentento" as the Chaitanya of Baidensake with so-called real-life story "Julia". Western-based USSR was the most illogical of the forgiving, it apparently inspired its film and film to take action to save the international communism of the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and fascists in America, who just proved that <br /> <br /> a critic correctly mentioned That's not American-American drama and movie, because Lilia His grave was the child of an American-hated communist. This image is American leftist that is known for the intellectual elites that magnet stupidity, since now the Daily Kos and Michael Moore bought the left moon conspiracy theories and those who again gave help and comfort to destroy America.
