This movie is just plain bad. Weak stories, weak instructions and down the average acting. The thing that really annoys me was messy advertising - continuously - for a well-known internet provider. It is visible that some scenes are just written, advertisements This movie is the face of anyone who has made money with this money. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this, your time is worth.
