Just a stupid old movie. The son of the first Stanwick was trapped in his cell phone, and her husband pushed her to his toe's toes. In an effort to save him, Stannieck gets unhappy, yet again, and comes across a criminal who escaped. He has a chance to kill him but fails in a very stupid way. Finally her husband is saved, and Stanwick tells us what the stupid message of the movie is. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, an unreasonable woman like Stanwick never made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's Glamor-based Golden Age. That nose so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The image is hungry short, running for an hour. As the director feels that he is being bullied, he thought that it was good to keep the shorts short.
