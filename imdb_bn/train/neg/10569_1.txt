During the foreign mission, I have tried to watch this movie in the military camp, and tell me, you will see something in that situation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first five minutes played weak porn-movie quality, strange tale plots set twists and sounds by incredible situations and behaviors. It gets worse after that. There is no saving grace in this movie, and it is not as bad as it would be fun to watch. It's just horrible. I have seen a number of movies in my life and I am not one of those hobbies - all the critics, I mean they will enjoy most movies even though they are bad. This one ... man <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This friend, my friend.
