This picture was a big letdown. The cruel cruelty and violence levels in this movie were very annoying. Some scenes were really unnecessary ugly and money spirit. Even with the main character was impossible to detect even sympathy. The lead hero's character was slimy as they were coming. The sick house / hothouse atmosphere over-the-top theater itself. Little or nothing can learn from this picture about the Spanish Civil War. Thankfully, I went to Spain and did not realize this realistic! In addition, the use of same sex attraction as "horror" is also very objectionable and poorly handled when the DVD is being packaged and being advertised to attract gay visitors. The actors felt uncomfortable in their role as if they were trying to remove themselves from this mess. I think if you have seen the brutal killing of children and pets, then this film can especially appeal to you.
