When I heard the plot of this movie, I just had to see it, I mean that the whole city is being erased by the killer tomato! Sadly, it's interesting as the headline. <br /> <br /> A special team of military and scientists led by Detective Dick Mason (with Greg Colburn that never closed SCBA's team and pictured without his parachute behind L.) 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' is one of the B-movies Parody, especially in the 1950's, Japanese fearsome. Before washing the film in the kitchen, we started slowly with a piece of tomatoes after washing it in the kitchen, as we watched tomato this lady and told you that it is not a sannar or film progress! At the right moment there are some funny moments, for example, Japanese scientist. Nokitopha is dubbed his word at any time in American accent, or when the camouflage expert Sam Smith abandons 'hei', can anyone pass the keychup? . Equally the film was probably better in 1978 and gave it a complete idea. Unfortunately for the 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes', pseudo-film releases such as 'AirPlay' and 'Necked songs' are released and this kind of comedy is very good. <br /> <br /> The actress is tortured; The editing has zero continuity and it really feels slow and lacking in energy. For a parody film to work you have to do a lot of things at once, a stain after the over. The music of the film seems to be uneven and the furniture store ads in the flash store across the screen are even right-winged for this movie. Finally, but you can see why this film is a religion? I can not see many people being indifferent to it. Unfortunately the terrible way I would add this.
