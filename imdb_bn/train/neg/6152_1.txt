When many say that this is the "worst movie" I have ever seen, they say that they do not like any movie. However, in almost 700 films, I can remember that this person is personally away from the humiliated and angry feeling of being one of the one. This is the way to review my first film, and I have been registered with IMDB for the badness of this movie. When I was in the theater I went to see it (I and my two friends were 5 others) and after 15 years I could not remember many precise, but my attitude is still crystal clear when leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> --- Spyler warning --- <br /> <br /> Where are you going? Losing the fat beside the altar, ski goes to the weekend, the blonde meets with the bombshell, who takes an interest in her, takes her home to meet the family, they are all cancerful and she's the main course, the tragic endeavor to escape dramatically, all of her butt and brother's girlfriend Run off with, they lived happily afterwards. Vomit First of all, messs were so bad that they were trying to suffocate, and this was a comedy. Special effects, what some are, looks like they did 15 years ago. The big dramatic ending was so humorous and poorly played that it was almost intolerable to watch (he hangs the whole bird on the lanes, standing on Tom and Jerry standing on the style). I'm sure there are a lot more, but I have no intention to see it again.
