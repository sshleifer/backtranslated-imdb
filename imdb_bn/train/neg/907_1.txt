I wrote a further review of this movie after buying the DVD and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to see it again after reading some comments from him. Being a filmmaker and creating similar budgeted films (i.e. a budget, shot on dg cam), I am standing by my real comments. It's not a budget student project (and not particularly good), get rid of a video / DVD watching an award winning movie (if you read the cover). So cheating people is thinking that this is not something like that. I want my money back under business details! Completely garbage!
