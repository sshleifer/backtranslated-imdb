Oh, what a painful BORING SCI-FI movie! And that's especially saddening because the inauguration of 15 minutes is so full of action-pack and potential! At the institutional time, we followed a bunch of nervous security officials and hired men with a briefcase full of top secret files which followed a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory as they hired. As he is believed to be held in the lab, the terrible and inhuman acts are expressed, he is executed. Statistics ?? Then, 'action' lagged behind in two places, the laboratory mentioned earlier and in the rural palace of a corrupt senator (or some), and it quickly became clear that the test was actually a bitter reversal. More dull, dull and vague like Scientists have selected four random people without living relatives and it is really true that they speak the truth, even though a giant machine can read the contents of their minds. They all conceal the dark secrets from their rotten and suffer when exposed; Yet I failed to see how these tests could come to humanity-threatening devices. Perhaps I've missed something, but I doubt it. Following interactions between patients and doctors is even less interesting, because none of them have personality. So basically, "brain machine" operates a bunch of people living in a comfortable furnished room. Although the building does not have thousands of shot shots, the film can be half-hour! Moves from the lab to the Villa and on the opposite side are indicated by a five-second shot every single time. Either the manufacturers really need padding or they are just notified that all the Sci-Fi viewers are unable to change the location by themselves. In just 5 minutes, for the tenth time, boring in a abandoned bridge with a palace in the background became very annoying, I assure you. The performance of James Best is rather fitting for mental problems, but a man can not explicitly protect this item from waste completely. Avoid!
