This tragic picture carries a little similarity to the 1971 Broadway resurgence which was such a 'nostalgic' hit. Remember that when Bert Chevalov ordered that revival, he reviewed the book. I think that this screenplay has changed a lot from the 1925 edition too. In 1974 I played Jimmy Smith on-stage, "innocent Philander", and thought that this $ 1 DVD will bring back memories. There is no chance. Even the "topper" expected joy of seeing Rowland Young was a big disappointment even in the 'my' section. Three songs remain from the game, and are done very badly. Even the classic duet, "Tea-To-Two", is acting as a virtual solo. The very familiar face of this 1940 Fiasco does not make itself proud and the star, Anna Negal, embarrassed herself. When I feel the dollar costing to be zipped, I know the film must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is known as "Tea for to Two" and is going to play Stage (essentially, of course), so the real "no noetite" searchers can find more recognizable versions.
