... okay I read this photo somewhere on the internet, and many criticized the bad movie and sold it. And I can not agree more about it. Then I saw this movie DVD, I was thinking twice about this and then started this movie business on TV. Thankfully I saved my money for this piece of shit. I was offered my sleep for this photo and soon it turned out that this movie could not please me. So I can not judge how film is made, but anyway ... it still sucks. For those who liked this picture, I apologize for the awakening of this film and tell about how the film is distorted. I do not know what you think about this picture?
