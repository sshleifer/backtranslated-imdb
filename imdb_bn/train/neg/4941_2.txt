I really do not think of geoco's first 50 ads, so I saw them and even saw them a little surprised, but strictly! This is the best thing that could come with this man? This shows sucks! It's great and an episode of "The Office" caveman's incognito characters (I know that you hate me to say a lot, but "The Office" does not just do it for me). All right, I got it: Our poor slab is trying to keep his nose clean and there is a drunk boss who hates her; Disguised-intellectuals who really have a seemingly functional intelligence; And Dopey is the one who just wants to take, but so what !!! I have worked with these people and I found it boring in real life, just as I did on TV ... Why do I want to exclude another 1/336th of my week? Please call your parents and after asking them if they throw you on your head, you still feel yourself entertained that it is entertainment.
