I was also curious about the rating rating for this movie (8.5), and I was very disappointed. I just saw some good foreign films and was looking forward to creating three in the row, but it could not be. I went with a Spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There are a lot of plots, if not there. I certainly do not need it in a movie, but it certainly must bring me or bring me. I used to say that it might be an Altman-Esque film, although it is a very small group. Of course, there are moments, but for a few moments it is easy to lose 9 7 minutes a little slowly. I do not understand high ratings for this photo. I'm a 3. <br /> <br />
