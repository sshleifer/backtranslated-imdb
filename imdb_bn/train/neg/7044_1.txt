Beautiful and talented Tina Louise is so sad to make this awesome excuse for a photo. Tina still looks fit and looks attractive, but for some reason it seems really frightening. I can understand his fear; Fear that this 3rd stinker will generally be published publicly. Also, I prefer a fan of Adam West. Again, as Tina, Adam shows good and bigger shape for his age. His acting is passable here, but the script is so bad, even harder to hear even dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is a rip off of classic brando biker flick, The Wild Ones; The law-enforcement gangs are in control of a small hik city. Here the bikes look like a motley group and I'm sure they do not want to date my sister. Activated rigid and wooden, and story-plot is old as sand. Helmers roam around!
