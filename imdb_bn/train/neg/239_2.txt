I was not bad at this movie, but it was not good. I hope something like this but I guess Koon Koo was better than this. This was completely old. At every stage of this movie, I hope some curves and what can I get? The girl gets burnt and her aunt's love is won. Despite being involved <br /> <br />, they have to take permission for any small step. They are shy even though after so many meetings. I hope to be a lot more cruel than aunt. He was all crazy crazy. <br /> <br /> Well, our kids also have it, but we do not keep an eye on them and keep tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, a good father-in-law and a man who loves her. HHK was the father of the poor husband of Anupam Kher and now it is the opposite. And I knew in any way that Munish Bale would be in the film. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
