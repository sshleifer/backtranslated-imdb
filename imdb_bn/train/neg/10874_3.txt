I've finished a marathon in this series, and it's becoming hated as it progresses. From the imagination of the historical material, from the horrific pronunciation in the later episode of Opeliliha, the show went further. If you are looking for some low-quality manufacturing of the normal WW2 Fluff, then I can recommend Season 1, but after that any thing will be avoided, it will become one step up from a soap opera, with the symptoms and sensitivity of the worst story. <br /> <br /> The old B & W film is the best entertainment that is associated with the Coldets name and can not even be expected for it.
