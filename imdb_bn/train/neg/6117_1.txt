I can not say it's the worst movie ever made, but personally I think it was released mainly because of the theatrical, (1) The initial lightning was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted that we would see it, and we could actually see the line sticks To get a ticket, and (2) this is still the only "serious" movie I remember where visitors started snapping at a specific time. Cutting through the rest of the movie basically laughed. Once we reach the infamous (and inward) snake battle scene, I think everyone has moved away. <br /> <br /> Only positive I can admit that good location shooting. Oh, and also have breasts of breasts, although its performance is so nude that the wood is unprotected and does not give much more than a playboy painting. <br /> <br /> "Dramatic Tensions" in this movie is a terrible act of Bo and her husband's awesome aspects. Serpent wars will be one of the most inaccessible "actions" sequence ever illustrated. However, this is a movie that is poor enough to keep an eye on the unexpected humor level. Definitely the worst movie I've seen.
