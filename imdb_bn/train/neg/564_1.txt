Producer Mark Lester made a big mistake that he could not play or play in the title role. In addition to his very "acting", all of Leicester's songs were dubbed by a girl. I do not know why they have thrown him completely, because many children can play an infinitely good part and sing their own songs. Shane Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was only 16 years old. The current West version is much better than the movie. Ross McCormack is the best artful dosage ever and he's certainly looking better than Jack Wild. After the untimely events of 1968, many old musicians were obviously politically in favor of awarding so much Oscar.
