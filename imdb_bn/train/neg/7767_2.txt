Nobody is familiar with CSS. This picture of Forrester's books will be interesting. It depicts colorful, good acting and high adventure, but those of us who know the real stories are unusual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and in some episodes that the film will be difficult to make. But why does the screen writer rewrite the story instead of changing it? In this case the authors left themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: there was no revolt in Renown. When the half-insane captain fell down with Hassaway, the officials lifted the ship after being driven mad, but the reasons were never given. There was no court martial. The court of inquiry is conducted in an almost congratulatory environment. Captain Peleau does not appear in this part of the Hornbahara Sea and also the wife of Colonel Orega. Hornblower was not in the brigade on himself, the ship or the coast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <> Why, why was a good story about screen authors in a zombie?
