After the first time it started, I commented on it and reviewed it in the "middle part", commenting that I would give doubt on the first episode. I have now seen six episodes till this point in June 2006. And as a longtime Batman I can say without curiosity: This show is a complete shit. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with it. Everything. Just before the strange animation and design, there is no character development or explicit interest to give stories to a story of a character slowly and to any character of a story. <br /> <br /> and for God. Is it just me, or jockey in every EPZ ?? Is Gotham a system of justice on the door of the cyclone? Or, again, is this a complete lack of interest for writers to try any other villains? (See "no character development" above). <br /> <br /> And to make things worse, the story of each joker is 3-point sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker Jesse Gosses. <br /> <br /> 2) Junker came out of the whole city gas. <br /> <br /> <br /> Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no story in a Joseph. This title escapes from me, but Villene is the overwhelming climber of the "Think Thuck Thong" episode with Clive Show. The story of a single bad Batman that I have ever seen, heard or read. Yes, I got Batman in my basement. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that I think this program is because it is probably against TOS, but it starts with "B" and "Fastestation". Thanks for the migration of Timm / Danny / etc to existence. Fat and kids return from the WB day, the era of bat-entertainment. Well that material, and I should know it, unfortunately, perhaps, can not last forever forever.
