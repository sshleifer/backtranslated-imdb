I saw this DVD at my friends' home and thought that it was a Turkish action movie with Hollywood-not a big name. I decided to give it a shot after enough. It was difficult to experience the experience. Then, finally, when I saw the credit roll, I thought, 'We suck to make sure that the Turkish film is truly Hollywood. It is an insult to the digestive film of the host.' But then wait! I've checked some names and did not, and they did not have Turkish name, it was not a Turkish movie; On the contrary it was an American director and literally shot by crew! It makes me think again! How can you nominate Michel Madison, Edward Furlong, or even Arnold Whislu to participate in a project like this? Probably with the money .. It keeps me thinking more about how you can increase their money and offer the proposed international welding? Then all my meditations were closed and I found the answer. Hire it that you can find cheap tools and crew. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget: by writing and managing the film you are trying to create the movie - I have no information against it. So the bottom line is not a bad movie because everyone is so worried about being present. It thinks you - even meditates in my case - and there are many movies that do not even affect it. It makes at least one of you; It makes you wonder. It leaves you with disbelief .. And then it makes you wonder again.
