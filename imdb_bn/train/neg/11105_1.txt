It was no idea and it was so awful ... I think there are many movies like Hollywood ... you do not see it. What do I say to eat or eat people ... it makes me sick! O god! We do not know about the movie man, but feed ourselves with the people! Do they have blah blah blah ... that's not known? I bet on it you saw it in another movie. The throw was so great but I think the scene was really awful. And I want to say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely awesome ... he was so talented ... I actually said terrible but because of the terrible scene I think ... let me explain it. Do you ever eat the tongue? But a man in the picture did it! It was really terrible ... however I think the film would be so good without the terrible human consumption or cut scenes ...
