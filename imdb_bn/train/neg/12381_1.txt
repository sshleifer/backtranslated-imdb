These pictures are really vain. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s / 80s and puts it in the context of a school. I'm not saying that urban crime is not a problem for many people or schools are not a problem area, but this cruel part of the exploitation takes biscuits. Violence is in addition to something fantastic, but in this case it is not about social problems, but a white, high-middle-class student uses it to become the crime of local local Skylon crime. And of course he knows how to play the system. That word is known. Yes This is purely violent exploitation of Turkish, a really nasty piece of work. It is dressed as a social commentary boring cruelty. It is in the same category as Exile, Death Com 2-5 and Trash etc. The only great thing is that Michael Fox had broken so much that he had to do such things.
