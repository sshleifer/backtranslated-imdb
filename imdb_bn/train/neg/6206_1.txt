Thomas Clay has mixed with the wrong type. These days, young people with this problem, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> This picture should not be seriously removed. The body of the main body of the film gradually slowly and gradually gradually emerged gradually We are familiar with the original title character, a cat outside, we do not see him sitting at home in school and at home, most of his adolescents seem to be unknowingly. Robert falls with bad boys and misses school and starts taking medicines and you know that he is a psycho rapist. <br /> <br /> This picture is really a complete failure of highlights, its failure to understand violent imagery and links between violent activities. . Clay seems to think that a pair of young people do evil by watching the war scene on our TV. He still portrays the most scathing part of the simulation violence. Is this guy really real? <br /> <br /> <br /> If Clay does not see YouTube, then what will be known with the stupid final scene from the idiot and his picture? Anyone who wants to see is the worst scene from the end of the film and I'm sure what the stick will be with the people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture is vain to do such acts of violence in the film because it does not ruin the youth involved in the fight against violence, even suppressing itself as an offender for extreme, brutal violence, better than a personal celebrity status. There is no reason. <br /> <br /> To engage everyone.
