I usually do not comment on anything (I read other opinions) ... but to make this comment, I was convinced that this movie is seen through the world like Action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but only Within a few minutes I changed my mind ... Lausi, Lausi script and a great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of my worst movies ... <br /> Just do not disturb ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before any other movie I check comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and I try this movie, now I am threatening to rate this movie with more than 2 points ????????? ?
