Be careful: Jet-Jones and McGregor also play the part when the poster believes. Their role is actually minor. <br /> <br /> The picture has become extremely frustrating, very strange comedy and real-time drama. Especially I think it is impossible to wake up a lot of sympathy for the main screen, not to mention her screwball friends and sexually abusive motherhood. The plot has drastically dragged, and I've closed it after about 2/3 - it's unusual for me, I want to finish what I started. Good acting and beautiful setting it takes 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
