Gradually capturing the life of Kibbutz <br /> <br /> This picture is a lesser cultural story of Kibtuja's boy's life, but in general the intentional demonization of Kibbutz life. Within the first two minutes of the movie, the cow's milk milk rape a person's calf. And it is generally all downhill from the terms of the letters representing "kibbutznikim". Without the two main characters, a clinical depressed woman and her little boy, everyone else in Kibbutz is a fairly good caricature ?? Evil <br /> <br /> The story focuses on how Gibitz gradually causes the mother and boy to despair in a little while and inevitably follows. This kibbutz has no happiness, no joy, no smile. Each character / situation represents a different terrible human vice such as misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, culture, suppression etc. For example, while looking for a strikingly handsome European 12-year-old boy looking ?? His elder brother is a common Kibbut young man with his "Jewish" physical appearance and brutal personality. He thinks more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of death. He behaved like these volunteers trash. His younger brother urged him to see his brother's brother, whom he had not seen for a long time because of the military, he said, quote? "Linda, take a bath and I cum in two minutes." <br /> <br /> There is another "good" character in this movie ?? A European foreigner who plays a mother's boyfriend. When the rape victim tried to hurt the mother's son, the boy broke the hands of the leftists and protected him. He came out of Kibbut for "violent" behavior against one of the Kibbutz members. More Hypocrisy: A frustrating French female actress who is unwilling to leave an annoying French woman before 18 years of age or without love, and gives an account of genuine activity that is considered ridiculous for the audience, but it's really stupid. She is definitely cutting the hair of Kabbutz in the field, then tearing her little mother screw in her mental health. <br /> <br /> This image portrays Kibuttz as a religious person. In the middle of the night, children leave their beds and take some programs where they take oath of loyalty to the field under the supervision of the Kibbudge elders. The mother apparently can not "escape" from Kibbut, although in reality, anyone can always go / choose to choose. The boy's father died, but you can be assured that this is what mysterious, Kimbuvaj "took him" and his surviving parent is another pair of heartless and unexpected characters that imposed on mother and his son. <br /> <br /> Talk about this movie. One dimensional character, dramatic, dry performance, and an incognito message that tries to hammer itself within the audience's head ?? That kibbutz life was frustrating, sad and even fatal for those who "kill". I'm sorry to create this image? Probably he was a bad experience growing up a kibbutz. But I think he took some rock of truth about Kibbutz life and made a huge nuclear bomb explosion.
