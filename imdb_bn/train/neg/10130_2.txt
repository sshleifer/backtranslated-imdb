I'm the owner of almost every Sigal film (yes even less like budget), and I must say that this is not the only movie, but the worst for all movies. The only brightness of this film, and the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1, is that Sigal, and B. Sigal has some sweet action sequences, especially in the store and even when he takes out an entire army with a knife. The next time I killed the Sigal people in the 90 minutes, and do not be bothered about the lines of the story, because the story is not only stancked, but also the F-16s of F-18's and F-14, and the stilth as an F-16 Was quick Also Steveal was never fuel ??? And since Afghanistan is considered hostile areas from an Air Force stand point. Lastly I checked, there are no air forces in Afghanistan, we (the United States) control the sky. Also, all the crew of the room was played through this top secret mission speaker, but Admiral still hides other people. How did Sichal rise above the truck? Plush tells us why he kept him in prison, because the Air Force pilots are the directors (since they do not have Wayne Wilson?) And when did the Arab countries do not think their drones get drunk? Also, at the top, hearing of the orders from women from Arabs was charged # 2? The highlights of the movie clearly killed Segal's shopmen and another 50 were killed with knives, as well as a very short and completely random lesbian scene that did not come from anywhere.
