At the end of the 80's, I had a deep experience with "Dar HÃ¤mele Uber Berlin" as a couple - "So what can these movies do?" "Paris, Texas" and "To the End of the World" It still has a special place in my heart and mind - a vendor of the womenders' talent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, next year it has seen "continuous deterioration of its working quality with" Million Dollar Hotel "and" Lots of Land "hits on a terrible low point. Has been impressive pictures or music. Display any search or great insight for. The remainder of which is character and thinly stated political statement, which is nothing but cliche, and totally mocks the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> are you lying down? Whatever it is, it is time for Mr Weatherber to save or completely stop it.
