This program bugs me! There is no comedy in it and it is very serious to say "funny"! It's just very educational for my favorites! The letters are very stereotyped and unappealing. Plot is void and morality is repeated over and over again. Where is it fun? Also, I think this has been broadcast in the BBC for a long time and is being broadcasted too much. Will it have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of the episode? I think the BBC has started to bring back some of their older groups: Inspector Gadget, Bornman, Smarfus, Snorks, Muminus, Rakunas and Count Dukula, instead of continuing to contract new ones! I thought the BBC would bring the danger to the mouse, so what's going on with it? 3/10
