An astronaut from Rubber, who went on the world's first aerospace expedition on Saturday, but of course it was a horror film that became ugly and he returned to earth as the only survivor. Feeling frightened in some annoying situations, which gradually slowly human bodies eat slowly, they are the only nurse in the hospital and are more prone to neighboring towns. <br /> <br /> I like the premiere and the effects of giant and gore are really good, but space scenes are stuck together with the stock NASA footage only and the hospital looks weirdly like a warehouse. A very weak script, the development of a little character and overall poor performance, keeps it empty from above any other than the middle slash, such as the novelty of living candle as a killer, and its low or low impact is only your interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for most Mariam giant film fans.
