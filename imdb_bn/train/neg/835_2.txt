Lion King and Lion King both saw both and enjoyed both thoroughly. I could be valuable to see Lion King 1.5. What a disappointment! Disney will be disappointed with the revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now they have lost the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just picked up a bit of footage which was released to the editor. Flooring (or trash can) and a <br /> <br /> quickly make bucks together to glued them together. It is different from LKI and II, both of which were strong story lines. <br /> <br /> There is no story about this movie. Although the characters and animations are always fun to watch, there is not enough material just for a movie. Bit can be the second 2 disc fillers on some original sacrifices. <br /> <br /> You have to take a quick bucks out of this trash to shame you <br /> <br /> Take the time and effort next time and make us a lasting job.
