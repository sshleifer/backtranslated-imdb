Very terrible but watchable and entertaining. This is the same old story (if you have been through 80). Vietnam will fight together as a friend against injustice to the United States. A-Team Death Wish, Fulfill My Favorite! <br /> <br /> Time goes on, soldiers go home, and after a few years the friend is in trouble. No, wait - actually, the friend died and it is the problem of his father. Even after the wheelchair of the war, while trying to save his father's small shop from the local sabotage gang, our first hero Zoyi was killed by a very dangerous (Super Pointer) flesh tender. Frustrating for help, Father talks to Sir, the leader of Zoe's old unit from Vietnam, when it is seen for Sir's funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the sticky wheel gets in Greece, and the old gang saddles up for the city. Most of you can imagine most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes me crazy is that sir keeps people brutal about his plans and how they really are good. When they plan ahead ahead. But if the unit is not very annoyed, Joel would not have been kept in wheelchairs in Vietnam's gunfight! Then, when they are doing really well in the cities with gang war, they do it again. For no reason, they totally disregard their plans and try to try to nail the gang without everyone present. Ph !!!! I raise my hand to hate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! They are all alone. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep watching, I guess. The movie is not very awesome to watch, but it's a lively. Nothing actually happens in the wind when these are all climatic moments. The most dramatic things at the beginning of the event are the beginning of the movie - explosives in Vietnam, the war of Joe's death, and the gang brutally beside innocent Teddy Bear (poor teddy!) <br /> <br /> Guessing my main beef with this movie I feel down by it. Even the mysterious subpages, including "mystery helper" and their bizarre cross-purpose motifs, were not enough to save it until finally. But one day maybe everything will be okay and they will make a signal. Ha ha ha ha !!!
