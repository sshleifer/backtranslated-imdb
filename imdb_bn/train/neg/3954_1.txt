The entire movie is also the first Boogeyman movie, along with the vaguely, the other Ully Lomel / Susanna Love movie, Brewerwaves's Flashbacks. It is a bit more current (from the 90's to the beginning) footage which is annoying, poorly played and cheaply shot. The film is not nearly completely flashbacks, they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the movie. So you have seen the reusable footage repeatedly, as you have not already seen it. Just like it was not bad enough. I did not see a movie that padded ... Someone was feeding the last dollar of these movies. Total ripoff And talk about padding ... Why do I have to write 10 lines about this trash? If I can say that it is 2 lines of garbage, it should be enough.
