Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, this film will be tested in TMC, nothing better. One of the worst mistakes in my life, and it's just half done. I seriously thought that this was one of the soft-core films, with sticky conspiracies and sticky acting, unclear films and harmful effects. But not, I do not even get that pleasure. Even "musician" was not very good. I had hoped to laugh at some, but I was not sure whether they were trying to throw in one liners. But now I have to sit down here and see the rest until the pipe fiction starts. Or maybe something good And now I can type here until there are 10 lines
