This is really the thing that gets me about the movie (that is, about the film that makes me physically ill) it is actually made of it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this film. It's not terrible, it does not feel excited, it's not fun, it's not good. It's a sleeping pill made of sinyide. The DVD case compares it with Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and a few decent movies, which clearly make the filmmaker's frustration clear. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; It's far, much worse. The demand for a "very frustrating ending will never be forgotten" is equal to one hour's horse striped. Do not waste your time while watching this piece of crash, because it can sterilize you. The author of this movie should remove the author's guild membership list, and some films are not allowed to be released again. Because if she thinks that it was worth producing a movie, then she probably does not have a proposal to do in the future. Zero Stars Grod can have a great grace to see someone's soul grace. I'm going to go upside down now.
