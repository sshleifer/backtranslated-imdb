I was present at the picture SXSW, the director was present. A few people went away, and the audience could only have humble worship. In this festival, I saw 60 or 70 films, the worst in France. <br /> <br /> It's at least 95 minutes long in the 106th minute. You can see the main character fails and the efforts to contact in extended real-time are drawn. The same hate, the face of the face, the letter of the hand and the overly over repeated words repeated over words - we get points. <br /> <br /> One site actually compares this task to Mike Legs. What do you have to do to make this statement? Frankland is a Captain Beafyart song, perhaps you will be able to enjoy a heavy rolling trout mask for this movie to appreciate. Incredibly, this festival won a jury award. You can bet it does not win an audience prize.
