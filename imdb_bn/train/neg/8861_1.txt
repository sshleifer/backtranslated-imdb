The horrible series from "The Hawling". It was closed with Karen White's funeral (it died at the end of the first film). Stefan Crossco (Christopher Lee comes with sorrow) and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was cruelly. He is heading to Translivia to kill Stabia (Cyber ​​Danning) chief Verubobol. Ben and Karen's colleague (Annie McEnroe) joined him. <br /> <br /> A terrible scripts, bad sides, inactive editing, and Brown and McNrow are singled out by singing alone. Belief effect is mostly kept in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects also - although I like cartoon lightning coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a Verbobel orgy that ends at least eight times, especially for fools and dancing closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the village of Transvvania village - it seems to have come from the universal horror of the 1930s! Transit viewers have attractive camera tactics; Brown and McNorro are good and Lee and Danning are good among them - but they can not save it. Really - why do they do this? Where are they hard for money ??? It is one of IMDB's lowest rating movies. That alone would tell you something. It seems as if Dancing saw the movie, I was so scared - why I can understand! A miss-miss
