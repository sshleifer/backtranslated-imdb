I liked the team chariot to have some high hopes for this. I was not satisfied with this picture. I liked Ang Lee the Hulk several years ago, so I think it will have more frogs in it. First of all I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He thinks his eyebrows were re-shaped for him. His performance was not believable. She was not as good as she expected. Team chords are always as cool as here. The gamma thing really was not near the real story line that I do not think. I think the best part of the film was over. It was some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was very long. This one is not as long as it got a bit annoying at the time. I used to think a little earlier when Walmart was really cheap to sell the film and I was always surprised. Now I know. I was hoping to fly away, but I was not there.
