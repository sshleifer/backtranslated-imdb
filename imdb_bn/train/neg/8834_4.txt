There was some truth in this movie. I think 15 to 20 years ago a fishery remembers a story finding a body in water and they decide not to report it until they finish their journey. I think they are charged with interfering with bodies (or some such charges). I'm not sure in Australia. Visitors outside of Australia can certainly think that we live in a country where there are victims of rape and serial killings. Wolf Creek and this film will encourage this perception. The film itself reminds me a simple plan. But as far as one of the best Australian movies, such as someone has claimed, I can not be generous. Keep this way, I'm not bothered to see it again.
