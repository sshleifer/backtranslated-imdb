I'm not saying that I really liked Batty Grable, especially from the "Down Argentina Way", but at the time the disaster came around, he also got the "round" and the film was really shameful. The conjugal story with Douglas Fairbank's JNR (who was fairly frustrated) was bad, the color was good and the film was much longer. It tried to stimulate interest in old stadbyes like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardner, but there was no success. The music score was frustrating, and I must say that no tune was anyhow memorable .... I was so fond of Miss Grable, I always wanted that I never saw it!
