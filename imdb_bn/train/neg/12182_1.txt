Where do I start? I think the real anne is very abusive with the Isleen Quinnen. I love the film Anne, and I hope it could be a brilliant film, but I was very frustrated! Acting horror, the original Annie came some years before I was born, I'm not 25 now and that's still one of my favorite movies, so I was really excited to see Annie. Acting was horrific in the film, which was the original of the character? Writing, guessing, and acting very badly. This is not a movie that I want to watch again, and any Anne lover I recommend that you do not see this movie because it will disappoint you too. Young girls are not bad to sing but still do not compare the original
