Come see, deal with it, there are many good illustrations of black America's troubles. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story, which I mentioned, killed. <br /> <br /> This is the mid-80s and the music / score division. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Pure Classic Movies First off, I do not care if you do not get drunk, you will react to the 1200F degree flame (no matter how bad your acting is done). But they really gave milk to that scene ... it was ridiculous. I would tell you, though, I was very pleased to burn Elizabeth McGower with a wrong death; She bothers me.
