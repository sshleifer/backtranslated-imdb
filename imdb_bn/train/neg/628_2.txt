This movie was potentially to be a decent horror movie. The original character was done accurately and I felt sorry for him and was a modest amount of personal. However, all the other sucks. Director, Emmelle, quite incapable of making films. He sometimes uses the most stupid shots. <br /> <br /> - Random images spread across random random images. He did not try to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he did not. It was stupid. The main character of the trailer randall shot resides, the random building, the building's random pan shots, the random cat which walks away. WTF? And clouds Many dark dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - She really liked this strategy to spend different shots, instead of having one series shot. EX: Guy is trying to lighten his weeds and camera circles around it. Instead of just a shot, he edited it like 10 different shots so its really EDGY! And the HIP! And smart! <br /> <br /> <br /> Actresses are horrific but this makes the movie so interesting. And scarecrow is a gymnast because he flips and spins and twirls all the time. And death can be some good. You are expecting a major riots with the death of a long time built. The ear is a simple corncob. Love interest was hot. Voluptuous Why this movie gets a 2
