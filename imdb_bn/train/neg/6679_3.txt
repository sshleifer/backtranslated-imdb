After the failure of Parsi Babu (1998), Manoj Agarwal returned to this film <br /> <br /> This image has been played by Govinda 8-9, such as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later he is in disguise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> As a Maharashtrian (yes inside of TV) <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture ends with the same misrepresentation and prophetic notes. Govinda, like African and many others <br /> <br /> The direction of Manjur Agrawal is right, music is ok <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda again proves that he is one of the most frequent actors. Although he has played these roles, he has played such a role before he got fit in all good ups and roles. Although the 6-7 role in this film does not really fit, the queen looks very fat, the team is well with Govinda. Nothing is extraordinary and continues to play such role in Nirmal Pandey. Naturally, the liver is very loud and funny in the first place and boring. The old man is happy, Satish Kaushik is happy, Parsh is okay, Tanaz is okay
