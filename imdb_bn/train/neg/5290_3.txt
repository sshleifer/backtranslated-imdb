I usually do not have a film slate. I try to see good points and not focus on bads, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something bad, why bother? The movie part brings Anne's face shot when she breathes deeply and plays violin music in the background. The other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. Rupert Penry is expressless at Jones. Jennifer Hammam plays Younger's younger sister with a modern approach. Anne is portrayed as humble and self-faulty, which is great at the beginning, but she is similar to the movie, and you do not see any reason why she might fall in love with Captain Ventworth. Overall, there is no feeling of timing of production, ignoring many mistakes, such as going out of the concert, kissing on the street, there is no hat on the street street (why was this scene in this film?) The book was one of the most romantic scenes in the book. It's an equivalent film, very frustrating, up.
