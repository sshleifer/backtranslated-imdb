First let me be honest. I did not see all these movies. I saw the first five minutes and when I realized that I was almost asleep, I decided that I could move fast and see if it had become more interesting later ... it was not. This image is just a collection of lam's for creating a story which is already unintentionally and badly said something that will never happen: a decent horror movie Because I think it is very important that if a film with great special effects is good then it may be good. If you try to watch it, this movie will not only keep you in deep sleep. Finally, I think that this movie seems to be in public mode, so if you think that you will certainly see it over a Little search on the internet, you will definitely see a place where you will not have to pay to see it. Pill of cinematographer dung.
