And bulqi tries to tell you a story, which was previously told by Raj Gopal Varma in an unselfish way. At this time it mixed with mature laughter. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and Indian food owner in London. He is very supremely arrogant and boasts his job as any other work. According to him, cooking is an art. Still, the Hyderabadi can not make Bariyani properly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, Amitabh 65 and 35 ?? no problem! But one hit! My father's father Pirsh Rawal! The couple decided to meet their father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realized that Taru's father was much younger than him. And start the complexity ?? According to performance, all three actors are bright. The script of the film is very tight and attractive. The film dialogue is interesting. But somewhere you think that your stomach is not properly filled. Comedy is sometimes not understood properly. The film tries to go a bit longer. <br /> <br /> There is not much to sing except the title track. Camera work is good. Director and Bulki could have done a lot better than this script. But in the second half he feels confused himself. The father's "true" view tears up. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during the scene are clap-worthy. <br /> <br /> You need more sugar than sugar!
