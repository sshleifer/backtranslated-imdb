It's hard to describe - if you are a fan of Rhea Girl's movie during the day, surely you can see that Haji is still very hot, although Farryman Aymman did not play so well (What are he still doing, making these movies anyway? Take the camera but he will be in my movie?). It was an excellent fun court - a superhero whose giant mammal was his secret weapon - but sometimes he could not find it for the full length and Jokes was your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and if costello is your thing) - Basically just bad puns. Yet, I saw this movie interesting and saw more than 2 reasons. Well done, but still a fundamentally flimsy production.
