I have a big fan of such low-budget horror movies, but come! It's sometimes seen Monkey S @ will be the worst piece! I ignore the reviews posted on this site that it will scare me in fear, but I got annoyed. Let's see: <br /> <br /> Clothing: Cheap comedy dress and painter's clothing from home depot. Masks are made from what kind of tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Itnebach's Burning Moon was good for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was awesome! I was not in the dubbing mind. I found this ridiculous like Eatenbach's "Ruttoos" (great movie). War and action sequences were PI $$ poor. <br /> <br /> The following line: Do not watch movies of any kind. There are many great directors, such as George Bootz and Wolff Etenbaek, with the same great and subject movies. Check Premutos, Blood Cells, Schramm and Nekromantiks.
