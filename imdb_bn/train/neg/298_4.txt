A pretty good start off at Dara. The next scene really happens next to my wondering what left me at the edge of the seat. For the other reason, the first half of the movie is a total bore. The first half of the movie is Rishi Kapoor's love for Juhu Chola. However, do not you think she's a little old for her? <br /> <br /> Jihi tells us about her previous husband when the subject starts spice up in the middle of the film; And wow he is a crazy! She was an overly protective, delicious, with a really warm tempara! He used to hit the jihira poor for any good reason! I do not really love this movie because one of the reasons I do not see is that Juhi (my favorite actress) has abused so much. In general, this movie has caused much misuse and bleeding; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I think it's okay. something else!
