* Speaker * <br /> <br /> I'm sure that after being released in 1958 it was very suitable for its time. Then the movies were slow, allowing visitors to follow and analyze stories. A man here is a house owned by his last wife, who mysteriously dies with his new wife. Gardens of the park (directed by Alex Nicole, who directed the film) is indeed an inappropriate character. He indirectly warns Jenny that he is in trouble, because he knew that there was a deadly game in the death of his first wife. He can not tell directly to Jeanie, so he tried to frighten him with a poles. Jenny, we also know that her parents see her dead, thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that leads to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I saw Pasteing being too slow for my taste. But if you like the terrible horror of a lot of grazing pictures, then this picture is for you. <br /> <br />
