This series only gets 2 stars because it puts some of Dickens's Black House in the movie and probably someone will read this book. In contrast to what's probably got the opinion, Diana Rigg was as poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clunky and woody. Lady D. Not a reserved character but a martinet. Denholm Eliot Wrong, Wrong, Wrong to Mr. Jr. So I will disrupt myself and respond to everyone who says: "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take this person's opinion because he evaluates the book." Not true and true. For the former, Diana Rig has played a bad role because of whether you have read the book. On the other hand, Danemahl Eliot is a portable gerundius (though very old). The series does not fail because it is not wrong to compare it to the book, but does not consolidate various plot lines and letters to a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and incomplete entertainment. It's soft and flat. If you want to create a great Black House, you have to spend 20 hours in the 10-hour episode. But I suggest that producers etc leave alone Dickens (even a Christmas carol). Dickens's genius diesens as television reveals its impressive plot and unforgettable characters.
