Usually I do not subtract and if I could give this site to 10 of this site, which means I really hate this movie. I thought the bowler was the worst one in the dark, but at least I gave it 2.5 out of 10 out of my opinion (Stephen Dorr did not laugh at me, so I increased a bit). If it is better than blood clots, then the Bladrine will win the Oscars for the best competition if they compete. <br /> <br /> Now for this plot, this movie is better about BT killer, but they can do better. Started looked okay but it was boring where I died that most of it was fast forward. I like murderous movies and even if they suck, they may get some great death. I am not an avant-garde expert but believe that if he sees himself, he shoots himself. Sorry for the rambling but it's not something good to say about me, because someone seems to take a camcorder and this film .. this .. disaster thing. Your movies never took cakes. You do not have movies in the worst movie list. Sorry, I could not explain the plot (if there were) but it was good for me. Now if you do not mind, I'm going to crawl in a corner and I'll go ahead and remind myself of how much the movie has got scared for life ... okay for life.
