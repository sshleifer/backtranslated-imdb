Outnation of this 1974 dance drama is directed by Leon Klimsky, and watch out on the promotional photos and packaging surveillance that you can believe that this medieval rump is in "Somewhere" and "Sodomania". Not to be sad; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> Naschy (those of whom I am a fan) struts her material as Gilles de Lancre, "Antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else. We got the feeling with this picture that we saw him (and it) did everything before. Strictly complete for Naschy only.
