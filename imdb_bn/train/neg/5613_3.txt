In my opinion, the movie progresses to a new thought. Looks like a spear grabbing! The director seems like an agenda! Duh! I do not seem to have room to look for the option to have its reasonable lack. I am usually on the side of Nayyare, but the film is not creditable because it depends on the good man / woman's excellent observation. If you really want to CR5eate a credible option of a religion held for 2000+ years, you will have to make another attempt to allow the other party to give voice of their faith. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film it felt like an attack on Christian belief, I'm not a believer for one, but allowed others to believe, and do not want to laugh at them, but try to understand and bear.
