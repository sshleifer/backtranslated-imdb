Cash (now played by Christian Hedge for Angelina Jolie) has landed in a public role (said that her guardian had died in old age, a real actor was protected by Ilyas Cotas) and now she is going to get people scrap metal and cash for business cyborgs Looking debris. He led a group of Savarburg (old William Cat, Ivan Laurie and a human scientist run by Jach Galigan) against Bayer Hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell Linch has two minutes of screen time as the employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than two other entries, but it is still mostly dust feature. The problem is that the probabilities of this time are never used properly, the action sequences routine and McDowell, CAT, and Galigan are given a little less. Hajj is truly a shiny heroine and Lynch is very much (normal) and lacking inspiration or ambition as funny as the comedic predecessor of the film. (One with Van Damier, the second is neutral.) Also frustrating is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively prevents any good idea of ​​it. This is done by routine and numbers B-Movie stuff as an action flick and it is made efficiently, only what I can say about it is only positive. <br /> <br /> * 4/1 out of 1- (poor)
