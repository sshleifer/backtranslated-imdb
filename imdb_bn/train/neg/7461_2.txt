*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** sets this record straight to this fantastic movie from its very opening credits: It's an instant classic. Bigger than 'Cinema Kindergarten Cop' or 'Police Academy', this movie is big, it will not take long to understand. When I came out of the movie theater, its perfect majesty kept me innocent and came back to buy another dozen tickets in the ticket counter. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that only needs multiple views. The first observer must go through that strange 'huh'? Feelings, but do not feel embarrassed - it could be our best. This story is so clever that it should be astonished about the death of its writers. What seems to be the FBI infiltrator seems like a simple story of a fool, it is a metaphorical story that works on different levels and teaches us all the important things of life. The complexity of the plot structure will bother you at your first sight, but do not give up! Until I saw my sixth or seventh, I began to discover only some of the 'secret secretaries of Romney'. And ultimately watch for unexpected turns, otherwise if you disclose that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most wanted criminal, Karki is not actually the real FBI agent, Pope Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is uneducated and Polly Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual Do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Kattan is not just a comedy. He was also a master of the drama, because the feelings of the audience control with the slightest step in his face. The expression of its face reflects itself in a way life. For example, in the scene where he goes away from his brother's face, you can express social injustice and isolation that clearly appears on his painful face. It is difficult to find dry eyes at home right now. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the screenwriter David Garrett and Jason Ward's 'Corky Romano'. With the story of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers have been appointed to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful story and overwhelming framework makes 'P. Fiction' look like a mid Saturday Night Live skit. The story of Garrett and Ward is so attractive and alluring that it keeps you with your hair, completely consume you, jumps around you and throws you out. At the end of the global experience known as 'Korki Romano', you are a different person with different worldly and different ideas and with only one question in your mind <br /> <br /> Why? God Why?!?
