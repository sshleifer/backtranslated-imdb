Rudy McDowell, who is a wild horse, flicker of the title, and the only reason to watch the movie in the first place is a very young actor on the train. Coated shaking by shining, protected music and impressive conversations, it is one of the endless films which bores you a gnawing headline. McDowell manages the next generation Nag's train, the title of the novel 'Thunderhead, Son of Flickr' is slightly better than the original but the speed is running fast and the score continues to submit to you, although at least one or two scenes are not a coma induced.
