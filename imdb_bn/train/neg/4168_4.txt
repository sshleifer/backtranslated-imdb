Well, this movie started fun but quickly wasted. Based on the first few moments I considered it as a 'adult-based' comedy, but then the movie switched to Disney Channel Type Mode for a bad creation, especially a go-cart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana de la Garza is fantastic but has a truly fake Italian actress. The film saw and spoke very independent and low budget. There was a very nice moment in which I would talk about the downstream scene but overall it was a Javanese. The smile is very short and far away. The last surprise for "Mr. Fix Brick" is so ridiculous that it made me crazy more than anything else. If you can catch it on free or on TV, it will not lose money to buy or rent your movie.
