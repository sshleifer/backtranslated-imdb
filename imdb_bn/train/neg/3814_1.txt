I can see small girls enjoying this show, but this is a family show call ridiculous. I amazed how well I think after all these years It's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about the father crashed with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others, as the season continues to others. Plot lines are all usually a stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone makes the crazy and the stars of each episode, and it ends with a light weird copper. For actors, I do not like them. Bob was painfully unfunny as a father with mother's duty. Dave Coolie's note is a fun 30-year-old, which works as a cartoon voice and a kid, and he's awesome. John Stams was the most tolerant character but he was so relaxed that he was hard to see. The oldest daughter of the show, DJ, did not show a real bad actress and any emotion ever. The middle girl was clich√©d as Stephanie's very annoying little sister. The youngest daughter Michel has shown that the Olson pair or the bad actress. You can always say when they are switched off. The plot lines of many story lines were so unreasonably stupid that it was appropriate. This is a "family" show that tries to replace a good substance with elegance and love, and although it is needed for a show for the family, they make it too much too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite city less in the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br /> My rating: Awesome show TV G 30 minutes
