The "Fred Claus" team is becoming "Santa Claus" this year at least a little more fun than Allen's star, but this does not mean that it's going to be enough for the theater to go. <br /> <br /> When vacation movies go, it is narrow and sensitive. But in reality, it can be at least one concern as "Fred Claus" in the title of David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights", "The Weather Crushers"), it suddenly turns into a strange fun moment, a shit Vince Vaughn and a car Lines in the dark Christmas film In the end, it is both ample quantities And it becomes even more frustrating with a cast of Paul Jamaican, Kevin Speacy, Rachel Weise, and Kathy Betts. Once <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, leaving her and her parents (Peacock and Bates and Peacock) to tolerate her younger brother's bias towards her parents Do it. Nick Santa became Clouse (and voice-over tells us that when you become a saint, you will be reduced on time with your family), Fred will be a Ulyetide-Z'd repo man in Chicago, who is giving a tough time to remind his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Asked, what? Nick agreed but Fred agreed to help in the toy-wrapped business at the North Pole. Fred hesitantly agrees, but his violence with Santa and Elvis's ever-hilarious nature is confronted with conflict, even an expert (SPACE) examines the activities of toy factories, but if things fail, it is very happy when the entire Arctic operations are closed. <Br. <br /> The film is on its moment, but the padding running length extends thin throughout its period. Among them, the Christmas film Klitschas' places, which were well-operated "Elf" and communal efforts were loving like last year's fruit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dan Fogelman's neutral script prevents him from doing his thing. Geometry brings a delightful old charm to its deceitful character under the bad fat suit, but unfortunately, Fred has to play second noise. SPACEIS brings his game face, but his turn is usually unintentionally ending as a vapid. Finally, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgotten film that falls below those involved. Sure, there is a more bad way to start the season in the movie, but there are certainly many good ways.
