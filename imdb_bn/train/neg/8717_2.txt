This is one of the most ridiculous bad movies, which I never had the privilege. <br /> <br /> I saw a DVD with a bunch of friends on this Friday night and we can not smile from the beginning <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is simply enough: terrorists think that Uranium is carrying arms in arms hands, but it is actually carrying a bunch of dinosaurs eating humans. Wrong to make it easy In order to deal with prehistoric animals, one of the striking misconduct teams of the Special Forces of the army. Colonel Rance led by them, is played by Scott Valentine; A man who has acted as 'Smell the Fert', as Zoya admired among friends. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of shooting and many shooting, but unfortunately the goal of Rans' team was a problem. Their arms are giant, lumbering monsters a common direction of the board. Also, the lights always seem dazzling and whenever Velociraptor invades the attack (probably we do not see how bad the effects of the animals). <br /> <br /> After saying all this, we all had a big deal <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> Entertainment is a proud success.
