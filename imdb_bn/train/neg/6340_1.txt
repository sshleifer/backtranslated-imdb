This kind of movie I fear most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it represents a sketch of Colombian conflict, so that the perfume and the fools humiliate everyone in Colombia. From Greece's (her nude scene is absolutely unfortunate), from BÃ©zarano, Fanny Mickey (who came out of Tim Burton's nightmare) starred Diaz, who made significant efforts to bring life to a character. The dimensional is so clichehed, and so badly all one has to wipe out the rest of the work he has done. Not to mention the undesirable finishing, a gore fade is so adhesive that it will be cringe to the ed wood. It all fails in all ways, cinematography, art direction, clothing, makeup, editing, and most of the directions, George William Triana is always a cruel filmmaker, but at least some of his previous movies have some dignity. I can not say anything good about the waste of this money, but I hope Colombian filmmakers will learn a lesson about honesty, honesty and accountability from this meaningful Fiasco.
