Well, I could not even enjoy this movie for the price of this movie. It is a B-movie action-flick, directed by "Commando", which is very long and stupid, with considerable entertainment value, as a good B-movie. <br /> <br /> This will be a '90's flick, but the action movie of the main movie 80 has to be reminded, when such B-movies are always high. These movies always went to the top and did not pay much attention to its story or acting. It was almost all up to the stuff, flying around the big muscle hero and bullets. This movie contains all its components, but as far as I like to watch this movie, I also like to see similar types of films. Why can it be true, why story and acting and how bad it is, so much worse than any other movie of the same age. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie is often far too silly. These movies are stupid moments, but this movie is only filled with it. The war, the dolph lundgren is running around the shirt, the character, the story. It's not very good at all because it is often too hair for the word. Sometimes the story is not trying to make a little intelligent and what is the main plot of the overall movie? His story is in every place and it seems to be the continuation of the war, the gun fights, and to make such a film. And those sequels are really not very good to see. Moments are very small and really frustrating, who has brought us "commando". <br /> <br /> It is one of the main issues of Dolph Lundgren, in which he can play the big action hero star, who knows how to handle butt kicks with seemingly relative ease, guns and other weapons and certainly gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. This all comes in one of the worst montage sequences in our action movie history and of course one of the worst sexual sequences I have ever seen in any movie. Both are just too long and very badly combined for words. <br /> <br /> No character really works. Good guys do not seem to act like policing but they do the same. They roam freely without anybody's responsibility and they are not interested in any arrest, or do not want to tell anyone about their invention. Despite trying to find Japanese Japanese crime syndicate, they are not trying to get down on the LA street, and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a pharmaceutical factory and large-scale drug smuggling. And think for a moment, what is Brandon Lee's overall objective? The film can easily be done by him and the girl as well. <br /> <br /> Not too stupid, long and straightforward and not enough entertainment. <br /> <br /> 4/10
