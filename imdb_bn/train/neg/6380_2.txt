Well, what can I say about this movie? I'm speechless Although I could go about fooling around this movie, actually there was a pie that * sed me music. And it's the closest to all of those comments they liked it. All of them have to say that it is one of the best martial arts films of Bruce Lee's best Fischfa Fury. She was still alive and never came across this movie she would have been afraid. The rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and tape waste. I call tape because one such movie could not possibly be shot in the movie. Now I feel more stupid to waste 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I even saw it is downloading it from my roommate morbid curiosity. What is the coming of this world?
