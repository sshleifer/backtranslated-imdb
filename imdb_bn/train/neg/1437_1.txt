I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie but from the beginning it does not seem to make any difference. I was extremely disappointed with the film getting very annoying and acting. I remember Patrick Soze and some other actors (for example, Roy Mursden) in extraordinary roles but they are frustrated because of the very poor script. "Kindle Solomon Mines" ... Within the "mine" the very small part of the movie was thrilling like paint drying and I suspected that even a pre-school child would be made to watch the war. "Fighter". The whole movie was memorable of the well-produced American TV series. Give me Indiana Jones!
