It seems that some people who reviewed this movie have seen it in the first place because it was portrayed where they live. How to authorize a ringing? If I were portrayed in the movie where I lived it would not be mentioned in my review. It's awesome! A number of reviews have said that this film is not a fool or tongue-in-cheek horror movie. It is tragic to review this picture as a comedy, because it is not only a bad endeavor but also a comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This garbage observer after a half-mask and arms placed on a table. The social comment behind the film is ridiculous, teeny and stupid. Do not get bored with this movie, you've already ruined while reading this review, and do not waste much on this movie. Arrggghhh! It is terrible to even get that kind of movie like this. I hope the whole actor will give credit to Alan Smith, a name that has been used when a person, usually a director, does not want to submit it to a movie because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to be released in this movie, I've spent $ 1.19 on rent and I think I'm getting leaked. To avoid. 10 out of 1
