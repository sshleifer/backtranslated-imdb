Anyone who likes Van Damen, I can not even like this movie. <br /> <br /> Movies actually starts with some promises. I think the action scene at the beginning of the movie is excellent. Family Scenes are a great start and good leadership in the original story, trying to save twins. However, the picture is all below the hills. <br /> <br /> It would have been good if the director could stay with the original generation. Brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. A brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be an expert in firearms. How convenient is that the brother who suddenly did not take the gun suddenly was a great Marxman and the brother who was not taught any martial arts, suddenly broke them and kicked high. <<br /> <br /> The plot, action, etc. is simply ridiculous. My favorite scene Van Damen is about how to encounter an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting Van Damen, he was crying like the battlefield driver and the ongoing battle against him. Van Damen pick a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoot him ... He's still 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most frustrating endings. Say Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Tell me the gun is throwing vanilla barrels in van Damen. There was so much commitment in the movie that was absolutely committed. If your van damen fan, save your time and see one of the hard targets or the earlier movies.
