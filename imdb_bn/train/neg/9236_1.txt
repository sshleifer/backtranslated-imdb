I think among millions of people who are curry grants fans, but I can not think of the single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the welding of Betsy's Drake and if it does not, then we will most agree that Catherine Hip Hop is looking back at Kerry Grant on her child's arrival. Here is the idea of ​​trying to rehearse the director or writer, but it unfortunately fails. I used to comment on how I was "unclear" Drake, but I thought it was a very light description. Franchot tones through this victim as he was a hunter. A welding disaster is one thing. This film is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This 10 comment line is not deserved and I do not know why it is a requirement. This bad is saved when many suitable movies travel around the vault. <br /> <br /> If you want to torture someone, give it a wider pay.
