It gets a couple because I liked it as a baby, but it has become so void that I started to hate it ... I can not give it a descriptive review because it will rest one thing after another, perhaps I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the most important things about this event is that it is quite nasty, that the child with folly kids who wanders with children warmly with them. And about it. My uncle has a cousin of love and he is a strange and cruel person. This show should be pulled from the air. It's always the same thing over ... They need to put a good show on Nick. I'm getting really tired of stuff like this.
