As soon as I was not acquainted with US television stations, I proceeded towards my in-laws cable, firstly I thought it was a low-budget Saif-Fi film, then after a few minutes I started thinking that it could be clever to the worst oppression of Christian fundamentalists. Squeeze on, and then it sank towards me - good sorrow, these folks are serious! After a while I saw a little strange smile. I was hesitant to write a review of the fear of treacherous believers, but then I saw other reviews and thoughts, hey, they could accept it. Strict philosophical conundrum: How do you criticize the movie criticizing the movie which is actually showing you what you are criticizing? Answer: Prepare in such a way that only people who appreciate it are hated by people who criticize you. I think some liberals (you say it when you say!) Might not be obsessed with the audience of the movie makers who are not obsessed with J **** C ***** rituals, but I did not think - it's very funny fun Was there!
