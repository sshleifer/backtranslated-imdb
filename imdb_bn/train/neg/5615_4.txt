I only saw DVD1. The correct information on the program can be 10 minutes; Otherwise it is the snotty putdowns of religious people. Director Brian Fleming has recently invented both atheism and mockery, and he can easily oppose it with these tools. <br /> <br /> Fleming is widely spread in his own personal affairs and they are in the movie. It never comes back to the subject. <br /> <br /> Religious objections are apparently in the offensive motivation, when they are prone to religious abusive suspects. Arguments from such people are considered illogical, and therefore these are disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people ask for more information. There is no need to say anything more than the American Jews to know how angry Christmas music is in the middle of December. <br /> <br /> The superintendent of Flaming Superstitious Christian School confronts the director on his motivation rather than insinuation. It seems to be the most honest part of the movie, and it was too small. <br /> <br /> <br /> If Fleming is a bit more confident, she may have a good story about her own (past and present) relation to Christianity, and her abusive organizations that inspired her during her youth. <br /> <br /> And perhaps he can lend his "Christ the world never walked the earth" element to a more serious document. I do not read the words of Saul / Paul to find out how to paint these windmills, but a quick browsing Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are denied. <br /> <br /> Bonus interviews are quite good, they do not make Fleming's thesis much stronger. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for anti-pov, and he does not get involved in other non-Christian religions. Harris also interviewed some good (and easily Google) Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
