Recently I discovered that the novel of Madeleine Louangle has become a TV movie by Disney and has ordered the DVD. The book was my favorite when I was younger and I read it many times. In spite of some children acting like characters described in the novel, the Muri family is well cast, a favorite (if very nice) Meg and Charles Wallace in the heart of the city, without being disturbed as a child's deceit. <br /> <br /> For the first half an hour, it is good enough to establish relationships between the lead characters and establish the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins and the whole thing is different when the children leave the earth. Alfred Woodward is very young and looking for the supernatural Mrs. White (instead of Mariam Margolis or Joan Plathite) and Kate Nagalan's face is so mask and extraordinary, she has visited Fai Dwain's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, they look like her mistress from the Wizard of Oz, when she should be like the savvy Wicked hatred of the West. <br /> <br /> Finally, these are the worst terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but CGI could see something that could be done 15 years ago. Mrs. White's Central Avatar is a disaster as a whistle-like disorder, in which the novel describes the foggy stars rather than the elaborate creatures I used to go, almost every artistic choice was a disaster, probably not enough budget to do this reason, but there was a lack of imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> This really needs Spellberg's sense of astonishment to bring his initial movie. There is no disrespect to the current popularity of the child's literary fantasy series criteria that, during a time, a prismel and its screen thinks of taking a bigger screen and it gives an opportunity to claim it.
