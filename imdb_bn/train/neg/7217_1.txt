I just got to see this DVD in the house. We love the West, so my husband hired. He apologized to me. Saddles, clothing, signs - everything was off. The part that made me so crazy is that the man did not shoot "collector" with his arrows and arrows, because he was taking the spirit of fat. His only excuse was "He was left with only 2 arrows." We saw through each other, and somebody else said ... Why do so many bad things to sing for any reason to suck it I mean, that boy was able to rob the evil stone from the collector at the same month and day, what is it? And why there was a cemetery where everyone died on April 25, but those whom the creators of the soul took away are still roaming? If you want a movie to have fun after a few beer, this might be your movie. However, if you want a real Western, you will hate this movie.
