If all Matters of Watchsky have to offer on condition of a backstory, I must ask the questions of those fans who believe that the films are intended for deeper registration. Second revival, while visible stunning and beautiful, story-based cliched and ridiculous. How many times have we heard of humanity that people dependent on technology technology, all people are very interested in fighting, people basically destroy themselves? There is nothing new here And I have another question. Considering the second revival's plot, that machine is good man?! The machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters. They fight, win their independence and try to build a peaceful peaceful coordination with the people who reject them for all wars, which conquer the clever machines naturally. If it is in the background, then we should never be rooting for our sake, rooting for our machines! The people were cruel and oppressive, although the machines were bold and sympathetic. Because I do not believe that machines of Watchsky are supposed to favor us on machines, so I have to believe that the second revival was a confusing effort by simply creating a false story.
