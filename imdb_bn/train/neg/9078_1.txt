If this movie is not really finished in other stupid, vain, it will not be great, are you getting more sex than me? In a perfect world, yes. Yet this one is even worse. This one is not insulted for stars, it's insulting for the distributor. All of the tricks that are basically expressed in the college student staff are probably no interest to show, yet it is "funny." Devon Sawa, who was really good at the final destination, is simply incomparable in this film. It makes you wonder if it's bad on purpose. Grade: F.
