I did not take this film for the first time in TCM's "indispensable" series. There was nothing more in view of the viewer. This observer saw this one little price. I was surprised by the infinite attraction of Lucy (Lauren Bacall). Imagine, Miss Bekal was a beautiful woman, but in this movie, her character closes more mocha than compelling. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley are likely to ignore Lucy than to fall in with instant infatuation. This film was created during the last illness of Humpty Bogaret's defense of Buckal, and his poor health weight could affect his performance. In contrast to the humorous part of Lucy's part in the humor of Mary, Dorothy Mallon ran and then acted. The scene where he was involved in a wildly sex dance, his father suddenly went on a steep heart attack, the film's best scene is far and away. Malone's performance throws out the rest, although her two children's gloomy behavior is illustrated by Jayshwar Hadley's glittering gorgeous Keith. Generally, though, I want to say that I'm not a fan of Maildrum. The cartoon behavior of characters makes for a story very impossible just for my taste.
