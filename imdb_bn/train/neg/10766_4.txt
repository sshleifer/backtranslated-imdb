Anyone who sees the yellow elephants of Tamus knows that it is a director who can do well. Let's hope it does not have many tools in the pot (any telephilm?) And it's one of the other features. Character is one dimensional and is used. Though the scenery shows the great and the Pacific Pacific Ocean. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Shot almost completely, the image is sticky and beautiful. You can bring air through almost pages. <br /> <br /> The more sound it comes to technically this movie is - it does not just have a heart.
