I heard about this picture and knew it was not really good. But I was interested and interested in seeing the movie (on my movie channel). This is a really great, dark black hottie on today's morality can be media. The small features of every contestant were good. It's not something I want to miss, build up But when the so-called show starts, everything is impossible, cheap and rather silly. Here the writer should add something which people think. But instead it is wrapped and people assume this is stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad I give it 1. Even if the film's commitment begins.
