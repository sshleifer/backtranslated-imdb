I actually paid to watch this movie in the theater. It will get 1-rating, but the war scene is okay in the robots, and there is a surprise there. <br /> <br /> <br /> I understand there are some movies bigger budget than others. I have a problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction films probably suffer most for a small budget due to obvious reasons. However, one of the ways in which this movie is failing is that every part of each set is Chess and cheaper I mean, do they not make it "look" well? <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible cause, I have seen the movie now and knew what to expect, I can only enjoy it for cheese-factor, but at that time, I was hoping for a good movie and it It was really horrible that it would really end. <br /> <br /> Thank you, at the age of 85, the experience ended.
