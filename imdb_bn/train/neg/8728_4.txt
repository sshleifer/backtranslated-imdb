This one is bad. A common and annoying crime film, in which there is nothing common. A series of crimes, killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie, the classic investigation. And a policeman knows about any incident and does not believe in the classic story, so to fight the fact he has to fight himself. This one is not too much. Voted: 10 out of 4
