This movie is a distorted meaning of a movie, which sets an unusual family in Japan, which ends with a strange violent guest, who just sits behind and sees the worst 4 members of the family. There is no sanctity in this movie, sex drugs and violence spread to such a limit, I am surprised that it has gone before the sensors. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it will apply only to those whom we should not encourage, rather than considering any inferred incoming message coming for the rest of us to consider. A movie that pushes towards the worst element of society and abuses in any way ... frustration from a person who has created a dead or living and a live film.
