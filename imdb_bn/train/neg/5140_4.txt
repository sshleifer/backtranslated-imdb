Demer Davis, the western and "broken arrows" are in everyone's heart when it's a wonderful director. As far as melodrama is concerned, it should be left to know people like Vincent Minley, George Cooker or the fabulous Douglas Cork. Scrapplells are so unlikely that you will not be surprised when you see such a cruel cry. The character of Natty Wood was inspired by Fannie Hart's "CV" (See Stahl and Cyrke), but who can believe that whatever a black man's daughter is? Susan Kohner's "imitation of life" was more believable) and Sinatra and Curtis have been given such an annoying part that they can not do anything to them: poor officers, and rich handsome and money-sergeant. Who will fall in love with Natalie? France has been shown as tolerant land, where different unions are warmly welcomed. During the time (about 1944) it was suspicious, it is still for narrow people, where you can find here and everywhere.
