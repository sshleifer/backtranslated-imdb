What can i say A Kamal Hassan movie is awesome. She works very well, but it's a terrific story, along with horrible aspects. My opinion, director Gautam Menon, must definitely give instructions. There are a lot of tragedies throughout the movie. Still no one can believe that how terrible the crime is. The movie was no reality. Gautam is just running out of the story. But both Kamal Hasan and Jyotika are really good. Villains look very ugly, though their performance is not bad. I do not think this Sunday afternoon padaapa movie that you can see with the family. You will not get to sleep watching this movie !! However, Harris Joyraj has done a great job again, so I gave the film 4 out of 10. Her song 'Paratha Modelle Nale' is about to be self-centered and miserable. Besides, great cinematography. Overall, it's a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hasan, I think, should have rejected this movie.
