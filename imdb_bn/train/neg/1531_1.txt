This picture is so bad, it wants to vomit me. Produced weak, a complete smile free zone. Why is a movie which is a spoof of a movie in the name of God (and that's a fun funny one) as a movie spoof? Set ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they are not even laughable, and acting harmful. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this garbage junk. The National Lampuna once created the Animal House, which is still considered to be fully and completely delightful to the people. Now they are ready to make a TV movie like **** like this picture. Your expletive name, and it can be used to properly describe this film.
