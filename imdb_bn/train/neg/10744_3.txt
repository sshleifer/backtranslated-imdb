Initially it was mainly the giant rats, but there was some wasps and a giant chicken. This one, however, just during the giant rats, good giant rats and a really growing little boy. This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally made giant killer rats ... you know how it is. There are some killings and moments in this movie, but I found it to be equal to the original, I just like some variations in my genius animals. Well, that's not true ... I really like "The Empress of Ats", maybe I just do not take care of the giant sheets. Although all a rather throbbing movie though it's a dream sequence really has an odd turn of events in the odd events. I can only recommend this one.
