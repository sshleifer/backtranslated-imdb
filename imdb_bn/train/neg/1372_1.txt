This TV saw. I'm glad that I did not go to the movies to watch or to spend money for watching this movie. The film is completely predictable - from malicious owners and planners, from snaking electrical cables. The plots are really weak and incredible - Glaciers expert broke the bones, hit by a 20-foot wave of Avision (using actual footage) and stand up to it and reduce yourself. The evening decreases one million miles an hour and stops the dead by the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some real internal elements show impressive and its devastating strength. But the contract between the real internal and staged stuff seems to be even snowy. <br /> <br /> Please do not be bothered with it, even in Tov.
