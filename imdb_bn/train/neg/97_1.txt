I did not see much less budget films, which I must admit, but perhaps it's the worst movie, as the old man had said, had a lobotomy and lost the power to say more than five seconds, the 5-year-old could do better. The story was the most intriguing plot, and the army man kept what he thought was like an army and then just went to the top, I just saw how bad it was to see it and hopefully it was moving into the real movie. . I do not believe it was under the 2 night rental item of Blockbuster, please remove it from our sight and release it. I think there was only one half actor apart from women, I think the only thing with the budget is OK, but they initially show every important scene in the movie on the music beat. Terrible just horror
