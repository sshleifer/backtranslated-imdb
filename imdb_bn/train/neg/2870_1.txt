O god! Please, do not see this movie for all the love that is sacred! It's 82 minutes in my life I will not get back. Of course, I could stop seeing halfway through the way. But I could get it better It's not Anyone who actually enjoys this movie is a seriously ill and rolled person. Australian / New Zealand has a terrible reputation for making movies. Everything about this movie is horrific, from acting to performances. I usually do not review reviews here, but in this case I will make an exception. I was just willing to warn someone before they rent this disaster
