I hate this movie! It was nothing like a book, and thinking about it made me crazy. If you see the movie before reading the book, yes, this is a good movie. But the King's book was Amazing and there was nothing like this in the movie. I mean, the common meaning can be the same, but most aspects of the film are completely different. Finished for example! So it is very intense in the book and Danny and Wondey escaped before the hotel blasts. But this terrible movie version is like a jack they get through a stupid manger ... Yes, there is no trace in the book, and there is no reason for it. Another part of what makes me angry, Jack just shoots him! What's the hack, he was basically the hero of the book and he was not as important as they just killed him. Overall, it was very bad that the film was so close.
