The film opens with a beautiful lady running through an initial Eastern European town of an incognito white gown. We know he's following something, because he looks behind him. And soon we see a black trench coat being followed by a mysterious man. Then we realize that the person is actually a vampire hunter and he is after that. But its reflection on appearance shop window ??? Not just her identical twin vampire! But unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this great and amazing fun gap in 60s and 70's old hammer films (the pair of credits listed as the evil pair, which is the name of the final installment of Hummer's Carnestine trilogy), this plot is mostly dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no small plot in the Dakula (Everyone who changes his appearance at the time of the resurrection), so producers' chickens are coming to the chicken, students are feeling unwelcome and thinking about their medicare. .. what a privilege, maybe I'll just ignore those movies saying that vampire drinking blood turns you into bloodstream and our quarrel closes Use pump blood for the treatment of illness. Clearly, this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept is broken down badly, the film sets up a wonderful situation and does something to do with them. For example, Med Maiders try to bring him back to the left-handed bathtub in a crowded country. The house itself is scared to be in the center of the film, but are we there? No reason because they decide to take a abandoned swimming pool vampire. The movie is a real problem with "tribute" before I can directly point out the first scene outside of Hammer. I mentioned that this house scene was suitable for movies like Hammer, but the movie was fast Changes in terms and changes to a medical day. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they introduce so many letters that it is almost impossible to feel sorry for some of them. The fat students and their wheelchair bound professors-type "friends" have all of the Med Medor: arrogant, annoying, hungry, and stupid. Until he got rid of his muscle hijacked / big breast quota in the medal school, they made me wonder at school medicine at all the wonders. And then Vampire hunters who remain mysterious through movies. Hey, I can honor it, but it would be good if they did not set it, but the movie would be about him. Then you have random priests, police, and science types. So many people are introduced and soon they do not need to save the day until they forget, or they are hurried to hurry to a terrific fear. <br /> <br /> It's basically a lazy movie. No real scares, scares just few anticipated jump. Setting up for this is extremely pleasing. Blood full bathtub for Exxam It's so obvious that the drac bloody blood pop is going out. And yet we will have to wait very long till we get inconclusive jump. After this, he killed one of Dumar and Big Breasted students. We all know he's going to be a spare. But what do others do? Bury him in a shallow grave near the house. Interesting, so you know who will get you out when the police appears at home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well ... <br /> <br /> Someone might be a scary vampire It is impossible to make movies and it will only be indicated for the atmospheric, and then we will end up with a whole film which is as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
