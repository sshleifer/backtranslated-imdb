I probably would get a lot of fax to hate this movie - I guess I did not contact it with the right whistle eye nostalgia before me. But do not say - St. Elmo's fire was very shaggy-fiqing-tastic, even in brat-pack movies. [<br /> <br /> All 80s (RENT, anyone?) the plot is virtually existential and spectacular is the best kitchy, bad times left the rest of the rest.

And we can hang on completely unknowingly, I know that I can be with one or the other at any time I can hook up, but none of you is satisfied enough for the promise (not the word!).
