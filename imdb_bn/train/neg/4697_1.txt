All right I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. First off the movie is not so pososed and real, they are all acting. They can not sing They are very full way of themselves. It's boring Yes 8 to 10 kids can enjoy but it's really stupid. I mean their manager is a kid. And there is the record label mesh. It's stupid. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> is not so bad for set-up and directions. This is a cute documentary but it is documented in a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> If you like good music, just watch it. Also, it is very corny. It's not even delicious. I hate to have so much money ... but it's really a piece of junk
