I have done something for this curry cookie for a while, and as far as he looks in this film, there is no complaint. But after grabbing it last night at High Definition, I'm sure: The only thing in the movie that is not low quality. The script is awesome, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in other comments how sex scenes were ... What is the comment? definitely no. When a movie is bad, you might even make it a sin-core pornographic but instead I see some pasty white dodd, which prevents me from seeing the body and the scenes of that which gives me nothing without teasing. They have gone to cinemax, so that the movie is not wasted completely, but not so. With this scripts this horror made them capitalized in the face of it, since it is the only pro in the film. 2/10, because he looked very hot.
