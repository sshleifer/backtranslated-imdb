It's worse than the horrific Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were the general riffecks of the resurrection of Stan and Wali. New audiences discovered the humorous talent of the couple and cartoons were psychological waste for monetization in the interest of children. It was expected to be. But, how can we try to justify this ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped that it would inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire interest in the past with a striking and weird past of the past. The dominant (I do not hesitate to play them) does a Vegas law and it's where it is. Even flimsier than the platforms used in the old days, trying to stretch two relay ideas for a feature. If this movie is truly the highlight and expresses Hardy for the first time, I am sure that the audience will dismiss the original pair's reputation, because the generosity has gone. I hate this more than the only movie I spit on your pride. And, you know, these filmmakers have largely did not do the same thing as Stan and Wally.
