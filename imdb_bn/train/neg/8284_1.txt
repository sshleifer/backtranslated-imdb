Who wrote this? Some people named John Cohen. I guess it was the first screen it ever worked. Someone has told him that you are supposed to write the dialog, which actually seems to be something that someone can say. <br /> <br /> And who gave this direction? Scott Marshal? Gary Marshall's son. My almond fell away from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can draw a scene in a cabinet in New York, and you can see it real and you do not need to fake it with a blue screen for some reason. He also wanted to tell him to be away from Jessica Simpson, but it is hoped that he learned the lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... Naturally, she can not work. Hell, she looked like Jessica Alla like Audrey Hepburn, and she is still acting in this movie. Oh wait, it is produced by his father. All right, so he got the part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, no, how bad would it be to be surprised I? I think many people see it as if I think. I think you're expecting a movie to play Jessica Simpson, but it's ... it's not just bad, it's a complete opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is a good film. It's Anti-Anne. <br /> <br /> I was very happy I could not see it, I could not stop for ten minutes, I could not go. No doubt, as soon as I came out of the theater. Actually I am surprised that in the theater it has seen how many 6 people are in reality and watched the whole thing. The film starts to humorously bad, and then becomes so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first thing ends, you realize it will get worse, and whenever you have to leave or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film should be used in place of water conventions in Guantanamo Bay, which is very bad under division. Although some water boarding choices.
