OK, I saw the original French version. But I can not imagine these subtitles well. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this is a very annoying movie that I've seen for a long time. This image has almost no redeeming attributes. So I do not understand all the positive reviews. It may be practical to be a concept but some real stories are kept incomplete. <br /> <br /> As long as it serves the purpose of the movie, I gradually like movies. Tarkovsky's Solaris is very slow but it sets the mood of the spontaneity and for example the film. But in this case, this film is only filed through psychological conversations that will guide us to say something about characters. Which one I can detect or care about. In many scenes, I thought to myself: "When are they silent"? The acting was quite bad. The way is not an overacting obvious type. But it seems that no actor is taking care of their character and they all saw that they wanted to be visible in most cases. These may be due to incomplete conversations. Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. Moving from one scene to the next. It seems that this movie was written (poorly) but never directed. <br /> <br /> In some of these films, I can say that no emotional response is created in the scene. There is no doubt, there is no fear, no confidence, there is no sadness, no self-knowledge, no intellectual revival, no interest. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how I say a movie.
