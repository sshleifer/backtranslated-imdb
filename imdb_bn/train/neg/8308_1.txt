The hills are going down the hill for the last few years, but last night (17 August 2006) they reached a new low <br /> <br /> To try to promote their broadcast, they decided that the original picture of Nat Ramsey's body To post ... "The case that you have never seen before" says the pictures. The two pictures were graphic and very annoying. One was beside his face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord used to move around his neck and to slap his face. It was so horrible, I could not believe it. How does this relate to something remotely from Hollywood entertainment ?? Nothing !! They have reduced their dignity and price ... and it shows. This was used to be the premier show to watch ... and it's just garbage now. <br /> <br /> I'll watch Hollywood from now on.
