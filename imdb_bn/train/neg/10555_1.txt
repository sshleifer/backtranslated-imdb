First of all: I love good splitmvies and are not afraid to contact the industry, but this zero-budget-flick is none of it! The quality of the photo is so much condemned, soundtrack I've heard (!!!!), and FX ... as well as the very low quality of something bad among them as they will not see a real movie (this is not what junk is here). No idea, a wafer thin storyline, primordial acting and rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each has been repeated almost 20 times ... the same for many movies (this could be a hint for The bad word was created by the audience !!!) The story seems to be that a young man has to show his father's rape and kill his mother, mental abuse Igrasta self-separation and travel time will show an adult. So far, so good ... but for these pseudo-art-idol-operators, this plot is a line in the cheap shock scene created in queue which is not a message and does not create any idea (refreshing intervals on a naked, tied-up woman Throw in a ground hole ... why? And why you only see bloody "movies" both women and thrower) ???? Bothered Yes !! Sick? Yes !! Necessary? No! Strategically? No !!!!! Everybody should see his psychologist as soon as possible, or see "The Wall" of Pink Floyd, how this kind of gore-show is wrong for the industry, how a similar thing can be done in a great way ... I hope this is your first and last (! !!!!!!!) Movies, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And remember that all out-of-the-head, all that is cheaper and does not definitely make any sense "art" automatically ...
