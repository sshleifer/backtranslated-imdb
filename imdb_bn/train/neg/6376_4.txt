Unknown to Jennifer Casey (Gina Phillips from "Dead and Breakfast") in her home, where she was recently inherited from her dead sister, her grandmother (Fei Dunaway) who is still living in it. Jennifer decided to sell it, because she needed lots of money in the disguise of Granny. He started a mysterious raven boring repeat nightmare. There was not really anyone in this movie. Jennifer looks cold, distant, uncertain, and narcissistic, when the grandmother looked repentant, sad, and narcissistic. The film is good and orderly, but it was difficult for me to take care of what happened with them to sympathize with someone. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
