You know Jason, Freddy knows, and you know the Leatherface. Now, get ready for: Security pin killer! Okay, in the Kilo Workout, if I ever saw one, then an unknown killer sent his (or his?) Victims with a larger, innovation security pins. It's kind of sure to sort an odd choice, which explains an explanation. Naturally, this movie never tries to clear the film to achieve such things. <br /> <br /> According to the title, an atomic gym is being blocked by a crazy killer and everyone is suspected. Actually, the film gives so many known sources as the identity of the killers, everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they die. And since just everyone but the killer dead wind, it's really the process of eliminating. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, even though the full name was cast, the aerobics class continued to be sincere. Actually, there is nothing able to stop the dance. Although three were killed in the next room, the activities are going on. Death is not even a cause; One character dies but the next workshop session is still visible. Director David Priare knew that he knew what the movie was doing in the name of the Keller Workout and No Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Cop shocks, explosive cut beds and hundreds of women's open meat are thrown for good measurement. Like a woman who was caught on the shoulder bed, I was very uncomfortable at the end of the killer workshop. Finally, thanks, flashed on the last screen. What happened next? You got it, women work shot Even without ending the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
