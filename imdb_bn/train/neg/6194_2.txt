With the title of "borrowing" from Warner Herzeg and with the liberal help of Kubrick, Henke and Noor, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Klein is spending naturally to destroy his British film. "Robert K. Carmichael" (for a short time) set himself up as a pragmatic research of youthful isolation and inevitably criticized Iraq war. The problem with the reality is that the characters are so utterly unreasonable and unreasonable - most of the teens are not drug-resisters, against the wrong ideas of filmmakers. As a criticism of the Iraq war, a movie of youth violence (a talented classical musician - subtracted by the society, has affected this sensitive person) It is very difficult to think about young people. There are technical power signs but some critics have overstated this. Like Kubrick and Noise, he sees that the sudden desire to engage with the supposedly serious intention can be the character of the worst movie in the recent movie. People liked "Clockwork Arranges" and "Invisible" because they liked rape and violence, but most of them liked to feel culturally superior to the most hate-related topics. So many Kubrick and Enough Henke (a serious and moral filmmaker) this label as one of the deadliest movies in years here. (I'm not against violence in the film, although it is important, but it is a tough strategy, although the people of the movie showed Alak in Clockwork Orange at ClearAware Orange that the intended purpose of Kubrick was missed by miles, in the context of many industrial directors.)
