The worst movie I've ever seen is this movie ... It is ridiculous how bad ... I was seeing it all the time I started to start half the anticipated music and the doctor started dancing .. good plot) when I was trying to enter the door overnight, Some people were throwing plastic dolls from around two feet away. But since I said it was very bad, so you have to see that you can see how bad it is that I explain it. If you see it, you are not going to do anything compared to it. I do not recommend renting it but it is about 30 minutes on TV. That's what I mean to show. I could not see more than 30 minutes but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good will
