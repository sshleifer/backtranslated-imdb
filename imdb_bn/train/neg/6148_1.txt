First off, movie events were not true. I just saw the documentary a few days ago and the movie was not something like that. Nash was the first genius of mathematics and the film should not be a story about a person who was cured and finally found love. There are also many scenes that are just simple mistakes - the cycling scene on campus did not happen in the early years of its university. My opinion Russell Crowe was not suitable for this intelligence, because he does not show the kind of personality / personality, so he really can not play one. If it focuses more on math (like pi) and not a dramatic lover. At this stage, ABM was very much Hollywood-Ish and there was a lot of places to be great. Personally I think he was not paranoid and he was somewhat up front because the people of those people knew a lesser number of "junk" than us. 5/10
