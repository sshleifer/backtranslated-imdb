This picture was absolutely awful, I even feel it is uncomfortable to call a film. Its "mammalak" movie is trying to "figure out stuff", a bunch of empty plot and aimless fascicular chaos. I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but it lets to be honest honest. <br /> <br /> I do not sync with the movie, I appreciate the Dogme95 film, Idioterne is one of my favorite time movies. So if some pictures (such as a) are made cheap for the substance, I do not think so. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The camera was not logical anywhere, there was no compatibility. I was able to accept as a person I heard nudity in this movie, so I thought to myself that even if he had a terrible minimum nudity (yes I know, I'm a mess). Well uber crappy camera - thank you for not really seeing anything, and believe me, which you do not see - you do not want to see. This image wants to make me vomit on many levels. <br /> <br /> The conversation wants to vomit me, the camera-work wants to vomit me, but most of the notion that the film praised some of the legitimate critics, better than anything I want to vomit.
