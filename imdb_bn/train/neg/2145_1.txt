I have a question for those who think of this concept. Why? Do make them think of doing a second movie. To serve the memory, do not end up with Cinderella "they lived happily after all"? I did it pretty sure, or it was implied. Wait a minute, how can a signal be if they all live happily? As long as they were trying to create the most annoying stories in history, it could not be a signal. I'm sure they can sing Cinderella for two hours with nongras, but why? A movie that ends in "happily ever after" can not be a sequel; If that happens then they will never live happily! Something went wrong, causing problems with the first completion! Why? That's not right, it's bad. This is my final word about this matter.
