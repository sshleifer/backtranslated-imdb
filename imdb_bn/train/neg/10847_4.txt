The director cut the version, which I saw, was too long for such a movie. About two hours is very long way. If you have a choice, it must be spent for illiterates. <br /> <br /> The original plot is not accepted at all, the film is in the main part of several murder scenes, but it is believed that they were shown to fill the film with only incisive violence. Until the connection is released till the next, and the lack of context bothered me there much earlier. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a horror movie. You never get the feeling you need for letters due to medieval acting and general nature (the character is presented, the character dies after 15 minutes). These pictures are part of the strong side splatter part.
