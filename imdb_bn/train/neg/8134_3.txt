A man wakes up from a nightmare about the bat. He and his wife went to the desert for a picnic in their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange sound, and he is disturbed by a bat's sight crawling across his picnic rugs. She wants to go on a tour of a cave, which she has something to do with some kind of work, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents They go on a tour, but leave the group to go out. She falls down a slope, where she is annoyed by insects. He followed her. He again heard the strange sound, and thinks a bat is coming; One, and gets her hair. He beat him, and bitten his head and attacked him. <br /> <br /> They get out of the cave, but when they have a gondola in the ski resort, they stoop, in which they have an attack on the man or the attitude of the bat. When this happens, he becomes angry. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting it. His wife was worried about Rebecca, and started a peach treatment for that, but responded with injuries from the injection. <br /> <br /> and then some people die. We see part of the transformation of human beings in a bat person. It seems that it's not just in his mind. These transitions are not clear because of a bat bite, because he has already received some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> The title appears to be inappropriate, but the last idea is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a very good movie, but I've seen desert, cave, and ski slopes and some frightening scenes. I do not think it was bad like other people, and I do not think 1999's film bats were bad, others thought it too (I rated it 5/10).
