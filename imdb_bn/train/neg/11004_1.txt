It really affects me that it has been created. The director / writer / actor must be really karmic. I can remember ID pass any other way to the script level. I want to consider what I want ... seeing these movies I'm sorry for the actors. It looks like a stand-up comedy club where the man is going to die on his feet and is sitting there, not enjoying it, just trying to try it out of his heart. ID really wants to know what the budget is, it has been estimated that it was certainly less because the quality of the film is really poor. I want to write 'joke did not appeal to me'. But to make an appeal to you to the reality, you have to be their author. Or a retard. So imagine that the script form ... and this guy is green. Thats not impressive?
