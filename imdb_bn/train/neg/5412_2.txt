Pierre Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst films of the anti-human. After the extraordinary success of Black, sudden helpless virus was created. Vivek Ober and Faridi Khan are the perfect characters of helpless people. When blacks represent cruelty and emotions and gives us a glimpse of the world, Guayaa Mohan shows two ferocious monkeys who have no qualifications for disabilities and half-round to protect their love interest. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who has started a committed with Sati, is hopelessly losing his ball to Hindi cinema. Faraden Khan was never an acceptable actor and was eligible to be banned from the film industry. Amirata Rao and Isha Deol are beautiful girls in Thailand during the wonderful time of night and there is no one to save them - except the Desperado mentioned earlier. Boman Irani as gentleman Don Tony is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.
