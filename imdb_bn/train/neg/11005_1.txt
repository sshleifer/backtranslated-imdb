This movie shows the row of sketches, which partially crosses each other. I felt late in the film, it initially only bothered me. <br /> <br /> Most of the episodes of this movie come without a recognized Panchmilain and try to surround the event using irrationality and obscenity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it failed. At least the director created something out of nothing. But this is not a good thing. Many movies have not turned as funny as their plans, but it keeps them all in the forehead. It expresses real life in the worst case scenario of filmmaking. No To correct yourself, it's worse than that. A movie with gags is so bad, that they are not funny. Due to the drowning of bad movies, it is not fun to see lead-actors, writers and directors (all three show the same person). The movie is so bad for that.
