I caught it on a screen screening. What I can say is: what ... ... hell? This image is easily running as easy to read the script for "Scarfus" as a Mikey Mouse. It is the oddity to make the least bit of sense; Even if you leave your brain in the car then the film is still not strange that it is not funny either. <br /> <br /> Crocher hunter Steve Irwin is trying to "save" a crocodile in this plot, which is a CIA investigation. After the CIA arrives for their investigation, Irwin makes mistakes for their predators, and sets them to "close". <br /> <br /> All of this story is there; The rest is final on Australian culture ("Didja see?" And "Crikey!") And the sequence of kinky dancer verbs. At one point, Iron has hit a dynamic RV and knife with the top CIA agent on top of it. Yes, it's OK: Steve Irwin knife takes a guy to the top of the RV. Let this be your guide for ridiculously bad film.
