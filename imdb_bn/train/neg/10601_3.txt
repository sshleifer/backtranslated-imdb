It is the official series of '92 Science-Action Action Thriller. Originally, Van Dam was rejuvenated as a perfect soldier (Unicolos) among a number of Vietnam War veterans. In this case, I think, about a dozen years later, Van Damme has a daughter of that age. Now he is working with the government for technical installation due to Unisex-coded Unisol 2500. Naturally, something goes wrong: On the site Super Computer (Seth named - the same year as the "King Cobra" snake) becomes power-mad, takes Uninsoul's command and even downloads his computer brain to the Super-Unisol body (Joy White) . We are looking at the next step of evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's battles, especially Unicol (Pro Wrestler Goldberg), mean only the common man: throw him out of a building - there is no good; Run him with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forget it! Van Dam is now in search of most humor for outgoing and outgoing (he's even becoming gray around the edge). But, even though he takes a leikin ', he keeps kickin'! Most of these seagulls are quite pale - pale imitations of the roots and it is certainly no stroke of the adornment, it can lead to continuous recreational, especially if you are a professional fan.
