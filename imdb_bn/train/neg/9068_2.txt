In my opinion Oscar nominated for "the worst script ever". There is no decent story, acting in rediculous, very laughable humor. Possible by every means, if you have self-respect, please do not waste your time looking at this movie. You can not see it even if actors can act. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
