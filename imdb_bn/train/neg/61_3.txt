"The Sunshine Boys" does not have a drops of drops, which titles the only satirical moment of the blue comedy title of this alleged comedy. Simon, who adapts the script from his play (which can not be known), compares the age of the old with illogical behavior - and, worse, weird, golfing, money-stimulating unreasonable behavior. Walter Mathew is an elderly Bhudevill actor, despite being asked to rejoin former television comedy partner George Burns for special television. He said the 43-year-old group asked, "How long has been finished in Voodville?" . Barnes, who won a supporter Oscar, is unlucky to have seen some thirty minutes in the film, after that Matthew already holds the element behind hell and behind. The movie gets noisier, less tolerant and it is watchable. Director Herbert Ross did hard work, not only with Neil Simon's screenplaces; Here, the juice set up gags as a cold amateur, failing to break the war (which demonstrates myths for a TV commercial at a mechanical garage, hammering away warfare routines away as half-incarcerated Matthau). At this point, Mathu was too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. "Sunshine Boys" used to drag the character to Ross and Simon to flex their mood to give some sunshine, but Walter continued continuing as we became deaf, as well. The picture looks horribly poking and shows the crawl along with a stupid pace; One soon lose hope for it. * **** to 1/2
