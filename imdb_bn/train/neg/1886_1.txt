I sometimes promised to move out of a movie (a personal policy that gives me various kinds of harmful pain like Rambo 3, Bice Lie, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Siddle was almost successful. Hundstage was a really terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austria is a frustrating, retrograde bead. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humiliate for one another - refrain from their own sad existence. The documentary style with non-professional actors is selected (most of them appear directly from the imagination of the Austrian Shock-Cartoonist Dix) Director Siddle wants us to believe that it is the real life of the Austrian (Western? Western)? Visionary sexual harassment screenplay, violence against women and people with disabilities, crazyness and deterioration. But it is not social criticism. This is pure pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you played bad, bad cinematography, bad film making. If someone requires a movie that is wrong in our society, then this person must have gone through the eyes with closed eyes. This is a pseudo-social criticism with a holes hammer. And it looks down to humans in a disgraceingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that's why I do not hate it. But it shows an ugly, misanthropic way the average person. And that's why this picture is really hateful.
