Thanks, he's not yet! This drama made in crude, simple student politics. It needs to buy a series of viewers to buy. Concepts 1: That British voter can turn into a very far left from the right side of the center. Concept 2: The debate between the media and the general public has ended all of a sudden and the only critics of the new Prime Minister are terrorists civilian, MI5, big business and Americans (naturally). Perception 3: This fundamentalist Socialist Prime Minister can unite the nation and solve all the nations, economic and social problems which combine the nation. CONCERN 4: A good thing to be cut off all relations with the United States and NATO. Estimation 5: The Soviet Union is not a cruel and oppressive regime and should have had our previous intimacy with them in the 80's. And finally, the idea 6: The reactionary forces in the US will actively try to start a coup against Britain. <br /> <br /> It is ridiculous and the program has tried only cash to achieve what it has achieved in the country with some feelings of anti-hate and wings are going to sing praises to critics. Even when it was made, the television was a very popular and influential medium, which resulted in a huge rating, so with great debate, it was a great opportunity for a large audience to talk widely about drama. Ray McInally's performance was fantastic, which is one of the few plus points. History and time have shown the huge weaknesses of the show and the plot of this show.
