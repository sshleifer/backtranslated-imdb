When you look at the collection of older, videotaped movies, you know and realize that you only once or twice, and you can not remember how valuable it is to watch them. Aliibi was one of these films; I did not do it long ago, and decided that I could give it a chance as well. If I'm happy with my decision then I'm not completely sure ... On one hand, the film is really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yes, you got it. The plot is predictable and the original is in any way. Panning is bad. Actor is bad, but it's not really surprising, because the two leads are the former soap opera star ... they used to be used. Characters are poorly written clich√©s. The film directs me to manage (the film) the easiest way to influence: court scene. Even those cardboards do not express single emotions for thin characters or against. The film does not have any true release ... even the dialogues are bad. The thing is so ridiculous that it is ridiculous. And this is one thing that raises it above the rating of 1/10: it (though, unknowingly) has many clinches and comic relief of stereotypes. I did not pay too much attention to the film, but there was something laughing about almost every time I looked at the screen. One final note: I thought of using the line "Tory spelling can not work" using the line summary, but I think everyone knows it, so I liked it for the present because it is more informative. After all, a completely bad movie, but if you do not have to do anything else and it's not the worst if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 3/10
