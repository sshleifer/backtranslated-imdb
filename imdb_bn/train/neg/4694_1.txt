I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, with the end of the Big Rig I was interested in getting out of the seat. The Big Rig is composed of "big rig" drivers who set out to supply products to the United States. Character is all wonderful people, but filmmakers do not dig deep into their kind of complexity. Instead, the movie map shows as much of the story, but it is never done. Most, we get lost. We - the audience - are not going to end up in the end and like the direction of the story, it ends somewhere but without directions, position or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How do we get here? The story is frustrating and the intention of "humanization" of managers, whom they consider to be "neglected" and "invisible", their feelings are known to be unknowingly and annoyingly. The problem here is that the truck driver lies in the director's perspective instead. The directors forward their own stupid idea to the truckers and then only edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, there is no excitement in the story, the film is not full length (15 minute sketches), "Saw Ki Ki" is not answered, and the part of the whole movie that is seen in the public is more "illuminated" about the big riggers in the outside world ( Nothing as director) nothing
