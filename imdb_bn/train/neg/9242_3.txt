What a fantastic proof: A movie about Berlin Airlift. It should all be there. Tragic events Suspense. Mates Rival Berlin's Frauleins and the solid US pilot. Love and tears What we got, which one of the above is a film. Heno Farch tried to disguise John Wayne, but he sadly failed. He works so much wood, he should crack at any moment. Instead of the hard people, he wants to play the tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with her character? Because they are throwing stones in the lake? Because he brings his coal bricks? SFX is very good, very good. Many though. In Berlin, instead of an aggressive plane like hundreds of airplanes, the attack-fighters-like Squadron? Actually it was. Interestingly enough, the White House, Kremlin and General Lucius D. The clay office seems to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same dredge, hanging down deep in Windows, such as a protective shield against nuclear collapse. Why is darkness and dust almost every scene inside? However, General Luceus D. Clay, who came across as a small, insecure, detached general, who believes in his own best-wisher plane. He had a lot of reverse. So you combine those different blunders, and as a result it is a movie which is not made towards any emotion, no mystery and no historical accuracy. Sorry, it started out so promising ??
