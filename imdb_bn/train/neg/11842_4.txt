Carsten Dunst is horribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that he just "played". I like though Izzard Plots are terrific boring. There is no real connection to the characters of the audience, sometimes it can not tell who is really sympathetic, or even care for them. Slowly, gentle movies, with some smiles, but some and very funny however. Plots are not least compelling or suspenseful. You can see each plot a mile away far away. What is this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Drama? Who care? You do not have to end this photo.
