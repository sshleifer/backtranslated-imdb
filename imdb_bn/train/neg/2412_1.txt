This movie is a long line of budget, no talent film shot on video, and a sleek cover of unwanted tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to know this movie is good to watch, grab a video camera and some red food colors and movies, and your friends roam the night and surround the neighborhood by "attacking". Congratulations, you've just created "The Living Dead Hood"! Now, see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I saw some low budget, shot on filmmakers who show talent from filmmakers and actors or very little efforts, but not even in it. Avoid until you are a true masochist or amused by horror movies created badly.
