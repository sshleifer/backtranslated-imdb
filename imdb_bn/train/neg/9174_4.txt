I usually like the zombie movie, but it was just bad. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Good share: The worst part is: too much video cots, too much matrix slow motion (it reduces work), enough blood and throat, bad acting and no stories. The only other person in the theater is smart and left side after a quick swim scene. $ 6 and total waste of time. I think it out of 10 out of 2.
