This guy has no idea in the movie. All right, it seems that he has performed some of his youth's hello theater programs, and about two acceptable films which achieved more success due to political reasons because they cheated communist censorship. All of these are very good, but look carefully: He does not know his work! The scenes do not start properly and are unsupported with unfinished content and cache. He has nothing to say about this issue, so he gives more licenses on the language of violence, nudity and atrocities. How to keep living living beings alive, who do not understand cinematographic profession and industry? Why do not they smash him?
