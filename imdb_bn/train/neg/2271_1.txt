Someone might make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer show, but this fiction version only succeeds in finding a authentic and interesting thing proven from trash-tv events. Several famous bad films (such as "Manas: Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this cool, unmarted movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not documentary about Jerry? Springer Show, which will start answering the real questions: Who are these people? What will happen in their lives after they show this show? How can the Cincinnati Mayor find yourself here? <br /> <br /> A good line: "Adaptation" for guests during the session: "Man, I can not take it seriously enough: there is no weight!"
