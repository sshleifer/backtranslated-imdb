Recently, part of Georget 2 has been captured on TV, but at the end it did not get to see itself. Just awesome! I can not even think of the plot. I know that George and Ursula were not the first films George and Ursula, which was bad enough. There are many scrambling around, but the directions and editing were so sticky and sticky, it was like to see the outtakes or deleted scenes. The real voice coming behind the app was not enough to warm me up. George 2 is probably the single bad sequel I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Because of the 10-line rule of the GIG, IMDB, I do not have to say anything about this scrapully-made-for-TV sigel when I have to keep typing. Disney, shy hanging your head.
