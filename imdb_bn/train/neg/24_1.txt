I have congratulated the talent who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you can not partner as well as you are not good, you will not get the least cost amateurs strap every piece, which is the sole purpose of getting some money. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with the camera will get the same result or better. <br /> <br /> Acting, just say: Do not look for actors in supercars. Good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some slightest experience! Mr. John Keyes, the director, find out the purpose of your life, as a director you simply suck. Your instruction is poor, the corners have all been spoiled (not good), the lines seem like they are falling from the toilet paper and the extraordinary music. It should never be done and for any apparent reason. And whatever the author, whatever, whatever. Films made in a coffee shop are not meant to serve, it requires art and skill, which I really doubt you. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a Badas Shootout movie, you should go back to it and wait. Wait till something has come better .. or just find a job in a coffeshop. You will have less pressure and you'll save movie girls on some money and bad night. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (my first one)
