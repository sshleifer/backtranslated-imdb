I can not believe how bad this garbage is! I want my $ 3.99 back! This badly-made piece of words is described in detail! Any way the shape or form dubbing aligns with the face of the actor. It appears to have been illustrated with the 1970's Vintage Camcoder. I've shot good movies with my cell phone camera. Gore is ridiculous because of the strange incredible plot. If you call all your friends on Saturday afternoon and play after the burst, then try to establish a game in his garage. Do not make me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neal and I like Jabby movies, but the production values ​​in this movie are so low that it can be unwanted. Avoid!
