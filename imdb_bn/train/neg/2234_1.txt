I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. Acting was too bad I've seen a long time. The light and sound are the best shoddy. Quickly even when the plot gives little idea (Warning: I do not give advice when I see this movie fascinatingly). This picture seems to be that you are watching a home movie of someone who is not too much. It is really embarrassing that the very little money spent on this project went to the waste, waiting to see if I have any other career except the only "star" Iva La Londria of this movie. That was apparently not hurt with the bad stick played. I am sorry that none of this criticism seems to be constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, do not try again. Squirlyem "It's a great deal of serious disruption in the department".
