'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' is such a stupid moment that if you really think this is a wonderful idea. Occasionally I was seeing a signal of Kung Pu instead of Bruce Lee's film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this image is with 'Game of Death'. If anything, this is a remake of a more seagull / 'enter the dragon', which includes many elements of the film - especially the actual footage. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) accidentally investigates death of his friend and encounters a piece of photo that is kept with the girl's daughter. During the body of the body is stolen! Billy died and his brother-in-law was kept in vengeance for his death. <br /> <br /> Tong Long is as big as her brother Bobby Lo and her really not pictured is Carmichael sort. His war power is very good however. Thank you Bruce Lee (thanks now) on the success of cash in the footage removed (now longer) thanks. Not to say that the footage is actually edited - better than 'Game of Death' but it does not prevent the film from being messy. OK, so the fight is really very entertaining (I dare say the heart-blowing) and the film is at least watchable. But this movie contains so many distance elements that it tests your patience. First, the fabulous villain who lives in his royal estate ... or that mental institution? Seriously, nuts eat raw deer, drink deer's blood, carry a monkey on his shoulder, and contain some peacocks and lions (?!). You feel sorry for this effort to make him feel hard and intelligent - you expect half the person to return to his home. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middleman is awful and when a nude hooker involved in the scene and came to a lion case I turned it off. However, I finished the film and I was happy because the view of war at the end ('Allah') was a reason to see a lot. Although the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and has excellent corography. <br /> <br /> The ending part was also frustrating if the premiere comes out. We were told that the 'Tower of Death' was a pagoda that was upstairs and underground. This sounds great, like a twist of Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles of battles on each level. Could this be the 'game of death' which was originally designed? No! The film should be named "Generator Room of Death" because it goes as far as towers. Yes, there were actually one or two 'different' styles ... there were foil terracotta scars, leopard skin and stupid beggars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If this was the purpose, then fine. However, thumbs up for the rebuilding projector room view from 'The Enter the Dragon'.
