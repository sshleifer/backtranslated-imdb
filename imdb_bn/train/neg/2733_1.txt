I debate whether the spoiler box should be checked or not. Since 99% of these shows are probably already seen by a follower of the Scrobbler, it probably does not come under an explosive department. <br /> <br /> clip show. Gorgant We all knew that the tubes were falling down while the friends started with a clip show ... and they went away in the scraws for five and a half years and the hole was broken. <br /> <br /> I wonder, the authors would not only be annoyed in writing that week and just said to themselves "Let's see other interesting things." It does not work. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, it is not funny to think of the way people have fallen asleep all the time. Todd is not funny to see his banana hammer dazzling, unless we know why he was hanging by his banana attacker. Second, to be convinced as a compilation of JD's fantasies, one was the dream of Turk, no one else imagined it, even though I forgot what I did. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen these things before. And people dance clip collection? Why? It's not funny. Finally, I have been shown the last two moments of my favorite scraps ... Cox realized that Ben was dead ... and JD was telling him how proud he was for her. <br /> <br /> But these episodes did not save even when they were seen. Summary Summary <br /> <br /> The worst phase. Bill Lawrence, please do not let your show go the same way as a friend, keep it fresh, keep it fun ... or wrap it up.
