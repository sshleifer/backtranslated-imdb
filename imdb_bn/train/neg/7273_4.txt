Barbara Shelley (firstly, the first person in Britain after working in Italy) had his first role, when he was 24, and, of course, he made a wonderful debut in the 1957 "cat girl". Although blondes and brunettes attract most of the attention (I will always enjoy Stainsgard in Utube), the lovely Ouber-Haired actress with a deep voice is always intelligent and weaknesses (such as the 1960's "repressed village" that during her screen, her husband's husband is more than George Sanders Was less.) The "Cats of people" is the only reason to see this satirical update and it can be enjoyed all the time. Although it is difficult to look for the beauty of the best showcase). His character is definitely sleeping in the nude, and when we are awake we are exposed to the back of his brilliant bare (manifested in "Rasputin-the-Mad Monk" after 865 years.) He is most of the time during the ravish gown movie a stunning strapless wonder (I Do not see what the dress is holding up, but I want to make sure). Finally, the evidence is a positive introduction that Barbara Shelley, the positive evidence that most actresses will be defeated, rises above her material and is continuously watchable in the film, the real test of a star power, which will be available soon in the 1960's in Bram Hammer's studio.
