I would like to know more about this movie if I wish. Based on Hightar Graham and her strong belief as an actress, I will put it in my rows (IMHO). The parts of the film were quite charming, but most of the movies were felt, unused, or otherwise felt just annoying or anticipated. Ibei factor can not be mentioned that many people thought about CBOs thinking ... I do not think how big is the length of the story line, it is still a little more, um, gross. And for Chargie, an animal, he certainly does not seem to attuned the signal from other Homo Sapiens. What about him (except for his warmth and some common interest) that Gray had for him? The story can be so much more interesting with a little more depth. High Point - Molly Shannon (although I did not agree with the critics who found her annoying on the occasion), drag cab and dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such a big dancer, I would like to see that we saw more, the bit that we have shown, the rest of the movie Was indeed good). May be good.
