<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> This stupidity is absolutely out of place. Jean Lockheart provided some ridiculous relief until he was forced to burn his gun in a moment of anger. <br /> <br /> Sadly, George Sanders and co-star Carole Landes committed suicide in the real life. After creating disgusting movies like this, it is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> The usual appealable sign hash is really nothing here.
