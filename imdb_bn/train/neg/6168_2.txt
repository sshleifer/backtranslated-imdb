Hmm, 7.5's IMDb rating, good comment, blah, bla ... all right, my two friends and me, we've ordered pizza, sat down and want to see something cool like iichi or at least some brains but fun as well. But naked blood sucked. This is a complete waste. Okay, the woman who likes to eat with her is pretty outstanding. But that's it. Not too much I do not summerize plots, other people have already, I just wanted to stop hype. But see it and rate for yourself. Possibly we can push the rating where it can be. Another thing that I think is: Soundtrack was worse than carpenter - OK, John calm ... :) 2/10
