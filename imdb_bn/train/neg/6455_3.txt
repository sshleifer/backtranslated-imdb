Really a terrible movie. It is expected though. Obviously low budget: An innovative, no actress (if you can "act" then there is no actress) who always plays with the nudity of the shower scene, a man in a reptile suit is often a hunter after model, a cabin wood, etc. But some rediming There are points. Although the story is not new, in most cases there are some parts that are not so distorted. For one, when a black man attacks, he does not die and he is not the first couple to die. But that's minor More importantly, I was interested in the CAT exam and Wies and Steve, which I did not see. When Steve said to Kat what he did, I believe what I said and the CAT responded. But when the creature revealed who he was, then I would be happy about the novelty of the revelation. This can be due to the lack of experience of my childhood, or it's really tricky. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is quite bad and if something is good then do not see it ... if you do not have the mood for a cheap scifi flick.
