I can not believe that I have ever seen the worst movie in my life. I smiled a few times (Perhaps why was stupid) If I let anyone see me again, then I could not do that. The plot was so awesome, it did not make any sense, and the act was so bad that they could not even try it. That movie was a terrible rating: F
