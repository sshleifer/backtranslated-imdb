Istanbul is one of the exotic movies that Iral Flein is trying to support his family in the last decade of his life and refrain from the IRS problem. This is a remake of Fred MacMurre-Awa Gardner Film Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the studio's products, Istanbul has taken advantage of the right cinematography in Golden Horn Philosophy. But before each camera's camera grew faster, it was too old to play Eral Flin, this move / adventure. His view with the Colonel Borcher is really lacking. <br /> <br /> For the kernel, he played Errol's former sweetheart, who was now hungry by the fire to save himself from the fire. She does not think both Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But it was caught by some harmful people led by Marlon Benson and Warner Clapper, who came after diamonds. We have been able to deal with them. <br /> <br /> The good reason to see Istanbul is the play singing and piano play. Most people today do not realize that there was a full jazz pianist in the lap, they only remembered him as a singer. In fact he was the first pianist, singing was a discretion. <br /> <br /> A routine action / Adventure movie for fans of that kind of movie.
