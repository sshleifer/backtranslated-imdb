All right ... so I saw my days really very strange / unusual movies. I think when there comes the mind of fear and hate in Las Vegas. Well ... and from here, whenever someone asks me, "Hey, have you ever seen the most unusual movie?" Slipstream is what I would say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, it is clear that it is going to be one of the "Trippi Camera Effects" movies. This means that the images on the screen are flashing, rewinding and fast-forward people's sounds and scenes, mess with screen colors, flash forwards and flashbacks, continuous little things ... then you have your own actual acting. People become violently violently, shoot things / people, say something strange that does not do much, in no way. <br /> <br /> The movie is a writer who begins to gather in the real life with the book, for writing and lacking a good way to explain it, you basically go to see this "trip" throughout the movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip to Las Vegas and had the same trip as Lothings, but the only difference was that it was entertaining, or painful to see his trip! Actually, I had a hard time ending the slipstream. It hurt my brain a bit. <br /> <br /> I can see the left front of some films for this movie, which is a certain cinematic minority for this movie, which is not only unique but adds to dementia feeling. Fault, fault, fault The point is, when you see it, this movie hurts your brain .... It gives a very little idea, it tries to get your attention even from the far end and even finally understands and, even at the end, happy with what you can do. Well ... and you can say that you are actually sitting through it! So if it's closed, if you want to see a movie that says "hello keys" and say both loud and your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check it out. <Br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, I congratulate you as an actor and appreciate your choice to take a stab in the direction ... please, do not make it a movie again. Next time, try something that relies heavily on a story better than camera tactics that lets viewers leave the headline.
