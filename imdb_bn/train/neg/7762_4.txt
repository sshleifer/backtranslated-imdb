Considering John Doe, apparently I inspired the creator of Kyle XYY, which I hoped would make his pilot very interesting. But I probably had very high expectations because I was quite frustrated. First of all, they turned into a volcanic drama, which was a crazy idea to show his amazing knowledge to the audience in public. So after the scene I thought that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse because no other characters were properly launched. They gave a lot of attention to John Doe, which made the story a little less curious. I was very disappointed because of Dominic Parcel's performance because I saw that he did not believe in John Doe. Another problem was the police story. It really felt like déjà vu and it was not a happy sensation. The bunch of it leads to the worst problem, episodic format. I could already see another one coming after fillers. <br /> <br /> So overall I was very disappointed by it and do not recommend it to anyone. Looks bad, now I understand why the show was canceled. In some ways I think it missed its goal, helping the character's development character find its own identity. It was tragic because there were potential people to meet with the club. Production quality was quite good and the welding was accurate. But perhaps it will never be better, I will never know, because I'm not planning to see the next episode.
