When I tell you that you see sex in this movie with a kid, then I'm not spoiling anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her sister is a vague lady to say the least, and she seems to be interested in beyond the family love. As well as a team of overwhelming characters, and started forming all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite weak and the characters are very stupid. After her husband started in a flurry and hanging with pagans even after sticking around, even sexual relations with her continued. On the exploitative side of things, there are many lively meat and some weird couplings, but there is nothing better than anywhere else. Oh, and the previous goats sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most visitors will not be able to finish it. The exploitation fans will rush, but there will be more left. <br /> <br /> 4/10
