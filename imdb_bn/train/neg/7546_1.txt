I'm a big fan of Nicholas Cage and I will never work in a movie like this. I could not believe another review and I think it should not be bad to see at least once ... but believe me, that's it. <br /> <br /> I did not see the old movie. But why they want to rebuild a movie. The very basic concept of a horror movie is that it should be a very intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This picture does not fall in them and is simply stupid. I just hope to see the movie that it will be interesting at some point but it never happens. <br /> <br /> This movie is not big for fans of cage as well as fans of the movie. You could probably display it for televisions.
