I have never penned a movie pani, but I started to feel it even after seeing it. Someone does not see the funeral and says to the bereaved, "My relatives have died, so why should I take care of you?" <br /> <br /> The campaign was reduced, if anything, anything that could be called "art." As the daughter of deaf parents, I was especially annoyed by the use of deafness. The deaf person who feels the inexpressiveness of the inexperience, perhaps it was investigated, it was not ignored. <br /> <br /> The word "Chhutjah" comes to mind. As a writer, I will be away with a few things: The Holocaust is one. This is another. I was not so arrogant of these movie makers (and inactive).
