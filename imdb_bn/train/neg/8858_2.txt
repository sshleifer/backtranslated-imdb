The police super outside Ben, believes that his sister has been killed brutally and wants to kill the murderer, but Stephen has come to him, who believes that his sister is a Veraowolf victim of worship. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan went to the transfiller to end this recession. <br /> <br /> This incredibly scary B-grade stuff and I wonder how it got released. It makes the original 'haoling' look like an original composition. Christopher Lee thinks this was the reason for my worst performance. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of misunderstanding with this really cheap-ass movie, in fact Anne's Hammy and Wooden Performance Makenro, Reb Browne, Marsha A Hunt and Scene Dancing (Li has not forgotten), Chasey Fashion (Sunni) , Cheeses and hair, special effects, bad use of shades, humor ... if there are 80 seconds of music (some pictures are just paying attention to some unknown band), And with a view to see the fingers flat and boring dialogue is a tedious story. I thought it would be very fun if it was bad, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The location and settings of this image looked very good, but it's about ... In fact, I'll add a short stripping scene to Saibul Danning. <br /> <br /> The last credit band played the song in their cone-house during the strange montage of the movie scene, which is why I asked why? <br /> <br /> Shocking horror pieces, but at least it's not annoying. <br /> <br /> 1/5
