Marilyn Miller made three films before his unforgettable death - Wonderful Sally (1929), Comedy Her Majesty Love (1931) and this triangle - Sunny (1930). It is as poor as the early box and in an attempt to musical instruments - although she has four dancing numbers, she only sings only two songs (WHO and one alone). While the rest score jittisoned with Spritely title tunes, we can hear the next in background scoring. Miller's overweight and amateur shows here - no star quality at all. Even her dance is cloutish. The film is very badly written, full stock of steak and weird joke and stupid circumstances. If you are interested in an actor in Miller, always check it out, but stay away for general entertainment.
