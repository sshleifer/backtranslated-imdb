I'm a big fan of sci-fi 50s, but this is not my favorite one. The idea behind the film was a natural car for the classic Tinni Boper Saif-Fi Flick, the director counted too much to carry the film. It is clear that he is working with any money, because the whole film is loaded with swollen dialogue which goes forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Wrote many poor, run-on dialogs. Steve M. and Anita C were good to see together, but the good sky ... could anyone vote for how anyone in their right mind would believe at thirteen years of age?
