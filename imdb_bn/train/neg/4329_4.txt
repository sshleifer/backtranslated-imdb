I do not forget the Arabic valation movie's cute and great comedy! Line, pacing, and time that events outstanding in the film! However, this European vacation signals let down a major. <br /> <br /> This series, a game show in Griswald, won a European holiday. The problem is that most of the film's humor is a bit more lighter, "ha ha" smile. For example, a flight flight attendant asked Clark, "What do you want to do?" Clarke replied, "No, I'll stay here." The only line that is funny in this movie <br /> <br /> The European holiday is fun. The authors highlighted all the jokes from the first film, attempting to re-do a script that was made earlier, and while finishing the picture, a ridiculous snap-stick will depend on the sequence of Chase scenes to end the time. <Br> <br /> Bad, normal comic standout such as Randy Quaid, cousin Eddie and real kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie are so good. Their replacements are not funny, they can not work and they seem to be running with speed most of the time. There are some weird social jokes and opinions that are not funny, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The place that made their legend! Do not join them in this European horrible adventure. Visitors can see the original holiday movie at this place! You will be glad you
