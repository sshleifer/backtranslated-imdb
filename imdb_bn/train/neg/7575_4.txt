A retired diplomat, well-played by Michael York, went to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who killed the diplomat's police son. There diplomats met a very powerful and competent Russian police capable of bringing Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I think the 1980s old works have always been remembered, which always marks the Russians as bad guys. Religious US government This time it is interesting to see Russia as a hero. <br /> <br /> Not a great flick, it's usually a "B" action flick. Michael York borrowed some classes in this medieval movie. Alexander Nevsky, who played Russian police, noticed "Bla", but surprisingly there is some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he wants to chemistry with any person in any scene. Frustrating, the handsome Adrian Paul died in the first 15 minutes. Now, if Adrian Paul has been in this movie for a long time, then this could be an average "B" action flick. What I can say about Adrian Paul is to keep an eye on the first 15 minutes of the movie. Well played villain by Richard Tyson, your usually bad guy In this movie he is very blonde and very terrible. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else on TV to watch this TV. OK. It does not suck too bad. Action view modest Acting may be better, the plot may be moved very quickly, but hey, what do you see in Russia today!
