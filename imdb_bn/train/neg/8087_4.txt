This movie lacks trust with helicopters, which did not exist until the 1950s. But even before the women's movement of the 60's and 70's, no woman could do it here. About the only part of the movie, you can believe that Germany should know where the landing will be. Ignore the spell that the British retained, even if they did not, that they could not even travel in such a way that the Germans were to assure the Germans that they would land in the Kalyaya. It's not a big thing that does not work in the movie. This is the result of all the mistakes that make the film a failure. Bad instruction, bad script, no attempts to integrate (at all) combine to make all the movie flats fall. Generally spawn should be faded into wood. Spies suspect that the information they have about them is legitimate and is notorious for being identified. This is one of the game that was from the beginning. This spy is doing something without spy. There are some credibility and some may instill some mystery instills reading your only chance book.
