I do not understand why the remakes have become trendy. I saw that every repetition is awful, and this is no exception. If you saw quote from Ben Jones, it is the "lazy" part of the trash, he is quite right. Why would they choose a wonderful television show, which I like, misses a single episode and breaks and destroys the 1-4 season in DVD, I never know. The television show was a family show, and even though Daisy was in the body, it was really flaunted, or even shouting addresses, saving outfits. A family show has become a messy piece of garbage, and I would not recommend going to see it. Another thing I do not like is that John Scendor and Tom Wetpatt are excellent actors (along with the original cast), and they are extremely cute. The new b and the look is not even a little clever. That was one of the drawers for the show. Welding is terrible. They might at least have gotten a brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified boss Hogg. He has played any role which is totally contrary to this role. They played half as well as the sole role Will Nelson Cousins ​​JC, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is her own actor, and she has made her perfect for this role. I'm thinking that the cast is horror, the story is horrific, and everyone has destroyed a wonderful show and it has become a messy, terrible movie. I will not recommend anyone to see it I only saw it from curiosity, plus 4 DVDs of the season was a free ticket. I could never pay for watching this movie, but it was free. Do not pay to see this movie.
