If I write a review about a movie, maybe it will be with me ... but usually I hope I forget that I have seen these two weeks from now on. Then why are you disturbed? Because I'm again seeing myself a low-rated movie which was fun to watch. I do not expect that I can stay at home while I am at home. <br /> <br /> It was not great, at least it was not intolerable ... errors do not have a comedy that always makes me cringe. It was just the sweet fluff ... and if you can not take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who protect this film because it has been confirmed that it must confirm its specific demographic and it will not be part of an adult's total wealth. <br /> <br /> It provides some good chocolate here and there, but nary is a side splitter. Make sure it is silly and not only conducive to recreational, but at least it does not suck (as soon as it has said a lot). Perhaps those people are afraid of their sensitive party? <br /> <br /> There is a tendency to grade in my neck curve, so my book 4,5 or 6 is really okay. It gives a 4 knowledge and strengthening its rating during this writing. Give it 1 or 10, since most of them did so making rating numbers meaningless. I can not believe how people think strongly about this forgotten fluff (or I am bored to write about it) about one way or another. Am I missing something? However, it should be noted that Emma Roberts has played her role as firmly as Clairadat. B * f role does not disappoint when Aurel Kebbel often gets her due to her character. You can also recognize Bruce Spence with Leonard, though his role is helpful. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, of course you can miss it. But, if you have pre-teen girls in your life, rent this movie for them ... and be ready to hate it (you can even enjoy it).
