Haha There is a doubt that Tommy's here is an evil. I do not know why, but for some reason, tiny kids little kids tend to come across a little butt munches. And since they are kids, they will not die. Because they are boring ... well ... without resort to terrorism. But those are less and far away. <br /> <br /> However, onto the movie. DVD can not find this movie? Sure you can! All you have to do is buy Chilling Classic DVD Pack! You will not get metamorphosis in DVD for only $ 15, but you will get 49 other films! What the deal! pff OK. I've done ads for this cheesy movie. Let's say, this movie is not worth Rs. 15. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical scientist. Yes Because seeing this chemist Peter plays all the chemistry scientists look handsome. He is trying to come up with a serum to stop body degradation. He wants to drag the plug into the project that he is working on, so he tries on himself. But it's a horror movie, because it starts and starts, and incredibly long conversion sequence that takes around 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> She has a son who falls in love with a woman to paddle a movie. And she did not get married! Defamatory! But of course Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... I take it back She is the most irritating character. Peter wants to seek over Peter's work and gloats when he's in hospital, worse than the old lame guy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, killing everyone on its way to get normal back. But eventually he ended de-evolving in a disguise. Yes, I do not know. The end does not really make any sense. And if you are really looking forward to getting a better salary, you are not going to get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie .... It's just frustrating because of a great lack. Reward If you already own 50 movie packs and this is next to your list, but you are not for a snozer, but you are not even for a great movie. Just sit back, relax, and eat plenty of food. Because this movie is never going to look out of you skin. <br /> <br /> Metafarmis receives 10 plastic incognito heads.
