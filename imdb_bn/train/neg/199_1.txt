This is a terrible movie, horror scripts, bad sides and dishonest end. Also, bad acting, except Clansy Brown who are involved in crime here, and in addition to Michael Pollard. It was crazy to watch this movie - you really unload bad movie roles to see bad movie lines better. <br /> <br /> The movie represents a father and son that they can not see possibly related. The male leadership part is not well written and it seems unusual in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. Woman leadership work and her brother, police, any knowledge. So, at the end of the film, a big step in her part does not give script-based ideas.
