This is one of my worst movies ever * ever seen! Even worse in TV movie level standards. This plot is erroneously erroneous, and the names known in this film are lost in confused, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director could put together this excuse for a movie - it's bad. Build as a 'psychological horror thriller' - it's definitely awesome. There is nothing thrilling about it. And it could hurt you emotionally! Such promises were made in the initial opening scene - the possible journey of whether the soul is the only side of the brain, but the cross-crash scene is beyond the complete belief of the followers. No matter how much you try, you can not care less about letters. There are so many drunken ideas that this movie is a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and, worse, this film will lead you to the brain's death! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 films in DVD. , And this is the first time I'm going to get my money back. Steer clear
