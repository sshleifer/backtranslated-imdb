Above all, tell me I'm LDS or instead, I'm a Mormon. So when I saw this picture, I automatically gave the benefit of suspicion. I can usually get some redemption in every movie I see. And this one was not the exception. It has its redeeming moments. But they are less and far away. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was that I was very annoyed, it seemed that Hellstorm got the shame of our church! In the LDS church, the congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is "cultural hall". Sometimes these two names are mentioned. The Church is never referred to by the name and "values" refers to as far as our Church believes. <br /> <br /> Does it really make me wonder if LDS or LDS wannabes of managers? This picture was so unlikely! It really showed our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see just what we were giving, but what we believe is also. Instead it was gently entertaining and a lot left to be desired. If I did not have LDS, I would have thought that the girls are foolish, stupid, and embarrassed for their faith. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I would recommend to my non-LDS friends. <br /> <br /> Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!
