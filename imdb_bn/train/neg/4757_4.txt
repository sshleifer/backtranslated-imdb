Shortly before, I saw Sleith (1972), two famous actors Michael Kain and Lawrence Olivier. Michael returned to Caine, but she is now husband and Jude Law his wife lover. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic game. <br /> <br /> During the movie I always had a feeling to see a game. One of the classic riders I hate is one. When I see a movie adapted to a game, I still have to watch a movie or just watch a game. Director Kenneth Brungin has done some amazing movies in the past, but he missed this time. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I have never felt that anyone lived in this house. Photography was not bad, but the light was awful. Sometimes blue light, dark, green light, friendly for eyes it was round. <br /> <br /> acting was really good. Michael Caine's and Jod's Law Perform Their Best I really want to see these 2 boys playing together on stage. But I must admit that I have never been a fan of the Jewish law. The weak part was in the middle part. I think that this section is still very mysterious and was just great guideline. I felt it to sleep in the middle and I tried to see it always. The last part is good and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not awful, but it looks more like a movie for the critics than the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still much more entertaining than a masterpiece and Sleuth (2007).
