I have to say that I saw this image almost six years ago, and I actually enjoyed it. I recently bought the DVD, and after seeing the second I was wondering why I liked it. The acting was awful, and as usual we have stereo-usually clansmen in their counterfeit dresses. The acting was awful. Tim Roth did just like Liam Nixon, but I do not know what Jessica Lange thinks. <br /> <br /> Plot line was good, but execution was executed. I am tired of portraying Scotland as a film. Braveheart was worse though, in which this movie is preserved only in mercy. But seriously, people did not talk like that at the time, why do all actors have accentuated at Glasswave? The film is just about to tire out and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I see this only person here who thinks this film is good American, and since I honestly see why they may like it, I know they have inspiration for men in the cents. However, if you are thinking of buying a DVD, then I would say spend your money on something else, like a good movie.
