The worst movie I've ever seen! Acting, dialogue, manuscript, sound, light, plot line. I enjoy the Swedish movie but I can not really say anything positive about this. The war scenario is so ridiculous that it is impossible to take it seriously. And when the lead character just looses its shirt, while holding down the bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure whether it might be fun, or if someone thinks it's a good movie element? Regina Lund is the only half-line actor, but he disappears in a flood of ridiculous words and incredible reactions. It scares you that someone has actually spent some time and money ...
