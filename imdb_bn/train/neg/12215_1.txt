What I can say is that my time was a theft, which I was taken to watch this movie and I must have a terrific experience. Pha Anne Lee is a terrible actress and inconsistent in this movie. Larryjoe76 is probably a rock critic. The intrigue is thin, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. See this movie in your trouble. <br /> <br /> This film should not be after the film for a little or no revenue for Sindhu Song from David Tong. The banned plot tries to compete with other Rome-comers and mix it in the scene. It was like a dry paint dry. <br /> <br /> This image was a total waste of time and place. I've seen movies on YouTube well
