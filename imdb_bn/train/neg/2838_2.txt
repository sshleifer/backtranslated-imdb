Skip missions: see Galactica and the original Living Legend episodes. Network Living Leaves the part 1 and 2 of the Legend and they are involved in an intriguing episode of horror fire. Although the Galaxy Legend 1978 is the best of the TV series, although Galactica is no network-controlled writing and preparation time for proper production. Fire in space, one on one, one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, see Galactica, the original Star Trek and then the revival track series, and you can see the difference in quality among the networked scientists and syndicated sci-fi.
