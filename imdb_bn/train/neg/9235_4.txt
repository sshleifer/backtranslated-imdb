This woman does not stop talking throughout the movie. He memorized each line, and distributed all without a bit of natural passion. She has a most uncharming lisp, and her voice sounds like a pitch on a blackboard nails. This film is not very close to Bit Dreke and a considerable amount of Kerry Grant, who left entirely the rest of the film.
