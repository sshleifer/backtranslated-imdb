It was 1 in the morning and I had nothing to do. Do not judge me ... <br /> <br /> <br /> We came back during Spanish settlement. A team made their way onto an island. They will not take much long before encountering a big "reptile", which gobbles their horses. Soon they were captured by the natives and they would have to kill "reptile god" to achieve independence. Cg sucks; This reminds me of CG's first console video game. Encounters had hair. The only positive thing I talked about about this was the local hottie running around a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it's just a discreet effort.
