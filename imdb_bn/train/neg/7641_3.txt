This is one of the movies that is trying to be moody and tense, and instead, all ends up tripping itself. When I saw it at a queer film festival, I was excited by the "young college threesome trio went wrong", however, too much has become quite frustrated by the end. <br /> <br /> There is a true "critical story to criticize" because much about the plot can not be done - but I got this jittery, musician and complete sadness. It's bold and almost awesome, with seventeen a darn vague flash painting with imposing music and jerky close-ups. It just did not work - in some scenes where impressive scary was instead supressing my audience snickers and rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting compound, but this just spins down into a dark, sad spiral.
