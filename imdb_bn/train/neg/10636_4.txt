I was looking forward to the show's authenticity with the quality of the actors and Scott Brothers. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed! Yet we again believe that KGB is a group of neutral bodies, which is not clear what they are doing. At one stage, a ridiculous scenario where 4 KGB agents can not manage a CIA agent. I tend to tired of this, that the spy game that went during the cold war became tired of one sided and completely wrong picture. I am ridiculing that the United States is unable to make motive movies about them involving WW2 and beyond. Just like the sad U-571, where we believe that the Inga machine is completely lied again. <br /> <br /> "Company" very well depicted and acted in his credits. The local is also very well realized. Alfred Molina puts a great performance as Keaton (the conflict between them is very good). I really wanted to like this show and I'm not sure that I'll finish watching the other 2 episodes, but I really want American productions to stop their spy from portraying the army, which is superb and physically superior to anyone else. Planets It detractcts from the feasibility of being old and quickly can be a 10/10. <br /> <br />
