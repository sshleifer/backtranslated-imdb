I can not be a critic, but I am going to this movie. I just saw the movie in the cinema and at first I want to say what I hate the story means to frighten a snowman along with little kids, secondly it is quite beautiful, but the movie is so perfect budget they probably use my graduation vote BOMB so ketchup !!! Excellent try and siege will suck as much as twice.
