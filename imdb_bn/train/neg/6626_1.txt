I saw the picture and I became drunk, because the movies were stupid and annoying. I thought Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole picture was damaged and they were "shole" spoiled. Cast and crew were bad. While watching movies, some people sleeping throughout the theater ran away in the middle. Amitab Bachan's performance was poor, I thought this movie would be a year's seratam, but this film will be the year's seratom flow. Someone with Ajay Devgan did not do justice to his work. These pictures do not deserve any audience. I bet that this film will flop. <br /> <br /> "Ultimately This Movie SUCKS"
