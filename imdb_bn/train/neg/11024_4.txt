I saw this photo first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were edited only by the Censorship Committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I saw it as a complete form. And what's that? Plot incredibly stupid - 2 genetic disasters have survived and feminists find powerful, straightforward and fundamental women full of deadly women. Men now try to fight it, and then follow the practice of stupid behavior - sex drive, desire for sex slowly, feminist showing completely foolish people (you can not agree with them, but they are not fools at all), and so on. Starar Jarji Stewar performs even wood and oddly bad - he just pulls a weird face and "I'm on a lift with a nude chick and I do not have anything to him!" Like repeating sentences saying. It wanted to be a comedy, instead, it turned a vapid furs, predictable joke and full of waist innuendos. Do not waste it on your time - this is just bad.
