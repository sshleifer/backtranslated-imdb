This weekend I just saw "28 weeks later" which was very good. Then I saw this picture. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you it's the most annoying so called that you can ever see. The scenes were unreal, there were no scripts and no plots. Alien creatures were genuine. And the battle scene is less light than a school yard fight. And to make it worse, Coder was an uncontrolled loose tongue that attracted attention from the original film. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; Rather go and see after 28 weeks. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
