Sadly, this is not 'the best British girl film since the hellfire', even though the DVD cover claims it, which makes me cheat by buying it. However, it is a tribute to many of the oldest scary, most notably Amikas stabilized films. <br /> <br /> While shooting small TVs, we all know that there is more to it than a movie feeling of a TV, much better work can be done. Every scene, set, and shot looks like the same way (old key, fill, back setup), which only increases the look of the finished piece. Gore content, quite genuine, ridiculous. From the inaugural shot, where we clearly see a man sealing the head of the foam rubber separately, through cheap prop hammers, animal effects and terrible cigarettes, there was nothing that affected me. <br /> <br /> The acting is hateful, from the nearby Komato detective to Brady Dueraf, through Danny Phillips, I have seen the worst person in the worst movie. Each of the elements is more stringent than the end, and the set becomes worse during films. Find out 'psychological shelter' - I saw a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad sign sign, and the most wicked (and not well) pad cells out there. <br /> <br /> It took me out of the end of the film, without my understanding, four attempts (terrible, moving) away from a scope of opportunity. During the film, I actually got Dusting at one time. <br /> <br /> This is a sign of the last known identities of Emily Booth's breasts, which I suppose is one (um, two) thing it's going to do for it. <br /> <br /> I have heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I want to believe them, but I can not possibly prove it. If you want respect for Amicus, avoid it and instead go for JustinMan's special Christmas. <br /> <br /> It's currently fighting with Blair Witch 2: Shadow Book Never Seen for My Bad Movie Title
