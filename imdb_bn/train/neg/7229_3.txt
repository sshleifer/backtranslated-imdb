The film seems to have started in the middle, presenting the peripheral players such as notable and presenting the main characters without any material and thin slim and / or unwanted back-stories. Often anyone has a credible or visible motivation for their actions in this film. The plot rambles and ultimately does not go anywhere, the dialogue has a little idea how to get the best from the camouflage and trite and its actor to the director. It almost feels like the first half of this movie but it has never been made. <br /> <br /> We have been told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared above New York City and the Central Park is inappropriately an Arctic landing ground. Yet none of them think that the majority of the population has created a stir and it is the least concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We're presenting "evil corporation" in Eugenex but it's really a convenient pride to float the universe with just a couple power-tripping minions. The whole "Eugenex-E-Bad" double-endender is handheld and never really pans up here. We have to take care of our central characters, but we can not know enough about them. This world is so unused or completely unused that it stops as a harmful logic for 1 hour, 40 minutes rape. <br /> <br /> "Ground Breaking" has been digitally created in the animated world, all I can say is that this movie was created almost at the same time many more directors did the same thing with more rich and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending time looking at this movie, the rest of the burning question was in my mind, "So what?"
