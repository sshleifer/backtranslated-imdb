Did you hear said to live every moment as if it ended? Whether it's your last day or not, I do not waste any part of watching it! Nicole Hilts offers some nice moments of eye candy (which is covered with disappointment) and David Deloise shows why she should be on small screen or dog food advertisements. With a terrific dialogue, there is no "art" in a shallow, unrealistic plot meaning "ring art". <br /> <br />
