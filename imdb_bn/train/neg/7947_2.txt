When I saw this movie on the Fearnette, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it was not. There are no sources I have been allowed to feature on that site on this site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> Acting from all the actors is amazing. I hate the story The story was stupid. The movie starts with a scroll with a guy and it has a stamped sign in it. He breaks the seal and some disasters happen. The water turns into blood, the ocean dies, the moon becomes red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also boring. He does not make much sense to the staff. Looks like a piece when it looks like with a date. Incidentally, it begins the enthusiasm about the expected date of her baby's birth and it starts researching and asks what it means to religious people. <br /> <br /> * Spiller Alert * <br /> <br> The two worst events occurred in this movie, executing a mentally annoying person, who claimed that God killed him for his parents and ended Demi Moore told to have died when she was born after transferring her child. <<br /> Here's what happened. The mentally challenged person shot and killed and universality began. Demi Moore admitted to a hospital in the middle of a huge earthquake and gave birth to her child. He touched his child's head, moved his soul into the child and then died. Then, stop the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Why suddenly change mind is Allah? When the governor gave permission for the death of psychiatric disabilities, he became angry, the only single woman transferred his soul to his child and forgave him? <br /> <br /> * The last speller * <br /> <br /> The movie is quite stupid. It is another religious end of the world promotion piece Acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is nice. Have all that. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this picture 2 stars out of 10. Acting with many cruelty!
