This movie started out early, Frank Morgan advised his daughter Anita Lewis's marriage against Gary Cooper's marriage. Frank Morgan, playing an ornamented gold digger, complained loudly to Cooper about his absence from the hand of his family - along with his daughter Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is the billionaire Hollywood (my mind), a legend of Cooper, and Louis is a very versatile, and less appreciated actress who rarely played a major role. There is nothing against my Teresa Wright, and when she is not happy with the great range, she usually gives heart-warm acting. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening ceremony, the story goes to the slide towards the end. I could not find anything ridiculous to hug Cooper's resident. Allow the dog to continue smoking, or alternatively he will provide some ways to cure ill cigarettes. Moreover, with a general sense, someone allows to keep liters of cigarettes without any means to settle it. And finally, someone crushes a cigarette into a napkin in his right mind and sticks his pocket! This whole sequence seems to be just the Cooper silly and gauche. This is a poor stimulation - Illustrations and ridiculously humorous illustrations. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is equally converted. Nobody gives himself a full medical examination without consulting his intentions or suggestions! That Cooper has so been removed from reality to be very funny - it's stupid! Stolen children from the hospital is a serious legal offense and it does not laugh at anything. Eventually, the horror of Cooper's horror, neurotic attention has hit nerves with some people who may focus on feeding and weighting their baby who felt anxiety about their newborn babies. But to me they feel very tired and slow. Clothing and phenomenon sections topped those scenes, though conversely, the script writer went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Lines do not have scripts to create humor. They just miss all the cylinders. Smile does not come miles a minute, but like a light year-a minute. When Frank Morgan is in the camera, the film does not have any power or humor. <br /> <br /> The scene that is completely destroyed when Cooper's love interest and their grandmother are assembled in the same hotel. Room together. Perhaps there is a rich vein of humor somewhere in my mine, but none of it was found out. <br /> <br /> Finally, two very favorite girls are going to get a hit. Predecessor, Anita Louise, who gets hanging on her wedding wedding night! Although it's not a camera, it's its fate, and it's not particularly fun - even a loose end. He did nothing in this film to disrespect me (like Gail Patrick, tell my dear wife). As a result, I hope (possibly "expecting" a good word in the context of the movie!) To enjoy a happy ending for Anita Luis. At the end of the movie, such a nice character has been wiped, actually damaged the "happy end" effect of Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I waited for something to do, so much of the era film's characteristic for the dialogue ... and it has never been delivered. Frank Morgan is a completely different performance in a slightly different role here is completely wasted here.
