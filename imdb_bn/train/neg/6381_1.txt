This image is about a group of additional parasitic gay black men to eliminate the world's women in order to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I saw how bad it was that I saw it. Still, I was surprised to see how bad I was. It looked more like a film made 50 years ago. Acting, if any, is too bad. Set and props so laughingly fake, no college film Mega budget appearance. And the special effect is ridiculously easy, as others commented, indeed, the jaw drops, but the jaw droppingly embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film one has to be seriously drunk, or the consciousness of the changed state. If I live in Denmark, then my countrymen will be very shy and humiliated by making so bad movies.
