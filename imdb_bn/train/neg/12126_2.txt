Here is another Diane Lane movie where she cheated her husband. This is the only role he knows how to play? This time it was set in 1969 and with the blouse man she cheats her husband. I am so surprised that so surprised. Then her husband gets crazy and threw milk. I would not be surprised if he slept with milkman. I will not be surprised because he is asleep with ice cream because it is a very annoying movie. After throwing some milk, he is sorry and again seen the blouse man. Duh Then she is made with her, gets stung by her son wasps. My mom does not always throw a rock at me in a pot duck. These kids did not have time to talk to the mother, she was busy with the blouse man.
