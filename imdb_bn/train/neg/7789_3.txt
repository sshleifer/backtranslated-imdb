Although not properly objectionable, the 1967 edition "Polyn of the Polins" must be absolutely absolute. This title can guide you to pay tribute to Pearl White (the 1914 silent 20th episode of the original casserole), but for that the 1948 edition will serve you better with the title of Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like the weakest mix of "Casino Royale" and the movies of Alvis. The worst of these is not a combination, but many more such tapestry tapes together so that things move backwards into two styles. <br/> <br /> There is no unity in the production of Paanemela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), this is a good match because both acting skills lack basic fundamentals (imagine Mandy Moore) playing against Dan Cole ). <br /> <br /> After Austin, "Evil Ray Slayd" will play opposite John Aston, it is really painful to see genius discrimination among them. In the mid-60's, she was the daughter of "Dodge Rebel", as she was shown in the same series of dangerous situations-imagine Sandra D is a dark blue jackpot. When Automaker's Add Agency replaced her with "Dodge Faver" girl, one got the bright idea to look after her in a feature film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> George does not fall in love with her (Polin-Mrs Osborn) and hides a number of opportunities to be accepted. George left to look for his fate, and 19-year-old Pauline gets jobs in search of the richest oil in the Middle East's royal youth. When he tried to add attractive blonde to his harem, he went away and was in danger from danger. These African Pygmies want 99.9-year-old Millionaire who wants to make her a year-old grand-daughter until she gets enough for her marriage, film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> These are all intended to be harmless and charming but only manage the silly parts. There are some attempts to incorporate a silent film look into action sequences by simulating camera under-cranking (which speeds up). Unfortunately all other (film stock, production design, editing) was depressed in the 1960's. Nothing here can reach the images of Pearl White. It is connected to a train or a railway track near the train waiting for the train. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
