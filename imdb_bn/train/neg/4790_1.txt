I loathed this picture. The original fantasy was such a wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked like some obscure, incomplete documentary and felt. At the end of the 80's, Fantas II spoke about the action, but maintained this beautiful mood. Sorry, Phantasm III is just awful. It explains all the weird events of exhausting previous movies, which are reduced rather than expanding their capabilities. It basically degrades the frustration of imagery from the first Phantasm like a cheap reenactment. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they feel more like insects from more mortal deaths. Hundreds of people were hanging on the roof like a Christmas growing Christmas drafts. Does anyone do - prop master, dp, editor, director - notice or care that they looked so bad? Even worse, Phantasm III presented one corny, unfunny joke after the other. How different from the intensity of the first film. The main fantasy uses humor to relieve his relentless focus on the death. Fantas III uses death to set up countless cheaper jokes about reggae discipline: Most of the film's "flying balls" say haha, oh, i found it. Maybe the crew got a kick out of this joke, but they are on us
