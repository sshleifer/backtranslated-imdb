This movie was so ridiculous that I have never seen it. I really thought that someone had made their own version and dubbed them in the movie store. This movie did not make me sick because it was fantastic, but I've lost 250 on it! It looks like my brother and I went to a house and made the movie myself and edited slaughter footage in it! I got very tickets, even BT had the ability to get more credit than the killer, even it was not correct, that the cow's head was made from OMG, the game's meat or hard gum, I could not even find all the words to explain it. Do not watch this movie !!!!!!!
