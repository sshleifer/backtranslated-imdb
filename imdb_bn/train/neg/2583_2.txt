Another American pie movie has shoved down our throats and this one is the worst of all of them. It does not deserve the American Pie name. They have to stop at "marriage" <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a stupid porn movie that has crushed the title to get American. When I was watching this I felt like I was watching a different series. It does not fall like the American pie all right. It has different humorous and more rude and more sexual scenes of other American pie films. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. Actually I do not recommend any "American Pie Presentation" films. Just stay with the excellent trilogy <br /> <br /> 2/10
