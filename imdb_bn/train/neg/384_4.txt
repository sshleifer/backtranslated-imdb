I do not believe much of AIDS conspiracy theory, but it is interesting to see the socialistically interesting event dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, horror and death and paranoia often created dark fantasy. This was particularly true of San Francisco's politically fundamentalist and sexual extreme Demi-Mande. The city, famous for its beauty, is rarely exaggerated than this picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A complete loss. In fact, I have seen the most appealing performance that the Eriat Levi is a crude and brutal Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective <br /> <br /> Highlights: The film's Girllee Tragic Turinot is an amazing motif and Icon Performance Artist Ron is an amazing silent actress.
