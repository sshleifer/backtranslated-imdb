I did not enjoy this movie. For one, I think it is irrelevant and irrational, because for some reason. I felt it remorseful (against women), the film seems really nothing, and I could not find any letters that are liked. Really, it does not seem like everything here. Maybe I'm feeling something, but for me, this movie is mostly wasting time, when I can be a bit more productive and enjoyable. Using my face as my cushion. James Garner's story is such as C. Thomas Howell and Sheryl Jones and James Cromwell It's been lost all the time here and I'm sure it's a low point among their respective careers. The film also contains Geneli Harrison (since the company's next year), and it is beautiful to play an unreasonable role. But even then, he 'emerged above the medieval script. For me, the tank is a 3/10
