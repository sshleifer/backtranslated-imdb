The robbery of train near Ummah robs the heads of responsible retired Sheriffs to kill his chain-gang and his wife (as well as the hidden hide of gold to give thanks to the screen writer). In the 1970s style of violence and atrocity, western culture was tried to get up to date, even in the late 1960s, some of the newcomers from the later part of the 1960s were not in the same league like the West. It is unlikely easy and square, with only the fifth-bag and female roles of potential rape. After returning to the order of former Sheriff, Charlton Hesson gave one of his greatest, at least inspired performance (he had a good moment, tried to read letters and was stigmatized for glasses). James Coburn, like a half-crazy half-line, is very much like a self-pilot, but there is also a way to make Coburn's even curiosity dialogue and make the situation a little coincidental and inefficient. It's all the way to show her * **** to 1/2
