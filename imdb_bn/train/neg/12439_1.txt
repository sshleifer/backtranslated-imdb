The first "Home Alone" was one of the most fun movies of the 90's. The second was funny with the same joke and joke! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I asked Kevin about how he could continue with the same story he was considered for 17 years until 1997. He can take care of himself, is not he? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes a boring as a child and makes him sick. The child is 6 years old and the mother left her alone? The burgers team is innocent? If you want to watch this movie sadly, I really do not want to know too much details. But please, I would recommend that you stay away from here. It's not worth your precious time. Keep a pencil on your nose, work in a piece of paper, or give a nipple! It's good to see "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
