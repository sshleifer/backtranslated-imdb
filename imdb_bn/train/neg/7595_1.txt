"Dust asked" looked stimulant from the trailer, and we especially loved all actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelled enough to be considered as a drama, and it was not enough fun to be a comedy. It effectively mocked itself, and no recreational effect. About seventy minutes after waiting for this to be done better, my wife and I came out, evaluated not to waste even more time. It was not only attractive, moving, funny or artistic. It seems that it was written, produced, and directed by a high school kid; There is still bad, otherwise we have not mentioned our time and money as unusually talented actors such as shameful waste.
