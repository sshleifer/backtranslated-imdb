Commenting on "jabs", this is not like a big mechanical toy. Well, "Blood surf" simply wants an animal as believable as the "Jaws" series shark. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are harmful. Acting and direction is not much better, either; They seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than a horror movie. The man's attitude of working in this movie is not only continuity, but also for the audience. You say, "Liked" this movie only encourages filmmakers to encourage us to offer this offer, destroying the more vulnerable horror genre. (* 1/2)
