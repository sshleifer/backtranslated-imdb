Somewhere I want to read that this image is supposed to be a comedy. After watching this, I'll say something without it. The point of this movie eludes me. The conversation is highly worshiping and irrational, most of the set seems to be the next incident, and despite all the nudity and sexual content, there is no erotic thing about this film ... Hack about all this is nothing to be surprised about this thing. ! The title premises can be a fun (if politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we are curious, cheap, amateur, sketchy and sketchy for impurity and its own food. If I like it, I'll go to buy a grace Jones CD.
