I never thought that a movie might be so violent, but I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects Crocodiles were awkward and stupid sexual / murder scenes were all for one, that was a bad move from the word. It was really disappointing and did not appreciate that! How can someone create this movie, then see it and then "yes, this is a good movie." People will see "If you do not see it, I do not request you :-(
