Wow, I had a huge Henry VIII / Tudor era fan and, well, this was .... interesting. Only I saw Catherine of Agron. And wow ... just wow. I saw bad acting before, but it reached new heights. Catherine while the actress would cry? He wails and screams and I have to admit I have many times ... many, many times .... funny, fun things. The only person who showed a little bit of talent was the actor Ann Bowlin (although I was maybe projected, I was a little emotional with Anne Boleyn, he was really a truly talented woman, he was on it!) Also, I've read a lot and I think the letters are not very accurately displayed, they are all b Stiriootaipikyala captured. If you are ready to watch a very important period, just watch this movie and the important life of the perpetrators becomes a ridiculous stock.
