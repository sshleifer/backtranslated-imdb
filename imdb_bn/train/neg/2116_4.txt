The Poverty Rages The horror pictures of the 1930s and 40s disappointed me from hell. God knows that I have nothing against low-budget movies, but the people produced by that time are so indifferent about them, a sticky look - and, in the final analysis, is not very good. "The Corps Varnishes", "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ap Man" are a little more entertaining than the barrel drakes, but it is not a classic. Bela Ludosi, her "Dracula" long before the sky, another crazy doctor played; Helpless Elizabeth Russell is playing his wife. They are sleeping on the coffin, because the logosi explains the suspected young female reporter (Luen Walters), a more comfortable than a coffin bed. Hmm Angelo Rosetto and Minerva Eureka are also in the lead, who can make brave supporters happy with the films of 30s and 40s.
