Quite obviously it seems like annoyance is seven hours. what is this? What will I say about Will Smith that I can not stand still? I think he feels very seriously and hellbent on receiving an Oscar. I understand how favorable it is, but unless he is sending some new acting, I can never win him. He is a huge name and so usually confused by being a talented and different actor. He just does not. I have credited him so hard, and being able to cry at a hat drop. That's about it. <br /> <br /> The seven pounds are an eyeroller type for me, from the beginning to the right. The suicide call 911 did not intrigue me anyway. He did not want to know why he was himself a suicide. There was absolutely no surprise. The best I can say is that something related to Will Smith and the Rosario Dawson screen chemistry was decent. Also, I do not know his name, but a terrible woman has done a great job with her role as a horrific and beaten wife. Woody Herrerson had a very limited screen, but I said that when he was there he stole it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why did I care about these people, I could not fully ask myself through them. Sometimes felt sorry for Team / Ben. Did he kill himself with jellyfish? 8 people are the only survivors of the accident? Geez ... that does not see anyone coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 Beautiful Lent.
