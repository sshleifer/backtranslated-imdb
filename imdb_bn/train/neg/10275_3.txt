The evidence is amazing and some of the performances, especially Sally Kellyman and Anthony Rap, are charming ... but this movie is unexpected. The music seems to be written with some rhythmic free online sites and songs written with a rhythmic dictionary open on the laptop. Most stop singing. I think they could have been protected by singing Acapella and keep music under ... conversations are really stupid and trite In fact, the film works best when talking about real estate, but unfortunately it often travels in silent missile sub-plots. I got my clock check for the first twenty minutes and 40 'when will it end?'
