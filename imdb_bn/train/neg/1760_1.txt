This movie makes many mistakes. Some Spanish actors in Spain and Spanish actor English says. Spaniards' English is okay, but the way it is executed makes it quite annoying. The dialog is very weak with full scripts; It could be a Spanish script, but it has been translated incorrectly, who knows and who carries. I can only assume that these famous Spanish actors are forced into English, they may be good but not in this flop. You will illustrate the film in the first 5 minutes, how graceful it is. Then the rest is just bad. Plenty of waste of time, lots of UN plots required. I said, there is one thing among the bulls.
