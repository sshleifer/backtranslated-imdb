"Sleeping with the Daisy" is a predictable, no inspiration that was 'before the thriller', and how cruel the Cast and the crew tried. I can not believe that a bunch of my friends went to see it in movies some 16 years ago. <br /> <br /> There is basically a complete lack of support from Ronald Bash's playplay (based on the Nancy Price novel), the average performance of Julie Roberts in either Joseph Ruben's bathroom or. Helpers with Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson help a bit to help. There is not much to say here. Just miss it <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - White Cinema Center Melbourne
