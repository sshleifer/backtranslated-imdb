This is a review of 'Freddie Mercury's Anthod Story', 'Theatrical Release, Chicago Inn. Film Festival, 2007 I saw the most painful, vague and most painful documentaries on biography. When the movie I saw in the movie theater was originally released on TV, I would request the producer and distributors to fool the money-making audience with false promises of a cinematic documentary feature. Even as a documentary made for television, flower arrangements and pompas in the hotel rooms, piano solos with passionate interviews with pseudo-literature descriptions were more authenticated than a sleeping bed in infrastructural. This "The Anthology Story of Freddie Mercury" - or the OHM, was the main story, video and TV footage of the only freedom fighter - Anabrida Freddy Mercury and Queen. Interview with irrelevant surveillance interviews with insights and testimonials, such as: "He was a free soul," (Really .. I thought Freddie Mercury was a company man ...) Brian May or Montserrat Cabbell broke these new friendly testimonials and Mercury's complex Tender light in life and character. And ... what are those in boarding school like Harry Potter? How did the interview with the first girl-crush ("... now work in a travel agency?") And Freddie's first school band members really want to know about Mercury? The important milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, the queen, the band remained undefined. These filmmakers do not ask for single, provocative questions and they do not join their subject of independent or visionary studies, but they are neatly commented neatly about a clever and brilliant rock legend and are not eligible for those who are not worthy of your memories by the biography of this history channel. Can stop Sunday night.
