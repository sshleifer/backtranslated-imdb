This show was absolutely terrible. One is not funny George, and his kids are a little brats of snobby. She treats with no respect to her mother. As a Hispanic, I am highly offended by this way by the way and the way the characters are illustrated. <br /> <br /> Plus, the family of unemployed family has died. Once, I'd like to see something original. What makes this show fun when other shows do millions of times? I was thinking that ABC would come into his senses and this waste would stop wind, but sadly, it would beat until they "shark the jump". <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they already did.
