I taught parochial primary school by not a Catholic, taught by Jesuit priests at high school and college. I am still practicing Catholic but the church's eyes will not be considered "good Catholic" because I do not believe in anything or the church gives me specific tasks. <br /> <br /> So back in the film ... This is bad because the two have killed the nuns, who talk of the ridicule in the form of women's religious character. There is no comedy in it and it's not good to taunt by acting on Diane Keaton. I have never seen this game, but it could be good if it was different from these movies. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun could be a fake and made the first female shooting plan first. As an attempt to show the emotional and intellectual superstition of four ex-students, believing Mary. But it has been proved that the bullets were real and the story was tragedy ... the tragedy of life loss (along with two former students ... children's life, student's mother's life), tragedy of faith, authority over human love, tragedy of organized religion is the substitution of true faith in God. What is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Jewish religion and Christianity?
