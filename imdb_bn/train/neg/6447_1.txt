I bought this movie for local $ 5 for the purchase of only for Chase Masters in local store, but I had to cut five pieces, put it in a toilet and flushed. This image is a group of about 20 groups that is finalized in high school and reconsider the anniversary of the death of their stupid friends, who become drunk and flutter in the jungle and die. The problem is that a reptile giant is hunting one of them down one. Unlike acting, this vain person was casted cast on the show like the apparently 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The instruction was twelve years old and probably the screen was thirteen years old. The whole set looks like the backyard of someone's home in Malibu. Those who have praised this film here are definitely the directors and / or actors' friends. Avoid this slope of garbage at all costs.
