This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say was that it was so bad that it seems ridiculous. First off, there is no plot. The actors appear to fall off the cou card and do the dumbest thing. Like to be chased by dead people but still go out and find their friends. Also zombies were terrible, as Romero's work is as funny as anybody else, who gets the plug-in of the movie. And the worst part of everyone, they showed the twinkling of video games in the sequence of sequences. We would like to get not about the video game Shooting Zombies. Also, there are 20 things to know about how to use automatic weapons and how to learn a target without gun targets. And the way people die so stupid. It's like they stand around waiting to be jumping so they run out of ammo. And when they enter the corner in front of the house, instead of keeping the door open, they come out of the porch, then silent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If this actor is present in any other film, but they are blessed with a second opportunity. The worst movie I've seen for several years. A B-Movie Good at the Cinema
