I tried twice to get this picture, was successful for the first time - and it was like dragging - and despite a great DVD transfer, failed a second time. The problem? It's just very annoying. <br /> <br /> If you can see dramatic court scene, which takes most of the time in the second half of the film, you have made it, but it is hard at the moment. During the trial, "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) had some interesting discussions. Eventually, Lincoln was stopped and its memorial statue on the screen increased. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent story, well played and so .... but there is lack of spark in the first half and the audience hanging there discouraged. I suspect Ibe Lincoln much more interesting than this picture.
