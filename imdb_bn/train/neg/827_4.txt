Burning saddles! This is a war between two unhappy brothers (Dennis Quaid and Erlis Howard), both of which could fire mentally; They closed the middle of the debraw wing with the interest of dippy love, off the class on childhood difference. Director Glenn Gordon Carnon (TV Weiz-Kidney Behind "Munlyiting") Vince Gilgene's screenplay features a striking, well-documented comedy, similar to the entry of a movie enthusiast on a fifteen million dollar donation. . This is the playful power of a big commercial feature, but a style that does not expose the characters without their barbarity. These are not even characters, they are the plot functions. The movie is rarely released in theaters, the film is a disaster, although it is strictly an example of style on the material as it looks good. Winger is the only stand out of a cast which looks really confusing. * **** to 1/2
