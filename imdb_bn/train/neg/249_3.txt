This movie was seen in my English class this afternoon and surprised how bad this version was. Do not make me wrong, George was awesome like Scott Scott, but the rest of the cast failed very badly. Sometimes I can stop stupid and do not stop to laugh at the repetition line: "Everybody Merry Christmas!" Other times I was almost asleep. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a rich man's story about Charles Dickens, who does not think Christmas is nothing else. After 30 minutes, the rich man visited by three ghosts, who prompted him to celebrate Christmas later. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie is so bad a script, how five minutes have been written, so it could be a good rate. Instead of this piece of trash, I recommend you, Bill Murray's comedy Scrugg. At least, it was funny ...
