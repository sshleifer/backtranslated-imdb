Now or what? Considering all the good things done by Danjeel, Clive and Jodi, the film does not have much more than any horrible dying-hard / hard movie copyist. Yes, two jokes, absolutely no unpredictable twists, the only unpredictable moment to be honest is not there because both director and editor have made some stupid mistakes, it is a shame for them and waste time for us. Someone could tell me why on earth they dug a hole inside that security, those in Rebecca and who knew in the world that the diamond was in a particular cell, it could only make my day, but it seems that Spike tells us to take too much stuff for this fun And do not raise our eyebrows when some strains ... relax and enjoy the movie of another studio contract ...
