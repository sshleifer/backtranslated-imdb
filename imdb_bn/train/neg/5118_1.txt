I am a Christian and I say this film is a terrible act, outstanding situation and a complete face to Christianity. You can not mix well with "remember Titans" and mix a mixture of Christ in at least one French film with formula steroids. Click me to give me some tips to annoy me in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not notice a single black student or player at the school. I deal with the White "Christian" academy on the south and they are built for any reason other than restoring segregation. When this movie is changing about Christ and Christian life, then there is a problem ... How can the difference of separation be changed? (Note: I like Token Black Coach; It is entirely made for white teams and all black 'giant' players.) <br /> <br /> 2. The unimaginable praise of the Christians about this film. Can I tell some people that it is less poor than bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and other movies? If we compare to another movie, will there be the same charisma and power? <br /> <br /> Half of the baked Christians, which became less meaning to me than unrealistic completion. If Christianity is just about reading a little scripture and praying to start a whole life, do not be surprised that nobody will listen to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ as a healing-all. She does not need to be sold and she is not required to be attached to such lively lifestyle. In this unreal representation, everyone does not consider Christians to be intellectual. <br /> <br /> I think this picture can be inspired by some people. Most, it will not be. It does not have to struggle and give a real picture of heartbreaking tension. Most important to me, it is not Christian by any means or by extension. It has value but it is summarized as 'pool-up-by-the-booststrap' messages as shallow as positive thoughts. If you live with people who are struggling and / or realistic in the third world, then this film will be Hole, because today most churches are in their religion.
