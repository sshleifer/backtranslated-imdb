I can not believe that this movie was ever made. I think the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse. They look zombies like applying too much eye makeup. Zombies are in the movie for only a few minutes. Finally, a total of five or six zombies total, certainly not a race. The best part of the film, if there is a credit, is because of the end, the painful experience ends. Again repeat the comments of another user, the voodoo priests are weird and do not have much knowledge of the whole movie. Also, there is only one idea that there is a snake and a Roman girl that is a view. It is not explained.
