Generally I support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I support everyone, because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> But this movie just turns away from all understanding and tolerance Going to be limited! <br /> <br /> <br /> Imagine the situation below: <br /> <br /> 1. Think about the real horror movie you have ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some cool, attractive ART for the movie DVD Box ... and a committed plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. Good news You've got a zombie race. <br /> <br /> If you do not have any other things to look for it only. Something good
