[I have seen this movie once in the public TV station, so I do not know if it is on the video.] <br /> <br /> It is one of the "Baby Bournex" (Sik) that was a Sheryli temple in the early 1930's. It is hard to believe that someone will keep this girl in this warm little film, which can be considered as "kidnap of teenage". <br /> <br /> The Sheryli temple is probably in an average, which is probably average 5. They are old diapers, and a salon which is served alcohol instead of alcohol. "Cash" as a lollipop. <br /> <br /> Playing a "Family Fattle" until the Charlie Barr and talking to the soldiers who comment on her (!). But Sheryli does not really need their lollipops / cash because her purse is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile a small black boy (!) makes a suggestive dance on a nearby table. <<br /> What a weird movie. . . Children use warm dialogue playing an adult role in salon. Who in any way think of this way?
