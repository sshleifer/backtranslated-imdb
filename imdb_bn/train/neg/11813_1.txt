Before Stan Leyrele became the smallest half-time of the greatest comedy team of all times, she underwent a contract with Bronco Billy Anderson in the comfort series, most of which are parody of the main features of Hollywood. After a debate with Anderson, the continuation of formal series continuation in the small (and more inefficient) production company of Lorel Joe Rock. <br /> <br /> Most of the parody movies of Lorel were very gently entertaining and even for less fun modern audiences who did not see the original film of Lorl Parading. 'West of Hot Dog' is a cowboy shoot- a rough generic parody of 'Am-ups'. It is a small parody of 'West of Pikos', which was released two years ago without any major actor. Since 'Picos' West' has never been a huge success, it is difficult to see why the Stan Film film unit has chosen this special film as a target for their lamp, it has waited so long after the release of its parody. And where did they get the title 'West dog title'? Perhaps it's hot dogs! In the 1920s, there was a sexual objection from American writers. (Like the opening scene of the stage 'Machinal'. <br /> <br /> 'West of Hot Dog' was created and directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other achievements, Rock presented Luarel to Lewis Nilsson and later he was the best of the wedding The person was a full-fledged publisher: In the last years of his life, I had the privilege of friendship and interviewing Joe Rock. At that time, the 90-year-old Rock The memory was clear ... but she did not feel anything about 'hot dog west', and I can not blame her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here are some 'impossible' awakens, with Laurel's method of mounting a horse. For just one moment in this movie, Stan Lorel reminded me of the wonderful Booster Keton when he suddenly ran The theme of 'West of Hot Dog' is Kitty's short comedy, 'The Frozen North', and is similar to vowels, but Keaton's version is a lot of fun. The plot of this film predicts a situation of 'our hospitality' but it suffers again (again): Here two solid warmmen brothers hope to be the successor of the last chancellor Salun, but the previous owner has grabbed it to weaken tenderfut stains. However, Stan died, the brothers became legal heirs. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, what is a legal validity? As soon as the stan occupies the property, then the ownership or any question of the property becomes his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not funny <br /> <br /> This 'hot dog' is not tiring and no winner: it's just a winner My rating: One point out of 10. Hang On, Stan: In a few years you'll be half of the comedy legend.
