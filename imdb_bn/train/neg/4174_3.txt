Whoo-boy, I'm definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. Guessed, it was Sci Fi, and I do not see much of fi fi, but people, talk about a razor's thin plot and maximum two dimensional letters <br /> <br /> The letters were stereotyped and overdone, the plot and setting were incredible, The vampires were less awesome, more fun, the cow was unnecessary, the special effect was down-right horrible, and last? Well, the only thing unknown at the end was that when suddenly the dome became gay and began to do it with the female vampire, which, considering it for about three seconds, which does not seem hot, which is "near hell?" Then "man, that's hot." If this ever reruns are displayed, God is forbidden, do not see it.
