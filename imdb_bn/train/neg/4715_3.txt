I recently tried to find a smile by Johnny Test. I'm terrible, failed. Cartoon networks are usually the tendency of viewers to make their shows enjoyable, but the Johnny Test is "Entertainment" at the lowest size. Writing is incredibly expected, and the ongoing gags are not all gags. The kids will like it, and it's about him. <br /> <br /> Now, it does not say bad at all. The original opening theme was actually quite interesting, but for some reason they took its skeleton and metaphorically it was broken with a metaphoric aluminum bat. This is a shame, because it was really one of the best things for it. <br /> <br /> Some characters can be very interesting, theories Working a little, the characters can work well together, but they are very dimensional. Then again, it makes the kids easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The speed is very fast very fast. The episodes are very busy, leaving a little time for clever writing. This is a real shame, because there are many interesting ideas that the program brings. Apparently, fast speeds will prevent kids from losing interest, and it is indeed the totality of the target audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks very good on paper, but it's not funny or interesting to be successful. This is a show I like to choose, but I can not afford it. There are just so many possibilities that are realized. Kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
