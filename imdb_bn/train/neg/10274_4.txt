In Texas, seven friends meet the bar to celebrate Halloween at night before going to a bar. Meanwhile, they make American Nitmaiire pirate radio fun and their intimate fear. A serial killer, who has heard their confessions, makes their nightmare true, killing them sadly. "American Nightmare" is a strange low-budget movie that started a horrific start: Without a previous explanation, a woman killed two couples in a separate camping area on Friday, 13th Friday. Then, the story is moved to the bar, where seven friends celebrate Halloween. At this point, the story has a potential and unknown cast is a very rational performance that shows some nice breasts and naked body as normal to produce such a type. However, the end of pornography does not provide any explanation for the behavior and motives of the killings for the behavior of Jane Tappan, the budget ends before the budget ends. With a good start and conclusion, these weird stories will be a good low budget slasher movie. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agony"
