When I started watching this movie I saw Bappy, Junker's dude, and well that he is still acting live in movies, how beautiful he is. Now I can stand a weird movie, it's a weird dose, for example, the David Lynch film, Twin Pick, Highway Highway etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. But this one thinks of conspiracy theories about conspiracy websites conspiring me that do not give any idea at all. I mean, the citizens of Nazi who want to maintain an evil trinity of America against evil? I was surprised that they did not mention the Hololar Flying Sucessers of this movie and the Earth's Earth Holocaust. Maybe, if you liked the heroine of the 60 grams of this movie, it would be made in a bit sense, but I seriously do not understand the film unacceptable. It should be burned, torn and forgotten so well Ol 'Xander could get another acting job. It was not his performance, that was okay, but the script just did not have any ideas. Sorry
