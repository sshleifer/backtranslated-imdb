This was frustrating. It started well enough but as it went in and lost every opportunity to fly, it became flat. Maria Shader's acting is terrible, she does not seem to understand what she's saying, or even she did not even know what to say. He did not see any favorite passion, not for the story of his beloved boyfriend or his mother. When Lennara is more than academic interest in Lanna's story It seems unlikely that Lenya and her mother had a real relation, that their mother's marriage does not seem to have a good time, which is not much. Hanna's "mixed" romance and her parallel parallel between her father's relationship with her father came to her, and unfortunately failed anyway. Marriage was completely disrespectful and had a mobile phone finish. The final outcome of the protest was uncertain, and even if Lenena did not do any work or did not do any work, she must have some difficulty, a scary look, an inappropriate conflict. Actually, there was no depth or spark in the film's character. Some of them were very difficult to take care of, even small Ruths. Everything with Luis was a confusion. (Why did she give him such a thing while calling in the hotel? There was no context or explanation for him.) If the references to him were removed then it can not be noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story became confusing by the development of the weak character (who's mother, again ??) acting poorly, and directing that everyone acted like them. You almost "quietly kept silent! ...." I started thinking that it was worth a 7, but it went faster than the 4th in the movie, then after earning the impression of the wedding scene 3 earned it. I saw that it was about as cold and stupid as a movie. A good story is a terrible waste.
