And not a fun-to-watch way. It's just bad. It has been astonishing here that people posted positive things here. The story sucks, acting is bad, it's not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! Blackboard is out of hand! Hello gi - mirror turned into water! Hair, clothes and makeup are not correct in '50's scenes, and they have got a middle-aged man with a middle-aged man to play the high school version. This Elm Street stuff is like nightmare after. I enjoyed enjoying sitting for a cheesy scary movie watching as someone else, but there are better bad ones to choose from.
