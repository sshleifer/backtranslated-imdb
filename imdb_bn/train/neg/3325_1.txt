Dislike If you believe that everyone in the South is a fool, morally foolish, stupid, violent, religious nuts, or child mullah, then this film may be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two elderly people are talking in general stores and one mentions that he scoffed at one of the sisters before getting the shoes. The man was proud of his actions, and the other person clearly took it as the normal part of life. very nice. A teenage girl walks on the street behind looking for her sister and does not offer any help to her - despite being a clear lump and lack of food or water (no backpacks, etc.). The character of Strathreen is not only totally despicable and thin, but as a religious believer who (the ideal for Hollywood) reflects the cruel nature of Christians. A scene in the movie makes it very memorable of the end of Cape Fier (one with Denier) - Bible verses are being highlighted by bad people. I am from the Great Northwest, but it is objectionable to know those wonderful people from NC, WV, Awami League, MS, KY, TN, etc.
