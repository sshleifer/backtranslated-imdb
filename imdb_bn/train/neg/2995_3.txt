On an extremely rare occasion, an episode of X-Files fails to make any excitement or the episode has something that is completely annoying to watch. Both a detective and his ex-partner die in vague situations. In the presence of the little girl who was there during the death related to death. Molldar has discovered a theory that a policeman killed by his colleagues has been resurrected as a little girl and revenge is being done. Now for the wicked bit. There is no connection and it seems as if only a random person has been resurrected. I think it was a little lazy writing by the authors and this episode is one of the worst forms of x-file history!
