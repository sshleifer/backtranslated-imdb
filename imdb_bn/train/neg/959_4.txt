If I could give this music 1 out of 10 but this is not for MS. Claudine Barretto's performance. And I will take this time to ignore Kris Aquino's here. And ... the end. <br /> <br /> I have not really seen Pino Horror movies because stories are lacking in originality and I really believe that (some) writers do not pay enough attention to letters (and their progress). Story (void ??) When they stank the wrist of their stories, they pushed the movie after 'like that. And my goodness, creative fatigue led to the snatching of their other movies. Why ?? Why get a better review of this movie ?? I do not have to give that much meritorious. The movie was scary, but it seems more weird as the film related to the Filipino locals ... it's going to be in my 'Maybe It Could' section. I just spent more time improving the story line and fixing the flash back signatures, do not forget to light up, it does not matter if the content is blowing you off. Syang
