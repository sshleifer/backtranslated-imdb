I saw it on a whim because it was available and I heard thumb movie was fun. This one was not there. Most of the jokes were "Zeranian" and then Kate Winslet was inside. I think it is very respectable for "Thomtanik" makers that he rarely jabs in the respected actress because he (banned heaven) does not waste himself in the model of modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is a line that becomes something, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let us swim on this bustling roof that no one else can see!" The 30-second entertainment outside the 26-minute movie does not free its value.
