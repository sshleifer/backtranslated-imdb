The stupid film about a well-looking but mindless couple who decide to live in their dreams and take diving excursions. The pair often misinterprets customers and when combined with the surplus credit sequence, some people will be able to recover items falling under the sea. The video movie was not so eager to look good if it looked primarily good. In order to ensure that the performance and the plot are not really bad, or whether directors and producers do not redirect the plot, we do not cause any tension in the bathing suits (or because of the "arrayed" "monkeys fleeting bare breasts") and a forgotten TV Do not rise above the movie level. If you go to see it, then the eyes are beautiful If you will open your eyes to us if the child does not have to stop making films produced under the pretext of a holiday.
