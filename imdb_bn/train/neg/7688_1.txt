A terrible movie made about $ 9.99 billion. Used very clear small sets, poor performance and terrible stories about aliens that use the meat disinfected from a slaughterhouse as fuel for their spaceships. The film has some blood (not enough to disturb) and a egg oval shape replacing its hand. (Yes you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> Save a talent / new wave band by the band "talent show" (how to taunt?) A song that I think was "I said." I'm looking for a heat missile. "Also, it is not suitable for your time, even its" very bad "level. If you look into the Chess alien movie, but someone should clean it. <br /> <br /> Ratings : 1 out of 10
