All right, I watched this movie a few weeks ago at Cinemax 9 00 and thought it won the prize, the boy was 180 degrees. This movie is a big bit of bits. I mean, the monster's mother only shows her true nature at the end of the film. I'm going "What's this? Why did not he see it a little earlier in the movie." Dowry demand dowry mother and son said. If they leave, they would not have been better, you know, every young woman will be killed in the killing, then the sheriff or the police will find one and find the old ones and find ways to kill the monster. Save the young woman, and 1 or 2 people killed in this process? I think it will be a hell of a lot better in that way. The boy also sucks on the main character and he dies first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Plus, how does he get the strength after the movie ends when he starts killing people? She told herself she was very weak. Was this time wrong with Stephen? I can never play, any actor acting in any movie, after all, they try their best. If it does not play well, I wanted to give this movie 1/10. 3/10.
