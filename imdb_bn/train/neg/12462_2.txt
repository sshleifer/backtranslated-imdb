I saw this picture last night by following many good reviews from many sources. I would like to say that if you are not prepared to continue and are not ready to work then who and what it means will mean that you hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the role of actors in this film, the film jumps through different stories and does not allow you to express feelings about any role. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably quite good for political films and people interested in corruption in other world governments, but this movie is strange to the average movie viewer, it is very annoying at places and you have confused and disturbed the movie that you pay the entry fee Have done <br /> <br /> If you're ready to focus, check it out. Your interest in detail every minute or politics 100% Do not see it, if you really like to watch movies.
