As a Turkish man living in Sweden, I recognize that I often see Scandinavian films. I never realized if they had them. I think Scandinavian actors do their best in Hollywood. Last week I saw a movie "The Polish Wading", which was a friendly friend of mine and both of us have said that we have ever seen the worst movies. Unfortunately I was wrong even this movie "The House of Angels" was wrong. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the woman's so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that nobody can believe it. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. A lot of bad acting without Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Selim
