As a long time fan of all Star Trek series, I found it a frustrating episode and I am surprised that the "flashbacks" generous use is associated with the exploitation of Will Ricker, both positive (and primarily romantic) and negative (many pain, and the death of a kramabat) There was a money-saving device, such as their "Bottle Shows" (episodes that perform all views on enterprises). . Diana Muldaur (who was present at least twice in the original series), character of this, deserves a better final form than Kat Pulaski. Trusted spectators (Star Trek World, have any other kind?) Have also been shortlisted. This was the last episode of the second season; So, the season is not "a bang" but "end up with a flashing".
