Wow, this film is not just a "new text in a real bad taste", but a lesson to "create real bad movies". Do not make me wrong, I've realized the concept of 'Zombie: 90: Extreme Fatality', but simultaneously a movie must be realized during the horror of fear. If you are omitted from the story, 'Jumbo' 90 plot is a government flat area carrying poisonous chemicals which causes disruption in the street, surrounds chemical substances, and make them locally looking bodies. The next thing you know is feeding people alive around the city, even though an idiot doctor and government agent are trying to eat each other for this disease - hence the "extreme epidemic". Nevertheless, we can see that the field day for every local man was nothing but the zombie-extreme and cyclical isolation and isolation, which is the continuous buckets of Hat and Gore. Since this is a German film, so this movie was dubbed in English and when you do not smile at the Fenzi feeding hairstyle, the voice-over is quite fun and entertaining. The user referred to as Euratedx * Speaker * * Spliler * * Spliler *, is a view of the film that is acceptable and not acceptable, crossing the line in it, the scene where a woman, who is carrying her child, is being choked by almost a few dancers A head of wheelchairs and zombies come out somewhere and attack them. The baby holds a zombie baby crying and eats its organs. Wow, this is a new lesson in the real taste of the realism. The oppressor, I tell you, the rogue.
