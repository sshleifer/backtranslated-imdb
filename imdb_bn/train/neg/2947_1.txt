There are very few movies that I could not sit. I made it through any problems in the field of battle field. But this, it's one of the single worst movies to be made. I realized that I tried to play in Hypie Goldberg. I do not blame him. I would feel ashamed to have this in a resume. I believe this is a rare event, when almost every gog on a movie flattens on his face. Well it happens here. Not to mention SFX, look for Dino with wire hanging wire behind the control !!!!!! I'm still looking for a plot through the halfway film. I do not find one. Trouble paying yourself and 90 minutes of your life.
