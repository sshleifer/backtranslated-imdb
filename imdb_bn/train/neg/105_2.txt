There are tons of handsome women in this flashing. But alas, this movie is free from nudity. Grrrester's strike is one. <br /> <br /> Aham. A story in this movie was held in 1971. What is the main character of Kya Sports? Hello Endless, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, this movie was released on stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most disgusting effect I ever seen. I'm not sure if someone stopped this work, but there was no 3D there, only two-vision blues I did not have the same problem with the company's other 3D movie, Season and Camp Blawood Hunting. Sure, those 3d sucked too much, but with them I could see a similar to the 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is nothing but a big force <br /> <br /> And whoever eats food to eat girls eat, daughter! I want to see more of her Movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at an early age. Rrrrr r. Rrrrr <br /> <br />
