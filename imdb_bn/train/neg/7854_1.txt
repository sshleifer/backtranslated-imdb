Wow this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I signed up for IMDB was that I could complain about this movie. I did not go out of the theater or stopped the DVD but I almost stopped it (and I should have). But I saw it all the way to the end to get down again with absolutely terrible end. Wow if all this is long that hungry can produce its time. I have not seen the first one and do not look after this. Her terrible act with a terrible plot. Hey lets anyone check out what it looks like we are shinning a mirror. And sadly, when this movie comes to the DVD, it is always always checked out in Blockbuster. So I feel bad for all people who saw this junk.
