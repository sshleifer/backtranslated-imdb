Parasomnia has an interesting premises, but the story is weakly done without any tension or even a logical approach. Unspeakable, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a great role in film like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Seas 2 and Eraser, is uncomfortable. The rest of the cast except Jafri combs is unknown (and not very good). (Herbert West from the Great Re-Animation Trilogy). But he can play such a role in his sleep (which he does a bit here). The main problem is that the verb does not understand the meaning of the letter. The story mixes with poor and predictable computer effects with some poor scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good, I did not get a better review about this. It's really average down.
