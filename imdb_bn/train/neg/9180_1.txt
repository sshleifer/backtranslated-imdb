All right, I'm not saying that anything in it would be astonished to read the opinions of others. That says, my GD, read this movie! I mean, Wow, I do not know that the money they could pay was as much money as possible and still worse than a Roger Croamen movie! Karaman probably came into the film at this moment but denied the script due to the bad quality! The only reason this movie was created in the first place was that someone said, 'Hey, hair is popular. Video games are popular. What can we get in a game that Zombies have it zombies? Resident Evil? No, there's someone else there first. Silent hills? No, very silent. People will not sit in the dark room, just because of fear of folly. Hey, is there a game of sega where people do not run around shooting zombies? They went out of the platform, we could get it for the sake of the penguins! <br /> <br /> They tried to create a movie that can be felt like a video game, even like shooting a war. The character is actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem is that the main game is horrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> Bad-cinema-in-a-game-in-a-game-game-with-two-week-of-two-out-of-ship-with- And-for their parents-Christmas horrible. The graphics were annoying. The monsters were annoying. The levels were annoying. The interface was annoying. The case was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And that was ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you did not even get the shotgun placed in your hands when you were bored of stupid by this pointless game! But I digress <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they actually intercut the scene from the actual game play during the war scene as they went. Oh oh Did the editor not have real confidence that the actual war is going on? Note that each war video was shot from the point of view of the game, which can explain the tedious use of matrix-style effects. The problem is that the game is the first person shooter (player character derives from Pov). Maybe they have entered the game graphics so that they can tell you that they are pointing to this game ... all right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that makes this whole experience a remote enjoyable in the theater Everyone was enjoying a lot of fun, so my sudden humorous smile and unusual fitness of unbelief was adopted as a normal place and kicked me out. It was not good. <br /> <br />, do not watch this movie! Within weeks it comes to the video when it does not even disable for rental. Run. Just run.
