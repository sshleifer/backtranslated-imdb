The only good thing about "John I know" is that it works as a perfect example of films that should not be avoided to avoid Al Pasino. The first big turn-off was that I tried to portray the words of Passino Georgia; In other parts when it is very much understood, it was weak and irrelevant at times. Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with weak plot. The supporting cast has done extremely impressive to keep the movie attractive, and in one hour there is still no sign of a strong plot. Overall the story was a real burqa, and I had to face myself a few times to keep myself awake. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bear you too ... to avoid all costs.
