I'm not saying that at the beginning of this movie there is 1 interesting point that brings the exchange between the narrator and George: Kathakah huh? Wait a minute! Who are you George: My new George. The studio is very cheap to give Brendan Fraser. Explainer: How did you get the part? George: New George is just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> The sad part is, the only fun part of the whole movie <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... but then again, I'm easily entertained ... <br/> <br / > I do not say that I have ever seen the worst movie (The title goes to the terrible non-disaster movie ...), this movie has been # 7 on my bottom 15 list ... <br /> <br /> <br / > If your little child is easily entertained, then you will enjoy this movie. If you're a movie-observer who wants a good, funny movie, you'll finish shooting yourself through.
