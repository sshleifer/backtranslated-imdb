Haha son <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well they exist in many forms, too. But did you ever want to see a documentary who ultimately did not succeed to do anything to an artist despite praising everyone about "talent"? Well you might just be able to grab a camera and find someone in any local scene (I know they are everywhere and I do not follow the local scene), or you can save yourself by spending money to see this trip. <br /> <br /> The prize is good and, indeed, it is not that filmmakers knew exactly how it was going to be considered as a documentary. Our two bands are followed, The Brian Jamestown genocide, led by the Anton, and The Daddy Warhols, which is headed by Courtney. I've heard of Dandy Warhols before watching this movie ... So Brian Jamestown is not about genocide. Why? Well from the point of view of this documentary, because of the difficulty of Brian Jamestown Massacre's intergovernment, they really refuse to do it in the music industry. However, it became an analysis of two separate bands and instead increased focus on Ant√≥n and his frenzy, instead of how successful it might be. Because, see, Anton is a "talent." Because he plays rock music. He really "understands the evolution of music" ... because he plays rock music with different instruments. Her music is considered "post-modern retro but in the future" ... because it is rock music. She wants to bring a "revolution" ... through rock music. All right, let's face it ... Within twenty minutes and I want to see a documentary among these cute kids. <br /> <br /> The documentary itself does not lend itself to showing any of Anton's talents, because in a short period of two-hour in two hours, in the short-term 2000 hours, the nature of material editing is not really the time to focus on that. So we see Anton instead, "talent", socially-emotional, blurred for two hours and realized that he really made great music. He does not know or do not, because there was not enough time to prove it like the documentary. What I know is that, there is a story about some of the most self-centered objectionable Tivarpans of our country, which are calling themselves as music worshipers and they are doing nothing to bring it back. Why is that obsessing observer? People like Antonan deserve attention, they do not deserve the different people who expect, and especially praise, and especially fail to paean failure after a failed failure. This film plays like a two-hour rough-cut VH1 special for a reason: she's running and about music, but it's all about images and attention. Look at the man, see how he works, how he works, how he tries to create a debate, because he can not spend marketing. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character of this photo is Joel, and because of that someone in this documentary, Joel seems to be just funny. Maybe it's because he's the Tumblr man. All the rest of them "rock star"! They deserve our attention, and respect, and interest, and engagements! They are there to "save the rock and roll." Does White Stripes seem to "save rock and roll"? Yes, it was due to Anton, and it did not mention them as "selfish" (Antonon) as inspiration to me. " What a load People like Anton are well left left. This documentary explains why mainstream music is so neutral - because the music editor has to deal with people like Antony, like a lively and ultimately, only the safe and passionate person can cast their support. Many thanks, Anton. Whatever your antics spoiled music for everyone touching you, whatever the opposite opinion is. "To inform" people about Anton and if he is really a genius, it still shows how bad the documentary is that it cuts it out. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
