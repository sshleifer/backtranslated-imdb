I understand that this film was made in a very low budget, but it is not an excuse for Grenelle's unconsciousness. Deathstalker, Fire of Throne, Barbarian Quinn, Conquest, Engineer Barbarian were all done in the shoes budget and poor special effects, yet they were able to create a classical classic by adding good ideas to some harmful female warriors and humorists. Primitive costumes, dark palaces, and beautiful Bulgarian landscape consider the grandson a very low budget sword and astronomy film, but manufacturers completely eliminate this opportunity by using very poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Beowulf (1999) Compare this film. It can not be in a citizen's cabin, but it is a good example of how to make an entertaining low budget science-adventure film using credible special effects and interesting characters.
