The first home alliance was a suitable movie ... In a new setting, the seagulls were the same. It tries to be realistic and achieves some degree ... Of course, the formula is basically the same, so it is the third movie to see the third time with a slightly changed plot. New scores are bad (although there was a new "setting trap" piece, if not anything else is interesting and different), especially compared to the first grand score and almost-but-enough-good scores. Second. It (almost) creates it using some pretty good non-original music, but it is not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat basically to the franchisee, but it is basically like the same movie, with it being worse performance and a less effective example of 'the terrible character turned out to be better'. Acting is mostly unimpressive. Characters are mostly caricatures. New thieves are less entertaining than older people (and they make fun of spies, which are almost criminal, there is limited number of good spying in them, and some of the valuable cools among them). There are many more (and then more trap) among them, it is a weak attempt to try more than the first two movies ... and it does not work. The idea behind thieves and their mission is very bad ... children are adult and serious for movies (and there was a sexual ruckus or two, although it was not the first time in the series). It's usually as intriguing, unnecessarily complex. I could follow it, but I could doubt a child. Some exhibitions are so clearly distributed that even children may find it stupid. Animal components are not usually fun. There are fewer siblings, which means that they have been improved there, but their first two films have less personality than at least featured features. Above all, especially not particularly good, or not worthy of viewing, unless you * really * cartoon - love to see criminals hurt in violence. I only recommend this to the huge fans of the series. 3/10
