I do not know what to say about this horrible movie that has not been told already. Actually I just have to be angry at myself. When I saw the title of this movie, I would love to feel that it would be a terrible piece of frustration, but I used to love war games, so I cherished my curiosity. I will decide that the rest of my life will have to regret. Very soon the government explained that their supercomputer could determine how well a terrorist video video was viewed properly. I knew that I was on a journey, though well-written-forgot. Very, very poor plot line, dialogue, and the list of acting is so long that I will try to post it if I am an IMDB crush. Please tell me they watched the worst movies than those who said this. I'm eager to see some of the horse dung can top this steaming pile.
