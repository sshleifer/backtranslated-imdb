Ah, dust TV. Shows and pilots tull evenly. Movie! Some examples are riding with death (most of the chronically incomparable cheeses), confused in space (confusing and unintended), San Francisco International (horribly lazy and incredible confusing), and this Turkish bit of Queen Martin glamor. <br /> <br /> (although you did not know it from outside shots) in Hawaii, it is apparently a failed pilot for a hair spell look. The real problem is that you do not like most characters, including the main character Diamond Head, who was half asleep for the whole movie; Her boss 'Ante Mary', who received a really weird delivery of her line and shelved white hair, and it seemed like it was going to be such an arrow; Diamand Head's girlfriend / colleague agent (Hell, I can not even remember his name) is a sexy, sexy woman with a flat way of talking to a skinny, woody woman; And singing Sidekick Zulus (again, I can not remember the name of his character) Those small doses were not bad. The most attractive person to the whole production was Ian McShane, who sued as a bad guy but still turned his acting chip. Al-othugh make-up was just ridiculous to use this so-called 'disguise' used to disguise itself. I have no idea whether he tried to steal from South American Dictator Kim American General who stole from that lab. I do not care. The plot was not enough to catch your attention for more than ten minutes, let alone an hour and a half hours or more. Just call this one - Hawaii Five Number!
