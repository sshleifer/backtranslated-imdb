I think I saw this cartoon at the age of 6 or 7. Tried free video for my grandfather mal. Remember that I really sucked. There was no sense in the plot. I hate Fox that becomes the friend of Coxper He was so stupid! Having found a friend, Kasperse closed his head. So what? Drink it! The only good part and I do not want to make middle spirits sound when Fox shot and eventually died. I smacked my head off the payback because this cartoon sucked so much. Bad news fox revives and becomes a ghost. I want to stay dead. I think I even gave some videos because I hate it. No wonder they were not offering it for free in the mall. If you have a child do not see them in this. They probably agree with me that sucks.
