I like Fulci's film, I'm not really somewhat annoying with ironic means but I know that they appear helplessly helpless and are proud to many people. <br /> <br /> In the conquest of the ocean where Flavchi tries her hand at the imagination. The genre and did not really succeed. Structured, it's like most flute movies you've seen. Some things happen, some things happen, and sometimes a scene may be related to others. It's really no set, no script, no real actor (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is rarely actor), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and like a Canaanite with a bunch of grooms. <br /> <br /> This was a hard one to get through and I could live without camera smasared inches on the camera to give the camera music video look.
