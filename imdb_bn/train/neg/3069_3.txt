Isha! And again I say ... yes! The original version of this movie was a well-directed story of a person who was already driving through the dead and devoted. The original film had a lot to say and it did not find the way to say it. And, it was a naked chick on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version hit something as a producer that bought my right and then abandoned it from isolation. It seems that a group of people consciously decided to fit it in the 90's and changed the ethnic and gender just as clever. This movie is not about a hoax about suicide in the last act of self-defense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
