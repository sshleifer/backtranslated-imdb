Evil Broad is unfortunately not good at all. It's unfortunately not good. The beginning of the film seems optimistic, but overall it is a disaster. The conversation is bad but not as bad as acting. The act is cruel and intolerable. Most characters can jump horribly and even if the motive does not work, the system does not work because the letters are annoying. Some killings are innovative but it takes a lot of time to get it. About half an hour after the film, we got the first death (without the beginning) and after almost five minutes, almost every character was smoking. The film is then a ridiculous looking character, an unreasonable cartoon fights and a man drags his man from his SSCrack. Which is not funny, it's just ridiculous. This image is very poor and very uninterrupted. Most of the letters are also cleared for slash values ​​and the counterclock has changed for as long as 5 days. Evil Bread is not too laughable, so it fails its main work. Just before Danson, see the Texas Shanso massacre, or see no Noble for a real slash.
