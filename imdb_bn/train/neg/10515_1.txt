Well it's a common "toilet straight" slasher film. <br /> <br /> In the long story short, a bunch of teens / young adults get trapped in the middle of horrible wood and get hacked down by nude nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has its main foundation for this problem: <br /> - Wolf women, children, young people, confused in some places, poor scene of death, last surviving young woman, who Always show her moderate, but never a little bra, - a wonderful, crazy man who knows about evil, -Llishian kiss scene, a man killer, a plot <br /> <br /> <br /> Chess For lasher film, it was really terrible. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, even sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to make men and lesbian women interested in the audience. It looks like it looks like a nasty head friction or the nasty head is cold. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
