The idea was extraordinary, the actor was incredible, the story could be very scary, but the study was poor and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel for characters, there were many Khilangas, and the movie was very weird. Is it happy to end? I do not know. Is it tragic end? Again, I do not know. You leave the theater feeling missing. The movie had so much to offer, but could not. Just because you can edit, should not you, right? I really will not recommend this movie because you can not say that the movie has left the feeling until it is complete. You just will be confused. Believe me, if you do not see this movie, you probably thank me. <br /> <br /> 3/10
