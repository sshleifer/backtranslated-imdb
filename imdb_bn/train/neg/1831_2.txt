I usually like comedy movies I really enjoy them. But I do not really get the "jealousy" point. I mean, it's a damp content / subject, and it's not really fun. <br /> <br /> While acting is generally good, the film is not enough to get at least a little interesting. Stella and Black do not show all their talents in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you're going to rent a comedy then I will not tell you to go for it. Unless you want to be bored, and I can see that I am not alone with this opinion, because Jack Black even apologizes for her (see Trivia).
