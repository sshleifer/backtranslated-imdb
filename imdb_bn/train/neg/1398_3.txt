I bought it under the title "Gray Matter" (it was just $ 3, all right?). In the role of non-Duchesafazard, the novelty of showing Sheriff Roscoo intrigues me. Other critics have been warned, it's a pretty annoying story of a confidential government exam. Got scared <br /> <br /> And yes, many shots are established, especially a room with a pool in front of it. There are some nonscript between characters and internals that I think the filmmakers are worried about who we can forget, so they show us outside of our home. It's actually a little fun. After a while, the pool shot feels like a TV identification logo on the TV channel, we remind that we are seeing "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the name-calling two buttons. At one stage, he got a "scientific b * tch!" Call and charge. It's just a very insufficient insult. After a few scenes, there is a different topic that "scientific B ** tard!" Sweep off vapors about me It's just too painful to me. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will disappear forever. It's impossible to find a copy of it for another decade now. It almost never happened. <br /> <br />
