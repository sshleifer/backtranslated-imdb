I spent eight years in the movie theater running between 80 years and 90s. So far, the greatest film ever I've seen in public. It's such a thing that makes it so bad that it tries to be a great, inspirational movie. Even the great Gregory Peaks can not save this awesome piece of drivel from much less than the middle. Jamie Lee Curtis, in the introduction of the first non-horror movie, clearly showed that she still did not learn to work (she is still trying, but it is not going to be better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and here spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is not going to happen because it is afraid children play a little league baseball! Even Nick and Disney Channel's shows do not seem foolish to us that it tries to betray us. <br /> <br /> It is not worth the time watching cable TV. This is a movie rental price worth; Your dollar will be spent on additional packages of microwave popcorn to go with another movie you choose (because it can be even better).
