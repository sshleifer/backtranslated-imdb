I felt the brain dead, I would tell you This is the worst movie I ever bought. (By my undoubtedly I had the same name Peter Jackson's film). The performance is so horrible that they are ridiculous. Special effects do not stand during the test and look terrible. This script promotes the same type of movie on TV, acting like a medium distance. They seem to be sending Joey from Tribbian, they all look at each other and stay with them. Plus I was confused by a movie until I sit for viewing it. It's a dream or a plot so terrible that frustration is set within a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.
