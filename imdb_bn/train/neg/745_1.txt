I really do forget to start to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad films, because they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inactive aspects. Music exceptions (which was better than I expected), were all the attributes of this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were surprisingly bad. My Nintendo 64 has seen the worst. Some scenes visible for Thunderchild, the mechanical legs, the Big Ben scene of the woman, the train is being broken ... Wow, so there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, some scenes of foreign walkers were well done. <br /> <br /> The acting is probably HG It was bad to be based on the Welsh book. For having such good source material, it's almost tricky though it is trying to be topped as. And then there's stupid ... I've seen the single most confusing part of the face hair unit for a long time. Of course, only half of the movies are played. The remaining letters are aimless and poorly-walking characters near prominent shots. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that Timothy Haines will be an innocent director who is innocent for neutral managers. For any particular reason, using different color filters in shots, even the use of bad backgrounds in the scene, the use of bad green screenings, it is amazing to me how this person has been approved for managing a movie. I would not imagine this would be possible to turn a shining book into a bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines Salad <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to watch this movie will have to do what I have to do: Some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker, drink and drink it all the way through . It creates a great bad movie, so make fun and smile yourself with this disaster.
