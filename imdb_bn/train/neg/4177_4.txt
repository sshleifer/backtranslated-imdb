Boxcat second movie. Originally titled bloodless, this movie was roughly average. It is annoying in some parts but has some good gore effects, but they're not great though. <br /> <br /> This movie was held in 2210. The vampire has taken quite a bit across the world. V-san (Vampire Sanitation) squad, which has its own spaceship and is headed by Churchill, captured by vampires, receives a message from the world and the group, which is made up of Quintana (powered by very hot Natasma Multi-run)), Ruku Officer Damian And rebellious fasting and Roman (Roman is mistakenly convicted by Aaron Pearl.) After the festival of V-san Directed by Michael Smith iransaidera tite Smith met with bhyampayarsa mukora. He is dependent on man's domination, as there is no plan to live peacefully with humans. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a waste of time, but I suspect that I will be back in the DVD player soon.
