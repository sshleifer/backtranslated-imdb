With a cast list like this, I expect so much better. Venice Redgrave spent most of the films lying in bed. When the best actresses in the world are limited to their acting and sleep throughout the film, they can not do very interesting things. Plot summary says that their mother is revealed to a secret girl as approaching death. The thing is, he never says anything to his daughter except a happy hypocrite. All the relationships in the movie are resorted. I think the back and back of the past was unnecessary. It is believed that this idea was stolen in the Da Da Vinci Code book, in which the device was used for suspense, or notebooks, which they used to make the endless romance of the device's main characters. This was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. This was the way to try to suspect a film that has no one. I was wondering why a good movie for girls could not be written. It really was a disappointment.
