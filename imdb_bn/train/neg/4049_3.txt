I did not like the car during the Liberation War in the 80's, so I tried again to see if I was in my film-going taste for the film in the 80's, whether it was "Stripes" or simply a bad movie. Well, this verdict and "stripes" are a bad movie. Now, "Stripes" can be an innovative comedy at the beginning of the 80's, and it can appeal to people who have gone through basic training or Bill Moore's fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Most of the reasons "stripes" are considered to be a comedy, but it's not funny. There are some laughs, but they are a few in and far away. Most movies are conspired by the dramatic plot which is incredibly slow and very interesting. This loss of the comedy is especially noticeable, if you use more contemporary comedy such as "Anchorman" which struggles for laughter in every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The lack of ability to compete with "Strips" kill more bills and Harold. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not yet a very dramatic actor in his career and playing with Harold Ramis, Harold Ramis. Actors are not good enough to carry the dramatic arch of these two films. Finally, most of the "stripes" of Comedy Bill Murray's self-centric, smart-Alex Man-Child Character, so if you can not find the character that is not funny (like I'm not) but you're funny on the stripes. Do not find anything less comedy. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a movie of its era, it is not good and it is not worth watching. If you want to see a "friend" comedy of 80, I would recommend "crazy stereo". Like "Stripes", "Stree Crazy", humor is not as fast as contemporary comedies, but it has got better as compared to "Stripes" and as a result it is still worth watching.
