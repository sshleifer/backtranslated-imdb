On Bridgepon, Bruno's high school teacher Richard Fenton (Janathan Shake) is covered by teenage student Donna Kepel (Britain's Snow); He murdered him for his stay with his family, witnesses but Richard was arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, Sad Doona feels good, but is still undergoing psychiatric treatment and medication. On the night of her, she took her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Portter) and two couples to friends at the Pacific Grade Hotel for the party. But Cycothath Richard escaped from prison and behind the donor, he was standing on the same floor in the hotel, hiding his friend and the staff of his passing hotel. <br /> <br /> The forgotten slash "Prom Night" is a collection of clich√©s with a total lack of originality. The story of an insane killer of stupid stories is shallow and stupid, with a bad performance of Jonathan Schaech. The expected screenplay is amazing because it is possible to predict what is going to happen in the next scene. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Donate after a Mort Confident" ("Invites Dance to Dance")
