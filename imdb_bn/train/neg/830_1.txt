I do not really understand all these positive user reviews. This film is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be neutral. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eva Mendes is hot in this movie but terrible. But I do not think it's his own fault but the director. He has somehow managed to do everything in the artificial appearance; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This bullshit Do not see, go to watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
