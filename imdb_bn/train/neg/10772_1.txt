The most sad part of this is that I will never return to this 87 minutes. I knew this terrible thing was with the man wearing a crazy Indian head dress on the roof. (See if they could get away with that in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is now in baseball, so we decided to rent it on rainy days. Although he started enjoying some part of it, then I started crying all the irrational idioca. Bad, bad movie This bad news Bears was a terrible ripoff. Completely shameless and completely anticipated. If I do a good job, I do not think of a predictable film, but it was not at all.
