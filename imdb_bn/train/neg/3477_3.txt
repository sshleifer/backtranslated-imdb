Not as bad as you have heard. In fact there are some fun parts and Affleck and Applegate have fairly good chemistry. Applegate, especially, is interesting and interesting like the love interest of Flecker James Gandalfini and Catherine Oahara Consumer Professional. They're just pretty good about everything. Finally, "survival" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has been focused and mostly comedy is compulsory. Dark humor endeavor as close to the door. Affleck comes across as endearly tried hard to be spastic and overenthusiastic but bothered. Looking at Gandhholini and O'Hara's more silent, credible performance, his character is brought to higher relief in the cartoonish nature. Even with the relaxed criteria of holiday movies, you can not buy this family for the X-mas completely in the "Rental" Affiliate Set-up. <br /> <br /> Here are the scenes which are the borders of the guest of their arrogance. The ex-scene of X-mas is filled with inexplicable humor (a boy being discovered in search of his mother's naked, provocative photo), which is not only funny or trustworthy but not annoying. <br /> <br /> To make matters even worse, the colors of this photo are ugly, almost dirty. The movie that appears in most films seems to be staging and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is mostly for a quarter of box office bunches (Pikecock, Gogli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how long the permanent damage will be.
