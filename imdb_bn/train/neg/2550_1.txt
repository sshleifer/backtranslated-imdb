It was the tagline of "American Piece Tradition" which made me fool to hire this movie. I was a part of Junk in Jackass's style, the main difference in comparison to this jackass is that the movie looks like a citizen. <br /> <br /> This movie has made me regret that I've rewarded other films. 1 out of 10 reasons I'm not going down now. This one makes several bad movies look like cinema feats. <br /> <br /> I actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I very rarely do. But it was very annoying, stupid, unintended and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Some people can not believe that it actually rewarded 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Are you just a child when you leave on the head? Or is it the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are you breast-fed thoughts? Something must be wrong, at least <br /> <br /> My suggestion: make it clear. If your thinking is not needed in a simple movie mood, then choose something else, or you'll definitely be sorry about it.
