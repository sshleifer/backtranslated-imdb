I guess it will be a great film for the true Christian believer in the Christian Duga, but it is a terrible joke for anyone who likes free will, rational thinking, church and state separation and good science fiction associated with free will! <<br> <br /> There are some famous actors who were badly in need of work or had their personal beliefs shared with the rest of us. <br /> <br /> In the same way I was entertained by the movie "Reefer Madness". The film that tried to learn the "Christian" principles of this movie tried to teach the drug strategy, as well as trying to threaten hell and suffering for the film's other good people who do not share explanations of our world. <br /> <br /> This made me excited with a smile and simultaneously understood how many people actually believe that our society will return to the good old days of the 19th century!
