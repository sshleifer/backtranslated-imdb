Some are as bad as it is made, although obviously compassionate than the original. According to me, Amitabh Bhilan was like Babban Singha - do not try to compare with Gabba because they could not clearly have the same effect. In addition to some middle action scenes, the rest of the film is faulty. Character development was poor and the development of the story was frustrating, many errors, and data lost information that I do not know if I can not read the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the support role of Nisha Kothari and in particular the new bride named Prashant Raja. Nisha is just annoying since her lips first time open. For the peaceful king - who is this guy? Where was he present for some other than drinking water in the film studio? His acting capacity is zero and he has exactly the same tone, distribution of the dialogue and every scene has a stretch expression, whether it is action, comedy, even a scene when someone died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expression changed, which I can say for a mate's mistake. Overall, RGB's rigid performance in Amitabh, and a special look very valuable for watching for sexy Urmila Matondkar.
