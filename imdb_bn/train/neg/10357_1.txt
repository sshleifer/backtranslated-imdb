I really did not like this movie because it really did not bring up the messages and ideas that Lou'engel published in his novel. We read novels in our English class and I love it, I thought I can not say the same thing for the film. There was some serious difference between the novel and the adapted version and it did not give any credit to the fantasy genre of Mallein Lawangle! For this reason I gave it a poor rating. If you are a fan of Laenggel's books then do not see this movie because you will be very disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment (or as a case for my case) then this is a correct film!
