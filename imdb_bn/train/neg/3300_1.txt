This is quite common for Sweden movies. Curious that the acting was very bad, these actors usually give a good show. The welding was done badly, it was something you expected (I would not tell you). The main character was awful ... I do not know where they find him. However, stay away from this and instead see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this is the head of action in Sweden.
