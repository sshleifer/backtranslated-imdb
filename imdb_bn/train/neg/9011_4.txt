Beautiful Standard B-Movie Staff. Sincerely, anyone who sees "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Kain and some of their first filmmakers should know better than expecting real quality or even medium intelligence. B-movies are popular that the re-creation formula exists. If you even analyze them even token, then you will ruin the film for yourself (and perhaps some self-important, write insulting reviews on IMDB). <br /> <br /> I like female lead, Christine Beas. His charisma was and I think he was remarkably attractive. It was a memorable B-movie look. Unfortunately, I did not see any movie that I made. I will meet again for him.
