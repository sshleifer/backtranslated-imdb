I did not really see this movie but it can tell me a thing about the product. While a comedy / old radio DJ in 1988, I got a call from the production firm. They ask that I want to write and record anything, they will enter the soundtrack as the sound emitted from a TV (the television screen will never be seen). I'm sure, a parody of 50 Seconds Saifai Giant Clich√©s has written, some sound effects have been scored and another DJ called Pam Laundry for playing DJ. At that time, suddenly in the air, he wrote a long song, joined Mike in my product room and we cut Voicetake by taking the unit. Guiding, then I mixed the effect of the silly sound when he returned to his show. If we know that "Woodchipper genocide" is going to be such a turkey, we could never have done it - but again, we could never pay for our efforts! - Gary Thro
