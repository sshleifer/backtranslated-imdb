How is it possible that any journalist or critic reminds us of the compatibility of another good Flemish movie "Congo Express (1986)"? Some characters of the Congo Express combine without having to relate to each other: Jane, (D Congolie), staff, two taxi drivers, street singers, Roger, Guy, Lucien and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Berman was not a star and Luke Gables. Anyway, the air strikes should not be the reason for the scripts to be forgotten (if there is a script) for some reason. The only thrill in the party about frozen ice (only!) Is taken from the great Flameish film "De Wit (1934)" where De Wite has kept a lot of salt in the pot. There were some accidents in the movie but no explanation came later. Tom Barman has provided us here a movie that is a test to watch on the television of the theater film. Another missed opportunity for the Flemish movie.
