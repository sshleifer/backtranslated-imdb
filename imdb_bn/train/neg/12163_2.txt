Absolutely welding slasher film has one redeeming quality. Camp Councilor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... terrible like a murderer, when her quip is abducted, it does not make it fun), those who fight against the war criminals who at least have been naughty or resisted for their good behavior. We are annoying, like sudden killing, looking for a baby like slashing in a glass to find her Freddy Cloud Glove, a baby gets a chainsaw, a girl is drilled, which enters a crotch (filled with litter). ), Those who are roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> This is an original idea and it is not only waste time. Until you want to see Valerie Hartman's (who played whore whore). Most of the violence is off-screen so that it is not even satisfied.
