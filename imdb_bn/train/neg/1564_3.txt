... so that I could say that the film was horrific, with good conscience. Even before I started thinking about it, I made it in just 20 minutes, "Wow, it's bad." And, to be honest, I could give this movie 1 star if it was not for the seals Morales (though it had a very small screen). She is the only good acting role of the movie, which is shameful because I really like Gill Bello ... or at least I thought I did it. <br /> <br /> I started thinking back to his part, "Shawshank Redemption" and I realized that it was not good. Problem: his prison-house / hard work seems like a law; Her conversation sounded like she's doing a very poor impression. Did he ever meet someone who spoke like his character? I suspect it, but perhaps he should stay. <br /> <br /> And, to make things even worse, they were able to insert a little prison philosophy philosophy and do not think anything less than commercial, especially when you consider that <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, favorable review. I felt that I was deceived and told to lie, and I thought that somebody should try to save me for some trouble trying to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you too
