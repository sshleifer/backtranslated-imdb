I do not know why these fans are doing this and I do not know why I gave it a score too. This is preposterous. There are many ghazals where somebody has to suspend unrest, roll the picture and take it anywhere before taking it, and some poor police officers must definitely explain what we have seen. However, this is going very little and there is a growing sequence where nothing is happening and we do not have any relevance when we hear most repetitive soundtracks, even by Italian standards. Not a gaelo, it's a totally messy mash of Close Kuniski's awesome 'phone-in-performance' horror ideas. I think he has become one, has done a day's work and left Mr. D'Amato to fill others. EVA is certainly fantastic but it's not enough, and in the end we've seen many more of its popping all the places, apparently after a lot of lost interest in this stupid and induced twaddle. Maybe I was not in the mood!
