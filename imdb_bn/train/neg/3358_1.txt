Hunting A remake, of course. The original has been developed with a peculiar mental thriller and time. Compared to this 1999 rimak, it's a classic. There is no character development, only the character (whore, official brain, "I'm going to find us here" colleague, oh so sensitive bookwork). But, seeing how special effects were banking as "stars", I guess the letters that you can imitate are a second concern. Unfortunately, the effect is ridiculous. Smooth doors, expanded doors, dead babies are annoying, which can not speak clearly ... and a utterly unexpected ending which is darnestest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainwater. I take my skittles verbally, thank you. Bruce Darn, I liked you from "Cowboys". Turn off
