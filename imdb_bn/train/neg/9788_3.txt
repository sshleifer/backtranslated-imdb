I do not dislike children's movies, but it was a tierjarker with some redemption qualities. Perfect voice for MJ Fox Stewart and the rest of the talents were lost. Hugh Laurie may be amazing fun, but this movie is not given a chance. Sugar coated sugar and anyone over 7 years old will not apply early. Toy Story, See The Monsters Incorporated Or Shake 3/10
