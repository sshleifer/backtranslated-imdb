I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave the leway for 10). If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will not be better. This theory proved to me that I still have experience of a movie. In real life, Dan definitely has no exception. I was watching this turkey and thought; Wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and I do not like a letter at all. <br /> <br /> A suggestion is going to be three young daughters in the story of a paternal / widow, who falls in love with her brother's girlfriend. I think the tagline "Advice columnists who could use the advice" would be? I do not know. In which way someone dances character hit me as worthy of advice. I guess that taunt? I do not know. He does not come to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids, family retreat, which is very sweet, and good comedy, the possible cover for the story line ... does not appear in anyone. The central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can not have her. Anyone with a pulse will understand that eventually he will get to him, but you will have to enjoy the painful unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network conversations "love killer" inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
