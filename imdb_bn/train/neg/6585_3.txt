In the review of this movie, I can go through my experience as a combatant on weekends, on September 1, 1971, at the spot in the garden of Fort Point Pollock, Louisiana, on the 1st of September 1971, in Louisiana. High Ground was not something I did not think of basic training. <br /> <br /> Remember that this post ended just after the end of Korea, but it was a conventional war, as we knew. It's not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we put draftees into an endless hole. At that time the draft was irrational, but the country's defense was still accepted as necessary. <br /> <br /> Richard Weymker has now given the state's responsibility to train a senior Korean man to go abroad. The film is for one of its training cycles and Platoon men's training. They will be of normal nature in any film of any of the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I would appreciate for the highlands is that MGM acknowledged that our army was now coordinated with the presence of William Hedger as a black hired platoon. <br/> <br /> But I would say that his smart face had healed from the first day of appointment like R. Tamblin. Richard Wyommark could not be the risk or hero of death to give Jerome Courtland the right to arms. And he will not be worried about the deportation of Robert Arthur. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See this as an army recruitment film and you must understand why the government has so eagerly supported the day. <br /> <br /> I think drill sergents think of their little contradiction which you can take if you were not worried about getting something in their case that was 95% of the time. But there is no way to open Karl Maldwin Weidmark open during training in front of several witnesses. Both could understand that there would be weak authority, the military would not do anything. <br /> <br /> I want to say something good about the highlands because I certainly like its gifted cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even Dmitry Towminin and Ned Washington's stupid theme, Hi Nun, fresh from their Oscars one year ago. . The film has received the Oscar nomination for Best Playplay and Millard Kaufman's Story. This is certainly the bright imagination of Kaufmann.
