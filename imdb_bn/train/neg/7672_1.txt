Clearly visible crew members are very talented by working in this movie, so do not see credits at all, you just keep it against them. Anyone interested in watching this movie, there were only 3 in the theater; The two passed after 10 minutes, and they were lucky. 'Monsters' were rejected by designers for Star Trek 2, The Ragged of Khan, and Allian's Astronauts. The film's makers did not want to scatter the third-grader of the movie, so they hired actors who were not able to remember their lines or learn to pronounce words before filming in some cases. Some are conveying what is supposed to occur in the scene, if conveying is incredibly inept. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater watching this movie, and you do not pass, you will laugh at the scary or suspicious moment of the movie. The uncertainty of a few scenes will stop you, and Stefan Dorf's 'Swinging Shalitahani Queen Mary' is the regular spieving of someone who expresses such a feeling of money. If you can see this movie, then do yourself a favor and wait until the application is filed in the video shop. If there is a trial in the film industry, then you have to rent it among the main actors.
