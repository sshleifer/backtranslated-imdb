Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I can see this film break specially. It may be because I am from a different era and from a different country, but I have found consistent reference in the first good comedic United States in crossbay, after a while and then finally annoying. Do not make me wrong - I am not anti-American - but it seems that the English do not need this brave and / or this brave warrior, so to show them American Americans such a great smartphone. It is a "fish out of fish" story, but unlike most of these films, this time it is "Fish" with its upper arm. To make myself and the film clear, I've seen it a few times in a few years and can get the same idea every time. <br /> <br /> (I saw another crosby movie last night - Emperor Waltz - and that, too, I have the same reaction. And my surprise - even my wife - for which it is a valuable American - American crossover " Attitudes are found to be provoked, much to Teddy Roosevelt, as he wrote.) <br /> <br /> In the context of the film, it is unique and perfectly Marthaka very well cast. Scenes and music are also good, as is the big costume - although I agree with the previous critics that William Bendix's Wig is awesome (see pictures of three Stogs in pictures). <br /> <br /> For everyone, it will be much more enjoyable than Bing Krosby's attitude, but it really is on every shot because it is very difficult to sit through this movie.
