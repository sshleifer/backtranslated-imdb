Snow White, which came to Lakeorno, where I had the opportunity to see it, certainly refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it refers to coke. In the end, the original ice of Swiss Alps also plays his part. <br /> <br /> The three aspects of this title are fixed in this movie. There is a lot of humor in the scene, and there is a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who wants to go through all kinds of trouble for her rescue. But <br />: It's not a fairy tale. It is considered a realistic drama in Zurich, Switzerland (according to tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically perfect movie Unfortunately, a weak plot, previously called dialog, is not added to create a mostly irreplaceable scenery and mixed performance honesty. So I became stuck as a spectator. <br /> <br /> And then there was such a quarrel that made me crazy: Snow White is a rich and deprived upper class girl - of course his parents are divorced and he gets enough love from them. Not because they were so busy all the time. On the other hand, her best friend is loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a small plane, poor and happy - and their daughter is frightening of the horrible situation. The good guy (= princess) is a musician from the French-speaking part of Switzerland (!) Which is considered to be economically less successful but mentally punctuated fraction of the country). There is a problem with her parents. They are immigrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept the living standards of living - unless the father is seriously ill and admits his son his glorious praise from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so on: Naturally, drug dealers are fierce, bankers are frustrated, the club owner is a playboy and photographer, although a woman (!) remembers her career only when she shows Snow White in the show of the show. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This review is not required to add these pieces to a clear conspiracy. I like the other films of Samir, such as "Forget Baghdad", I was quite frustrated. Let's hope for next.
