I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, it was a quid-taker or an adult, it was a strange combination of an adult story, and there was a problem in determining the creation of some violent scenes with a dull little duck that provided "funny" moments at the beginning. <</ br> <br /> But it is rarely important that the film is not only boring, overwhelming and true to the original story. It just failed to move to the photo, Orwell tried to go to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution !! Did they learn anything ?? Then who will be the next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
