Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, tortured another Brad Sykes. The acting is very harmful, shows some promises without Emmy Smith. The camera "direction" needs serious reworking. And there is no longer "hold and run camera" gimmicks; It just does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, real-time detection is a problem that can be detected. If you are going to stop the ear, please do not let the actor see the real ear under the blood. The scenery is soft and annoying (like Mr. Sykes's other initiatives) and the music is a cross between the cheap pot and a really bad guitar driven metal (see visible comments). <br /> <br /> Did I mention any real intent, or lack of character development? Apparently, the script writer is not. <br /> <br /> Anyone is financing this person ... please stop. I saw her some other "home movie" (which I did not plug in) and they were just as bad. Generally, a "director" will grow from his previous efforts and learn ... this guy is not. It can be an amateur movie maker, but anyone can hack. <br /> <br /> Certainly not a popcorn movie ... Of course, popcorn will be less painful than chewing on the kernels. <Br. <br /> Award: The worst military push-up in a movie.
