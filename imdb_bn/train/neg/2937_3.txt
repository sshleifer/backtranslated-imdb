In order to appeal to those who do not appreciate the apples, an attempt at the crossover exploits the fame of the greatest operators of all times, it fails badly. The movies that are available in this movie can be the best opera, and one can best record the best page. This plot revolves around romance with a doctor who cures her throat, which suddenly becomes annoying. <br /> <br /> I came out so far because it's forgotten. Like most opera stars, the Powouti is a good actor and his singing talent is in the presence of the star, and he refuses to comment on what he does in this movie. His defective horror scripts do not reject or lie. Perhaps big operas may have stupid stories because they have tolerated it. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except who? What do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and treacherous. This film reprimanded with cold mud to select some of the juicy tidbit hanging above the stem (opera music). We have other ways to appreciate the great power, and it is not one of them. Just get one of his many fantastic opera or voice-music recordings and he can identify master tnar where he is most appropriate. <br /> <br /> This is one of the 100 worst films of IMDB but it will also remember and vote for some; It will be healthy in the list with a number of attempts to utilize the popularity of singers, actors, models, and athletes through various movies. It is often bad because of an unreasonable act or a horrible script. Potato was acting actor that she did not show such a great voice. Although he is acting as an actor (above needs it), Jimmy Stewart could not even rescue this script of this script. <br /> <br /> I can give it a sample 3 because no one can be a part of this film due to the music of Paveroti and Opera.
