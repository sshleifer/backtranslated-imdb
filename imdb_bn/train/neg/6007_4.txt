Wonderfully enough it has some ransom quality when it moves towards its end in the movie. For the other part, this film is really bad and langol, a small budget, an insulted poorly written script, and whatever it is with. <br /> <br /> It is meaningless that the circulation of the Christian circle around is not going to get enough funds to make a decent movie with them. I'm not religious, so I did not really care less, but like some good tools for film making, reaching new audiences for churches and making interested people interested in reading the Bible more interested and enthusiastic. In this context, these movies always seem like unexpected opportunities. <br /> <br /> The low budget hits the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie laughable to see its effects, and it only gives the overall movie a feeling of a campi b-movie. <br /> <br /> But his writing about how to hit this movie more. What has happened in this movie is only insulting to intelligence and then I am not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses are so unlikely and people in this movie do such unlikely things that the audience is insulted. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by how the sub-opera was in the movie. . I think it was a difficult time to make it a full-length movie, and they just added some characters and dramatic developments to fill something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it's all predictable, but it's a movie to see Prevents complete ruins and so far as these movies are concerned, there is something worse to watch there, even though I do not think this movie is a new spirit. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
