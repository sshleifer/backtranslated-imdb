My wife and I just finished watching Busu AKA booth. He fell asleep in some parts of the movie. I am really good luck with him, but unfortunate events are the main character's voice so loudly and loudly for me it is impossible for me. When our hero speaks, I want to hear Regis Filbin and William Shatner sing Karaoke. He has no redeeming qualities. I hope he hits a bus on a bus for five minutes. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but booths are very annoying and no damned sense at all full of scenes. If you like some good Asian movies, two sisters look in a story or mirror. Avoid boots like plugs, especially if you enjoy frequent migraines.
