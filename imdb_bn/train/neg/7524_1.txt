Critics have been awarded this image with a handful of positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinions, but I strongly disagree. When I first saw this movie, I was silent. But after comparing with other movies, especially with late master, Bruce Lee quickly changed my mind. Actually, if it was not for the title of the film, I would have bought it. Death 2 is not related to the original game (a letter without this, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> <br /> I found out that the game of death has been compared to the game. Plots have similar matches: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Low are a mission to take a relative revenge. The two places are the same, where they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. Both films have an element of prostitution (both women are sent to the two guest rooms of both movies.) Both Han (write the Dragon) and Lewis's hechchman missing a hand. Enter the Dragon is an underground drug operation, whether it does not believe or not, there is one of the death games. Hannah's Dragon ENTER is a pet cat, the director has used his imagination and has given Luis a pet monkey! The list continues. <br /> <br /> About other aspects of the movie, such as scripts and acting, I felt it was very bad. I felt that director Marshall wanted to play in the film in search of a group of artists and prayed that they could work. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that choreography is captivating. Although Acrobatics has strong elements in the war sequence, they do not work with less efficiency. However, the plot was inadequate, I could not relate to the characters, so there was more showcase of the war than the money in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say that this movie is a recommendation for a martial arts fan, but with a good story and strong character for those who enjoy a difficult story, I will not seriously recommend this movie. My opinion about this movie may seem very biased and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts movie, especially after his best work: Enter the Dragon, the film failed to look at these standards. If they really want to achieve the same level of fame, just like the real brilliant martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> In relation to my assessment, 1 of the 10 works very hard, the film sees Barley and should be grateful that it had a sequence of battles.
