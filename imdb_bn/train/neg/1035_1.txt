Terrible acting, awesome cast and cheap props It's been a lot better to set up an action parody style movie. What a waste Starting from the name of the movie <br /> <br /> "Acne Movie" It would have been better if it was named "action movie". (Contribute to the effect of the parody). The Superintendent of Police, like a 60-year-old player, has a similarly annoying look. At the end of the film, he and the bad guys are omitted and whenever they work together to exchange words, it seems like a cheap line given before pornographic scenes of an obscene film. Horrible Do not waste your time.
