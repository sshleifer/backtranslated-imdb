Now when I say something that can be condemned or wrong, I will accept it first, so I apologize in advance for my anger about how much I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> it sums up too. I like this movie. To be more specific, I dislike the idea of ​​this movie. Cinematography was good. The mood was beautiful. And the acting was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is shameless, irrational and confusing. It's also aggressive. <br /> <br /> I'm about a quarter of Cree, and for some reason I feel humiliated at the personal level by the nature of the whitter character. First of all, he is a black guy. And this is not a racist comment, I swear. A White, Hispanic, or even American Native Americans dislike all those who represent Katana hanging on a rooftop. Katana represents the soul of a Samurai, which is confident with the souls of her ancestors and protects Samui. Ghost dog used to use his gun instead of katana blades and an insult inside the soul, and where is he a Katana hack? It must be one of the copies that Samurai insults the nation. <br /> <br /> Also, Ghost dogs have not shown any respect. At the end of the film, he shot a bodyguard behind a window and then shot a man through a drain and shot him dead. It's not just a terrible way to kill an enemy; it's more like a disgrace; Silent killer; There is a group that denies the Sumerians, but they are hated less. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss, when he learns that his boss is a badie. Do you know that when a true Samuai learns his master, does he prove to be bad or dishonest? He kills himself, proves that he dies, he will humble himself in the level of his master of the dog. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " We have great cinematography, good adaptation and so on, which include the plot and compound of a laugh (which is unfortunately its most important aspect), it creates an unsatisfactory overall film and insults an insulting Bishish (Samurai). <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Blah
