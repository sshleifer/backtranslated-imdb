Before writing this review, I went back and read reviews of read others. This film was particularly disappointing because it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakris, often featuring the wonderful Michael Legend ("Worthington Heights", "Ice Station Zebra," "Thomas Crown Affair"). , Unsupported and unreasonable, forgotten song, the story is a joke, even costuming was not particularly flattering. J and soul captive. I am glad that other people enjoyed "young girls in Ratchfort", although I certainly did not do it.
