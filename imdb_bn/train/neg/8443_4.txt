Anna lives outside of the city with her family just inside a new housing estate. She has been with her husband Sebastian for several years and they do not talk much more. A female colleague committed suicide during a foreign trip abroad. Anna was deeply influenced by his death, though he rarely knew him. No one knows why he took his life. For the first time Anna realized that someone might be unknown to you in the most beloved. Anna did not return home after mentioning the incident and started observing her husband and son. Gurness is the story of a woman who suddenly started to see her own life. And she wondered how she moved away from her closest people. <br /> <br /> (This is my DVD cover syllabus translation.)
