This movie was like a bad train debris, which was awesome, yet you still had to watch. My boyfriend and I rent it and waste our two-hour day. Now do not make me wrong, acting is good. Just completely cinema is just both of us mad. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this film, I had to rent a little bit which was a bit lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. Think of his character manic and think all of it. He played an excellent role in playing at the Darry Hall in Darry where he is in the position. More than once, I shouted at my TV that he was saying to fight or be violent. After all, very violent films ... not for the heart's dissatisfaction.
