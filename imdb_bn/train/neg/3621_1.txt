I hate this show when I was a child. On the day the children used to actually see the letters, the Generic American General Dialect was used, not just blue. Jack Wild had a British accent and was Pufnstuf's South. Like others mentioned, I did not know what was the deal deal with wild radio. That always seemed strange to me, probably the flood bothered me, and I did not find any problem in taking it away! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Others mention: Pfnstuff trapped McDonalds. In the height of popularity in McDonald's, TV shows (or rather their makers) tried to license McDonald's characters for their shows, but when McDonald's denied TV shows, the TV show changed the character slightly and passed it on its own. They recruited McDonald's Advertising Agency's former employees and voice actors to create TV shows. McDonald's sued and won. Search for the Pufnstuf McDonaldland suit and you will find plenty of articles about it.
