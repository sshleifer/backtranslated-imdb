This film is very difficult to appreciate. CGI has worked well for the dragon, but the lack of proper modeling for lighting and shadows. Also, the same footage is used continuously in the drug, which becomes slightly tedious. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in acting credits, thinking I was acting a Roman Emperor Empire in this film! It should be an ali like "Hypie Goldberg", and if he appears in this stacker, he may be held accountable for using one. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the acting is flat, and the direction is tired. If you see this movie then go near your friend's house and get drunk while doing it - it will be enjoyable.
