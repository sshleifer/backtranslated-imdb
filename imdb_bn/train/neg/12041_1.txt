Well, you have to start? This is one of the worst movies I've ever paid a lot of money. I do not comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it seems like a soap opera. Acting in the beginning, except for Eric Bana, soap opera quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here the bold and beautiful actress shames him. Camera action, does not help. She thinks when it lingers on her, it just takes me back to Brooke Forster's day in the lab! Peter O'Toole is really a bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one. Like Linda Evans, she looks more like Linda Yans! And to finish my opinion, Dean Kr√ºger is an intelligent girl, but she is sure that Troy is not Helen. Peterson should rather choose Saffron Burrows for the role, Elizabeth Taylor will now be miscast now.
