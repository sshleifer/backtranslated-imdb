I read Chris_M_grant's comment from the United States. He wrote: "A great documentary in 1924. Today's geography of Iraq was strong in the early 20th century." <br /> <br /> I want to thank Chris and the people who are interested in Iran's Bakhtiari Nomad, Zodros Mountains and landscapes, and want to thank the film grass, a nation's war for life. The tradition that you saw in the film has been tolerated for centuries and will continue till the end of life. I'm from this region of Iran. I am a courtesan <br /> <br /> I am sorry to bother you but Zardakah's bounty is not in Iran, as you mentioned in your comments. Iran and Iraq are two different and distinct countries. Accepting an Iranian for an Iranian is almost American adoption of Mexicanism. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Live
