Especially interested in this special historic event, as a nut in history, I was very disappointed with the movie. The guessed, costume and staging were completely pure, but Hollywood's image of this "British Little Big Horn" was really annoying. <br /> <br /> The size of the footage or the dedicated footage of the army's army was unprecedented, in film history. I started listening to the wonderful background music, I knew I was preparing myself for another rugged scenes of flawless fillers. Clearly, the producers strongly invested "staging" and were determined to get their money value. <br /> <br /> Despite their outstanding cast, their conversations were again annoying and their characters have never been developed. Whenever Peter Oatoll or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would be frustrated with despair. Their given line was so weak and meaningless that I could not believe that these two great actors who painted the Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man of Alcrase respectively. <br /> <br /> There is a worse epic, but it's not a lot better.
