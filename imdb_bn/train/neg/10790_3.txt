Above all, I'm not very fond of contemporary Turkish movies, because the normal pattern of box office success has been hit by the bottom of the waistline. As a movie director and marketing advertising means, there is nothing to do with an artistic masterpiece that relates to taboos. In my opinion, the only purpose of this film can be to make money by touching a sensitive monotony (it is basically considered banned nationwide), providing cheap public money with a brief definition of my understanding. <br /> <br /> However, acting is near perfect. In fact, most of the customs have theater backgrounds and strenuous efforts to compensate for the lack of bilinguals; Genius! Cast members are fully qualified with their roles and qualifications for jobs, even fewer experienced people. At least, (like jonset), Alcatel's praise is worthy of getting a little word, just because he knows how to choose Cast. Even more than that, he is simply a media monkey who thinks himself as a director with an artist's talent. Come on, art is not something that completely deals with naked / half-naked women. And because of media dissemination, a director has not been a milestone in the history of Turkish film. Just close your ears and some are some of the real artistic, I'm waiting enthusiastic to appreciate your next job. Hopefully, you will manage to acquire an artistic method at this time. <br /> <br /> In a short time; Prose> Good acting, hot women (just fun!) :) Cons> Each and every single, other than cast
