Have good Is bad And then their sentinel, a minimalist barrel political "thriller" that I saw among the worst movies. A joke in the Secret Service is a good one with a plot, but with so much potential a movie has been so silly. Directed by Clarke Johnson, with Ham-Handed "Izzi", every actor in this movie seems to be working at Autopailot. Even the great Michael Douglas shows bored here. I can honestly say that I never saw, in my life, I saw another film with many painted plot holes. Curvaceous is predictable from the square, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they encourage laugh from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a movie disaster without the price of a release.
