I'm really looking forward to this program for two reasons; I really like John Michael Vincent and I have a serious love relationship with Aviation Brown and Helicopters. I do not like this program because it imagines an incredible level. A few years ago, the world speed record for the helicopters by Westland Lins was replaced by 249 miles. In the 1960s, experimental Lockheed was the fastest helicopter on AH 56. It hit over 300 and it was a composite helicopter, which means it was a crusher propeller at the end of its lung supply. <br /> <br /> In short, because of the rolling policy, a helicopter can not fly more than 275 Wing flights. And Bell 222, "Actor", which illustrated Airfowl, even the helicopter standards were not too fast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
