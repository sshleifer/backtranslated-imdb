Because of the recommendation of Toronto, I picked it up in the video store ("If you do not like it, go f & ^% yourself!") In the box ... looks like a ringing approval ... I was expecting "death proof" like Something ... this one is not real physical violence in character, character, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Check out the poster. It's all there. Stunt, and rock. It goes behind it. A LA band is a week or more that shows a shocking magic show, at a stage that you see in one of the few casinos from the strip and the new Australian stuntman in the city finds her leg ... they work, they meet the girls They're the team. The story ends. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It should be said that stunt bits in the film are actually spinning - which is actually something that Australian colleagues actually do, and seems to be inspired by love and respect for the film "art". I hang it there on the crazy things he'd like to do next Just wish she could find a good car.
