Before watching this movie, I could already say it was a complete copy (they were full of shack-like places and black people want to break their hands out of the cuffs). A movie named Movie usually turns me off (yug, what can we say?), But I still want to try. <br /> <br /> I started, I was a little interested. Acting is absolutely terrible and I found myself smiling on almost every response from the character (especially that people playing "Sulley") MJH was even worse, but I kept on spinning. <br /> <br /> Finally, the biggest joke among them was! <br /> <br /> I thought, what was this last ?! <br /> <br /> I thought this expression was funny than "scary movie" spoofs and was really saying something!
