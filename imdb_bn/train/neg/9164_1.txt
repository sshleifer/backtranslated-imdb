I must disclose this to a huge romantic saying. So I really wanted to like this image. So I'm writing my thoughts to save everyone else from frustration I felt seeing it. Leap Year tells Li-Ann's fateful story, who has read for Jeremy Subeder and is committed to meeting every leap year. Based on a great little story and a cast, it's a very romantic premiere that you still do not think of seeing another Jack Neo Flick. Oh, why are you so bad? First of all, I think filmmakers think they are shooting a music video, because they chose to replace the true emotions with storytelling and chassi montage, expected action and clinched lines. I feel frustrated and embarrassed among the first few people in Singapore to see the leap year, but those of us in the movie agree that due to the qualifying performance, our miserability is diminishing. My hopes were a romantic film that would be the greatest romantic comedy evergreen forever in Singapore, and the Leap Years might not even close. Some blogs are known as The Crop Years, which are strict but ultimately true. I do not waste your money or your passion like I do. In the movie you will always have to give up on love.
