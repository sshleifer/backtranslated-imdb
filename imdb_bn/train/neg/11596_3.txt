The fifth film in 1989's "The Dream Child" (usually overdated) "Nightmare" series and at the latest, this series became the total waste. The only good film in the series was Wes Cranven's original and third episode "The Dream Warriors" in 1987. The second part was frustrating and annoying and it was the fourth part of which the frightening crazy Freddy Kruger started to bother with the constant idiotic joke. This fifth entry in the series has nothing to suggest as how Freddie Kr√ºger (see the admirable) visuals and the existence of a wonderful scene. The rest of the film is basically screaming with the stupid one-liners of our razor-cloud pants-cloud-jocartor and the old formula of teenage jackass clans, who try to avoid sleeping, because the old Freddy waits among them. Dream Lisa Wilcox has returned to Elise Johnson's role and a bunch of helpless fears, such as super-dum 'iri' children's rhythms, have been added for any other reason than for any kind of loyalty to create this unnecessary and annoying seagull. .. Brief: An original load of an originality, a decrease in the old formula, and an extra load of painful annoying jokes. My (generous) rating is to strengthen the distinction of the great scene of 3/10 and especially the next series "Freddy Dead", which is horrific beyond belief. If you are not a Freddie Kruger enthusiast then you should avoid "Dream Child" and even if you're disappointed, it's more.
