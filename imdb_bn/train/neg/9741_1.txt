(spoilers) Strawber's Hena Birds, This is a really memorable part of brown and British cooking foods, rather than the other, one of the worst dye jobs. That is, and superb caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who are trying to steal the discoveries of Steiner. MST3K makes fun of a badly boring and gray film. I especially liked it when Crowe killed Mike with his death and when he revived him in the theater, Mike shouted, "Friends, I have died, I have seen eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this movie ..." It is frustrating, the rest of the projected man to come back from the next life. The film could sell as a fate to help a sleeper. Some pictures of the movie were wicked: Police Inspector- "Electrocution!" CRO- "Terrified, is not it?" Police inspector- "It's love, okay" Tom Servo- "Very Low, by the floor below!" Police Inspector- "Can I Get It?" Tom Sro- "He died, but wasted himself" The only way MSST3 found this snooze
