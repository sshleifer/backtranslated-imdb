Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. What started as cute cute teenager - "Comment on everything that suits all and feelers about their sucky teenage life" sitcom now mutated into a "you should deal with your problem" I used to watch and love Daria all the time. Now, after watching the so-called "movie" I'm sitting here, I can only express the surprise of all these things. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? please forgive? Did not create every episode of Dariya that you want to do right, as long as it is right with you, do not you think the rest of the sad sad world? This whole thing reminds me of the movie "Reality Beitts", the movie channel shows the documentary for the first time.
