I can not see enough TV game shows to understand the attraction of money, but I think it has some appeal to neglect the audience. Apparently a quiz show, it offers a huge amount of money to answer a few simple questions. However, his quiz elements are only a small part of the proceedings, which I found to be oppressed complex. For example, before answering a question, the contester chooses to ask a question by selecting a question from "L," "B," or "C". Does this game serve any other purpose than slow motion? It will be very fast to start with "A" Competitors can ask questions, but each section will have to answer three questions. After answering a question, the contestant is asked to "lock in" to answer - another delay strategy. The next job of the competition is to open a card in which dancers of almost a dozen shoots of a woman named, which indicates how valuable the question is. Adds the total number of dollars in the running of a correct answer contest; A wrong answer subtracts the same sum. In this timeline, there are actually some entertainment standards, because the audience can watch closely and closely with the beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant is thought that an unexpected selection of "killer card" will end the game immediately. It naturally creates competitive sweating and nervous competitors think of the sudden losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars as a cause for further delay. I suspect that the main audience appeal of sudden disaster may be appealed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process was slowed down by host William Shatna and many empty banners in the contestant. Occasionally routines by caged dancers. These delays may be forgotten so often that the right answer for the audience can be forgotten what the correct answer is. <br /> <br /> A typical 30 minute episode of Geopdaddy often has 60 questions. I have seen that SMTM is only through the first 30 minutes of six questions (which is related to many other TV shows). Nobody on your right will not see this show because it makes fun of answering the questions of the house. The three possible reasons to see that show are the pages. <br /> <br /> at How a contestant shows a direct reaction to a million dollar winner, can only lose everything in one stroke. <br /> <br /> b. Seeing pretty young women by performing routine dance routines. <br /> <br /> c. To enjoy William Shatner's curiosity cats. <br /> <br /> I like "B," but for an hour, women have enough cameras to handle hardship.
