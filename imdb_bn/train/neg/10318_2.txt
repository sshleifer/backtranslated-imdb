Who likes the horrific "comedy" show like the Little Mosque in the Priory? Among those who can see, I can think of only two types of people: Liberal defenders are so thrilled to get rid of all the ethnic groups that are so thrilled that there is no problem whether the show is good. Or all the fun (which is not it). Two, the idea of ​​old people and jokes is incredibly predictable, badly written, curiosity jokes. <br /> <br /> Need to see what CBC is doing and who is watching their audience. If they are writing comedy only for the old man, then guess what will happen, their listener will die soon and no audience will remain. Am I interested in writing for this event? Do you think it is a Muslim, or a hip, funny young man? No, I have written these same old boys who have similarly similarly malicious writings in the same BJP show since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you saw CBC Comedy Shows, Air Fars was just finally shutting down the air (thanks to love!) but we still have foamy ducks like 22 minutes and Rick Mercer, which we are providing, in the prairie " This poor excuse for the comedy "Little Mosque" should not be mentioned. Is it supposed to be humiliated and funny? Only CBC thinks this lam shot is all strangers or fun. CBC Sham for only squandering our tax dollars will only bother watching some observers.
