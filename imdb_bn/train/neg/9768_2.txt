On my first birthday Happy Birthday, I checked the timer, how long the film was. I was surprised by the length. Both animated and horror films both share a common ground: the attention of the selected audience is Spanish and that should be around 90 minutes or right. Something else, and you will lose your audience a lot. <br /> <br /> This 110 minute, or its main 20 minutes ago, was a big problem for me. I want to say that half of this movie can be edited, but I want to be very generous to say. Go ahead and see it and tell me how many scenes can be edited, even though being a movie head. <br /> <br /> Without a lot of inspection, the movie was under the middle. It has spent all its time trying to find this great mystery, in which "elite 10" are killing remaining friends. In most cases, they do not just look at it, but they face it and most of them say, "This guy! No! This girl!" You actually spend more time with the camera rather than enjoying the movie. And you can not start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, I started. Melissa So Anderson had become blind in the Little House in the Prairie (later, my doubts were proved to be correct in the study) I had to smile at the start of the attention, because she was really blind through this movie. As a weird, established actress, she wanted to be the best in the team, but turned worse. The rest of the staff, apart from Anne (Bregman), was very bad, but he, oh, took a cake. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with ten friends, and one is killed immediately. Very rarely, this "dear" friend seems twice as invisible, so they continue their pleasurable ways. Gradually, then more rapidly, Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past and his psychologist, which is published about some personal (and apparently 24/7 call) than most contractions. All the time, more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> What's funny, like the first "disappearance", the "best spines" disappear, and the rest is less carefree. Sure, they give a few hours of air time "Wow, (that person) will not just run" etc., but then they came back to their sexual ways. And what's being said, probably because of the horrific script, or perhaps I was losing interest in 30 minutes, but it was really difficult to be with those who liked the group because they all seemed to be sex partners. The next or anyone will be able to make the best friends in MAX and next scene. See: lazy guy that puts a mouse / rats in his pocket ?? Literally ?? And the most obvious doubt was there. I'm crediting the movie too much (and the time), but I will never know how he has become part of the "Elite 10". <br /> <br /> However, I have a mystery here. Why are these kids targeted? Virginia wonders why she killed someone, when it has never been proven ('to the end) that someone among them is actually killed?' And why this troller and poster will claim that "six of the wicked killings you see"? Hell, even for the year 1981, the first of Friday's 13th movie was shown on Friday ?? Comedy enough, Friday 13th part 2 is released 2 weeks from my Happy Birthday day. Probably, when they were filming a few months ago they were talking, but it was late, <br /> <br /> When "mystery" is released, believe me, you have to review 3 -4x To get ridiculous and implicit intent, and even then, all the mumbling victims / killer's words get subtitled. Even if you get it for the first time, it's an incredibly harmful and ridiculous ending. It is almost worth to see the whole film again, but as a drink game. <br /> <br /> This birthday rally will be avoided. This is a terrific and unreasonable first draft script ?? Please, please take more than one rewrite before the role of the camera, it has no way under the extreme on acting or acting and it is 100% unrealistic on how respondents respond to extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side note: When I was a child, or 10-11 years old, I loved horror films. (Still, weirdly, unhappy criminals are fun, but they have been working hard and hard for years.) We got our first VCR, and I taped many horror movies outside the network (or, version version) TV. I remember that Happy Birthday is getting me the last 10 minutes of Tap, which makes me afraid of death? And obviously the killer gave away big mystery on those who. Although I saw another clip from this movie, I think this is my first full-length vision. Thankfully, this terrible movie does not hurt me as a child. I'm old now, and I can take this trash. But again <br /> <br /> <br /> Side said: Crazy, "Last Happy Birthday" song played the last credit (and as a whole score), still wakes me up. I guess the film (or the last few minutes) affected my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Su Anderson!
