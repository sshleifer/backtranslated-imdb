This short was a terrible disappointment. Until one of my favorite novels is one of the worst adaptations. The dialogue was terribly weird; I could sense any feelings behind the words expressed by the letters. The line is delivered very quickly and the place is felt instead. They can be quoted exactly by the statue. George C. Chemistry was unincorporated between Scott and Susanha York, and an American Rochester observer felt strange. He could at least try to pronounce British. I love George C Scott as an actor, but it just did not work. I think I see highlights from Zen Zenner, where the main parts of the story have been randomly linked to the flow of the story in some way. The scene and the music were all very nice, but I could not feel the feeling and love of Jane and Rochester, and the film kept me completely unexpected. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of JaneYear, I've seen you with the 1983 BBC version of Timothy Dalton and Jellie Clark or the 1997 edition with Sieran Hinds and Samantha Marton. Now these two bright adaptations.
