After high ratings points in IMDb, I decided to watch this movie. To overcome that high rating, I deliberately avoid reading reviews. I would like to go to the theater with a clear slot, rather than knowing the plot or knowing the predetermined prospects. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that you can see my rating. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. The manager at the hotel tried to tell me to enter the hotel room but I also enjoyed it. During Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff. <br /> <br /> The first chocolate pillow is displayed and toilet paper is folded. Enslin responds in a credible manner. He is weird I encourage and think of myself, this is going to be good Those who made this movie realize that less than <br /> <br /> But what happened next is a big one. Eyewitnesses are replaced by the fast expected shotgun method ... Explode the audience with every Hollywood scary technique in the book and hope that some work. Let's see, a clock radio that runs itself? Well, that's always scary. Move objects around the house? Well, you can not complain about that. Blood sinking from the walls and sink? Great. The soul that suits suicide? Well anything else? How to sound higher, vibration, fire, more vibration, messing up the house, more blood, etc. It's all good And it has all been done before. Overwhelm our viewers, including all types of fittings, quickly reduce the overtime, and they will not be able to see it away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And what else do you know? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, several groups of viewers shout at fear in fearful moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and discouraged. I felt no cold down my spine. There is nothing. This movie was 100x which was dreaded. <br /> <br /> So who are these people saying that this is one of the best horror movies? Friends friends Sorry, I did not get it.
