urgh! A movie needs 3 things: a good script, a good plot and good casting. I saw this movie being horribly horrible and unfortunately was frustrating when it was just terrible terrible. I lose the desire to survive half. Rose Byron (The reason I used to show this in my first place) was the only thing to stop my eyes from tearing my eyes. He did a good job as a street and at the age of 13, his face has not changed much. This was a remarkable first attempt in a movie. The dogs were very good. Both did a great job with such terrible elements. Sandra Bernard I think the movie was the biggest mistake. He was completely miscast, and I do not think he ever got the letter. <br /> <br /> I got 10 out of the movie 2 - and that's just because of the Rose.
