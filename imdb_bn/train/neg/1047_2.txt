Someone has to explain to me why the poor man portrays and why a film that reflects the look of an incognito is seen by some as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic about the characters (though the actors do their good work with really bad part) or circumstances. Instead, I saw a forceful, self-conscious effort to be a "awake", "bitter" and "down and dirty". The sad thing is that the camera takes much more than holding the camera without the rhythm of the camera, and because of the reason and in any significant way, it is not possible to stir the movie to achieve a movie in any of the above ways. <br /> <br /> This is a sad commentary on the status of independent film distribution that can be seen only inside a movie Theater Most of today's oath of oath for all carbon copy, bad cinematography, existent camera direction and the oath of passing "art" It is wonderful that "bedroom" or "about shmid" for getting raves like "I think they are very annoying and very intriguing, but like the" Winning Vargas Raising "than the current winner clones. They are totally bright and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Some years ago you saw an "independent" film that means you probably will be treated with some originality and a lot of energy and care, and probably less or less Some technical confusions caused by the sets are, nowadays, that means that you still get the numbers of others, let's have two hours-to-camera-camera surroundings to surround the lack of freedom of independent distributors. And of course, serving characters and situations that are totally unreasonable And arise. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that there is less and less surviving company in the independent market? Is not it? When you see a movie like Victor Vargas Rising, it's not something that copies the worst pictures in their previous movies.
