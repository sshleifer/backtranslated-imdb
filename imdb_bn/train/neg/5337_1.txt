Here's a lot of negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe", I can not stay quiet anymore and let this injustice happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This means, I do not have to worry about missing complex plots because there is no suitable plot to start with it. I can only tear my shoes, take a beer, sit back, close my brain and enjoy all the common satire and the rock nan all the rock n 'rolls from the Grovest decades. <br /> <br /> "Stay away, Joe" in my books is definitely included in the category "So Good That's Good". Now if you are like me and appreciate the "trash value" then it is the final form of camp experience in the 1960s. It's so bad that it's almost obscured by the most imaginative way that it's almost surveillance and only when you think it's probably not a bad one. In the end, you are so amazed with the new dimensions of foolish that you simply do not know how to laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it is so ridiculous that at one time there was a generation that actually made such films. Although I still give 1 out of 10 - once it hits 100, it will become an instant bad movie classic.
