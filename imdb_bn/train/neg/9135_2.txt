Oh, Sam Marovich, we know you have tried so hard. This is your great actress, a brilliant example for all of us, that you must be eligible for nomination at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you mentioned in the 1998 era web site). Well, it's good to be silent and to be stupid than to talk and to eliminate all doubts. You just do this with Ben and Arthur. <br /> <br /> Directly involved with instructions or lack of education, the film's screenplay leads to a really intriguing direction in each of our new scenes. This is a crazy excuse of a story that can be the best companion of the film. Seriously, in the beginning, Benjamin, Ben and Arthur are trying to get married, flying across the country, in the shade of Vermont's best palm tree. However, all these postings are only lead-in for blood. Then more blood, and many more blood. I mean, the final blood donation of this film should be at least $ 20 in fake makeup. <br /> <br /> It is completely a technical gaff. From sound to edit to music, which contains a single vague lightning note on a keyboard, it is a wonderful fact that the media that you see in it combines the film. So shame that some beautiful amateur performances have been lost here. <br /> <br /> <br /> No matter, Sam. I'm sure you made five images on this flickr or run poor souls (like yourself) to watch this movie. Sadly, we do not laugh with you.
