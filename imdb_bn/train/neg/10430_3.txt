There are many good things about the new BSG: there are multiple cylinders for model 8 and 6, for example, two actresses have acted great. There is also the old school feeling of art design on galactica ("Do not be networked on my ship, my dead body!", My bodies will not be networked!), Also, all the spacefight war, special effects (even season science will admit the cartoonishness All of them) dark of characters, their basically flawed nature <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was very good. But the end of Musee? I always watch films and hide these times by showing the timer, so in the end I do not know how much time left. So it was a special kind of torture for me, the last time it happened to happen. Every time I thought, oh this final scene, the final shot, I got more. Each frakking character got its full finish! It was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really is the schoolboy highlighting all this amateurism: young Roslin scenery. Why do we need to know that: {a} He lost his sister and father in a horrible accident and {b} that one night he is standing with a former student? What did the story bring? Where was the connection? Now, for more European-Isch style methods, and any random work in movies and shows, and all of it, but it was just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said I saw "the last frakkin special" and about Ron Ron He expressed his curiosity: He could not come up with a good ending for the story, so ... He is not just! Not as much about the characters as they make the last episode. The whole "Thousands of years ago" was the idea that the mitochondrial eve was used in the Galaxy's HitHeader's Guide, and you believe me, there are many BSG observers who know the special H2G2 story. And I'm talking about, now there is a story that did not work well. Instead we're Rosalin's alumnus who is 20 years old. Do not make me wrong, I'm with old men for old women. Their more power. But this ... just did not create any sense <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone, this series is faulty, as they would like their characters. That goes even moreso for the last episode. I did not do well, with the final and 24 series final.
