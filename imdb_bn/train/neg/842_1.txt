This is not the fault of Michael Madison, he was rarely. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not be described how stupid. Sorry Michael Cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. While viewing it, it seems like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scene. This movie was in sexual overturn, because it is about an underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, without the part of Michael Madsen. He seemed to want to laugh. I hope to make good money for this lousy movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not a B movie for cable, it's more like an F and it should never be seen.
