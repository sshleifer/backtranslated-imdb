Hello I'm from Denmark, and one day I was in a film evening with my friends. One of them came with the film "Russian Terminator" and it was very awful. After watching less than half a minute we go ahead to stop some ridiculous "Highlights" or call "Lautatites" in the movie. I was actually surprised to discover that this movie was produced in my country of Denmark ... It must be certainly the greatest mistake ever made in this country.
