Thomas Achter (Ron Elder) has killed his child and his wife has been attacked by rogue house attacks. Dr. Heler (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him by post-traumatic pressure. Then look at Armar himself facing a man (Til Sageger) and put him on the chair. He is told that this person killed his child and attacked his wife and could do what she likes to do. And there are a lot of resources for her help ... <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting (and shows real restraint in Blood and Gore) for the first time but gets stupidas in minutes and some seemingly impossible plot twists and winds. It was a final wrapping that was all old and stupid that I was frustrated that nobody would actually think of using it anymore. Such talented actors like Elderd, Sageger and Plummer are involved in such a bit as me. It gets three stars for this role but sit in this sitting through stupid plot and really incredible twists.
