Observe all the mad scientist everywhere: If you are going to make your son genetically altered, you have to give it a terrible name than "Paul". I'm not scared if he suddenly had the ability to attack the tooth-sharp teeth and the water and dry land facing Hamerhead shark. Give the child a more qualified name, "Thor," "Rock," or "Tiburan." Because if he ate me, but I'm just laughing, "Ha! Take a load of this!" Paul the slow movers tearing me !!!!! " This is the worst part about this movie, this shark is referred to as "Paul" across Flickr. It seems stupid to make what's been a decent, horror horror movie. "CamerHade: Shark Frenzy" is not a part of other camps and concrete parts. Scientists spend the whole movie traveling around the island, and suddenly a girl goes crazy to walk in the cow's grave, and only pours water on her feet to pour water, which is "Poke", to get out of the water and kill her. The hottie was made live on the SaiPai channel in the film, but it is a small silver lining of another disappointing film.
