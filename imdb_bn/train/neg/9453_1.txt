Holy cow, what is a piece of this movie? How can I take this film maker 250 word books and turn it into a movie? I think they do not know! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You should give a good idea of ​​what this Hollywood producer looks like. I want to say, apparently it was interesting, but the bright visual stories were destroyed by the toilet humor (even if you even think that such things are fun) I want kids that I do not want to remember. <Br /> <br /> Take care of your kids, do not rent the DVD. I hope the doctor's spirit comes from ghosts and hunt people who create this movie.
