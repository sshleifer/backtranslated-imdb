Is it just or is the child really annoying? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Violent sister, after most of her time has become disobedient. For him, well, I know he's all the children, but his acting ability is almost as wood as a dead tree. So far, I'm only halfway through the road, and fascinated by the story, but the people in it end it, I hope it will be better by the end because I do not know about it. Although some supposed cryptic messages in the wall and notebook scripts, everything points backwards, such as Dog God, Live Evil Evil etc. ... seems a little clearer at this moment, but no one categorically expresses its meaning. However, however, if my opinion changes at the end of the movie, then I will update this post, but if you read it then good ...... see the above statement.
