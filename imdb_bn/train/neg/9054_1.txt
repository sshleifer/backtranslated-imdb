If you hate to pronounce Redneck, you'll hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swage, one has been trying to be a redneck. I can not really stand the redneck signs I love Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at sleeping, but he was boring in the film. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more can you get to get this movie? The story was stupid. I am not usually the judge of the film, but I could not stand up to this film. If you want to Billy Bob Thornton movie then go see Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother got this image for $ 5.95 on this wall murat ... statistics ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may be that I'm not able to tolerate the Red Act, or I can not stand Patrick Soze. Probably if Patrick Swaze is not. I do not laugh once in the movie. I usually smile something stupid. If they showed some fingers, then I would laugh. The loss of accident by finger accident always makes me laugh.
