Because of the unexpected success of the Italian "Spaghetti" Westerners, this British-Spanish collaborative film is one of the most outstanding films of all time, and this is the ideal example of traditional effort, established and emerging an eclectic store international star: Robert Shaw, Tele Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Laetey Duffy Sutton, Antonio Mayan etc. Wickedly, this inconsistent mess of a movie acts as a brilliant example; In the 1970s, most of the film's American became a mortal breeding and nowadays it has virtually disappeared (or it has been officially). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to make this movie, not only Western but also my favorite types of films but this was also because it was a great thing with all the qualities, it was not good - my father followed his original relation to a town Buying a paperback version of the novel by Caldad Bastard. Relax! For example, Stevens is playing a widow to revenge her betrayal with her revolutionary husband, sleeping inside a coffin (!) Her stupid manfucker (?) Sutton, for example, is the only quality of the film (if, in fact, it can even be called). Powered by a car nearby; Sawalas, like the blood thirsty revived, who initially seemed to be the main villain, was quickly sent by the film's own ankle lettie; Then the fragment of the fragrance was made, which was our legendary hero-turned-priest Shaw! Fernando Ray, playing a blind farmer, can identify the only rebel shoe who was only in front of the end ... well, never! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and gets unfamiliar from there! The production team responsible for this film was behind other Western rentals at the same time, such as West Caster (1967), Bad Man River (1971), Captain Apache (1971) and Pancho Villa (1972).
