How nice. I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. In the last decade I have seen that this is the worst movie - there is no overdose. <br /> <br /> As a US soldier in the war in Afghanistan, I could not even see this ridiculous film even impossible, because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was no attempt at "truth" in the film Can be found anywhere. Not so much as the tiniest little cone. It seems that it was written by an 8-year-old child, who received all the concepts (and soldier behavior) directly in his book of joke. This image was made in Honduras, which should have been an obvious, but even this clay-raided trash can be broken into pieces. <br /> <br /> I list all the endless technical errors, but it will take virtually forever. From the ancient single shoulder patches that are not seen or worn from WWIIII and the character's name tags, "Colkollins" (character "colon colonies"), which are actually made using reverse, mirror-image. "The Russian alphabet (not the US alphabet) just keeps on running. Uniforms, tools, plot, and especially character behaviors - especially each scene was full of ridiculous errors, stagnation, and complete stupid clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It was not at all that the characters were at least bits credible or trustworthy. It was all ridiculous pillow, extreme, it was definitely a movie that pre-old boy It was meant to appeal strictly, and I do not doubt that they would think this movie is completely strange. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is not a complete freedom fighter. It is a total waste of time. Anyone want strong advice to read this, it really is worth noting a moment of your time.
