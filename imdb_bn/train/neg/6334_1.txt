I saw this movie in 1979, when I was released for 17 or 18 years. The theater was probably 1/4 full when the movie started. Within ten minutes of my film and that friend who went with me, there were only two in the theater. The movie was really curious and his script did not have any plots or reasons and people claimed to have their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie ... why tolerate such torture? Here's why ... We wanted to be a real movie critic ... it's hard to justify showing the best movie for you to have a benchmark on the basis of all other movies on it (10) They always bring good things. However, it is easy to stop all other movies from any bad movie (and this is ... the best 1). There may be several other films that are truly qualified as 1 but I still can not see them. I now see a scale based on all these badges. All the movies base .... I am a true movie critic ... he is he.
