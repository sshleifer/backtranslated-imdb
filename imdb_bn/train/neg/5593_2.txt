I love Dakula but this movie is frustrating! When I was young, I remembered Lee from another dracula movie, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know my young man made me fooled, Lee was the final dracula, style, face, attraction and the evil below it Or maybe it just disappointed me this picture. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine, Dracula must go through the English pronunciation and body language of nineteen? Which plot characters have unrealistic choices and you feel annoying and lack of excitement? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> - Not to see! Sorry, but if you love this movie then you have to sleep and sleep in the dark room alone. Place your unwatched behind. Maybe in your parent's home or abroad, in a non-resident home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of Dracula, which has been developed from today to Naseratu, has been developed. As a movie because it is not objectionable, it does not let you drag on the inspirational mystery that makes Vampire's story so attractive to me. <br /> <br /> And more than 70 million think of this. Visible looks like cheap theater. And say I do not reject everything made in the 70ies. Because I can love new pictures as well as new ones.
