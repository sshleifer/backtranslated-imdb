It's been around 30 years, and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I saw him on television by showing allergic reactions. <br /> <br /> Against my good decision - I pulled it through peer pressure. However, after coming out of the theater, those friends never swore to revive the choice of my movie. After nearly thirty years, we still carry around mental scars from this movie. <br /> <br /> On my death, forgive me one time I hope this movie may be good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , Hopefully I can probably warn others against watching this movie. If I can save only one person from this observation, then my existence in this world will be justified.
