Stan King is afraid of his non-fiction book that awaiting a terrific piece of information to show your readers a secret to writing horror stories, waiting for them to arrive. Finally, if the door is open and the reader gets a little frightened by a 10 foot tall bug, he will also think, "Well, I can deal with it, at least it was not a small leg." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Starting his own picture, he opened his door metaphorically, and shouted: "Look, everyone, see, it's a ten foot foot tall bug! What is SCARY?! " At the end of the film, at the end of the film, he is not saying, his CGI pot and madness crazy and shouted, "Look, everybody, look here! Here's a tens of thousands pound-long bug ... and now, here There is a hundred thousand pounds tall bugs! "<br /> <br /> The filmmakers obviously believed that these special effects alone would compensate for all other errors in this endeavor. (And many are). They can not and do not. Indeed, as they are impressive, special effects are so strong and aggressive that the confused spectators can look at them - instead of being immersed in the story of praise or annoyance. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie comes to the stupid fools when "statue" blurts from its mouth, trying to sunk a statue, Liam Nixon (as Dr. Marro). The filmmakers did not know exactly what they would do once with this complaint, so they surrounded Nisson in a little water, carrying his weapon and launching glove-gloves. Through the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself and threatened, forgot about this annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Sheryl Jackson's novel seems to have sink into this ridiculous scrapple by a committee. Low-eyed teenage stoners who thought of the way to scare were all big and loud: "Okay, come on, let's make the roof, you know, look like a vague face, and, uh, come down on her. .. and catch all these fantastic things, for example, trap him in bed. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of hunting is that it eventually becomes so horrible that it's really fun. Oven Wilson (like Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went to his magic-carpet ride O'Don't, I just fell on his floor and started laughing. <br /> <br /> The poorly constructed, unwise, extremely heavy hand, completely incredible, and filled with incognito dialogue and unmatched views, this vacuum hunting is a textbook example which does not create a horror movie.
