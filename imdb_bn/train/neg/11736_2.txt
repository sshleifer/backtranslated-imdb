Weeks before I saw Iowa, I saw art school secrecy, where a provocative student makes a film and can not determine whether it wants art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be a picture that he had created. I can see the elements of better movies between Iowa-Spoon and the natural motherland killers. However, in addition to artiness, both movies had good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa This movie stumbles on a great end. I must admit it was in conformity. This film is bad from the beginning to the beginning and is not particularly bad or good in any direction. Actors can do all they do. Roseanna Arquette deserves well. She shows that she is very talented, very funny, and very sexy. But why would he have to show it on this turd ball.
