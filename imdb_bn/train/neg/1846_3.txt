Well, I want to be honest with the audience I bought, but bought it for the sex scene, but unfortunately I did not see most of them. All sex scenes were small in harmful way along with all the weird and authentic background music, such as small and other BBC movies, and these two people do not look more like sexual intercourse. At the end there is a small plot - Kira's new lover killer. Stand up !!! How frustrating !!! Why do not we nominate this movie for the Oscars prize? I can not imagine how bad it would be if the movie is R-rated (mine is imported from the UK, Rate 18). Conclusion? Keep it down and walks away, so Yon will not end up having a moron like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
