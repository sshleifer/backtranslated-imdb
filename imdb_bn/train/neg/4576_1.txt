At first glance, consider this documentary / fiction / cartoon quite entertaining and stimulating. Of course, when some thoughts stimulate, it can then be scrutinized. The reality is that this film combines physics with a basic and neutral decision. "What to sleep ... ..." is the link you will see in science and spirituality, in fact, is not rooted basically in science. The Transcendental Meditation Study mentioned in the film claims that Washington DC in this group can reduce the crime of any group in a certain area. In reality, the rate of crime in 1993 was 30% higher than the average crime rate of 1992 in 1992, of HRA (Homicide, Rapese, and Asstus)? There was no reduction in contemporary genocide rates. In fact, every claim related to science with physics can be denied and denied. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is a bad attempt to ridicule humans or joke. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long wind film about science that might stimulate thoughts, you can consider mindval (1990).
