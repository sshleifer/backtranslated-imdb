If this movie was about a fictional character, then the film could stand on its own and be fairly judged. For the unfortunate audience, the film is based on "events", which is very inappropriate for Rub√©n's carter. Many minor incidents were ignored (Carter was not the number one competitor at the time of murder, there is no evidence to save a friend from childhood friendships in his youth), but some big data such as apparently by the "racist" judges hiding a decision of Joe Guidello, our tape war Views and Guidello are completely abusive. Hollywood thinks that anyone who needs to lose a hero, who was in the best of times, was in trouble and had to face more problems than normal people (many times arrested for beatting women) are strange to me. Ruben Carter saw her work for 60 and more, when she refused to talk to her son, the person who could see it. Everyone knows that Zeusison can direct directions, and Washington can work, but why they chose this story because their cars are out of my way. Hollywood needs so much black black heroes that they will have to bind the truth in their biological images to make them believable? (Hens is a suggestion, how is Segel looking at a movie about himself? Now it is inspirational), based on all the erratum in the film, I would suggest to pass it.
