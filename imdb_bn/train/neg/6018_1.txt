I'm sorry that Christian (and I'm one) think we must create "left-handed" films. We have a lot of good stories that can not be said to be so preacher. I was very disappointed with this picture. As an ambitious filmmaker who believes in being a Christian, I see this movie as a perfect example of what I'm going to do with my film career.
