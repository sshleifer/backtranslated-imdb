I only saw this for the first 30 minutes and what I saw is that the whole part of the nut The scenes I saw were bad as Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood is the fame of being the worst director ever but that is not true; The junk handler is the greatest manager of all time. <br /> <br /> American police have a German accent! "Police Station" was a desk in a warehouse, "Police Station" is a sign hanging on the wall. There is a boxing fight where the punches are almost clearly absent by FENET. <br /> <br /> This police pulls women over them, capsizes them and takes them to a warehouse. He tells his colleague to wait for the car. Then he comes from a warehouse carrying Duffel bags. Kop Partner thinks that something is not right, his partner might be a bad police that is killing this woman, but if he is not sure what is going on - he is a fool! The dialogue is completely stupid, acting horror, and the characters work on the stupid way I've ever seen on the screen. It is absolutely clear to the police officials that he is abducting this woman illegally and he is slapped and taken to a warehouse and returned to the car with a duffel bag with a body, and still, the partner who does not know what is happening, all along there! <br /> <br /> This photo director hacks. I stopped the movie in 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It should be one of the coolest films I've ever seen and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> absolutely perfect.
