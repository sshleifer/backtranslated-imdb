... Well, pop it in the DVD, waste one and a half hours of your life that you will not get back and find out. <br /> <br /> are you acting? What acting? <br /> <br /> Production price? ... production? ... Price? <br /> <br /> the story? Do not start me <br /> <br /> After many years of posting IMDB, I never thought I'd be able to see a movie that I really want to get a low rating. In this case, all the same people (!) Will actually get the handle, at least for the purpose of the author, director, cast, or the producer's intention or effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, This tangled waste of video tape, demonstrated that he has no talent. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if it was "production" of some junior high school students for its first movie class, but during this miscarriage there were six "artists" mentioned behind this drake. <br /> <br /> How is this made? Who wrote a check for this in their right mind?
