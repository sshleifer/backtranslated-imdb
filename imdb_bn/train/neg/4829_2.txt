As a general movie-viewer, I can not say that I liked to see it. This is not very emotional for a play, not very fast for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments of film are rarely credible. All right, I understand that the soldiers have become somewhat frustrated with their minds there, but it is hard to believe that a person will risk his life in the middle of his dangerous life, and a professor's wife will run away crying, without asking a question (a Correctly). It was an animation or it would seem romantic, but it seems to be a deadly movie about war. There are many such episodes, so the whole picture gives an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie and it needs a lot of work. It seems that filmmakers wanted to create a picture of a brave soldier, but this 'curve' in his psychology seems to be just irrelevant. <br /> <br /> This image has a question on my mind: why? Why did they give an Oscar? Why six And IMHO it's the most thrilling part of the movie :)
