As a member of the test audience, I had the opportunity to preview this movie and the only thing I kept in my seat was to fill the post-screening survey. I think the biggest problem of the film was the lack of main plot. Instead, it was composed of competing (too) many sub-plots for screen time. As a result, there is not enough character to create any type of attachment for viewers. We have to show what the director and producer failed to do, why should we see what will happen to our characters. Actually any sub-plot and letters related to it may be removed completely without causing serious damage to the film. (The necessary sub-plots and letters will be given the necessary permissions for the time required.) Simply tell, the Hungarian Bachelor's plate plate is narrower with sided dishes and appetizers when no entrance is desired.
