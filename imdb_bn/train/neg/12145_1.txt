Since you may be gathered from the title, I sincerely believe this movie is the worst movie of all time. Acting, camera-work, writing, special effects, and remotely sucked anything related to this movie. People argued that this film is very awesome and horrific but it comes with a diverse intelligent script. How nice. There are more holes in plot than I or anyone else could possibly count. At the beginning, why would everyone go to work if the government is not safe? I know the government looks bad but they do not get anything with the entire population of the country. There will be no one to rule! Another thing I was wondering about, even if the government asked everyone to work, why could people go to the streets even in the streets? Did the zombies attack the helpless people to help the government in the plot to hide the trees and kill the planets? And how about the end? That stupid torch guy sacrificed his life so that zombies get a few close-up shots. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why did Heinberg say before he died? Hendenberg was a rare event seen by a very few people. Throughout the country, perhaps the world's zombie danger will be seen. He does not think anyone else will get some snapshots? When the soldier overseeing foreign dancers, they managed to destroy only semi-interesting scenes in the film. Why did the jambi hide behind the screen for 5 minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when zombie can come through the door. It's probably something like an intelligent junky movie fan that just can not understand himself. Every day I pray that in order to increase the capacity of my brain to find enough subtle quality of feeding me enough people, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The desire to hit people involved in the production of physically. Hey Trent Haga, I'm calling you!
