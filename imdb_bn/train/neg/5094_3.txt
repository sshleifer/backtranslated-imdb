This movie sucked. Acting sucked, sucked the script, and sucked the overall movie. There were two threads in the movie which did not develop, and the audience had to work a bit to know what was happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled, but you're suddenly going to have something to say about what's the smallest form you have. Example: <br /> <br /> The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The listener never sees how he knows something about the person and how he relates to his fiance's death. Viewers also have at least exposure with the death of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Also, it is seen suddenly that a bunch of people is loading and machine guns are jumping and other scenes are seen by what you are doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that while watching it the movie was bad and bad fun, so it gave us some relaxation at least. ;-)
