Houseboat is a great title for this photo. This is absolutely spot-on, and so is the only point of view for which I can give 10 10. There are houseboats, horrific, and even horrific events in homes. But if there is a tagline for the film poster but for the loss of a houseboat, it must 'come to the conclusion that such a thing ...', which I have ever seen, is the worst Australian horror movie that does not mention the worst horror. I've ever seen movies, and generally a tremendous effort to create the film. The good news is, it's so bloody horror, it sails straight through the humorous zone in the strange sunny world of viewers. It's valuable to see * Cause * It's bloody horror. The worst story does not come from the story; the simple reason is actually one: a record producer, a movie crew and a rock band shoots a music video in Victoria (true Lake Alejandro ) Somewhere a mysterious rural retreat, which runs visually named Lake Infinity. Someone is not particularly happy to see them there, and probably tries to please the audience, with a sharp knife, each other closes. Even more mysteriousness is to see how much the survivors are actually doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very annoying young man, intolerant old, obscure local (one of whom, serving petrol station, easily won a Guru's competition) has got and face it, my description of the killer could easily be Jason Bhurishis. Ah, but if the performance and production values ​​are closer to comparative superiority than Friday, 13th part VII. Unfortunately, the houseboat is completely inefficient. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it makes just ridiculous and ridiculous. Once upon a time, the talk of 'Late Show' and 'Get This' member Tony Martin will be aware of the original dialogue gems ('see the scene ... you stop!') When it is so bad to believe that accompanying real music music videos is so bad - Writer / director Oli Wood hopes that I will not be surprised if this will actually hit. The awful ingredient is comparable. I think the B-slashes of the style, and especially for the time, but there was a time when someone could not help watching Hamburger's off-screen and trying to see the Tomato sauce spray on the wall. On the screen <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you recommend this picture as ridiculous junk like me, I do not think you'll be disappointed. It should not pass any 'bad-to-good' awful chance of any fan. Although you will not 'bar up' or else matter On the other hand, if you are looking for the ultimate superiority in the Australian horror style, you will find yourself a copy of 'Long Weekend' and do not look back.
