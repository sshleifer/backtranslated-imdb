I saw 'EV' at two nights, at the friends of friends in the DVD. The film's consistency is quite charming, with many potentials in a comedy Jack Black and Ben Stiller, but fails to deliver it completely. I saw almost five friends and nobody laughs for the whole picture. The trick (which is less and far away) is not funny in any way ... The line of the story is painful, and they never answer this question ... where is the SH? Of course no one is CARES. This film lacks some kind of comedy quality, and some other users have said that looking after Christopher Walken as a jetty-man is the only thing. No letters are developed, the plot is so thin it's almost transparent - and this song is supposed to be funny all over the world ??
