Let's say it in simple language so that even the filmmakers can understand it: it's even a dumbar script, lam animations and a story that's just like thumbtex. Do not disturb - unless you have to find ways to entertain a mentally retarded adult or group of very slow children. They may laugh, especially if they stop their meds. This movie is a special kind of humiliation - the filmmakers simply do not think that children are foolish fools who can often entertain themselves with a clapperap for zero effort, but they do not bother to add a sweat, an adult can be ridiculous that there's a joke here and there . This picture, really, closed me royally. Sham on you for so little stooping
