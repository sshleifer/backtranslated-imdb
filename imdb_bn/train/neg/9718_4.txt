A silly person (Steve Guttenberg) has a night stand with his boss wife (Isabel Hooper). He is attacking outside a woman (Elizabeth McGavron) but she can not call the police because it will kill Gutenberg's horse (Paul Shenara) on her marriage. So Gutenberg, he is an honest citizen, when he discovered that another woman was attacked and killed just hours after the attack, she came forward and claimed to be the witness of the first attack, expressed her desire to send only Hupperts information. Well - do not bear false testimony against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> A murderer quickly wanders to kill this simple ordinary policeman. When he met with McGwen's first victim, he was immediately about to happen, but agreed to remain silent at the moment. But then Gutenberg found himself in court, to identify heavy (Greenwich) and through cross-examination he discovered that he can not identify close and sightable places, face alone. (This is not important because, after all, he did not see the creep in the first place.) The plot became functionally confusing. During the murder of Huppert, Gutenberg gave the main suspect to the wind. <br /> <br /> He just escaped and torn away with sympathetic McGwen. Gutenberg and McGoughon plan to trap the murderer. She will serve as a bite. They will follow a fraudulent crap in their wicked hunt and McGwen will behave like this killer, who will try to kill him. But everything will be all right, see, because Gutenberg will not only keep an eye on him and he will alert the police just minutes after entering the dive, but he will work easily in the mail - just <br /> <br /> <br /> I You're asking, the warning demonstrator, does this look as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has a quirkily attractive bone structure. He thinks all the mandible and tiny face repeatedly, but he is vibrant. Steve Gutenberg has his Brian hair and that's about it. Otherwise he plays as the character he plays. If you can work in Isabella, then this film is not clear. The killer is so fabricated and so beautiful that he seems to be wearing one of the masks of the twilight zone episode about greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Director, Curtis Hanson, did not go to create "LA Confidential"? That was a nicely worked piece of work. Here, everything seems overwhelming and narrow, part of the small bit below. Just before the inevitable violent measurement, a uniform police officer was presented to delay the rescue of McGower, and it was embarrassing to see the scene. Dick Olsen has a bit part as a late customer. He is a handsome man and always reliable. Paul Chenner is an attractive face shown as a helpless husband who is produced in phases and he works well. <br /> <br /> Couple of hairy apes, North Carolina, was shot at a bar in Carolina Beach, far from where I lived. The way to set up the interior, it is clear that it is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive. Indeed it seems rather more elegant on screen than reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is tears in the eye to visualize Hitkoc region and what it has done with this story.
