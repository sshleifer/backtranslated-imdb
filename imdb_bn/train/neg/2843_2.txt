Oh yes, Sakura killers are a fool, horrible ninja movie, no mistake. But it's an incredibly enjoyable one. This is thanks to the wonderful appearance of a Chuck Connor, which is billed as a role in the film, but in fact it only gets illuminated in some scenes. I think he is supposed to be an OB van Kunni type ("Hard Nyan-Buster", box copy exclaims), but his 'knowledge' is ridiculous. "Remove without thinking" ??? My friend says that it is a sign of mental retardation, not of the utmost attention. <br /> <br /> But really, her two associates, Sony and Dennis, have such a terrific dialogue that Brooklyn, we call the colonel, shy of comparison. Especially for Dennis's 'Genetic Splicing' Sequoas looked into the sequence. If you know something about cloning you will die laughing. And yes, this is a major plot point, folks. <br /> <br /> A horror movie, Sakura killers have a hard-to-read mine. For Sakura killers it will not ruin the ending "tactics" for you, except for a perfect set. Very bad choke cones died :-( Because there is the easiest way to blame him.
