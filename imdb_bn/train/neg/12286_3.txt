The essence provided by my cable TV guide is a lot more interesting than it actually sounds. "Slaughterhouse Rock" by the worst horror movie that I have ever seen, previously held a title "Urban Legend: Final Cut". From its first scene I could say it's going to be really bad, but I was too bored that I could not care less. This movie has a humorous performance, especially a man who feels pain in his dreams, is incredible as a trustworthy plot twist and some great music I've heard, and I live in a time when Britney Spears and Nsync air waves dominate. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is not funny. A movie as a frustrating and annoying and will not be so scary that it will try to spice up with some interesting one-liners here and there, but not. We tried to be funny, Guy's self-centered friend tormented, but came across rather annoying. (spoiler) and please, tell me, insane and self-sufficient enough to visit a vague prison in the middle of the night in this insane world? Nobody! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it credible. This one but nothing but
