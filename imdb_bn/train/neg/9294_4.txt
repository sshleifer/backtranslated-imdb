In the incredible visual scenes of "Hero", whoever was scattered, I was interested in seeing this movie, which was billed alongside the same line, but better. It's an actress I like: Zia Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both the numbers. I bought this movie's DVD invisible, and it was a mistake. It was not good. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movies of Flying-The-D-Air-Marshal martial arts are genuine but this story has expanded from remote distant places, it only makes me disbelieved in frustration. . A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that's a little away. Also, the main male character 'Jean' (Tekshi Kanaseiro) was so annoying with her conversation, her stupid face and stupid smile on her face, she also spoiled the film. <br /> <br /> Amazing action scenes in spite of wonderful color, this story - to me - there is no appeal to create a film owned by it. This movie is not a "hero"!
