I went to the expectation that it was a "thought provoking" little gem reviewed by people. I love the indie film and hope very nicely. I really know such a hot button, I'm really looking forward to entertaining, even seeing an external perspective. <br /> <br /> I can say that wow! .... If you have your own torture, or separation, you will love it personally I do not want to beat myself or spend it so I think it was trash. Bad scripts, bad acting, bad stories, bad directions, bad editing .... I could go. I have no criticism why a critic has claimed that he is making a political point with this film 10. It's confusing and unidentified. IMDB is not an example placed for a movie! It just seems to other people that it is okay to see a garbage bomb like this being controversial (this is not the film, it is tough but fails). <br /> <br /> When you are praying in 15 minutes that the movie is bad, all the major characters die horribly. Unfortunately they die, but in the painful behavior the spectators have not shown any justice or justification, so that they only see two hours of rest. <br /> <br /> Make a favor on your behalf, and do not even bother. I got this movie in a durbar in my local video store. For 50 and I felt!
