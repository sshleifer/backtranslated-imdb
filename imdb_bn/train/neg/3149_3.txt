An independent filmmaker and Edward D. Wood Jr. is a huge fan. I believe in this documentary that at the end, how the gift was really gifted and bright Ed Wood would determine the direct record. <br /> <br /> What I got was a confusing set of frustrating self-centered, contradictory, bitter self-enriching. <br /> <br /> Where people remember Ed Wood Jr., people actually remember the second cousin of the man with a fake tape, who knew someone from the plane nine outside the space? <br /> <br /> It seems, Ed Wood has a new interest, these people have come out of "woodwork" work! Only those who take the vowel of money for someone who really gives them opportunities when no one else! After 50 years I suggest that these people have not been promised their 75 dollars, they can avoid this fact! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew about entertainment. Actually he lived for that. You can be frustrated when you see Ed's movie, but you know how you laugh with him and do not know him. <br /> <br /> But, I gotta ... come back to the film in hand. If you are Edward D. Wood Hope hopes for a movie but you will not find it here. If you want a movie about the rude nasty old actors, this is the movie for you!
