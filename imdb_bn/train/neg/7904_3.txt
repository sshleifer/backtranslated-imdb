Spooky foam and reproducing themselves that weird looking little boogers. So far for the horror-elements of this movie The rest of the actors actually act as a boring comedy which is so stupid that it will not be fun after 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids for little kids, but only the supposed "smart" references to adults will be released, such as being translated to the on-screen staff at Captain Kirk's log entries from the Stat tray, it is the most well-known scene from ET. Embarrassed statement from filmmakers "Look! We are monetizing here on Grameenphone!" And Clint Eastwood's cardboard cutout tells us ... what exactly is its western movies? That last got completely lost on me ... oh yeah, and the discovery of the chemical disintegration of the cave seems to be a bad thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Really fool And if you manage to manage a smile crack, you'll probably feel silly to do this after the film's completion. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes, but only "fool", "boring" and "ridiculous" if you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, ohm, 6/10.
