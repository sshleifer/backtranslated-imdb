Often Europe begins the war of World War II, until the end of the war, Hollywood (with significant growth from the government) produces a number of movies, which were designed to give young people the opportunity to enter the army. Serviceman appears "cool." It is meant by the most sloppiest, the work of a soldier's life is in vain, you get good food, and you hear Ann Mills radio all day long. I'm too young to participate in WWII, but I think there was more than that. <br /> <br /> I think that by 1943, Sivvid's most naïveté even knew that going abroad is far more than the mad Hijinaks pictured abroad. Although I am sure that it was seen as feathered entertainment, I would not be surprised that the family and loved ones of the men fighting in the war were surprised or disappointed by the sacrifices of their loved ones.
