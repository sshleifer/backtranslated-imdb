For the sake of my life, I do not understand the blind faith and devotion of this completely incredible movie ... and I think I have the ability to say this .... I have a special operation soldier "Life Style" in 14 years ... this film is completely complete It was unrealistic and obviously someone wrote, who did very little research in the army, in war or at the team or platoon level. <br /> <br /> Three Eid turns around Baghdad ????? Get real ... any chain of commands ????? Get Real ... EOD Clearing Building ??? Get Real ... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Eligible Rouge Sergeant ???? Become real ... wait ... I shot a bad guy and then shot two people and shot them without injuring the other shot ???? Be realistic .... I've hosted an Iraqi civilian when I was armed with only 9 million people, entered into other citizens' homes, his wife went crazy, and then returned to the camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night. So as a scratch or conflict ???? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> In contrast to this poor film, the EOD men and women are totally incredible and disrespectful, they are incredibly hard work for highly qualified professionals but not wild adrenaline for Yahoo.
