Infinitely more of a torn rip off of "Murderer, He Writes", it is quite surprising that this poorly written garbage is going on for eight years. I'm sure that this stranger who saw most of the people in their sixties and seventeen years and had nothing to do with them because their old Dick van Dike just seemed to be the star from the show. Van Dyke did not make his career the best (in his own career) in the 1960s and he was too old to play a doctor before the series started in 1993. He looks completely old. Chain smoking and heavy drinks year results. His gifted real-life son Barry, a wooden actor, who rarely had been involved with his father, played his son in the series.
