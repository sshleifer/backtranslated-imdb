Although I totally disagree with a critic, who described Charlie Chase as obscure, in this film he must It's embarrassing, because I think another reviewer must have seen some Charie Chase Doos and said that the man was not funny. A sunny-like movie is like a Mus√©e and what's the price GOODY? Very good Chase film, so she could be really fun to be fun. Unfortunately, in this film he was given absolutely nothing. Even the best Oliver Hardy is not included as a foil because the main foundation (the boy wants to marry the girl but the girl's father thinks that the boy is a mess) and the gags are so poor. It's embarrassing because I really wanted to love this movie but could not. <br /> <br /> For the people who used to look for Charlie's appearance from the mid-1920s, you would be very surprised to see Chase Sports as no glasses or torch - and you'd expect to look very little.
