I saw the cabin by the lake this afternoon in the US. Creating this movie for TV was interesting enough to see a sigell. So, I made the melody for airing this evening and was extremely disappointing. I knew I did not like the movie, but I did not expect to be confused by using DV (Digital Video). If these soft digital shots do not seem to come from anywhere, the film may be endorsement. I expected to be tied with this shot in the plot line, but there seems to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: A speaker of the following mail !!!!) The open end of the cabin by the lake was acceptable, but the open end of the signal was ridiculous. I only see that the cabin is returning to the returning lake, if the film is not shown in any way but it is shown at 4 am in the ad.
