Good Lord, anyone who needs to burial alive in this Turkey made I'm sorry, but another critic has not seen this movie, he must be watching something else, or have never seen a movie before ... among the 9 of the 9? What is he saying, like Ben Hurey was so good or wind? Strangely funny, incredibly incredible characters, unreasonable circumstances, it seems to be shot in the griffith park (which works quite well - shot in Muffy Griffith Park), scared scripts, it seems that maybe almost all of a rolling movie might be wrong with a package In between As an example of how a film might be mistaken for mistakes, all potential filmmakers should be needed to look for it. It reminds me of something a U.Sc student could do for a film class. <br /> <br /> If you do not get the medication and do not have high camps, then pass it.
