This got one of the worst movies I've ever seen! People were leaving the theater, others were asleep (okay, this was a late night show) ... This is an unknown movie, who does not want to show you the mainstream picture again. I want to see this movie brutally because I am interested in the deep interest of such junk writers. Do they smile by making this ridiculous thing or do they think they're doing something interesting? I'm surprised ... soundtrack is a bit awkward element that reminds you of the previous winner album than that. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay at home. The best thing to do. There is no reason to go outside and store yourself in this torture, in a little, short, beautiful music piece. God! ...
