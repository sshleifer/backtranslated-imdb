What a poor excuse for making New Zealnd movie When this movie exists and I'm currently playing a game in New Zealand Satellite TV (August 2006), I'm ashamed to call myself a new Newlander. The cast is made up of a large number of local soap large. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travels daily between two main islands and even the company's logos (dolphins) in all the sets, including the fan funnel. Ships are supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the United States and Mexico. This is a clear sign of rust and old age, but it can be a luxurious ship on its first ride. One of the scenes is the snow-clad peak of New Zealand's southern island in the background for God's sake! The United States / Mexico area must have very cold time! The story is weak, the acting weakens and New Zealand / American signs just do not work. I hope New Zealand's taxpayers have contributed to the production cost of this film and this is the costly money waste in real production. I know high school kids from New Zealand who can make better movies with their cell phones. Cave: There is a truck with tagging on it and they can prevent the signature of the Taco company on the truck's door, perhaps it seems to be American. But some of the marks are at the top of tagging - you think they have noticed it in the Propose section before connecting it. I love to go but it is not worth the pain in any way.
