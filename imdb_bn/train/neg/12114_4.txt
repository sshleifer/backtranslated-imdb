Strangers living in a city go about their life. There are people who loot everything, a dumpster diver who finds a body to live with her, a crazy girl like a doll in a garment like that, who wants to clean girls in her wicked way ... extreme, black and white movies This shot color is better with the outside. Monochrome takes the edge of the movie home from two feet to two feet. Like a tromba film, this movie is fun and fun to start but most are curious for its birds and soon it becomes a crashing bore, since you have seen the set up which you can guess that is going to be a long time - not always - but enough fun Not enough. (Although I'm not clear). If you do not have anything to see, the shot is valuable and you are waiting for the next set of golden girls from Netiffs.
