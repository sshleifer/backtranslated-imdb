I could have used this low budget movie for the first twenty minutes. The most shining ignorance was that the American prisons of North Korean Pound camps were all serious deprivation of food and medicine, without bathing, flying in snowy and dirty floors and going to sleep on bare floors and - do not let lasting torture - they always handle ruthlessly coiffed hair sport. Excluding Harry Morgan, properly watching the army as a Major, Casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Reagan does not seem to be portraying a single character, and instead instead of the past roles, instead of creating a schizophrenic scholar. Most Caucasian customs depicted in the North Korean camp officer can be forgiving, but when Russian officials are working as an advisor to Koreans, the Nazi uniforms with full nets and jacoboots often revolve around (obviously rebuilding the clothing department from WWII Flickr) and Hogan's heroes. From the words of General Burkhalter, Saying, okay, it's six kind of silly. Do not waste your time on this one.
