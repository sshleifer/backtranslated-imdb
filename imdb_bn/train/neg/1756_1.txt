Burners (so reported) for a couple of years, this television reunion started badly in the beginning of the history of the most beloved characters in the history of Seitikom - and went straight to the straight path from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Roda Morganstein (Valerie Harper) joined the New York after a long rebellion and lived each other. What a novel idea! But, relating to sadness, it's worth not to talk about (about making a movie) Interference in the year has happened to any of them. So, instead, the content of the script itself picks up multiple old plot devices (most often work with older women in the workplace), whereas the curiosity that creates the original shot and the sophistication is completely absent. Supporting cast is immediately forgotten, not ridiculous, and chemistry that has left Murray and Harper together. Moore suspended the charge for several years, waiting to see "correct script" before establishing itself. If it were considered "right" then how was it that they were on earth? It is not the age of letters that it (in course of time, continues with time), but the complete lack of imagination vaguely ignores the elements of the series. At one time it was intended as a pilot, but perhaps, it probably failed to create any interest in potential sponsors. Or in that case, in the potential audience. Rapid and kindly forgotten, the film is a mockery and a classic insult.
