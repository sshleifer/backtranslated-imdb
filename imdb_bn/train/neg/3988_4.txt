In short: <br /> <br /> There's definitely a lot of him in Spike Lee. He is concerned about racism, alphabetic, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexuality, 'discrimination-sexism', politics of drug warfare etc. <br /> <br /> I think it is a blessing that our everyday life is choosing more people to test critics; The silent and invisible forces operating in our society. However, Lee did not make her a good film-maker because of the controversial filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Surveillance on the socio-political forces that happened in "jungle fever". This is mainly the result of two major failures: <br /> First, Lee is trying very easily. He seems to be trying hard to accommodate each political / social statement that can think in 90mins. And as a result, the end result seems confusing and irrational because he does not give himself time to develop such characters that can fulfill the expectations of completely presenting. And so he exhausts stereotypes and we have rushed testimonies and left with very loaded dialogs. The end result is very stupendous and unrealistic Second, there is no concrete or original explanation of the social / political issues of his presence, trying to make a statement about such different social activities. What comes across is a thrust of regurgitated senses. You think that he bought a primary level sociology textbook and found out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are extremely problematic features because the artists of the film are dedicated and converted to loudspeakers for this purpose. Filmmaker voice He can not move himself away from work and speak for himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </
