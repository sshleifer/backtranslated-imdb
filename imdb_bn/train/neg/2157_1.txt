Seychelle and Ebert were very horrific in the show that you agreed with them or because of their actual conflict their individual opinions were created. Ruper took the shot two or two downwards because he was not really a film critic, and he replaced graduation for consideration. Now, when Ben Lions arrives, I think I see "Tin News" - you know, kids news shows, kids hosted by kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is clear that they have encountered only a steady diet in mainstream film of their entire life. These two rank amateurs do not seem to have any idea about the speed or consequences of the speed. They are reviewing a source movie, they are completely lost. Show them their original and intelligent - they simply find it "confusing". Wait - I think I found it ... owned by ABC Disney ... Disney creates movies for kids. Siskel, Ebert and Ruper's independent films were broadcasted and were only hit-miss-misses with big budget studio production - it was amazing: these two prefer studio studios and manage to tolerate only a few of the Indies. Plus everyone is known for age TV advertisers. The harmful nepotism is icing on the cake. Are these guys in an alternative universe worthy of film critics?
