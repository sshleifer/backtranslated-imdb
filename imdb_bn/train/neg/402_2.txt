Inappropriate to describe this film as garbage. Rooting through at least garbage can be a drying hobby. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The story of the mad scientist of 'Hall Man' has been told earlier, it has been said that without much ridiculously expensive special effects it has been said. Most of the special effects of <br /> <br /> seem to be built around. You can buy men, women and dogs in clever physiological dolls in the seventeenth century. In the UK, they were sold as 'The Transparent Man', which is probably the title of this movie. <br /> <br /> Shining special effect, scary script, unexplained plot. <br /> <br />
