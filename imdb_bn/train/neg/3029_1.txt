From the first moment, this "thing" unclear camera work is a terrible sequence of extremely short cuts. The overall plot has every possible potential for a thriller, but the story is so bad that I can not afford it. From the film, the characters do not understand the verb. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea is that under Edna's alleged experience of making coffee for them to stop her son's hand! It's just a very stupid idea. Domino Clermont does not ask about the growing orders obtained through a breaking-phone phone connection from Williams, only to me; Should Williams not be suspicious about moving around them? Those FBI agents think of their minds only with a single helicopter that has every reason to consider their capital mafia shooting-out. Besides, maintaining and maintaining information on the signals and leaking what they do is much more provocative in the killing. It seems like the departure of my trial if they do this by investigating the FBI. In fact, if they act like this, they hated a case even after repairs. We see a car crash, which is usually severely injured if it does not kill most passengers, but only to release all of them with some rage. On the contrary, the accident immediately creates love for Domino Choko, which is not established by the previous incidents from Domino's perspective, but only in the twinkling of an eye. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Combined with the work of this awful, helpless camera makes hesitation to make a movie call. I am sorry for the humiliating efforts of the main actors, whose merit is not in question.
