This picture is the portrait of Benjamin, half-uncle who is going to board boarding school because of the Lausi mark of Math. He never got good experience in life and got serious self-esteem problems. After a rough start in his new school, he began to make friends, loved a girl and stuffed some American pic teenager. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is called very serious, focusing on Benjamin and its problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not already like this story outline, save your time and see something else. If you do, please be aware of the following: <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he makes it a terrible mistake and then he always goes for self-pity. For me he is not such a "charmed man" who can feel sympathy and laugh at you. Instead, he and his behavior really bothered me and in my own teen years I was very lagging behind. <br /> <br /> 2) The film is actually trying to be realistic and the story I think is not just the characters experience (except Janosch). And yes, I know this movie is based on a 17-year-old self-living - but I have some experience with the German school and German youth, I do not trust her. <br /> <br /> Showing sex awakening is really an important thing for a photo in this regard. But I suspect that teenage boys "quarreling with a cookie" -bangala where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation and after the damage the sperm-gourmet cookie will be eaten. Although it enjoys me annoyingly, it is not funny and is not based on the serious effort of this photo. <br /> <br /> 4) Benjamin's family and his father betray his wife. I do not know why it is and where to put it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, however, that some people that I can image can understand it and touch it. If you like "another sister" you probably also like it. I hate both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys do not have to write an autobiography and if they do, it does not seem to be the best idea to get it out of a film. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2.
