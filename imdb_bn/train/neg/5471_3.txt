Typical Troma-trash, this smutty 80's flick was released one year ago "The Toxic Avenger" as well as Lloyd Kaufman's "Highlights" of the notorious production studio. If you ask me, "The toxic avenger" is much more impressive, but this deprecated splatter-flick is still durable. Just make sure you leave the door to your full brain capacity. The events are held in Tromwell, which is a proud city that claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and they are certainly not lying. The safety warnings of the local nuclear power plant are poor (even Homer Simpson never had this nonsense) and toxic waste to reach nearby high school. The first drug addiction is Stereototypical Nerd, which starts spreading green stuff out of all the cavities of his body, but his death is considered an accident because he did not have two microwave oven at his house! Ah! Humanity! Soon after, nuclear leaks affect school's weed planting and start to become really dirty. After a group smoking a group, the most expensive couple in the school settled in the basement and created a huge pest monster that feeds on teenage skam. The "Nuclear Class of Heat" is the ultimate delivery filmmaker, the dialogues are so stupid that they hit your ear and the effects of which upset the word completely new money. You enjoy watching obsessed molt away, being half-crushing or splitting, this must certainly see a must! In contrast to the previous "The Toxic Resistant", some of these films are truly neutral and are suffering from too much moments, in which something really notable happens, for example, when Chris and Warren tried to understand what was wrong between their hormones. Crude Humor is not as effective as "poisonous revenge" and acting performance illogical amateur. If you are a warm troma-fanatic just go ahead.
