My girlfriend picked this one; As a South born and raised African American I found this movie's plot without credibility and found firmly. Believing that class and racial prejudices will be so easily and conveniently postponed, only the ex-bellamas will be completely unfamiliar with the south. Completely stupid !!! I'm surprised to see a good actress like Harry Keitel, and a good actress like And McDowell (who knows better than the south), in this meeting.
