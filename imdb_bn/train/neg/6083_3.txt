We want two types of movies (1) western, and (2) movies 30 or 40 years ago. We should prefer a man called Sledge; But <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is disrespectful, annoying and stupid from end to end. Since there is no one to warm up in the story (good or bad), so there is no one to encourage the secret to the viewer's interest. There are no camera cameras that are not trying to steal gold, and those who try to save it. Sledge has a beautiful girl friend, but there is no reason why she slobbers on any person or why she'd be in the same room with single pig on this account. <br /> <br /> The picture also suffered from an intrusion and the score of stupid musical instruments, and by Vick Morrow very bad writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Among the last 30 old films rented from NetFix or Video Vault, this rock was below, the only true bud of bunch.
