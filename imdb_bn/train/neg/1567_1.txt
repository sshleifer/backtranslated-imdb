I had to change my view on the worst movie in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> True story). Dreadful acting (what Judge Reinhold thought was) incredibly bad stunts. Child dialogue Non-existent continuation. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
