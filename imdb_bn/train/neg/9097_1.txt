Actually this piece has made it the worst movie of my life which is the time and money waste. I hate how they make less budget signals by combining the same story, like the De-Luster actor and the first story. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting beside the thunders of floods in this film, getting into deaf and dying for Supermodels for $ 2.99. What might I think of a fool that might actually be good, instead I saw hatred as bad story stereotypes story from the first story And the script ripped. <br /> <br /> Anyone thought that direct-to-video production was half a decent movie that you need to crack or something because I think this movie sees most people feel shaky load!
