First off, I have no ideas on how to make this movie big screen. It's even a low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just awful. Me and my friends who love Action Movie, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, Lotro etc., I found this movie to expect this movie, Dragon, a transformer with stupid entertainment. We all got a stupid hour and a half. I was not so bad as the CGT was bad, but the plot was so horrific that it was created for it. It's basically a Chinese crazy dragon that returned every 500 years ... like the good repetition of fire rains? No, I'll try to make the plot deeper, it's not just holes, but a little real war between magic and dragon (rather big snake) it just gets ridiculous. The director failed to join the movie which is a bit addictive. I and my friend laughed through the whole thing (along with the audience all 5), and believe we did not spend money on this. The short trailer on the TV is mostly made for action and the crap rests. I have seen many B movies like Rephilioan, Cave, Spider and others, but if you do not want to laugh for an hour, say this, see this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 Cgi: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but it helped before watching this movie
