Oh dear! Seldom a "horror" movie disturbed me, or smiled me, as much as this one. After an induced start with an intriguing court, it descends into much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. Generally nice alice crease is broken into this one, and the plot twists are ridiculous. Do not bother until you are really frustrated. Ratings: 3/10
