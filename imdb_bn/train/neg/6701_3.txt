I have been an environmentalist for years and were really looking forward to this show. I thought it was set to record all episodes, because I thought I could really learn some great new things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps a second show that really serious about the environment would be a good idea. Some things below are not necessary for us. <br /> <br /> I do not record episodes or see the show, but let me know if there is a real green show in the work.
