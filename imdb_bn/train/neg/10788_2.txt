And I mean ultra light. There are four giant stars, about one and a half jokes and nothing else. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this stinger, though it's a bit better bit, it's not the most fun. No it all works as a romance. How as a romantic comedy? Not in your life Most conversations are very sophisticated, very rich to be sophisticated. <br /> <br /> Really hopelessly not bad? This movie can be so much, especially with the latest focus on which movies are being broadcasted, with the most recent focus, completing Phoenix quotes from critics. The film unveils the non-excavated area of ​​Press Junket - journalists who often travel all their expenses to write excellent reviews. But instead of discovering that Jokes should be the mother tongue, it spreads about three minutes in this region and goes ahead in search of film hair romance. <br /> <br /> Catherine is similar to Jeta-Jones. Character - Sticky, self centered movie star. JETO-JONES does a good job with his work, but he does not really give anything. It looks very pale in comparison to some of the homogenized junk which has been heard about big for years. Finally, it is difficult to understand that Jet-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign the ship on the ship, which sinks like a repetition of "love boat". Indeed, when the old joke went, they forgot the script and the deal was heard. It's probably a good story to make So, go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have in these stars to attend these stars?
