All right, so I'm dying to see this movie. In the horror of this film "Who's Who?", His friend, my friend has rented this, brought it, and we started to see it. It is supposed to be a comedy .... I do not even smirk even until the mark of 40min. <br /> <br /> do it with the budget? Actually, there actually is a movie that does not stop at all, and they are amazing (whatever it is for me). Also, while watching this movie, I could not help but understand the similarity of a low-budget indie film titled "Acta's Acoplipes" (i.e., stealing), I read my review about this (this film cuts BTW). <Br /> <br /> This image ... it was really possible. This is the "Star Power", the theft plot (behind the scenes of the movie creation scene ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, that makes me feel more strongly), ... it was really fun. Many, curiosity is a very flat. Acting is okay for it. But it pulled up, was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I gave it two, because it was Sue Awful, but this is the only reason.
