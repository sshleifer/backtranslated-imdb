Here are no spoilers but I have been a fan since the Watch The Dead started but the last series, which has only been so horrible to so far 3. The original ideas of the series of stories bear no similarity. I have found the jaw joke of the last series of this series 3. As a BBC Licensor, after the ceremony, I filed BBC complaints for my frustration. I am surprised that Trevor Eve and Sue Jonstone did not object to the story line actors. This actor has been with this character for the 8th season, surly they can see it lost in all aspects. This could be a good job, with the final series or the next series of the investigation of the death of Father Christmas, with the team! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
