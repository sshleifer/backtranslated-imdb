You do not expect a movie like this, and it does not. It is a budget, highly spoiled zombie movie impressed with a bad looking hand held camera ... and it's lovely. The actor has obviously played before and it shows their terrible delightful readings. There is no plot to meet. I could find that the little plot ran a government test and a group of zombies might think that a couple seems to be terrorists in the family. The effect of Gore is actually the most sick thing I've ever seen. It seems that people have bought a slaughterhouse for all parts of the body, and in many scenes it involves breaking people and eating their organs. This is a funny and sick movie, and it can get you as bad as any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / **** 90 minutes
