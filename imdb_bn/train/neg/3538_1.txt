3 years ago, after seeing "powered" on an airplane flight in America, I really believed that I saw the worst movie I ever made, and I could be safe in front of any screen that I could never afford. Unfortunately this case was not as I found last night. Revolver is such a terrible bad I'm actually thinking about going to friends and recommending, so I do not think I'm fool enough to show it. It's really amazing how much of the film falls constantly on his face, and I mean that Constant Voice Overs of the original characters are completely insane spooky fools! I was actually getting angry with the movie to remind me of Andrei Benjamin's half-film, when I thought it all the time - what would the Turkic gangster / Con Man do with this full copper, when he made his "proposal"? What i say to you He said to him, ** ** will be closed, his head swollen, and as far away as with his disrespectful partner, he will carry the small legs of his whip. I mean we're going to believe when they were going through Jack's head, they solved their problem? They are men, so they must have the skills to cure bloody diseases! I mean FFS. He did not start thinking why his symptoms are not bad? Instead of Revie, the penny drop is happening on the third day, forcing viewers to make a phone call from Avili to a painful patron so that she is informed that she has been purified. <br /> <br /> However, I can add a small positive note in the film as I proceed to dry smile, if it shows gratitude for the similarity of the previous movie ????. Bull's ** tons! This film does not try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some good time fun track, oh no. Is it somehow directed to be so devious that we do not really listen as a titter from a completely packed movie ?? And anyone who knows Sheffield's UGC knows how big the main screen is, and 1 person is not sunny. Maybe he never wanted to make the movie fun, and enough you can create good gangster movies besides comedy, but what does he plan to leak in this film? Unnecessary annoying plot! I do not sincerely hope <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said how fast it was watching patronage and they realized that they were dashing to understand what they had ended and they were free from their pain ! <br /> <br /> I'll close this round (I'm going to end, I'm getting angry again for writing) "end" I mean s ** End ?? No, sorry, I can not, you just have to go and see it. It can not be placed in words, it can not fix it, and you can find out why. Wow Crying ??
