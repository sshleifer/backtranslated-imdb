This movie reminds me of many films from the 60's decade drug, because it was created by a person who apparently did not feel their social evil, which they warned us. Tom Hendz and his friends "play the role", but there are no birds, many candles, and then you are moving away from a bad mood, which looks to Hanks to fall for this party's lady. Quite funny but confused. I wonder how poorer kids have destroyed their D & D material, and their imagination used to be the road to destruction. As a movie, it is essentially a school special, bad performance (though Hong Kong shows some talent) and talks about relationships and does not seem to be funny. It seems that adults of these movies have psychological focus in the path of adult psychology, which is apparently more serious, and you need to leak and do things for others. Despite my 2 votes, it is worth watching for its unique style, awesome movies, which I personally find funny.
