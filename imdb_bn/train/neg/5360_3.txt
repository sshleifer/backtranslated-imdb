Divive actress ("La Bell Equipe" "Panic"), Vivian Romance, was lost as a madam (Gabriel). Italian actors (Fabio Tasti, Lou Castel) are awful. <br /> <br /> With the "Nada" it is the second time the brutal inspiration for Chabrol. It was "Violette Nozi√®res" before he was again at the top of his game.
