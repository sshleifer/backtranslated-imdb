What a terrible movie Rotten Tomato was also a good rating for this. Not fooled by positive comments; It was not terrible. It was not funny. It was not tricky. It will not even hold your attention. I just lost 2 hours of my life watching this shag-festival. The giant created computer was interesting to see the first couple times. It was no longer entertained after about 15 minutes. The dialogue was terrible, would be a translation thing. Another negative that stood out was stupid Americans. 3 were portrayed and they all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now we need 10, so I will write a few lines. The video shoppers have crushed me to bring this title to the counter.
