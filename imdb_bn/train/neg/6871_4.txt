A great idea has gone wrong. Poor performance, even bad writing. After being the first two episode observers, I was wondering why it was made sometime in the season. Characters are forgettable, poor to write, set OK. Special effects are only tragic - much better done at the same time frame - where is this money going? The first episode starts to be attractive and then quickly rises - the principle of the whole show is simply silly. Now do not mistake me, I'm a huge sai-fi fan and 'gaik' - but this show is not cutting it alone. As I said at the beginning, I was really surprised that it did two in the season - it was canceled only after one season (for example Jake 2.0). This show was just bad.
