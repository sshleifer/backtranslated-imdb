First of all tell me the first 20 minutes is fantastic, the demon looks fantastic and CGI is done reasonably. It is a shame that the rest of the movie is so frustrating, <br /> <br /> ******** below Spirit ******** <br /> <br /> This movie is not visible to American film Usually this kind of stereootiping will not bother me (we got enough from Broad Hollywood) but it is not fine about making America's brain dead. It goes from the point of view of reality and your left is wondering if any yank director has raped the director. <br /> <br /> The tragic scene was really poor and part of the movie where it started to go downhill. <br /> <br /> Here we introduce the Olympic Medalist's Extraterrestrial and Drunk Uncle who started walking in the memorials and blaming the father for the death of the girls, then they all hit him before he started to roam around. Very rarely realistic ties in crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole virus problem is ridiculous. Americans know if there is no virus, why are they searching for time, money and wealth? American government agents do not order innocent Korea's brain surgery, (or stupid), thinks Americans are cross-eyed for a ridiculous effect, this does not help. <br /> <br /> Movie is about giant hunting. US and Korean special forces were appointed to find animals but they disappeared through filming. The whole family is the only family to kill the monster in Korea and some random trams that come to save on the end of the day! Naturally some US / Korean agents try to stop the road with them. <br /> <br /> The sister was simply included in the movie so that she could eventually create important shots. It was clich√©d, you knew what was going to happen but it did not make all the bugs until that part to make it worse! And my final annoyance, how did that child eventually survive? The giant is swimming for 5 minutes under water! Why did not kids feed the children at the first night?
