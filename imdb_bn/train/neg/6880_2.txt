I was excited to make a documentary if I wanted to be Puerto Rican. When I heard Rashi Perez, I was surprised. Perhaps she knew that it really wants to be Puerto Rican? As far as I knew .... She was a New York. However, I sat anxiously with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 minutes that my initial fear was right. Rossi Perez has a little knowledge about how it feels to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is another 1st hand, it's a New Yorkican and it's all very personal accounts that apply. He (I know almost like the Nuyurians) has a haphazard, partial and sometimes distorted sense of history. (How they can not .. They live here.) Yes, they all are proud. They will be! But in most cases there is little to know about real culture, history and political background or language. It became very clear with his participation in the issue of Wikis. Whatever my personal duty is in this regard ... at least I know what the fight is for. He is being arrested for something to know ... and only participated in it because it is a "Puerto Rican reason" I really do not accept that he does not feel embarrassed at it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please see this as a partial account of a woman's journey to a spontaneity and recognition. Do not accept this as the Gospel ... It's not even true at all. Consider the source. Rosie is an actress; Not a historian. This movie is for other neoconsists, not for their information and should never be. Instead, just one step toward finding more information, learning and debating is the reality. Not just this woman is coming from the eye.
