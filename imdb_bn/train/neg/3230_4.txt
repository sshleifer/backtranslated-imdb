I just finished watching Guinea Pig - The Devil's Test. I did this movie, though being very good FX, well then I did not have a good movie, expected. I can not honestly say that I enjoyed this movie. Of course it is a frustrating, realistic, wicked 43 minute effective on the way of torture, but I found it very annoying (and not as glorious as I expected). And I saw that the abusers were very annoying, when they tried hard to sound and always pronounced, it destroys it even more (and I'm sure there are some people who agree with me). I have now seen Guinea Piegh 1,2,3,5 and the best of my opinion is Guinea Pig 2 - Meat and Blood Flowers. Other than the great Fx I have, test the Devils, the elite acting to the girl, annoying fu ** Trespassers, I give it four because the FX cos they give 4000 stars fairly.
