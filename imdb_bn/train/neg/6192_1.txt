Robert K. Carmichael Great ExstiT all the way bad film. Scripts, slow motion, lack of depth of character, scattering sub-plot, horrific acting, unimportant measurement, I've probably seen this worst movie ever. I have not found anything enjoyable, enjoyable or intelligent in any way. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking the filmmakers are thinking that they are doing something clever and dark, their moody lighting, long prolonged silence and vaguely hunting classical soundtracks. If so, they have completely failed. It just bothered me, and I did not see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs.
