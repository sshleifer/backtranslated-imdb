Rock star John Norman Howard (Chris Christopherson) turned lounge singer Easter Huffman (Barbra Streisand) overnight into singing. People have fallen, Esther's star is growing, thanks for the medicine and alcohol. About two hours later, John did the self-destructive-red-transformable-160-MPH-crack-up-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this movie is music, especially songs, "evergreen." Barbara Strasand does good songs, but when you * before * a star, you can not take him seriously as an up-and-coming star. While coming back to sing for the first time, he looks like an established singer star, who is paying for the night, is not a stranger who is trying to start singing. He is very professional, very confident. His apartment looks like a page like "Apartment Living", where there is no hole-in-wall apartment where a real struggling singer will live. <br /> <br /> Chris Christopherson operates self-centered, out-of-the-center rock star role ... well, an actor who is trying to be an actor but he does not have many acting talents. As the tip touches, the story gradually moves gradually slowly and slowly gradually and gradually gradually, gradually, it gradually goes slowly and slowly. It's hair! After staring for Kristofferson and Streisand's awesome 70's hairstyles for 2 hours, hit your eyes.
