I found the letters mediated and reluctant stories. I did not have to read this book (thankful), or it has been a painful experience. I got a preview ticket for free but it was still not worth my time, or my friend. I'm not saying this story. It's saying that old people have a past before (no fun). The life of the main character was painful, after the mistakes of the fool, after the mistakes were not better than a generation. However, I think actors can do better with a haircut story. I have always been a big fan of Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter positive reviews, unfortunately I firmly believe in trying this film.
