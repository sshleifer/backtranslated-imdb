Disney has done it again. The company that created "Mr. Magu" and "George of Jungle" has created a movie that is similar to that of a cartoon and it does not have any soul of origin. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a kid, and a dream came true for a movie. Now that movie exists, I was seriously disappointed, even angry. <br /> <br /> First we have the letters. <br /> <br /> The gadget has its own gadget that made him a fun character, the original cartoon (with special effects on them), and even some casuals of the original gadget, but now he is more skilled and penny and brain Only expected to solve the crime. <br /> <br /> Penny has a little; He played a major role in the cartoon, invented the crime and closed it and occasionally was captured by MED agents, now he is easily acquainted and forgotten, even though he has at least torn on the basis of clauses. <br /> <Clo The version of Cloeyer, who was a bad, drunken, who used to wear metallic gloves and was sitting on the chair, was hiding his face, as he slapped his cat and watched various crimes. Now he is a bird with only one hand, which has no mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> The brain and mad cat are in the movie, but less than this. <br /> <br /> Even small portions of cartoons are not protected from this slaughterhouse. Famous expression "Wowsers!" Mysteriously changed "Weaver", and gadget gadgetmobiles are now different and talk. <br /> <br /> There are even product approvals everywhere. Why "Yahoo!" A sign advertising? <br /> <br /> Cartoon fans will hate it, others will probably find the movie as below, and when everything is said and done, this film is another attempt to make some quick bucks off of an old show.
