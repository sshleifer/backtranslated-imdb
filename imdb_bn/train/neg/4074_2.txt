I can excite the same excitement as I spit on your pride but I can just call a movie (its kinda a mini porn) how I find it a junk. When I was eating my business, I got sick. It gives a quick jump from any story line to killing it all. If you like to watch women's nude or even men's portions, then there is a stain for the film and there is even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a pornographic and not a movie. I saw some stupid movies in my time but this number 1. I want to be watching it again again. During the film, the actors even feel annoyed, so perhaps they needed money for the film to be produced.
