Twilight Zone has achieved a specific legend about it - like Star Trek. Since there are many dedicated lovers on this event, it does not seem to be the winner of any episode. Each of them displays 10 and does not evaluate the exhibition. For this reason, a while ago I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were very positive. Now, while doing this for the timeline zone. <br /> <br /> Although I've done many episode 10, it got a bad 3 because it was bad. Writing was embarrassingly bad. Two people watched the whole episode on behalf of the opposition in a great war. After a while, it is clear that only two people left the world - as you will learn in a truly stupid and totally incredible conclusion. Usually the punch makes the episode a great one - it kills one!
