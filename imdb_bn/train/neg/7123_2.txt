Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror story was scared by a newlyweds (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) screams screams found in their empty palaces and lily ponds and were scared by her previous memories. Is the husband really trying to insane his already worried bride? Or is she competing to learn Mikey (Alex Nicol), who took care of the mansion since the death of the real gem in the house? This low budget horror flick keeps a story line that involves the end of all of you. Special effects even in 1958 the quality is very bad. I used to cry and cry and cry, Godzilla should be in the film. Reverend Snow is also played as character actor Russ Conway. However ... the director of the hidden gardener (Nicole) film. You can catch it as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
