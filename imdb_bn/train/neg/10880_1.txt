This is the worst movie I ever seen controversially, and I have great appetite for terrible (and good) movies. It (right) can lead a teenage comedy if it consistently shows the pictures of the tongue-cheek-la-la-Rocky Horror, which was really fun. Other movies, Plan Nine out of space, manage to be funny (apparently) trying to be serious. As acting, it seems that they surrounded the dead child in the brain and asked to collect the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alex Guinness. There was a good explanation - old ghoul-busting that broad on motorcycles.
