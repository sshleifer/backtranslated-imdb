What I liked about this movie is that my seat was enough to keep me in the end ... I was thinking that things would be jailed in the next scene ... ... <br /> <br /> Those songs GAN likes to play Van Sant's film - especially after that - perhaps it will be preferred. Personally, I think Van Sant's films are inferior, provocative and strong. Well, he was an executive producer for this movie, so this film can not be made almost by him. But I personally like it better than Van Sant's last attempt (eg elephant). <br /> <br /> Contrary to many, I do not think it was difficult to understand or confuse the film, I think it is a film that wants to portray a particular mood - a teenage mood is gradually moving towards the adult world. Going - but so slowly that change is visible only. But I think that the problem of the film is "Mood" is not enough ... and not only this, but the minded mind here has been wrongly selected for the story. The dream-like quality of nature is closely linked to nature, but it is a mood that is very much for a very small child, which in reality is fully understood to look at nature. , Grass and flowers, spiders etc.). The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summer when I was about eight or nine. A linguist of the film opposed it that it should be a very difficult time at a teenage age. When you put someone in a crucifixion - or rape is going on in school - you are some but stupid! The film has really worked for me two moments ... here is the spirit - Logan torn the grocery and fits her mother a bit. An adult disappointment with an adult child - especially with the presence of no parents - feel real to me. <br /> <br /> It's no other, and only part of the film with no excitement, where the scene was "Leah" (Logan's re-creation) phone Rodeo phone and tried to seduce him into phone sex. The first reason I like because the voice-over of "Laha" is a person who was the most credited actor of the whole film. (It reminds me of Claire Dances from my so-called life ... sounds like voices too.) And Rodo was the only scene that seemed completely credible among the kids. And especially what I liked was that Rodo had just told to play ... maybe this picture was probably the best moment! - We got some character development. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can move away from the influence of Van Sant, then it can be a good world for him. Who is this director - Van is one of the children of child child?
