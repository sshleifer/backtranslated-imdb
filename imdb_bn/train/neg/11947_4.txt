An interesting change from the first one. This movie was the first mystery. Even your own question finally ended what was what the killer was. There are some good parts through the film, the first half starts slowly and the speed increases in the last half. The movie is all enjoyable. 22 years after the events that happened in the first film, this story is about 22 years after Norman Bates is from a refuge and after returning to Bates Matthal, but when a woman claims to be her real mother, then everything goes wrong. The park once again played an older Norman well and at the end the scene was nice, he swang that is terribly terrible hard.
