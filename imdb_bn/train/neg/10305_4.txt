As an engineer, I must start out very promising this show's first season. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat logical and the relationship between Epis's brother and father highlights an interesting point. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show suddenly became violent. Mathematics and technologies used in crime prevention are now quite funny and interesting for everyone involved in real science and technology. <br /> <br /> It's still good to be involved with actors and I can imagine a fair amount of money still going to produce each episode, but ultimately, it is a very unexpectedly fatty dishes, which is a Grade C Action thriller and CSI Style Coppo Show has been mixed. <br /> <br /> If you see it, only go for the first season and possibly the second part. Then I will not waste my time. I myself have given moderate rituals through season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 They Season 2 - 5 They Season 3 - 3 They <br /> <br /> Let's up to 4 Star. Since Charlie does not know his math anymore, I will not be disturbed by my authentic accuracy.
