I was gifted with this movie because it was a great generation, and three women were in love with a young man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No! I'm quick to add. These women are dragged into a strange character, not very helpful to each other, and are plotting and fighting to take each other down. Prior to this, Chancellor and Eug√®da Stouton, brought to my book before making any mistake, but here they transfer an insulting script and say to adjust the work between skeptics and screws, which does not work very well when women too All the well-known professionals in the small town. <br /> <br /> And intelligent women spend a whole mile in their lives, worried about males / sexual / inadequacies. I think it could be a lot more due to a beautiful script and more excitement, so the gay sub-plot went somewhere and those who smoke / drinking women (in their twenty-fifth year all 3 ???) were very unreal - even in the baby scene - baby screws Give me a cigarette! OK. <br /> <br /> Like it, shame is a shame. 10 out of 4
