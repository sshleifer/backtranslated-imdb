Bad written conspiracies about the possibility of the release of AIDS to the public by the government drama / mystery. Vashichih has played a gay researcher to find the answer - that anyone in the plot of this fog will find it difficult to find. Regardless of the cinematography, the camera will be unfortunate to act as hungry, amateur for the true depth character rather than shallow. Grade: D +
