I had very little trouble watching this film after the first 5 minutes. I beaten it 45-50 minutes before hitting it and instead saw the Monster House (which, by the way, a lot of fun). There is a huge hole in the story of <br /> <br />. The plot line is described and neutrally large, the act is horrific, especially Justin Tibberlake, who really wants to do something good (look great and sing like a Castro). Morgan Freeman was incredibly uncomfortable, especially when after watching him and Timberlake, he made the music of the rock dance for half for any direct reason. It seems that Freeman and Timberlake's characters may be selected or have some relation to some father / son, which is not absolutely clear at all; Although Freeman's character does not seem to be insulting for Timberlake's unknowable and silly character, he will never drag all the stops so that he can be completely ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It can take anything incredible to the incredible story to give credit to a credit, which is easily irrational and out of all the ratios. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a pure waste.
