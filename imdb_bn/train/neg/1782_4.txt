A charming boy and his mother moved somewhere in town, cats and death to follow them soon. <br /> <br /> I said, after watching this movie I was a little mad by the cats. But the innumerable things that are wrong with this movie, despite all the seriousness, and believe me that it has to go a lot, it's a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> The letters more here, just like caricatures with their foundation innocence depending on here. Fear, greed, pride, or anger inspire these people. Although it may be reasonable that it seems impossible, in reality, the story has been told. The supermodel prize and it's Stefan King Screenplay (which I do not have anything specific to Mr. King) is actually fully supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite appropriate music. The ultimate jewel of this movie is without any doubt, Alice Cr√®ge, who plays Marie Brady, unexpected mom, who. <br /> <br /> The King is an ordinary story from the outside, or those who are a little different (just - a lot in this case), there will be no horror fan collection that fit into a camp on a slightly awful gem and try twists in it.
