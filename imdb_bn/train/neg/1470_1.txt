I was looking at some of our DVD towers last night to watch. We were in Netflix Mailing and it was a cool Saturday night. I found a pull that I had never heard before and realized that it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it seems to be a rip off of "The Big Chill", but with All-Star Cast it seems that it might be worth watching. Boy i was wrong !!! It was not just like "The Big Chill", but it was almost the character of the character. Bill Paxton's character is a copy of William Hurt ("Where Are You All These Time" Introduction) - Spiller Alerts- And, look and see, he is behind the old space (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Morphic Woman Matt Craven = Jeff Goldbam etc. I myself saw why I saw these people. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" find these letters even after 20 years? Even after plasins fell, it was not funny in the morning, it was 'flopped' from the bed on the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After the end, I asked my wife, "Is there any boyfriend character in this picture ... ... are you sleeping there?" He replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... no, I can not think."
