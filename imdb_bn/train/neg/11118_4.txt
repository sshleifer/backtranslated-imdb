This was probably a popular movie, because it is a comedy, a fairytale story, a miracle that closes all the loudmouth. The interesting thing is that if you replace someone, you probably can not make a movie with this title, but some other PCs as "white" will be considered racist by police. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrison, like the white guy, has played well if the black basketball player is not good, his main opponent is Wesley Snipes, <br /> <br /> Snippets had a lot of fun-down-lines, which provided a lot of humor. Bad part of the film - which does not bother many people - extreme superstition and laxity of all characters here. Among these are the performances of Woody's girlfriend, Rossi Perez. There is really no clean, beautiful people in this movie. Because of that, I can not really recommend the film, at least not to the friends or those who are offended by the LOTF prejudice
