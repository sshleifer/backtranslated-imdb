Anyone who is not proud of the history of the country's buff and ethnic relations in a WWII naval history, I was looking forward to watching this movie. What is a frustrating piece of skilk I've made it around with 3/4 paths, but I should stop it at the Gulf scene. It is assumed that a U-boat will burn a torpedo in a DDE, as it was expected to hit, and then will be able to "escape" from the DED while being debated. And that's just a small detail. The whole film was badly written, poorly operated, and played badly. I agree with others on this board that it could be a good movie. They decide that since these unexpected WWII propaganda movies were made with all white white, so they need to be united with black people. And those old movies were as bad, this is actually bad. And it smacks false advertisements for the title of almost untrue Davis and Stephen Ray. It turned out to be very minor role. I believe that these two fine actors felt embarrassed to be associated with this film. I've done I gave this shit cinema my life too much way.
