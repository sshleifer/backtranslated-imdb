I enjoyed the movie, mentally, intelligent and visually. There is no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and they do not need it, it attracts my attention all the time, with the intrinsic words of the visual, the stories and the knowledge <br /> <br /> However: 1] Some languages ​​of foreign languages ​​have difficulty listening to and understanding the speech dialogue; [2] Unnecessary excessive use of swearing (especially F-words, which has been rated as the film rate). [3] The film is compatible with comedians and emotional, but most of the passions throughout the film, except for the final offer at the last moment, are extremely harmful response due to some harmful reactionary reactions, very long living in the depth of bitterness and depression. [4] I will not recommend this movie due to a 5-second background description, it did not add a bit to the side-character, or the movie - it just turned me into a movie and got stuck between me. Through the whole film of the brain and later: the mother of the main character of the German genius, seeing the old WWII films, "The roots of the German for secret." If the Nazi war wins, there will be no "local color" or industry. Nazi wins WWII if the world seems to be a better place, but I do not know the German except for the immediate ScandHed.
