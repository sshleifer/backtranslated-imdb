About a girl named Promenade Doona (Brittany Snow), who is trying to kill her promotor night by a psycho killer. And so he killed his family, friends, and his enemies. <br /> <br /> Now tell me before you start, you are tired of PG-13 horror movies, which were not afraid in recent times. You are stupid girl dialogue 'Oh my God' is talking about tired and girls things. And you are really tired of relations between the girls and then crying. And the last thing is that you're tired of reviving America, Japanese and Chinese movies. Most of the promo nights are uploaded, but I am still not ready to review. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If not, do not see the prominent night. You never hear crying alone and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way death is repeated like 24/7. So they are not only terrifying but it is illogical. When I met Cast, I thought I was ready to lose. Many girls talk, lots of people, and many 'oh my lord. It's our prom ' I understand it's fun but do not seek attention seriously too. <br /> <br /> If I do not see Pram Night in other movies of 2008, I'll be the first one. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released for DVD for cheap and fast. Do not spend seriously 'spending night to die' to watch your money or dull acting, cheap fear and time. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars. (PS if I can give the film I'll be grading zero).
