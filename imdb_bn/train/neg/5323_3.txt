I can not believe that none of the 34 comments said that this picture was a packet of yesterday's birth. A man is hired to bring up a visible stupid blonde until a gangster needs. Rent guns and fellows love to fall and live happily ever after. Gangster louve left. But yesterday was an intelligent treatment yesterday, but this is just a lot of fluff. DVD technicolor transfer is great. Natalie Kalmus will be rolling over her grave. Check out Paperboy. Recognize him? However, historically Rock 'n Roll's roots are interesting to see. Also the role of Yewel's cinemakers, it is a new format.
