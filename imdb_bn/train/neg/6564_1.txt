This is one of the worst movies of today, Christian J. Mayoli "Leonard" was the best part of trying to jump outside and down the bar, as I wanted to do on DVD, as the rest of humanity suffered the pain of seeing this shitty film. It's a great cast so that you wait for it to wait, I mean "Andrew" with San Austen (fully portrayed in part, did a great job, it was very bad in this movie), "Seven", "Bevan" Ron Livingstone "Chad", Reynie Gelveser "Poetry" (in the whole episode, they have their name on 1 line and then less than 4 seconds ... <br /> <br /> If Cast Ona dignity, they go out and buy all copies of the film, and writer / director George hikenalopara and writer John enaboma burn them along.
