I had read reviews for this movie quite decent so I decided to check it out. Bid Idea! Another movie about this is a ghost out for revenge against a group friends. Mix the story stupid, part of the two parts of the rim, with a splash knight; I know what you did last summer and add a little white dash of a white white woman - mix it until it is completely unknown. There is nothing new for this plot, and as much encouragement as I have been encouraged, the review process was not even entertaining at this time. This film has jumped from the past and past, and once I understood it, I still realized that it still does not have much knowledge. Seekee killer from eye to eye goes into an eye blink. Speaking of the characters, they are all your stereotypical choices - greedy selfish lawyers, sensual actresses, base-baseball stars, video voyeur, nasty girl, spooky calm chick, 'pretty-good-beautiful' beautiful girl, a freakin 'black cat. And I do not care any of them. Perhaps a good writer could make movies, there was some decent view, but overall the film was a mess. I should mention a specific 'video tape' which was impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror offering, but it's still quite bad. If you want to see some obscure images in the dark, or want to laugh loudly in some cases from above, or just "you are stupid!" No movie screen or any other Asian awful posture wants to flick your slip when someone asks you how many you are watching - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who like the beautiful plot they look elsewhere.
