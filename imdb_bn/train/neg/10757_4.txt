I saw this movie on DVD last night, and decided to check the reviews this morning. It seems that the critical view in the "I, Robot" IMDB has killed the community (and many insults and name-calling have increased). <br /> <br /> I think it's a little strange, like the movie is not great (or even better), but it's terrible (or even worse). What really is this film, is ... depressing. American film-girl population intensity, cleared re-hits, and spectacular new work ready for their appreciation are so frustrating. This image has been written as "retread", it is Smith's character from a plot line (an incompatible mix of modern and modern day uber-action) (a smart-brained discipline with a bit of titanium), special effects (from the matrix and some others). Done). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" Sadly, perhaps the perfect action movie for today's audience: Space Plot, Instant Graduation Dialog, and lots and many Adrenaline. Smith Middle, but we already knew (he seems to be a failed attempts to create a black Bruce Willis in Hollywood). This story has all sorts of holes, but I do not think that the majority of the people in this film have survived, which are quite attentive. Probably a blockbuster by today's standard, but very B movies compared to the true B winners.
