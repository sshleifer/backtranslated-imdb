Worst de Niro Scorsese collaboration in this violent outrage violent overlong mess. Scorsese seems to be coming from a master craftsman such as ridiculous and embarrassing that gripping the loud loud phone ringing and door slamming with the door suddenly out of its material. Throwing is completely wasted here and southern languages ​​are very annoying and forced. Nick Nolty plays the most scary lawyer in history who never believes that he can defend anyone! De Niro psychiatrist Bowden 90's general movie is nothing more than a psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Luis is very painful and climax, and we all will not be tired of being tired of the sticker in the brain. One of my most awesome movie experiences is This is 100 times better original rent. <br /> <br />
