If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, then I would recommend that you show a copy of the original story of Alumni Blackwell. This movie was not just bad, but there was nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> When I used to read it as a child I liked the book (in EM Freeman's "Campfire Chillers") and I was so excited to see a movie coming out of it. I was so frustrated when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there are many PCs (politically correct) handling in all the films that do not have any place in the film. The PC was not even in existence when the book was written. <br /> <br /> My advice does not waste your time or money !! If you look at the video store look at it there.
