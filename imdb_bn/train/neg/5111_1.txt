As long as I helped build a home for the White Family, I had spent long hours in the house, only after one year I became ill at home. All of the beautiful rock landscapes have been moved, excellent rock pathways and front fountains have been removed, all the front pine trees and pine trees have been cut, the sprinkler system is leaked. It now looks like a disaster area. They do not live there anymore ... They live in "cities" and only come out on weekends. Oklahoma thinks all the people donating these people and seeing results are sick to me. What we saw on TV was not completely true ... you do not believe what you see and heard.
