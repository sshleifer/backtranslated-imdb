This movie works very hard, but there is a complete lack of the lack of the 1960s TV series, I'm sure people remember with love. Although I was 17 years old, I watched some of the series on YouTube long ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly, this movie does a little justice in the series. <br /> <br /> Special effects are rather low-quality, and it does not help by flat camera-work. The script was also dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humor. Other films with Under-Cross scripting are Home Alone 4, Hat In Hot, Thomas and Magic Railroads, and Adams Family Reconciliation. <br /> <br /> Now I would say I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was executed very badly and ran steam very quickly, and I am not sure why this is the reason for the family to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> But the most excited thing about this picture is that Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniel and Daryl Hana, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has dragged some good performances before, but he does not seem to have a formula that he was supposed to do any work, and Elizabeth Hurley's character came across as sadly vague. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and is usually ignored, and I think she is interested in love, but sadly you see her very rarely, (as well as Monter can fight with Walter, children can also fear children) Shaon is the type of official operator. Christopher Lloyd has made himself better, and I love Lloyd as an actor (he was in my two favorite movies, Qi and Hugh Framed Roger Rabitt, and I'm in love with futures futures) but he was paid very little for work, <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, instead of having fun, it was added as vain, and it's a shame because it Many talented non Ineta with a good idea and a lot of potential, but it was lost to poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
