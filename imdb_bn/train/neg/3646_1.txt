Oh ... my ... God ... I have never seen without any doubt the most fascinating movie. The bad acting, the weak of the characters, the characters weak, and the whole film just does not sense. With this medieval direction, this twin really turns out to be strange scenery (such as a child gets hijacked and mysteriously falls), and thoroughly submerged conversations ("Look!" "Moastan's Pants Chen!"), And you complete a failure. It can not be mentioned that the only thing like Atlas could be to defeat the challenge bars. But this is part of the charm of this movie. Sit down and see it with a few friends for a good smile. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it is not just that!
