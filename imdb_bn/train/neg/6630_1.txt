This so-called rimble is terrible. I went to see this tonight .. My expectations and campaign were too much to handle the first day. But one hour in the first half, we knew it was a disaster. It does not match the hype created but insults the original blockbuster. There were errors in the script, the editing was untidy several times. Mahallal is a wonderful actor who has done the right thing. Amitabh was right .. The director wanted to illustrate how bad his character was, but he went on a little overboard, which resulted in it being effective. This kind of role was particularly disappointing in Ajay too smoothly. New people can not even start thinking about peace. It will not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav was thrown for some laughter, he could not have laughing at anyone with a humorous humor and strong voice. Nisha Kothari proved that today she is our worst actress. Above all, I used to think that RGV was the most talented and gifted director of India. Unfortunately failed. He is known as the best Hindi film of all time, which took such a huge challenge and responsibility for rebuilding and made mess of it.
