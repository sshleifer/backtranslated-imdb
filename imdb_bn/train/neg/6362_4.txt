I have been a big fan of Italian movies since the seventy years, and I did not always want to hesitate to list beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actors, so I went to this picture with some hope. However, it has soon become clear that it is a largely unmatched film that is not going anywhere. Obviously no one can do more to this expectation, but it becomes vain when you consider it to be more neutral and not a character attractive. According to the title, the film draws a 'rogue' attention; In this case one of the stolen, femininity and stuff smuggles. Basically all the plans that are in this movie The film has a genuine '70 style' and its concept is becoming very cautious. It sometimes looks like something like Director Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson seems, whatever that point does not come across very well whatever. See Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and that is also the case here; She is definitely the best part of the movie and hanging from the nude carrier is the best part of the movie. Overall, the rig will probably appeal something for those who love 70's style, but unfortunately there is not much to offer.
