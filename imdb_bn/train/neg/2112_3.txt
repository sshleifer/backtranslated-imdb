Bela Lugosi plays a doctor, who does something to make her wife look young and beautiful. To this end, he saw the drug addicts in their wedding ceremonies that they were dead, so they could steal their body. I do not know exactly how he does with the body. I do not remember it being fully explained. I know that he took out something from them and injected it into his wife. (I would assume that it is the spinal fluid. Vertebrate scientists are 40 scientist in the sciences.) You can guess everyone else from here. There are a couple of (well, really a couple more, but I will write only about two of the problems that I have with this movie. One way is to use the apples. Sure, he has a decent way of sorting his own overacting Enough work (BTW, the rest cast is simply straightforward). But, hide behind the person's hearing or do not let the female reporter enter the bedroom. I hate him and / or kill him henchman, is it evil to him? Well, anyone who is kidnapping a comrose brides does not have to look bad. <br /> <br /> My second problem is the idea of ​​Brothers Designers, why are they? What will a woman under 20 not do? Seeing Bell going through this vitality for his prey, I reminded the evil fisherman that I still know what you did last summer In each case, there is an easy way to reach your purpose rather than using a seemingly impossible plan depending on the circumstances beyond your control. (BTW, an alternative title for this movie is Missing Bride Case. I think partly explains the 'boud' need.)
