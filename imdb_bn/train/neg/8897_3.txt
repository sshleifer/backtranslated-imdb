When I first saw this movie, it seemed as if I was in six classes when it happened. Before I could see it, I had heard its main broadcast record, and I really liked it! But when I saw it, how was I, what's the hack? This movie has lost many songs from the voice for the building! Who decided to do all of this? <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm really a huge fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of any musical instrument! This movie looks more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful highlands in Scotland. And who has decided to cut the song of all the Meg of this photo? <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I want to bet, learners and people are probably thinking: "Who has decided to do this in our best writing world?" Well they said that if they did, they would probably have gone crazy because of turning them into their wonderful musical instrument in this vague film. <br /> <br /> Song and musician Mr. Kelly, you're auditioning with flying colors, but you're in a film that is not much missing. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good movie based on the music of Frederick Loay and Alan J. Lerner, this is not the one! <br /> <br /> 3/10
