I have a huge fan of the war movies, and as a Vietnam War vet, have some experience with technical expertise. I worked with the bomb son more than once and there is nothing but respect for them. Other vats, and especially Iraq vets, have incorrectly summarized errors in this movie. Poetry license is one thing, but this movie is totally fantastic, and because of this, it badly fails. A bomb disposal unit, or a unit, will never tolerate this miscreant operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units are rewarded for a reason and synonymous with discipline; It saves lives. The opening scene, especially annoying me. The guy with the cell phone will be shot immediately. Yelling, "Off Dialing" is not an effective preventive. It's worse than that. Scenery with sniper was particularly harmful. As others have mentioned, your average EOD guy does not know Jack as a sniper, and an Arab sniper thinks that it really stretches the imagination. It is not right to kidnap an Arab businessman for some personal revenge. Someone can shoot him, but these types of risky movies are limited. I could go, but, as I said, others pointed these things in detail. This is not a good movie and it won a prize but more reflection of why it has been named "La la Land"
