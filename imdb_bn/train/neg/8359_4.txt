In spite of having a few moments of heavy rain, despite being confused with a drunk and a Gypsy and a monkey and a grapes in a sanatorium, this rosso is shortened with the help of silent comedy Booster Keaton and Al-Sart. While John is simply fantastic, although Arctic has a very interesting section on Drift Flirt with Booster, but this is the final in "sweet intelligent" scene, especially it can be seen in a few times when we see a smile in the Great Stone Face and the movie! Also, most scenes may have been jumped due to excessive use of film stock. Still, if you are an Arbuckle or Keaton completist, Good Night, nurse! Of course a look price.
