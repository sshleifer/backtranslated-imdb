It has got one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's rock bottom. In a small plot, a small town (how real!) And outsiders involved in the fighters trying to fight them. Why do not they call out for help? Who knows? The war scenario is probably fake. Adam West and Tina Louise have both but there is little to do and both look shy there (understandable) belong in this movie trash hip!
