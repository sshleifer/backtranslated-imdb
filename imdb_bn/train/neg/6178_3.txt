Frank Tashlin's 'The Home Front' is a more intense private snap shorts, a cartoon made for the military as a guide film. Rather than accepting some strange acts of Sanaphu's disaster, 'The Home Front' returns to her loved ones instead, and how much they will pay for the war effort. Snifu realized that he was wrong when he thought that it was easy. This is an idea with some possibilities for good ideas, and instead the Tashlin Russian Card is more strongly, the increased rig to the strip and the younger actresses rather than the most effective comic relief. The result is a good meaning to have a little relevance or entertainment value today than today as a traditional Artefact.
