The main allegation of this film is that I can not tell. There is no intention of racism, but the Asian people all look the same! I can tell the story a bit, but as soon as it's about that heck The identity of the people is not a mystery, but if they were a mystery then I would take care of them. Instead, I did not close the screen to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot in huge shots and silent emotions. Hack It's annoying, I just do not know this people, but they're sitting there. <br /> <br /> Production of Chinese Chinese John Woo, terrible video in the scary scene. It looks a bit better than Andy Lau's "Full Time Killer" (which was a great movie.) You might think of a modest budget that looks like Hollywood at least 90's. I did not know that sugar was an art-house beetic.
