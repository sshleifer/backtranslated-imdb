This movie sucked pretty. I am in the army and the soldiers pictured in this movie are horrific. If you see this film in the military and you see the movie, then suddenly you suddenly get disappointed with the whole film because they worked in a team. It was ridiculous. They worked for the army uniform to know that they worked like a bunch of normal people. This is a pretty poor movie I want to say at least. They had a couple scenes where you try to jump. If you are bored I would recommend seeing it and want to see a violent, poor movie. If it is not in the army it will be a better movie. I would say I've got one better choice than this one.
