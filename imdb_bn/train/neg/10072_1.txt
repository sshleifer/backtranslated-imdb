Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros to the movie theater to watch this messy nonsense movie. My points; <br /> <br /> The movie is based on 2 things; Point of view: As is most common in American movies, the author feels himself as an expert after learning about 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. No person understands any culture in order to name two cakes and other foods. For example, Shaving is the sign of clean living in Asia but trying to stop every girl. The people of Lebanon are totally different from other Arab countries (Christianity has got it) and their cultural form and beliefs and methods. The main difference between Eastern and Western cultures is that we do not create atheistic conscience. So we do not judge people by following the first question of our life, since the father did the picture in all the pictures. <br /> <br /> 2) Girl's sexual revolution: There is nothing to say about it. I showed 10 girls, who were in their sexual awakening, I would say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers were promoting this film with the continuation of black humor. Please watch Dr.Strangelove watch and black humor. A black humor had to reflect the truth and the audience had to focus on it the fun part. Where is the truth? Where is the movie about money
