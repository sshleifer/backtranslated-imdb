Imagine the scene - you're on movie holidays only because you are in Washington on weekends and it's raining and you end up with the museum. You think you can see Sarah Marshall, such as the trailer, and you do not have to engage your brain. It is sold. Alternate? - Bank jobs, bruges, ledheads or promotor night. You watched Bank Job (that's nicely moderated Hust Movie) and saw Bruges (again, quite good) so you're down from two. Walking around 1930 football uniforms, you do not see Cloni or a great person, so you go to Pram Night? Wrong Take $ 8.50, walk a stranger on the street and ask him to face $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. <br /> <br /> This is more than the horror / thriller comedy or more than what is expected. If I were financing the movie and they showed me that I can not laugh or cry as a final cut. Probably both. Somebody insulted the intelligence ... my roommate smiled loudly in most of the movies, for acting, they could throw robots (or dogs) in roles, they were more realistic. The detective may be the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christensen (I hate his acting so much that I'll spell his name). You're free from your title. <br /> So the essence is not 'good'
