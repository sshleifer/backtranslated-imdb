After a long time in space, Superman (Brandon Routh) came back to Earth to look for Christopher's remains. He missed Lowe Lane (Kate Bosworth), who has a son and has a son with Richard White (James Merceden). Meanwhile, Lex Luther (Kevin Specy) plotted an evil plot using a crystal stolen from Solidad's fort to create a new land and to sink the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or "Loose and Clark" (and date hatcher ) Or a TV show like "Chimville", this was a great prospect for Superman's return to the version of Brian Singh. Unfortunately, horror stories are very long and annoying, many unnecessary parts, lack of passion and overrated in IMDb. In addition, some embarrassing ridiculous in romance between Lois Lane and Superman. 22-year-old actress Kate Bosworth incorrectly miscast, playing the role of a mature reporter and a five-year-old son experienced mother. Brandon Ruth is two years younger than Tom Welling, who played a teenager "Kentucky" in Clark Kent. The character of Parker Pazzy, Kitty KÃ¶lski, is actually a humorous joke. Last but not least, and despite being a horrific lex luther, Kevin Spacy is 25 years old, so older and older than other lead. The Corny Conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
