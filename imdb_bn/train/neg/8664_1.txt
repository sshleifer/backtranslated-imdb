This is just a joke of a movie, they killed me the first opening scene (spyar warring) to kill dangerous animals in the cage, it is seen by a scientist who works on a monitor and guesses what he does, leaving the cage staff test To do this, OMG how these writers are stupid thinking that the people come so much that the fish tank shakes with big white sharks It has eaten your goldenfish just as it has been poured ... very vain and more figs and I will not even talk about cast because they are not worth the effort. Why did the man write that it is a secret to me immediately ... and this kind of silly film is going on. This is a better CG which is better than average for low budget movies, only good things. <br /> <br /> If this type of thing does not disturb you, check it out, but if your IQ is above 60, then it will probably hate it.
