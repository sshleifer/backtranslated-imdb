As mentioned by others, it should have been an excellent film in the Hammer-style and it seems to me that most of its actors were instructed to run it ... but screenplay is very limited, poorly read, and lots of lazy soliloquies filled (poor Timothy Dalton them Most are saddled with) that it is all overblown and self-important. This is an unreasonably weak performance from Dalton, although he calmly climates the climactic scene, where Dr. Rock eventually understands what he has done. The only actor who comes off really well is Patrick Stewart a most welcome vision. Freddie Francis could be a great painter, but he was a lousy director.
