Wow, how can it get worse? This was seriously bad. Not for Gore - which is a ridiculous CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was awesome - the character of the protagonist was a total joke. Within a few hours of taking Vinnie Jones, she became a 'ghost' when she started crying while her photo was being taken. Um ... all is this young photographer of New York, the counselor and the weak? There was no argument or point to the development of his character - and at the very end you will laugh loudly with his character, completely anticipated, and completely curious. <br /> <br /> The cow's moments were definitely right, the modern MTV style is a weak, self-respected attempt to jump over the Gogh Wagon - all CGIs, blood still has no real passion. These parts were weirdly funny - and confused by their self-consciousness - the Wakey camera angle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The overall picture of this movie is the crime of running out of other possible ideas. The atmosphere may have been destroyed (finally until the silly monsters) 'looking at my own self-conscious guidance'. This movie was not created for the audience - it was created for a selfish purpose for a CV.
