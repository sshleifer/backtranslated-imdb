I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. The acting was not great, but that was not the real problem. This problem was a feeling of drowning about 20 minutes in my belly hole. These letters were hollow. They did not have much depth and what they did was devoted to cruelty to each other in protest of friendship. Exploring dark aspects of a set of characters can be interesting, but you have to give those characters genuine personalities or they just have to pay cardboard castouts. These letters were on the cardboard and the pictures they gave were just ugly.
