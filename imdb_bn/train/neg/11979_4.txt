Hulkamaniacos) Suicide: The earthquake soon follows the two-angled drops for the pins (2-2) to overcome Bashman, and Hogan gets frustrated and finally togabat gets a tag (who knew he was there at this moment?), He was able to count with earthquake First fight for about 30 seconds. Only Hogan and Barbaryan left. Barbarian puts some nice crimes but catching big boots and leg drop for inevitable pins. Hogan is the only survivor. 4/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All Mercenaries (Sgt Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express): all mechanisms wore incognito paint paint. All of the alliance (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwalkers). In a few seconds with Santana, the fastest pin here (4-3 Ad Alliance) with suspension pinning at its last PPV. There was even a Bolshevik showdown. Bushwakkar hit Sato with the Battery Ram, though Tanaka was a legal person (4-2 Ad Alliance) and his last appearance at WWF PPV was because the Orient Express was rescheduled. Tancak follows Satin when Santana stops him with flying arrows (4-1 AD Alliance). Despite having a ring against four men, he left the Volks (after the end of his career), Busch and Luke in relative ease. Eventually, the general Adnan was assassinated by the Iraqi flag while assaulting him in a fit of disqualification. Finally some interesting booking matches were awkward. Santana takes a tragic victory like the only survivor and becomes its last best hour. 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> He danced with Gene O'Kelland and became warm by the crowd, when the piper and monsoon were enjoyed that they were enjoying. <br /> <br /> Survival Match: Ultimate Warrior, Hawk Hogan and Tito Santana v Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick Model 'Martel' and Million Dollar Man Ted Debussy: At the front of the Santana Pin Warlord, at the front, 4-3 AD. Dibius's team). Santana (4-2 AD. Dibius's team) for pins after the Dubins Stun gun. Hogan comes out of the power plaque and lets Ram to pin after the pump line, effectively pushing power and glory (3-2 AD). Hogan Martel drops leg for pins by excluding Count-Out and Debbie (2-1 ad hogan team). Hogan eventually let Warrior play in such a match, who settled former Nemesis Hercules before quickly getting clear. Vomiting dot is a very expected ending. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Overall, many matches and very short time definitely had a detrimental effect because the wrestlers are waiting to pin the conveyor belt around. Most of the heels fall by Warrior and Hogan, which is a bad way to manage a great roller of wrestlers.
