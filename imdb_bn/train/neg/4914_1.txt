I like the love story of good love (and I'm a man) but when I hired "love story", I prayed for the fast and painful way to come as quickly as possible and to come against Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <As Jenny Ali McGro got upset in me in the first 15 minutes. I can not be surprised when we know that he diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, but it would be frustrating for Oliver's weakness due to his death or whether anyone would be cared for by watching this movie. If he did not die, his breaking personality pushed Oliver to the edge and eventually took him to the court of divorce. <br /> <br /> People love this movie but the worst of 70.
