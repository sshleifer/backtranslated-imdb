I can not really think of any of the riders of this completely bad rendering than the art of Asimov's art. Forget product settlement disaster, unconvincing performance from Will Smith and gargantuan plot-holes. This was not only ridiculous and painful to visit. Even the action was annoying. MTV insists mixing mixed mix and extremely bad conversations, probably looking at very young children. <br /> <br /> Can our Blackdreamer, minority report or shameful still be a shame after this? A lesser amount of Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs to 100 list. Really terrible.
