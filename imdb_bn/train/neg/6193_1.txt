I can not believe I saw only one and a half hours a weak film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This all makes him unconsciously more violent and ultimately as such the intensity of explosion blasts ... <br /> <br /> The first one is that I do not think I can find any great sense or trace of this movie, no single character . If the director thinks that in the last few minutes I have seen that great joy, but I have to say that it does not stop. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature. Most of the time, I did not see any facial expression from the actors and I do not think that body language is enough to make enough impact. Maybe the crew was so tired that they fixed the camera to include everything in settings. Everyone is happy without the audience <br /> <br /> The plot is especially weak. Many related scenes and conversations that seem to be related, but they are really so random that you can not move them together, probably unless you write them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < So I can not really comment here commented here. <br /> <br /> In the last few minutes the song is a wonderful choice. Maybe this is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I have never given a film 1, but this film must claim it (at least you will laugh at scary movies). This is a film that fails to portray the frustrated young people with meticulous visitors. Hope you never fall into the team.
