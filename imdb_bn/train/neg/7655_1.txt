We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. She's incredible done. IMDB has only two films in the 100 films below, the only director! He is like the ideology of some types of movies. It does not matter how little talent she is, and she does not mind how bad these films are, they continue to carry on. I know, he has financed them all by some strange German funding, but even after complete, complete failure, his ability to continue filming is one of the great mysteries of the universe. <br /> <br /> This video game developers will not be so bad except this guy keeps their best features. I really enjoy the series of the dark series alone. Even the latest, New Nightmare game was good for a few hours of playing. Edward Carney was a good film made of courage, but it is not. Now Ub Bold holds the hand on Bloody and Hunter: Count. After what, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine this trick that if the person is not stopped, the game-to-movie adaptation will be cut. Someone has to stop their credit line, or the publisher of this video game must be intelligent and realize that no one is interested in the title when they create bad films from a game that kills the franchisees. <Br /> <br /> Think of it, the House of Dead or Dark in the Dark is an effective game title? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for the X-Box and no one cares for it. The title is dead, and all due to Uwe Boll. So if you work for a game publisher, or a game publisher, or get access to a game publisher, please alert them. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is not valuable. I can not distinguish what I do not like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything sucks about it. Writing, acting, music, CG effect, edit I thought I waited till the DVD came out and then hired it for lesser expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Uwe's a bigger out, BOLL sh * t has less evaluation of the steaming sloping capacity.
