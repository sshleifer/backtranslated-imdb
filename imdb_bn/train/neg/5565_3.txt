I think a big action star of Dolf Lundgren could be some of De La Hue Schwarzenegger, Stallone and even Dan. His career had some big moments but he liked a little too poor and it must have been one of only after his career. The strange thing about Zill the Ripper (or Jill Reps ... or up to up) is that I really think they are seriously thinking that they are creating provocative and serious thrillers? It shows the way they describe it in IMDb, in the case of DVDs, and this film is not serious. It will be a huge understatement to call Campi. Whenever the film tries to be intricate and intelligent it is not something of the shallow, confusing and gratuitous ones. On top of that they played Landgren, known for action films, to make a serious role, it has created more camps because its range as an actor is quite limited. The whole picture is turning around the weird sex world, and yet they are trying to make it a serious thriller? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, keep aside many plot holes that hang out free for Londongran criminal scenes, witnesses and everything else, even though he is not yet a policeman and you still do not have any brilliant performance and brilliant performance than Lundren. Daniel Brett Lundgren's last love interest and his brother's widow. Brett scripts and Campy play considerable roles in the story. The supporter cast is huge and does not stand specially in anybody's performance unless it seems to have taken several names in the film due to the negative aspects such as Victor Pedrichenho's performance, it is not a great word and it's really awful <br /> <br /> I genuinely tried to enter the mystery and the film and did not intimate  র রাখি কিন্তু এর কোন কারণ ছিল না কারণ এটি ছিল হাস্যকর চক্রান্ত এবং অযৌক্তিক যৌন উত্তেজনাপূর্ণ খেলাগুলির একটি অসম্ভব হাস্যকর হাস্যকর দৃশ্য সহ যেখানে লুন্ডগ্রেন কভার অধীনে যায় এবং প্রায় নগ্ন নিচে উল্টানো হয়। To explain how this movie was dedicated and well done (limitations ... annoying) The DVD I picked (it was really cheap) is the name of Lundgren's character "Murray Wilson" (not his character's name in the film). However, the lundren Usually directed to be observable, but the film tries to be serious and flat on its face. Considering director Anthony Hikks is actually infamous for Bickie Flickr, although I think he is really trying to be serious. Lundgren fans of hard-core culture will see it ... no one else ... should certainly be for any kind of mystery or mystery. 3/10
