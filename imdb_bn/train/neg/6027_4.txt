I grew up in Baptist and I want to tell the story, but I do not believe in the story. I give the movie the average life time movie of the week as well as cudo movies. Gently catching, medium acting, slowly, the script is hypothetical, the music is sad, and it's a little musician. And all the people have left behind, sometimes the squeakiest clean non-Christians will be. They do not have any single curse word. But when I loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly loudly loudly said, "nuclear" as Bush's "nu-cu-lar" There is no response to the honor of a Christian, that Bush's claim that he too has called God, should Christians who misread the word in the same way should ignore their ignorance? Ha ha ha! I really had a hard time after that the movies at all. After the "Nu-Que-Lara" incident, the film seemed like a packed, manipulated campaign. I was looking for something brave. Actually, I'm looking for something that I can remember, but I could not find it here. You're looking for stupid entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
