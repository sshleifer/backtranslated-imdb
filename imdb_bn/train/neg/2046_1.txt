I can not believe that this film has made it even in the video, and is willing to put video rental shops on their roofs. I asked for a refund of literature. Take the film off of no historical fact, and it is still the worst movie in a video store. It's not good enough to say a B-movie. Do not waste your money or your time in this movie. Just list on the voice and awesome music made me sick. Anyone involved in this movie will have to pull from the union, giving the art a black mark, but after most of the reviews of this film, I really do not think anyone involved is a union member.
