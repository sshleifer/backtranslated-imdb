The only disturbing thing about this movie is that anyone who created it could create a sequel. <br /> <br /> Starting from the beginning "teeth elf" was terrible. It seemed like a badly played child movie that confused with the "Wizard of Oz" and was pleased with the effects of some bad pregnancies and swearing in Kiddies. <br /> <br /> Half of the welding seems completely unnecessary, without being comfortable, some fashion is being killed. There is no complete picture point in the role of two brothers' sisters, Aura Reader and Mrs. McDonald - they could have included some interesting aspect in the original plot but could not be apparently annoyed. Seeing this movie, people know that some bloody death scenes have characters but at least TRY and they have a little plot. The common story is weaker than those characters who want you to be witchcraft. <br /> <br /> Playing with weak plots and the weak (children especially the wood) and the movie ends a complete failure. If only MST3 could go this one ...
