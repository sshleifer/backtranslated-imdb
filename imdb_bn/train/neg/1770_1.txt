My wife and I both agreed that it was one of the worst movies ever made. Of course I saw the top ten of all those ten above. At least "Plan 9" was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firearms Arter", "Kerry" and a few other movies. I did not pay too much attention to "badge" (the word was just so bad on the words I saw and I did not often say what people are saying), or "pet cemeteries" <Br /> <br /> But this mess is possible everywhere. "Animals" itself was designed by a 9-year-old. (There is no 9-year old crime.) <br /> <br /> Even "one-fishing boat" bothered us and was not distantly entertaining.
