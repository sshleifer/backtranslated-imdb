I enjoyed the first few minutes of feedback, but in 20 minutes I was generously applying a fast-forward button. Many of Stuart's shot (Michael Jelniker) walks from house to house, down the street and down the street, and many shots make him feel very confused and confused. I thought the story was originally meant to be brief (20-30 minutes) and the director was expanded as the labor of love between director Grave and star Jelniker (they co-authored with screenplay). <Br /> It could have been more entertaining than this if a character has something to say that I have not heard before in many other films, or if not last - frustrating - which I gave three-minute forecast in the picture (an independent / small studio Atatic for film). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not your ideal formulaic Hollywood manipuluit nonsense.
