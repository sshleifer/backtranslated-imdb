Strange ... I like all these movie crew and dark humorous movies; But do not like this one! It's terrible, awesome and certainly not funny. Can not make a full movie plot of sorrow, hate. And it was really annoying. Long empty moment meets the movie; It may be moved. It must be in another small size format. Maybe I expected too much from the crew - such as saving the movie lol? It also filled the heavily used minds on letters and situations ... I can not find why people like it ... "poetry", "hope"; Nap mam did not see anything like that! ^^ Above all, it is empty and plentiful, kind and hopeless. Oh well ..........
