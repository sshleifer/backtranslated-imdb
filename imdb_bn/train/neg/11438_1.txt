I am not aware of this, though there is a bad comedy than 'Gray Matters'. Jewish comedy's 'funny' determination in New York is that siblings Sam and Gray have misunderstood for a couple and so decided to set up a friend with Sam, only the Grey is attracted equally to their target - Charlie. Gray secretly revealed that the publisher was only a surprise to her. A deeply embarrassing "drunken work" from Mannahan and Graham and a performance that would embarrass the forest for its wooden timber from Tom Kwavanagh. Sissy Spsek displays a complete disability to comedy and this would excised from her resume. Home friends with Molly Shannon lumpen insouciance friends. Only Alan Kunming is raised with a credit but is not seriously employed and given a job. Throughout Graham's wonderful eye-rolling performance, the whole disaster finally ends with the scene where she wears a comedy hat and overcote despite being set in a gay bar. It is no surprise that the film is released and it is not a freedom fighter and must not be spared.
