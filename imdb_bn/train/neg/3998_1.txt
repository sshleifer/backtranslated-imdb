Can you say "all shocks, no plot?" There were so many undefined aspects in this movie. There was no history other than death. Why was it bad? What is that that way? Why count a "hour"? Then, there was an indication at the unexplored thing; For example, we have seen a camera in the air, which he mentioned. But when he stood up and said, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How did all the ghosts look "digital", and things were "disturbed" before stabilizing the sound and hit the ground? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, it makes 1408 high-tech speake houses like. <br /> <br /> Oh ... oh ... not working in electronics 1408. All right, except the TV ... cell phone no signal, but Wireless Internet works fine. How likely can you add dissatisfaction? I'm sorry, but this image was nothing but "shock after shock". It has all been done before. Mirror reflection The only thing outside the site. Paintings change. Bloodshed walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... or it was not." And, if the house was "bad", then why our main character comes in terms of his daughter's death, if she can be kept there forever? It was not just sensual. <br /> <br /> Still, he had no background information about "first book". Just some unclear information about "Father a brawl" and so forth. When talking to my father, what about his father? "You'll be in my place" <br /> <br /> Overall, a really cool movie. It was 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is made in "cheap"; Several sets and a set shot using several, and recycled, cheesy, "effects-before-before" effects were nothing without an impact film.
