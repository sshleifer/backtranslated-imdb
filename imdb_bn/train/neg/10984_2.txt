I saw this movie for two hours and there is no idea about it. Someone has been killed or maybe they did not, and probably someone did it or maybe they did not. It was good old days (bad old days?) When all the CBC came back to the memory of all the CBC Canadian movies stinkers. Recent stinkers have been exceptions but this confused hodge podge of conventional feminism, makes for the lost time in the mind of the flashback and mumbled dialogue. I could not find Margaret Atwood's book easy to read. This movie continues that fine Canadian heritage. It's not easy to see. Maybe people like this about the trend of the Chi Chi Toronto Cocktail parties. Our people are less motivated in festivities.
