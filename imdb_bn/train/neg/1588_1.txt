This was the worst movie I ever saw Billy Jane. I understand that this film was originally a showcase of newcomers, who did well for the newcomer, but above all, the movie was not believable. <br /> <br /> With all of the gunfight, you think police will interfere. Even having a bug on the currency hook was stupid. Shun suddenly realized that the bug was not realistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie has torn off together. Poor work Get a good writer. <br /> <br /> Counting was not consistent at all. It took war more time. And what's going on in an event that each time the Sun is going to explode, she'd be out of bullet. Once, I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In reality, the delivery character was stupid. Shaw was so stupid when she finally came out. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
