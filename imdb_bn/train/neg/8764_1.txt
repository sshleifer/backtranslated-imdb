This movie was absolute torture. After all, it's a huge 4+ hours long! True, there may be several points in the Kargil war which was captured and fought for war, but it was not necessary to show every single fight. So perhaps it's not a commercial film as a documentary, advertising. Surely it does not seem to be, enough background information was not provided and there were some errors. The order of war is so badly executed. I am very frustrated from people who have done good work in Border. Each war was correct as before. It was so expected. (It can be a spoiler.) The whole army moves, five or more soldiers per five thousand times per annum (using the same word each time), a main actor shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, "No, Do not get the stretcher, it will take 6 people from the battalion "and then an actor dies. That same thing happens again and again over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The film throw is too big for her own. Despite such a long movie, the characters were no better developed. The actresses had the smallest role. They are all dressed and illustrated to be the same. Two of their synchronized crying. It was very ridiculous. They move their hands and head at the same time and then bite them together wit <br /> <br /> the list just continues. I'm still going to forget something. However, I think you got the picture by spreading it to a large extent.
