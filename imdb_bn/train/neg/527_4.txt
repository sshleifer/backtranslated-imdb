A movie that died for less than enough. Vanessa Redgrave is dead but before she goes, she begins to tell her daughter about her life and her secret love story ... <br /> <br /> It is a film that has great appearance in her looks and expectations. There are actors and actresses because it actually seems to be something other than Potlobar. Do not be worse than Redgrave, Tony Colette, Glenn Close, Merrill Strip, Claire Dances, Natasha Richardson, Aileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all good acting), you'd expect more than a nasty story <br /> <br /> Wait till Harlequin romance.
