Quite honestly, I've seen the worst movie in Omega code for a long time. In the first 30 minutes, I tried to determine whether I wanted to sit and panic in my seat and demand to export. But since I can not see the first place (pauses), I think I can stay. And I do not think it might be worse. <br /> <br /> has done it. I'll quickly go through the lower points (including some spoilers): The terrible miscasting of Cashier Van Deeen Gillen Lane, two PhD as a motivational speaker. Characterization was inappropriate; For example, Lane, despite its credentials, is a complete nitwit. Then there is a hairy look of the fulfillment of Bible prophecies; We see a bunch of exciting news-soundbits with non-bona fide computer printed code in bible code. Also, the terrible "action" sequence: Lane escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and once the lane seems really in danger, it can be a dream sequence! It's nice to have the responsibility of writing in grammar school, but it is a non-disabled plot device in a motion picture. Pacing was bad: after a long time, the first third of the movie changed every 90 seconds. Later, panning improves, but there are still much more unnecessary jumping around. And as someone else mentioned, the year passed to someone still (not even Lane's young girl). That was disconcerting. <br /> <br /> There are some good things to do. The quality of the film (eg the lack of lack) is high and very interesting. Outdoor shots have been well done and location shooting adds a touch of reality. Also, in the last part of the film, Lane has called God (finally) for her help - in the moment when I find someone who does not accept Jesus as personal savior, it is very pleasant. But I like it because it hit me as the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it follows the major ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Characters, dialogues, instructions and acting are all done badly. Michael Iranside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just curious. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot becomes even more difficult and more attentive and the characteristic becomes more faded, then the film will get better. <br /> <br /> In short, the Omega code is frustrating. Definitely do not give this view. I think it's ** ten stars out <br /> <br /> <br />
