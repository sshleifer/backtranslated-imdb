Upcoming Attractions of "Order", it seems like a great horror mystery / thriller, but what we find is a plot that can all be combined together to make garbage together. <br /> <br /> The first movie closure consists of the first terrible dialogue and God influences horror. Acting was not something to be proud of, but Keith Ledger (I think I've spelled correctly) saved this movie in this section. <br /> <br /> For the sake of heaven: do not see this movie!
