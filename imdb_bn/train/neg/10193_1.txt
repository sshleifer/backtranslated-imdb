With this film, Bunuwel transformed the viewer into Manipulue with all the scenes in the film and clearly stated in the film that his work was 'materialism'. Of course, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'Shot by pure chance' is a clear set-up (when the poor goat falls 'accidentally' from the arch, you can see the gun smoke on the right side of the screen!). For others, concealing one of his important information: Hudhurogi was in such a way that for a particular reason, the film indicated. That is, the illness caused by the lack of tribe, salt (salt). These people (yet, questionable) may have endured ending telling the truth about this tribe because of their cretinism and Boonu only took the time to do its research (O ck, if he checked 'medicine' in a 'medical' dictionary). Instead, he continually judges his film, constantly speaking as his 'crotin', performing the act, dramatizing activities, and setting visual scenes created, it is very unacceptable for a documentarian who claims to work for it, the Almighty Objectivity . Bunuwel always talked about the film, saying that he does not have a single word about the film he is filming. He talks for them and even, judges them. This piece is faulty in its mainstream, its ideology and it is a real shame, it is considered as a great movie.
