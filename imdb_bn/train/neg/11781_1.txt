Godfather Part I had a wonderful look inside the legendary Corleone family and how all was an innocent young man but he also wanted to be in a part of the circumstances. The Godfather Part II shows that young people enter their new role, the continuity of character, and the complete loss of all innocence, they enter deeper into the depth of crime. The first two episodes of this adaptation of Michael Corleone have been made for the greatest tragedies in the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> Then came with The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the Corleone family's aging don. He pardons his past actions, not by subtle conduct, but trying to use his power and accept all his wrongdoing and forgiveness from others. Michael Corleone is that complex character very cliche and uncharacteristic. Michael plans to use the power for his plans overthrowing the ambitious young disciple and his enemies. Michael's girl is finally a victim of the ongoing battle of the crowd and her death probably has been revealed to Michael that his whole life as a Don was in vain because he failed in a thing which he had reason to add to his position: to protect his family. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Before Part III was created, the Godfather Sea was an emotional story of an innocent young man's journey in the darkness that left Michael unbelievably unfortunate and abandoned something that was always the most important to him and his people: family loyalty. Part III Michael's picture portrays a man who has always been a victim of the situation. It first weakens the meaning of the two two films. <br /> <br /> The Godfather Part III is a horrific mess of a movie that should never have been created. The only solution to solve the problem in the final installment of The Godfather films is that it does not exist, and this song really ends with the terrible work of killing a member of his own family with Michael's threat.
