I have read some other comments and I have to agree with them without getting the last one. I thought it was going to end ... in the end. It keeps running your mind and then keep splat. I did the last few minutes that lasted a movie without a complete mess, it did not make it clear. They were working to run out of money just to finish well. Firstly, they got a mysterious thing that makes people invisible, then they talk about a guy about Area 51 (which lets you think about the alien). I think the performer and actress fine just went to the script just like it. However, if you do not see this movie then finally be ready to be frustrated.
