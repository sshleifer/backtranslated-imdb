I liked the first "Azumi" movie. I saw Mrs. Etoo's presence of her different TVs and I saw my fair share of Samurai and Nenja Flickr. I want to say that this movie was much weaker than me. <br /> <br /> When film cast and set up "Azumi", they were able to do better with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in the part, and with very poor, unconvincing, and wood acting Sprinkle <br /> <br /> When they were annoyed to mention the first movie, they were in a manner that was very loose and weak. The character of the title "Azumi" is the best of a group of higher murderers. In "Azimi 2" he seems to be less and less dominant. <br /> <br /> It does not seem to be a total loss. There were some modest war scenes and some upper-upper letters. Unfortunately, the movie is full of the common reality that is Susu Kaneko and Yoshiki Kawajiri Raihi Kitamura and Isho Kirima. The next two really feel their "monga" feelings in their scrapplets, where the former never got "perfectly".
