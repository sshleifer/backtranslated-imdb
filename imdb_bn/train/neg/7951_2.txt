I got a low score of 'Kohi Jiko' because it was not a bad movie, because it is not something worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Hishio-Hassan Hou's work, but uninitiated (I included) Yasujiro Ozu for 'Kohi jik√¥' is notified as a tribute. (A Japanese director whose last film was The Path, in 1962), the film is very vague work ... very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto 'Yoko' is a jobless, terrible character who spends his time in his local coffee shop or a Taiwanian singer who he likes uninterrupted investigation. Along with her acting star, who works in a CD store and occasionally engages with Otaku's interest in trains. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The old reality can be seen on a daily basis. Hou has taken these simple moments of life, but this vintet is completely useless for creating or viewing it without any meaning.
