This movie is my favorite one. It's really no good, but it's great to laugh. Conversation can be incredibly ridiculous and bad (for example, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Of course." "We think you can answer us.") Any war less or supernatural Do not forget to look for those who attack the main character of the Brock, Ophy white guy. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best friends in the movie!
