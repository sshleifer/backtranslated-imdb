Okay, I can break it for your son ... it's fierce! <br /> <br /> Roger Kumble was so fond of the first cruel Intentions, why did he do so badly? I'm sorry but this movie is stupid, if its series is broadcast, it can be realistic ... this movie is a cross! Bad acting lot * Shower scene note * "Kiss cousin" What kind of line is that? "Wet when sleeping" ????????? Can we say DOHM! This movie was a try, I'll give it to you, but it was very stupid! They even tried to make fun by giving stupid utterances to the housemaid .... It was kind. Not to mention that they were all made in the scene just like the original cast. They look at their motives or something different as they are! I really really like the board, which does not happen occasionally when watching it. For those who liked it ... okay, what do you think? Can you possibly choose another movie with other actors and extraordinary Sarah Michelle Gallery? It's a movie of Sarah Michelle Gallery, but the duh! But there is no crime in this movie, Amy Adams Oh yes, when is the heart of Sebastien? Esse!
