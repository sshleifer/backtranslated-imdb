The Deathstaller, directed by John Watson, and it plays Rick Hill, the creator of any kind and famous, if I understand correctly? Following the plot, the Destitute (Hill) tries to get something from the evil lord, and he will go to the cave of the Lord. He met many dwarfs and monsters during the journey, and setting very close to tocanean, and certainly Canaan Barbarian. It is free from the huge success of the Conn, and although it is a very stupid film, it has a lot of great trash meteites and trash fans are advised to tolerate and offer film junk! <br /> <br /> There are not many cinematic qualifications of this photo. The couple in the scene are almost atmospheric and attractive, but what does the deathstalker focus on, the naked women and the huge muscles of the heels. Women are usually helpless victims and very fool, too, so it is very macho film and thus please many feminists! The war scene is nothing special and beautiful dull, and monsters are not something special. And other aspects of the film are also very amateur and badly done, but what did you expect from such a low budget effort? This conan tries to be as great but quite miserably fails. I said, please this Turkey movie fans but nobody can do it. This section is so bad that it is very bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! If you have cups of bad movies, try it and have fun, but if you do not understand the "bad bad movie", stay away from it. And if someone can not stand great nudity then stay away as well. There is more nudity than violence here, and due to these scenes, the film has a rating. Otherwise this could be a family of secure PG family! <br /> <br /> 4/10
