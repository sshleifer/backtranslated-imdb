<br /> <br /> The movie "Slogs" is unique because it is a good guy in this horror story of the title Padma Bridge. You see, these poor slogans have changed through the pollution of the wicked and there is no meaning to pollute them, they are just eating torch and slaughtered poison with poisonous tooth, but the slogs are not low. The real bad people are people who actively try to destroy our favorite slogans, or when they face them, they put pressure on them. <br /> <br /> For example, go to the person where the document holds the slogan. When they did not come to them anywhere in this demonic hands, they were hanging on comfortable work documents, and they expressed normal reaction, protect themselves and bite people. Now, instead of trying to bite his slogan, this man screams his Greenhouse like a fool, spreads some very unstable chemicals, starts a fire, strikes a chest on his own and cuts his hands - then the combination of fire and orthopedic chemicals His house exploded. How can you blame that slugs? <br /> <br /> This movie is less than favorable that illustrates a portrait of people. The characters of this movie include mobile phones Sheriff, who hates everyone, drunk hik means his dog, and tall shadowik, whose wife is at least twenty-five years old. There is also a set of drug addicts <br /> <br /> which invades while coupons, and see the skin cells of our skinny long-haired fixes. Meanwhile, there is a man who looks like a giant Leslie Nilsson who "has no right to announce your birthday!" For some reason Finally, this paradox of paradoxes comes out of the mouth of the classic "Pod People" man, whose face explodes after eating a slug-lace salad (is easily responsible for helpful helper, harmful slogans). <br /> <br /> People are regarded as rapists, such as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and a pointless scene. In the climatic scenes of the film, the renowned people tried to burn the slogans which are helplessly helpless in the sewer, because they are stupid, and people are shining everywhere. They only do more harm than the slugs! <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know that I do, you would appreciate the "slugs". If you are a fan of bad movies, you would also appreciate this Cufffest from the director of "Pies" and "Pod People". Fairly bad acting, shameless dialogue, unreasonable plot twists, hair-shaped special effects, dull scene, and poor dubbing to keep your attention.
