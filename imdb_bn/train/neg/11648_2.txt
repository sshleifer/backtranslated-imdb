Already floating around that time was not enough, we have a lam of the Godfather clone here from the director of the IL Consiliary (1973), which I saw earlier this year. The name of the MARC-standard entered at this time on the TV savalas who belatedly entered into the proceedings and seen from behind from the first, instead of camping hanging towards her flower and wearing a bit in the style of French painters! Along with not looking at the Sicilian as well, he sports any other kind of access to his familiar drill. Then Antonio Sabato, creates an unlicensed gangster - in addition to a preventable leading man; His relation with Savalas, which becomes a parent in the eyes of the eyes, is also disrespectful (especially later on he is romantically associated with the enthusiastic teenage nephew later)! Besides, for a gangster flick, there are precious little steps to talk about, and none of this is memorable (although clinical finals set is fairly manageable); In addition, Francesco De Mossy is a score worthy but nothing else. Eventually, the rental tenant I rent the rent DVD starts with the credit from the Middle East so that no cast member - even the title of the movie is listed!
