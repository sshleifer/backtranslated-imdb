Tasan - The title itself explains the nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> Such films are actually made for flop. Yash Raj Films produces movies which are shameful compared to C-grade movies. Or even some C-grade movies have good and fun stories from Tasan. Tussan burst into a box office in a very excited and confident way, which it must deserve. <br /> <br /> I think the worst movie made from this prestigious Yash Raj Films banner. How can the new Bijay Krishna Acharya handle such a huge project, which has no real idea of ​​any activity? Like Dhyan, Sanjay tried to follow Gandhvi's path but eventually he got hurt. The action scenes are more than comics or cartoon movies made to tarnish the audience. <br /> <br /> The story loses its meaning and material to the viewers' hearts humbly. In most cases, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the language and vocabulary of his Tamil language Rajinikanth's body language. I am neither Saif nor Akshay, but instead of Akshay Kareena, instead of Akshay, we will have to go to Saif. I just hope it's from the beginning, but in the end it has disappointed me with Claymax Truth. Saif is the master behind all courage, and Akshay joins the middle. In any film, the final character should be judged with the award of the whole story and rewards or should be given a reward for the creditworthiness. And Tasan loses in this way, and unexpectedly fails to hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay is nothing new to show his gimmick but still reminisces his earlier films. He likes to influence his fans seriously and again to create new images. Saif had great work in the race, and now he has come back to this film with his lovely nature. But he has developed himself in the field fully played. Last but not least about Kareena. She looks really warm with a bikini dress, who has been accused of being too thin. But I do not think so myself, instead she becomes thin. Yes thinner !!! It's a good reason to attract the main male (or man, male) Along with them, Saif's son Ibrahim finally died like that of the young Saif. I hope he will continue to act as a career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this Tasan are mentally unreliable or still want to go back to childhood, or want to be admitted to a place of refuge. Yash Raj Films's proposed project has been damaged by deputy director director Vijay Krishna Acharya. In the future, he should practice at least 5 years before practicing and practicing. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to rate the good star in such junk films.
