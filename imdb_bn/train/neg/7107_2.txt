I'm sure MMDB likes any kind of messaging message that MST3K makes fun of. After watching this and "Weorolf" both and how they are reading dozens of comments about it, I'm sure there's some playful going on here. Many people say that those who hate it "are scared by Gore", "do not know good nights" or such stuff. Well, I do not really care about Gore, but I want to happen something in a movie! This is mostly sitting and sitting! Or walking around the house / garden! You need to do something to give a movie atamosafer, you just do not see the slightest scenes of it that somebody roams and straises. Oh, and "you think"? Yes, I was thinking, "Come on! You're @ # $ 0 &% !!" I've never seen the worst horror movie! <br /> <br /> p. For the record, I'm in Hara's old style, Dracula, a big fan of Frankenstein, the kind of thing.
