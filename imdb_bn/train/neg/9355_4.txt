Recently I recently caught Marilyn Miller's films because they were not shown in TCM in the UK. I'm curious about these years because it was one of the superstar's 20-year-olds. What he really liked was that some stars of this era still shine a bit through the magician, but not for Miller. Her dance seems strange and badly dancer, her song is somewhat limited, and she thinks Ruby Keller as Hepburn as actress. Like more bad people, the film was tired of musical instruments, almost all the musical numbers were deleted. So we went with a little real appeal with a comedy of that time. That's why he is paying $ 500,000! So I have only two conclusions. Then he did the film badly or did not have any talent. I think the truth is closer to the later than before.
