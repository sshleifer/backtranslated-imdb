First off, lead, Brad Dourif is a chick. If you try to take this movie seriously, I'm sure that he will destroy it for you. If you do not take him very seriously, he's actually kind of fun to see. As another critic, I liked the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dowryf are announcing their love for each other - drowning flame shooting jets from her hand in the car. Another great cam-scene, revolving around John Landes, revolves around, as a radio studio producer. Actually, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie as an unpleasant smile - I'm not sure Tobie Hooper means this way.
