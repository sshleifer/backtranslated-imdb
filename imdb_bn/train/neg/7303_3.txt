The first feature film directed by Cabin Fawar Eli Roth Roth and Randy Perlstein wrote this script from a story of Roth. This is a zombie film, for reference to George Romero and his previous "live dead movie" to the original Texas Chess Massacarot Sam Rammie "Evil Dead" There is nothing real here, and the story is not mandatory. Acting is consistent with this style, it is true that the story has failed. We have already seen this movie and made well. Havig said, after commercial acquisitions, if artistic success was not available from this film, then Roth decided that he was a director and was uncomfortable, violent, enthusiastic, vain (even more ambitious) cone festival hostel. He should have left when he was behind. Cabin Faware is not a good movie, but it is a work of art compared to the hostel. I hope that someone (especially a psychologist) confirms this guy that the wrong choice of filmmaking is the choice. Cabin fever, as weak as 3/10 Smile as a weak hostel.
