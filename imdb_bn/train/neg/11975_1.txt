How long were these pieces of this long TV on TV? It's terrible. It wants to shoot me It is so fake that it is actually worse than the scientists of 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than to see this dirty. I remember watching it when it came out first. I thought, this could be interesting, then I was really, absolutely, insane, ridiculously stupid, it really was. It's so bad that I actually pulled my pocket knife and locked my hand in the table. <br /> <br /> Please stop seeing all these and other reality shows for people, they are the trash that is jamming the network and need some ideas to create that the standard programming can be canceled.
