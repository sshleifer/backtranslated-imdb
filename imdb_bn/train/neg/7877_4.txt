The makers of this photo have created the future where abortion and birth control in every country is not illegal, but women are accused of killing and sent away to serve long prison sentences. In other words, this film is the worst nightmare of every liberal! The political agenda is so strong here and the film style is so low that it loses vapor rapidly. Regardless of the fence that you're beside, I recommend it to be omitted.
