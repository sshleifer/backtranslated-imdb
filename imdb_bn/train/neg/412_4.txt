In the history of science fiction, two special themes consistently expressed interest, initially a pre-film era was discovered in literature, and then the filmmakers and writers repeatedly repeated with degrees of success. The first theme of time travel, a continuous charm for fans of the film, as well as a written word, has recently been screened with another version of HG Wells Classic, "Time Machine". The second theme, which guides the audience to capture, is the invisibility, which imagines Imagine with its impossible and numerous possibilities. And this theme has again become the basis for a movie from HG Wales's classic, 'The Invibable Man', which is realized here, directed by 'Hall Man', Paul Worhawane, and Kevin Bacon, and Elisabeth Schieu. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Kain (Bacon) and his colleagues have been experimenting for the US government for a while, invented the likelihood of invisibility and the effectiveness, which they eventually achieved by Primates which they tested their methods. In fact, they have been advancing on this point to ensure that the invisibility affects; Their only problem is bringing the matter to the real 'visible' condition. But this is a problem, however, Cain has solved many hours of hard work after hard work and lab - or so he thinks. And when a live subject of her live thesis is successful, she decides to present the results to the Board of Management, so that it can maintain the fund for the continuation of the project. <br /> <br /> At the last moment, sinking in the kine, fears that the control of this project will be separated from it before going to the next level - a human test. And he accepted this as his subject, assisting his research team that he was approved by the Board to do these things. But something goes wrong, and the kine is trapped in terms of invisibility; And before he and his team struggled to find a significant dilemma solution before it was too late, it started to take a toll on all Keynesian minds. And suddenly, the fear of losing control and control becomes unexpected, because he faces the imminent danger of losing more than himself. Now there is a very real chance that he could lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> He set a good pace and used F / X to his great effect, Allow development to decrease. Anyone who is familiar with the 'Invisible Man', or indeed anyone who can logically follow the story's progress, should know that Cain is not scheduled for a happy time. Still, Verhoeven is a style in the story which is definitely going to capture attention and engage its audience. But he thinks he is looking forward to climax, and just as he has made his film so far successful, he has been nominated to enter into a final sequence, which is nothing more than a selfless blood-e-gore. That betrays its audience and everything that she has done for the film before the festival. Rather than finding an intelligent resolution for Kennen's sorrow, and instead of using some innovation and imagination to take the film to its inevitable conclusion, Veriovan took less roads, and although it may be completely successful on the adhesive level, any meaning can be derived from the story so much in Asia. Like dissolve, it creates a memorable movie Some of the people. And it's embarrassing, because Vivienne is at a higher level than what has been given in this style, and she can unnecessarily sink it down. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon did well to create a credible character, only on the surface, which apparently works perfectly for Verhoeven's purposes. Bacon's film has a depth, but there is more to do with his director's agenda than his own playing capabilities. Verhoeven not only allows Bain to develop any quantity of Caine; Character is basically a ship which can build its story in Verhoeven, and on that side, it works. The film was well served, however, Veronique and Bacon cooperated more closely for Kerin and the audience to develop at least one bond that raised some psychological involvement in the audience, something that could draw some of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trying to experiment, but it is basically a void As part of a challenge, especially syu actor's eligibility. The same thing can be said about Kim Dickens (the 2001 film's superb, 'behind things behind the sun'). Its character, Sarah Kennedy, works a bit more than the F / X support. Both actors are so much capable, and here's a better reward than all given to work with them. <br /> <br /> Assistant actor Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joe Saltnik (Frank)), Mary Randall (Janice) and William Deven (Dr Crumar). Concentrate on a point and even succeeding at a certain level (low), 'Hall Man' is a movie that can think about what you can do. Like an annual firearms display, it will give you some tiny thrill thrills, but after some time it will start mixing with others you see, without it except for something special. And it is very bad, because the talents and power of the involved are given here, it can be much more. I rate this 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
