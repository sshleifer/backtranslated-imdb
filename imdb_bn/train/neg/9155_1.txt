The worst movie I've ever seen in this movie. It was like a "homework assignment" for a film class. When it is trying to relay "message" it misses the mark completely. The letters are hugely poorly played and for a plot ... well it's completely ridiculous. The cover shot reminds me that it can be a decent movie, co-actor is handsome and it's about it. The morality of this movie: Ever covers a movie across it! Save your time, money and energy and create your own home movie and you'll be much better than me. It was painful to see and I am really surprised that anyone will spend money to create and distribute it!
