They saw me at school and it was terrible. Movies are old. These incidents have become confusing because the story has become more interesting to meet with fiction. Teachers talked about it as a behavior, but it was really a painful boring experience. I've played those fewer people who are acting, but most of them do what they do in the real life of the movie. It often happens for very greasy performances. Also, often the story gets gently aggressive and distant. I do not like the way to write something on the line and they wish they had more money. Although, it was educational, funny, suspicious and written from the hip, it became annoying, dry, distant, and old. I hope nobody will take the time to watch this movie because you can not see it.
