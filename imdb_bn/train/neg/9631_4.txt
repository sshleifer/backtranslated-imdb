The film is John Ben Stirler Charisma and J. Due to Anthony's reputation, he appealed to the public to appeal. Looks like we have a recipe for a successful title, but there is no success in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that polly played well. This kind of character is perfectly suited to her. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Meet your parents" with Bam Stella's parents, but comic scenes in this movie are less than the ones mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special. Things can be better with these two well-paid actors - but what can they do if there is such a bad story and a script? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
