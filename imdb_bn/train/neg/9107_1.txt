I was crazy about someone making this movie. I was more angry, I was sitting to see it after a few minutes of my life. I could have been working in a wax and have been more entertained. At least cherry laughs before hurting me. I was a little confused at first but then I grabbed it and realized what was going on. At this point the film crosses half way, and yes I'm a flashing but I always want to see everything at the end. So I stuck it in. I saw it all. Cruel intent is not only as interesting as the actors, they are not only believable. I've seen my nephew cry for a more firmer focus than in the film's supposedly pictured film. If you like bad movies with bad acting watch.
