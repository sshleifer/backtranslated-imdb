I recently saw a site that shows public domain movies. The film was on its long list of movies and I thought I would be hallucinating in such objectionable headlines and proofs. But, no, what it really was. And since this movie was about 27 minutes long, so I decided to try it. It has become to be some porn movie, I will stop watching. Instead, it has turned into the most bizarre film I've ever seen. The Danish production system tried with a budget of about $ 49, so that most of the gay men could create a star tractor-style film, killing all women, eliminating women's torture and traveling to the galaxy. Earth! And in every case, they meet cheers and thank you guys from the planet now. <br /> <br /> Fine, this is not. I have ever heard letters with some of the most obscene and kids names, I do not even think I can write them at IMDb without removing my thoughts! However, despite all this cumbersome crappiness, it is curiously watchable and worth a peek. But, as I've already mentioned, this is only a movie for adults because of crude names and strange issues (though there is no nudity). However, this movie gave me 1001 questions WHW would make it, why did it and the WHO create viewers for the purpose? It may not be the worst thing I have ever seen, but it's probably weird and probably the most aggressive!
