This movie is not worth your time. His reliance on New Age's mysticism serves as its semi-attractive confusion. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, what? Bola Bola. Their motivation and motivation are suspicious because they encourage you to not focus on film flaws, but their influenced message of New Age Consciousness. <br /> <br /> So, some thirty-thirty people will be fit for missionary Christians, or do Islamic fundamentalists enter positive ratings about movies / televisions that support their opinions? Despite the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth on its supposed historical basis? I do not hope <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will follow me to tell the flowers about this movie.
