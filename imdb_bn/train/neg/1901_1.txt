This review may have some spoilers. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Actually it moves well and plays quite well. But a big Hollywood budget does not change that even the original plot is more credible. For those who do not know, the original plot was a thief working as insurance inspector. Who would doubt them But hb Almost every aspect of this has also changed. Halqi's original, remix is ​​a very good movie, until we can get the final Chase scene, it is part of the 74th edition which makes it great. This version consumes only 10 minutes of water, and it ends in a giant special effect that takes all the credibility out of consciousness. Where the original Chase was very believable, the star stunt driver, who did all his stunts, remixed flat in the last 15 minutes. My suggestion, if you want to watch a classic car charging movie, add the original dargah bint to your local rental era and clear the new remix.
