I should have heard. I was warned, and still, I paid for money after reading all these reviews, knowing the original "very bad it is good" and that part 2 is not suitable even in this section, even me, even me. Can not resist. What happened here? Part one was Hilarius, it was a lot of politically wrong, and other crazy, fat entertainment, and this one, God's Green can not be a bad variant of the world, basket case 2, Hell, and even Troll 2. This is really the worst series in history and it basically says something under ground barrel, considering groundbreaking. Criminally insane part 2 was a totally different brand of bad. The video has shot, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 of the original flashbacks and over it, crazy, fat ethel has lost a part of its hole. I mean, really, what kind of a joke this sick?!? Many thanks, Nick Milliard 1/1
