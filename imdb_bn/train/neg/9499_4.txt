I was a poor documentary in the movie. Nothing has been discussed in the substance. It did not offer ideas cheap and new anything. The film is wonderful or romance or something that really drives science. Most scientists appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. One woman said that her rewards were not entirely important, but only helped the children. He said, after a 10-minute scene, he explained all his rewards. Playing "gentle scientist, what are we?" "I have a dance equation on my head," another said. I do not see anything that explains us. It has covered significant impact on science in our culture. Science politics is a little touching. <br /> <br /> 10-14 year olds do not feel bad for them. Furthermore, I felt it annoying and unrevealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
