The story is weird and long, it is also difficult to keep your eyes open, performance and dialogue, sucking. I suggest you a caffeine-driven friend to be on time for some good-effects. Why did they bring Alcrase? In this case, melting becomes increasingly difficult. All the time, I wonder what is the target for this movie? Lam subdivisions (such as the Kannabalism US Army-Captain) are full-shiny, it is low-grade in every aspect. BTWT This movie is banned in Germany!
