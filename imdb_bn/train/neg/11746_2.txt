Well this picture was definitely a fair amount of hip; The Toronto Film Festival starts with reviews on the CTC radio station. Apparently a refreshed, fragile, funny indie movie. I was looking forward to it for several months. <br /> <br /> How can I keep it simple? It sucked in a very big way. Adam Sandler is an exercise in cinematic lameness to feel humorous. <br /> <br /> The best it was gently and the worst coma inspiration. An unexpected script is badly managed and shoddily edited in a ramshackle mess. <br /> <br /> And what was the 500db louder than the rest of the music? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> There is no comparison!
