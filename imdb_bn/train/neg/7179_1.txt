What's so good about her "message" - this movie is a sudden twisted trainwrack - horror performance, hair camera work - why do not you know why she agreed to try - she is so shy. You keep an eye on the DVD and follow him around the way his camera is - he just gets his attention - he likes to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker Eric Shafaar. Some of the pictures of this image of the city's Youth Center and New Age churches have shown - where the affected people are confiscated by looking at the determination and attention to attracting their image - but as a film it is sticky, anticipated and humorous.
