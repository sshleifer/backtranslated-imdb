Action Movie Dispensation with an Attractive Premier: Must be a young Mafia slayer (Chandler) Must show his master that he is a good man for this service, so he is going to California to read something with a famous professional murderer (Beluschi). First and foremost work: killing a young woman (Li) which is absolutely strange for all of them. But is he a simple target? The film is based on the main idea and the result is simply bad routine; Even the weird twist does not save the movie. Good performance by the Chandler. I give this a 4 (four) one.
