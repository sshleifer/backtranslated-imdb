Below is a bit of a spoiler, which may surprise one unexpected and really funny scene in this movie. There is information about the first picture in this series. <br /> <br /> I grabbed this image in DVD, who gave my roommate a gift. It came as a set together with the first film in the "Blind Dead" series. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly much worse than the first, "la noké dell teror sío". In addition, the features of the first film have significantly changed. To boot, the movie was dubbed in English (the first was a subtitle), which I found to be confusing. The idea behind the series is that a local branch of Knight Templar was involved in a serious and secret ceremony in the distant past. In search of this crime, local farmers killed Templar in such a way that their eyes could not be used, so they prevented them from retaliating from returning from hell. We jumped into modern times, where due to some incident the Templars decided to revenge their villagers, whose ancestors got involved in their first place. Of course, since the unfortunate knights have no eyes, they can only find their prey when they make any kind of noise. <br /> <br /> Templars had secret orders from the 12th century. Crusades. By the Pope and others in the early 1300's, they were almost pretty close to 150 years before suppression. Because they were secret, especially for the initiation, there was always rumor about their rituals. Also, on the way to organize the society, you did not have the necessity of supervising the things of church officials, which means there was no internal people while warming things up. And, due to the nature of their trial, they are tortured in confession. This order was the most powerful in France, but Portugal and Spain were present where these films took place. <br /> <br /> Where the first film was directly from the virgin body of a virgin and drinks blood. Breast shots are here, of course, it's a horror movie after all), and then once the night comes back to life, they attack their victims by eating alive and sucking their blood; This sequel, all this invisible. To sacrifice a virgin is still the same scene (restoring, not the same footage), but they throw blood in a bowl and drink it. So, when they come back, they only hack people with the death of their sword or birds, which I want to tell is a very effective way to annoy your visitors. There are also problems at one time: Dating in the first movie is very close to the Templars, where they are now saying that these people are 500 anniversaries of this group of people burnt in this group, which is around 1473. Templars could lose their eyes so much less interesting. First, they have pecked by the crow. Now they are easily burned, and quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, and probably it was mine, but it looks like many people are coming back from this movie's first movie. Despite the death). Not really a problem, since the film is completely different and not in the continuation of a series continuation, but nothing strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is that a wealthy colleague who uses makes it a break for zip when exposed children are distracted. This rich man was already feeding his father's father to try to get a zip, so he asked to find out and find his father. It comes out of the blue and it is easily the most fun scene in the film. Of course, why children do not die at this moment, it is more and frustrating for awesome fans. <br /> <br /> I probably could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad to be funny, so it ends up as a medieval horror movie. Most of the people in this movie have hid a few people in the church, everyone is trying to escape from the darkness to make them move around alone. When the movie ends, you do not surprise the result. Actually, quite frustrating. If you are in the novelty of Spanish horror film, see the first movie, which is at least some innovative ideas and so is not expected results.
