Two years after the blockade of the Iranian embassy in 1982, the children's dramatic SAS Rescue and the Falkland Islands were involved in the war with Argentina, a better film than the Gong-Ho "SAS" film was created. Iran has put an end to the coup, while Britain's number one action hero, Lewis Collins, is using. Throw in Edward Woodward and some well-known actors and you have your winner in your hand? ... maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation critically, though the acting is just the second rate. This is like a movie long episode of "The Professiones", but without the source. This film goes faster somewhere and is quite predictable. Perhaps the poet Bocoly saw this movie and Roger Moore decided to drown Levi's Collins as replacement for Totten James Bond. See if a fan of Louis Colins or General SAS staff saves you time.
