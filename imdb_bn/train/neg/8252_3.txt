What was the word suddenly? It sounds like all dubbed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = Bad. Practice = Bad (even Dogra, and we live in Scotland), Acting = Bad, Harp = Bad, Sex Scenes - Bad / Crunchable. <br /> <br /> Yet we saw it till the end of disbelief. How can the actor make so good roll call so badly? Will they get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, bad, bad. However, we gave it 3 because we were at least excited to see it because of its bizarre plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Old critics - I totally agree, this is a romantic Fars from the 1940s. How was it made in 2004? <br /> <br /> All right, all right. They were a wonderful house in Bristol. Dougay was an excellent boat. Jennifer looked a little outfit pretty. But how did sister get all the men?
