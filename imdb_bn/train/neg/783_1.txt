I saw this show and I simply found it interesting. It may have been the first episode. Recently I realized that ABC is playing many stupid shows nowadays and going down as a station. All characters in this show are very bad actors, but if they are good, the jokes and scripts are quite awesome and will still shine. I would say that I think this program will be canceled, but seeing how they are doing awesome things for the quality of the ABC show how they are doing it can only be made because they are average compared to them.
