OK. I know that the 80s Hughes movies were flat, so the expectations of this film were quite low. <br /> <br /> Still, after sitting in this frog, I seem to be coming out of my head: <br /> <br /> I was just sitting in the movie Rob Loire of 80, in which There was no nudity and there was only sex in them. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrifying, the characters are annoying and flat, a complete humiliation of Oxford's screenplay, and the writing scenes are unexpected, unfamiliar, and wrong. <br /> <br /> As long as you do some vaid Alley Shady or Amanda Pay (or I guess), Rob Loew), there really is no reason to see this one.
