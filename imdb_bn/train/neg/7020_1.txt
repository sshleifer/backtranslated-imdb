The smarter was probably not the longest 90-minute moment of my life. There was no laughing there; Actually, I do not remember to laugh at all. Diane Keaton was suddenly a stranger like a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoder, imposed a textbook on the mother's character, which was a shameless woman, who was clearly suffering from any type of personality disorder. She is impressive, conniving, melodramatic, child, narcissistic, and all the worst, annoying. <br /> <br /> I think I should mention the other letters briefly, but why bother? It was a long string of movies, Klichspeople, socially inactive remote relatives, who are just "art", misunderstanding and long-suffering, but anyway still loving father, silent-intelligent wife who is not only 'and do not accept it (but eventually goes out of the contradiction And come back home by resigning), the shepherds who are sitting in the house, all who like to sneak and chuck chicks away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a lover. I have never been a fan of Diane Keaton and why Smith reminded me. Overacting is overacting, no matter how many photos you have made at your head. His efforts in physical comedy were especially humiliating. What is the director thinking? <br /> <br /> When I liked Dax Shepherd and sometimes with Leiv Tyler, his acting was very lazy and neutral, it was clear that this actor also blamed the film. That was not right, because I did not. Keaton's endless self-absorption was helpless and occasionally Shepard's dislike seemed to be realistic to him. At the end of the movie I wanted to choke myself <br /> <br /> Horror.
