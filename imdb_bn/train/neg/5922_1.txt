My mother keeps a cassette in this movie that threatens her for a movie loving person who bothers her. It stinks everything about me <br /> <br /> As it is a true classic <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Are you unknowingly watching a good movie and accidentally voted for it? <br /> <br /> Everybody involved in the filming process must be forced to see at least a small part of this film. It should be believed that the film should be kept sacred and it should be respected as the symbol of the film's terrible tide.
