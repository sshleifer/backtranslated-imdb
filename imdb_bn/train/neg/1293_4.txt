I'm probably one of the few visitors who would not recommend this movie. Visually stunning ideas (like each frame still seems worth a print), like all of Anne Lee's, I was really frustrated by the disruptive motion of the film. It was really too long. <br /> <br /> This story is set in Missouri during the civil war, and a young man joining the militant force of Bushwalkar (Rodeel), confronted by the guerrilla-led Confederate fighters, fighting with the feudalists, their union opponents He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chicks, played by Skit Ulrich, shot Chilean father and then joined the team after the shot and burned his house, perhaps Joyvarkers. This story follows their interaction with Roodle and Chills' incidents and other victims of war, among which the Bushwalkars (played by Daniel Hult in Jeffrey Wright), and with the former slaves for the war widows war directed by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed as if the film was about to develop the story in every interesting comment, it would turn into something else and release unused things. For example, due to the collision of Rudol's clan, the former Slave Hollt was briefly shown by some contradictions in communalism and protocols due to the collision and then released to the film. A young woman, Vladimir / Rape, hates Riddle in Bushvakker and most aggressions and violence against him indicate, but we do not know why. Some characters never feel the surface; I think that this movie embraces many of them as well as accepts huge amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical details were excellent. I love watching housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I think the main actor has done an excellent job to make the characters human, though they have become somewhat frustrated with the dialogue. If you really enjoy the history or not the huge Ang Lee fan, pass it on.
