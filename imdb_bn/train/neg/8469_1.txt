Given the "kids like this" issue, may be a decent film. But instead it has reduced the free TV movie of the week, which is not going to go much for it. The acting is inaccessible, the plot of predictive and direction exists. For a better film, "Le Hutemme Jar", try a great movie, a movie that is really concerned with the people of Down syndrome. "Kids Like It" These are simply used as an excuse for the crying attitude. Very scary. 1/10
