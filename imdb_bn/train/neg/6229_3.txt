Above all, let's get some things here: a) I'm an anime fan- always as a matter of fact (I used to always see speed racers in pre-school). B) I like many B-movies because they are colorful. C) I like Godzilla movies - many. <br /> <br /> When the movie comes first, it seems like it's going to be your normal B-movie, which suddenly falls below the FX, but all of a sudden - Boom! Anime comes! When this movie was flying WWWAAAAYYYY <br /> <br /> <br /> Animation is too bad and cheaper, worse than crystalline for Speed ​​Razor! Actually, it's very cheap, in a few scenes of the movie 1, one is "obviously" remembered when a child goes to a school ... and it's the same child again! FX is very terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Apart from this, live action changes in animation were unobtrusive, conversations and voices (especially English dub, which I saw) were horrible and I wanted to ask my father to take the tapes from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing to save me was the MTS3 (to select the Rose Season) and the curiosity and feedback like Joel / Mike. Actually, the only way to enjoy the meetings of this movie, and to survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm planning to show it to another Otaku Paul in Halloween. Movie night Because it's stupid, very painful and unexpectedly at the same time, I'm giving this movie 3/10, I'm basically giving it a boost from 0.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> (According to my grading scale: 3/10 is quite annoying and bad, if you find a way to make it fun, it will be fun 15)
