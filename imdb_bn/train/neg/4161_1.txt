A stuttering plot, unintended character and sub-par (talk to a minimum) conversation affect the production of this TV which can be even attractive with billions of dollars of budget. <br /> <br /> The letters are not trusted, their motives, actions or their professed profession. Plot like a bad Dungeons and Dragon (TM) hack but read like the Plasma Rifle and Ball Field. There are serious continuity problems and this writer, at least, won the degree of uninterrupted interaction among characters. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a plug. Look at any episode of the Dark Angel and you will have good acting, dialogue and plot. Ish
