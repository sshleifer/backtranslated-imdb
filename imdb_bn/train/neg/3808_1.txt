Warning! This review will conclude the movie, "Scoop." If you do not want to finish the movie, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think of "Annie Hall". <br /> <br /> It gets a star because you can see Hugh Jackman in the nude chest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A wizard, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Who even made an earlier film, never remembers the dais. Perhaps Alan had a stroke that was notified by press. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the previous films, Woody Allen, who is now a Septuagnerian, eventually allowed the leadership of a small man. Get the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. Actually, this plot has been created so that the girl does not get any. <br /> <br /> There is an elementary scene where Johanan, there is no reason in the center of the film, lets herself get drunk, and seduced by a powerful, old director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happened. It's a "slam, bamboo, I have to go" moment. It is not related to a plot, and it makes Joansen cheaper in the eyes of the viewer. Why did Allen add unnecessary scenes to the movie? It shows a strong director - like Allen - having sex with female lead. Allen gets his cake and gets it to eat. <br /> <br /> Johanan is not yet an actress. She does not know how to command the screen without wearing a tough, less cut top. She imitated Allen in a few scenes and it seems just weird and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not inscribe his doll as a doll which can not work without a ghost or an old man, and even less terrible magician, what he has to do in each house. <br /> <br /> She is almost half of Jackman's age, and she comes together as a very vicious screen presence in her scene. <br /> <br /> Those heroes who do not cover the breasts of the audience love the heroes, and Jackman is more deserving - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and organization and an actress who can express those qualities. <br /> <Hugh Jackman is deceived by the same script. Allen obviously can not stand that Jackman is so well-looking and young, and so he does not say anything to Jackman or to do. Like Johansson, he is simply used for his good looks. It's a shame, because Jackman has played "Ok Men" from any of the productions "Oklahoma" because he can work. <br /> <br /> Big plot twist here - Jackman, Sue, charming English Lord, really a killer. So, even though the movie is telling anyone other than Allen, to get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man he loves, is a whore who murdered. Excellent, Woody. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the picture alone. <br /> <br /> A final note: At my screening, an audience member did not smile at any time during the movie. Always a bad sign when a film is notified as a comedy.
