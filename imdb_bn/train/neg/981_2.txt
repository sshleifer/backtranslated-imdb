As a great fan of Marlin Dietrich, I had to (finally) see this very, very dull picture. It's the first coloring movie of Miss Dryerich, and a red head of the world's most beautiful blonde! Bad start The story is an extraordinary bore, a subject that bores itself bore itself: religious offenses involved (Who needs it ???) Probably enough, enough to say all of Dietrich's films (and I've seen the most, with "Pittsburgh"), this is the only one where his performance is rarely worth seeing. Color photography is ok (this is a very basic technolar release) but not for any purpose. Wicked cast: C. Abry Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough?). The only thing that interests us is the wonderful characteristic of John Carradine's "Hill Deviar", which predicts what will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is sometimes supposed to be one of the most depressed ones. Yet another example of David and Salznik's brilliant fame (Has he ever made a good movie? - Which other than that?) And, for a final frustration, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with the volume level seemingly randomly randomly. Very uncomfortable.
