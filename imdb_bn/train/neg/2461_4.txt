Perhaps more people are afraid than dentists, say a little, a little monster or scary looking doll. Which actually makes it a perfect topic for a horror movie, <br /> <br /> Fineston (Corbin Bersen) has been a successful dentist for many years now, but when he delivers his wife with her in the pool, she brings her anger and disappointment for her work. Well, a crazy dentist should give a drill and face, and perhaps you can guess what's next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, bright ideas but it should not be distributed. Especially the last one huge go down. Last note: Mark Raffalo (You can keep an eye on me, eternal sunshine ...) <br /> <br /> 5/10.
