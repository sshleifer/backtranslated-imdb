I think, there are very few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You make "this wrong" shout at the movie. Immersion zero. So far, most of you probably have a terrible error / strange computer that has hackers on the computer etc. This image is like that every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the film is the little girl Emily, brightly playing Elisa Bennett. I hope he will grow up and build it. At least some valuable. <br /> <br /> Make a favor on your behalf. Do not see this. Not even the right steps. Total waste of time.
