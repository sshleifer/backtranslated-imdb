The first (and only) time I saw "shadow" was during a Sneakpreview time. It was not even premiere. I remember there were some of the directors, even those who do not remember. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were neutral, I did not know what to expect. Mickey is a brilliant actor in the rock and she has left all the other miles ahead. He was an actor who stopped the stars growing a long time. She is helping to realize a movie titled "Shadow" in Belgium. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much oath. Occasionally nothing against the word of oath. But this was the way beyond the annoying. Rourke uses the word F *** to reveal something, it comes naturally. However, when someone uses Cast non-English speaker F **** or S ***, then it becomes violent and aggressive. <br /> <br /> How many times we have lost count of numbers F and S are used. Everyone is happy to be outside the theater. And we had to vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10, and we were looking at -10.
