The movie seems incomplete and written incomplete, poorly. The screenplay continued as if 10 different people wrote it, and none of them were communicating with each other. Apparently, he wanted to take a page from a miracle of 34th Street (original) type film, but it was done in such a weak way by separating the film. This movie is for a very young age, and even they will see that anyone who has scripted does not know anything about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels are dead, the owner is not cared for, or is he not really bothered to fight with his pot ?? On the head ?? Or he made fifty of the team fifty by player announced on live TV. However, when the team is in a game to win the category, he is out of shape on a story (dedicated by 6 year old) that the manager is demanding to see the original angels from a child. What's wrong? The violation of the control manager, whose team has lost 15 in the row? Or the winner of the playoffs shoulder coaches who are acting a little more sensible and helping the oster kids? The owner's response makes no sense. And he has moved to change his mind during a press conference in Maggi and his 'direct clich√© land' speech. <br /> <br /> ?? Angels are supposed to play in the series in the final weekend against White Sax, but after the end of the game, the announcer declares Angels "win". "Not until the victory of the Lingu championship" is the title of the regular seasonal section. <br /> <br /> ?? White Bash, Goffball Pachter, is the starting point and win the game that prevents the Angels? So what is the starting pot ?? Very nice day <br /> <br />? Mail Clark (Tony Dessa) said in the 9th innings that 156 pitches were dropped in the lowest scorer. Generally in low scoring games, this is much less than the pitch count, about 80-90 pitch. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL" will say "the championship will win on their own" at the end of the angel, although he and his angels manipulate and fixing covers the whole second half of the new season. <br /> <br /> I could go because there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For small kids (under 10), this movie may be entertaining. Is it so bad ?? This may have been a classic right. This is a mistake and it is a forgotten mess that will forever live as a UHF / cable Saturday morning.
