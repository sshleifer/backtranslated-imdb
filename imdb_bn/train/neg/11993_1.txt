After just seeing half of the pictures returned to school in November, I found that it was on the Flex Channel and decided to see the rest of it and write a new review. <br /> <br /> Books that are based on film, hatchet, okay. Although it's a terrible adaption. <br /> <br /> Awful (and I mean terrible), bad dialogue, and average cinematography hatchet make this terrible adaption. <br /> <br /> The film Bryan (to prevent his head with the 80-year-old Rock Music), and his mother started to fly on a plane to fly in order to show flying aircraft to drive in his car. Her parents are divorced ... now because of a dramatic break.) Now Brian farewell to mom and dog and flies to meet his father. The pilot was a greasy, ugly, rude person (not like a book) after a 2-minute heart attack and died in the air. If there is more pain in the pilot, the book has been described in more detail, and before the pilot had a heart attack, he was in the air long before the plane. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br> This point in the movie where everything was different, it was in the book. In the book it has been said that her jacket has been scattered, but in film it is absolutely fine with a tears or rip (it seems to have bought it completely), it never said that she climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and fell asleep there. On the mountain, never said that he attacked with a bear (it was a moose but not a bear), never said that he ate several bugs, it never mentions a second tornado or he has learned to get those abyss, their skin, and their Or eat a little fish that traps the trap (that is destroyed by a tornado) and it refers to hurting its rib from a tornado. <br /> <br /> I can not even make a call at the Tornado film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival was Brian's Lam Flashback (which has never been mentioned in the book), especially Brian Zagrut's clich√© shows up, walking over the window and all of his parents packed all his things Can fit perfectly behind his truck) and "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (Then of course his father was not out of him, though he was not out of the box) and he imposed his fist through the window (<br /> <br /> <br /> The last thing in the near book (I I said in the book.) In the book, I think the rescuer pilot said to Brian what was an important thing, "You are the child whom they were looking for! They stopped a few months ago. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think we were going together for Thanksgiving (because there was a turkey in their counter.) Then it shows its temporary house (for this, in the movie, three days It seemed like, but it was a few months in the book) and his hat, still where he left it (even in the book) where he had a message Made it so perfectly: "home" (where we really believed that he composed it only with that hectare?) <br /> <br /> No quote can make this film better, when "It is so bad that it has been good and bad again." <br /> <br /> I will not recommend to anyone (who did not read the book) and only a go Citra do not want to see, and that those who read the book What should I do? Because they will get frustrated and become bored in death. <br /> <br /> Create your imagination as a movie for those who have read the book. It's awful and will reduce your thinking on the book. </10
