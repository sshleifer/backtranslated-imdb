ba ba ba boring ... this science fiction is beside the world of sleeping battlefield. Jenny Francks (Laura of AÃ§a General Hospital) played a small role as a reporter and said in itself that the film should be bad ... the painful actor Ben Kingsley (Academy Award-winning actor) and some decent actors Have you wondered what you possessed them to decide to make this terrible movie. It goes dramatically up and down like a big dramatic story. Even if it is impossible to follow the plot to pay attention. The effect seems to be medieval and really dates as well. All actors speak a monotone voice and there is no realism in their dialogue. How can I go and how it is a bad movie At least it's a fun thing with the battlefield world but it's just B & R I Avoid until you want to sleep.
