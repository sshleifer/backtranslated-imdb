This movie is a car for Schwarzenegger-Clown Alexander Nevsky. His charisma is inadequate to give up this movie on his poor script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was an actor, which made me uncomfortable. Come on, you can do even better! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and strangers; The top of this bill looks like an inspector of Volda, who sounds like an American woman, but the context seems to be working for the Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story is well after the end of the communist rule, all the Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, all of the utility vehicles as Vold-Police-Car are allowed to run a pimped-up drive. Action scenes badly shot and hence lack of dynamics. <br /> <br /> Do not see the movie ...
