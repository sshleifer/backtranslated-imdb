If you are invited to create a bad film that can become stupid humanity, then this award will be accepted. The plot centers around the Bible's prophecies that lie in hidden messages from the scriptures, which encourages a team seeking power to try to control the world. How stupid actually this writer is? <br /> <br /> The acting was good. This genius of Caspar Van Deeen spoiled his acting. Michael York's work was at the center of the film, because he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was awful and very annoying. Any flexible or unfamiliar mind will see this picture. In this way how a basic good versus evil plot can go wrong. <br /> <br /> There should be many mental diseases floating around the photo circles, who look for these types of junk markets. Certainly there has been some sensor to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still awful.
