The headline above is used to present "Jane" to its viewers. Jane is a young doctor about a young doctor (Doga Root). To start her new job, her mother started leaving the film behind her. When he drives, we realize that he is not in a close house because the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as he walked into the hospital gardens, he saw a patient's body. It's a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers came to the hospital for a suicidal investigation. In fact, they must be in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather. All of their contact with the outside world is very cut. There is no way !! Within a few days there will be more nasty killings. Now everyone is suspicious of each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is bright. It can be really very scary. Of course there are positive aspects of the movie. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, during the hospital and his first moments to go to hospital. Acting is okay. Some of them are trying very hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock should be spread out of the movie. What I'm saying is that this was a good point, but in the end, instead of showing it as a parody, we realized that we were seeing what was happening. The manager needed to fully explain what I think does not work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the film is considered to be at least 48 years old, but his body is so young and it is suitable for a person who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I want to say something about the director. I'm sure he'll improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That felt more positive about me and his future film. I'm not going to rate this film out ***** *.
