Another weak third season entry, 'Is there any beauty in the truth?' Yet at least one key plot material which is very different and will speak, is interesting. The main character is an alien who must be born in a black box because his appearance is so horrible that it makes man crazy. It is very bad that this episode can not live on an incredible premises. Obviously, I think Alien was never 'shown' wrong, since her original viewpoint does not assume such a difficult danger in any way; All we have got is the Star Trek Cyclodic Light Displays, which is used for anything in different episodes, usually when the ship crosses the magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, the appearance of the Colosseum can be tolerated at least by Mr. Speak, and then after the special masks are spoken. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I got a joke, but I was disappointed.) Spoken should be associated with the Colosseum at one point so that the alien can again drive the enterprise towards safety. It is done, but when the Spock / Kollos mind goes back to the end of the mold, by slap, Spock forgets his mask. Oh oh He became crazy, but finally, with the assistance of a blind woman with the support of Colosse's assistant, psychological force. This was really a wonderful, unusual episode but it was badly managed and seen in the last season of the series as a more poorly-run show.
