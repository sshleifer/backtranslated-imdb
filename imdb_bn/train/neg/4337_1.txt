It's just a wonderful story by Edwin Torres a slaughterhouse. This movie does not follow the story of the book. And, there are so many inconsistencies with the original film that if you are surprised, then the screenplay has not seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) came out of the prison as a starting point. Here, Carlito retires with her woman in heaven. <br /> <br /> What happened to Lorraine from Gore? In this installment, he is not mentioned, and Carlito retired and probably would marry any other girl. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I am also in this film. How to play Gujmain's totally different character. He was a panchanga day back on Pacino. Now, he is a Cuban killer, Nico Rice. I think Nacho Reyas has played a lot of role in the book. <br /> <br /> This book is shortly after reading, but where is the character of Shan Kambh come from? Also, I think this movie actually pales on teres writing about Harlem's racial tension. And, this crowd does not treat them in the book. They are removed out of this movie. However, the magical Plant Avenue bunch is closer to the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book said a great story. This movie may be called a great story. It's just a huge disappointment. Read the book. It is a good use of your time.
