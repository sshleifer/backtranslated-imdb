Since I was eight years old I was a great wrestling fan. It does not matter what I saw in the federation. WWE, the leading WCW, USWA I have seen this work to me. <br /> <br /> 23 May 1999. I had 19 birthday I ordered over the Edge and I was expecting every other pay per vision. But this time. I was roasted. Instead of one of the best wrestlers out of Canada, one real man fell into his death one night. You can not do much to change the situation. But the death of Oven's death makes me very crazy. Then after completing every aspect and making the right thing like humans, WWE decided to protect what came first, and give every aspect as it did not have been the death of Oven. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you. Vince Mitton has made some stupid decisions in his life, but he made that stupid decision that he had made so far. <br /> <br /> And Owen asked this shit to keep the Pay Payview going on. Give me a break. See her comon's sense to turn it off when someone dies on a pay pew. Like a police officer, robbery or run a robbery and then only let the person die so that he can go home and make the day fit, as the human life never goes to the standard. <br /> <br /> What matters will happen. Thank you for missing the oven and all the memories you gave us.
