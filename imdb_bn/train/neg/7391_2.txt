Like most Steven Sigal fans, I know that when I make a film, I do not expect a great composition, but I hope the film has at least some budget budget. The main problem I saw was the terrible horror on Dubbing, I know that it should be done in some films and I accept it but when they overdate with different actors and do it through film, it takes away overdubbing Magic The set also does not seem to be made with care, such as a top-secret lab sliding glass top of a scene, it is going through a large crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and only hope that the purchase of Steven's next project / rental before the movie is sent before it will be more ending. The story of this movie surprised me that if I see a science-fiction film or some part of it does not seem alien, it does not fully explain how it is happening.
