It was David Hunter's notoriety on the DBP 'Video Nasty' list, but it was not really necessary. Many movies on the list where only the reasons for God (and DPP) are known, and when it is not the best of the group; There are not many things here to ban the warrant ... which is shameful because I would never have sat through it, this is not for 'shopping list'. This plot actually gives the film a lovely foundation - or at least a decent foundation than most cannabal films - and it follows an actress, who is kidnapped and thrown into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is appointed to find him, but he needs to dare the natives with the path, under the leadership of a person who called himself "The Devil" (hence the title). The film originally plods along for about eighty minutes and does not really have much interest in the scene. It is a real shame since the creation of Jess Franco's film, like this, Man has genuinely talent; Such as diabetic Dr. Zed, Venus in Fars, Falc√©s and She Kills In Existy, but unfortunately his good movies are only part of the gems and devil hunter disappointments among the hips of shit. I have seen this movie completely because I want to say that I have seen everything on the DPP list (to go to two more times!), And I guess why this was seen by most people. But you're not looking for Nasties; There is no reason to really bother with this one.
