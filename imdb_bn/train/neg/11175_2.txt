If no one lights me up, then I have no idea about this movie. It looks like a picture with a message but it's far from it. This movie is a New York press agent and a vague story about his problem. And, that's basically all. When the agent plays the casino, he must certainly remember something important. But determining this movie as meaningless and impartial does not make any difficult thought. The world's best actor, Al Pacino, is entitled to title this year's second film (the second "Simon") entitled "The Most Annoying and Most Uninterrupted Film of the Year". So, what's going on, al?
