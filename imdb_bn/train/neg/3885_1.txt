This movie was not just bad - it was terrible. After I saw it, I felt really needed to take a shower to get messy from me. 'Gag' is running with an adult couple, it's not funny, but it's hateful. The giant make-up was cold, but that's all. Only continuation errors will make you angry - at least I was. The edit is really poor. <br /> <br /> Often what you can do is be better than spending some time watching another movie. Even if your friends have 'bad movies', this is an exception in its ambiguity, even I can not even laugh at myself. You have been warned.
