Even Steve Martin and Dan Icod could not save this image from egg-shaped egg eggs. It was bombarded on the basis of the classic Phil Silver TV series because: a) It was updated in the 1990's, and B) became an easy authoritative confusing, weak and silly screenplay of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of gifted actors, so that it can easily play a cheerful startup. In the 1990s, the film was in trouble for the expansion of the premises and it shows. Nobody could give me enough to sit through this stinker for the second time.
