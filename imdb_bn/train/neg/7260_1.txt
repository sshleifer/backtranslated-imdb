"Man with no name" triangle "A Town Called Hell" (Ukka "A Town Called Bastard"), British / Spanish co-production, Clint Eastwood's successive heels in Italian. This template used in most of the films was rented to accredited American actors whose careers were largely reduced and their voice dubbed. This picture is nothing but exceptions that they used to be British actors. <br /> <br /> It's hard to make the plot short, but it goes here. The story strikes a church led by rebels or whatever, including Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, and kills everyone including the priest. Some years later Shah's character masquerading as a pastor, in which subject matter is fast forward. The city mayor (Tele Savalas) is a brutal leader who seems to have nothing to fulfill the justice with his gun. <br /> <br /> A sad widow mixed by Alvira (Stella Stevens) who is searching for her husband is a murderer. Why is he roaming around asleep like Saul to know God? After the Mayor killed his henman La Bombie (al-Lateiierei), the city attacked a rebel leader (Landaui) a rebel leader (Landaui) (I'm sorry but the name escapes me). The Colonel has captured the city and started executing the townspeople to force them to publish their city identity in the majority. <br /> <br /> While they can also tell from the dialogue as well as movies, Landau and Shao characters know each other. A blind man (Fernando Re) claims that he can touch his face and identify the rebel leader. He does so and .................................................. ........ <br /> <br /> I'm sure the princes make this picture and sorry. It's just my horrible "1" rating's terrible and well-deserved. Shawo has spent most of his films in the field of hardly rectifying his trademark. Even Landoo can not retrieve this image. Beautiful Miss Steven is completely wasteted here too. Last year, by creating Pacinpah's "Just Hagg's Ballad", I think it would appear in a diverse world. Savalas made several photos of this picture, ("Kuchak era Pancha villa" and "Horror Express" in the former Kozak era). Michael Craig is also like a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Ray was present in most of the "western", although she would rise to play villain in the film "French Connection". Al-Latarii was also concerned about a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and in 1975 he played another memorable role before his impossible death. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I can not see the version I saw, instead of just running 88 minutes or more than 95 or 97 minutes listed in IMDB, I can not make any difference between the extra 7 or 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
