"Seed" torture is obscene ... There is no doubt about it. But, surprisingly, the Uwe Bowle has written, produced, and directed more polished films than any other image in its recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a Bowl movie, I think some page scripts have gone missing. The stories and dialogs are simply bigger gaps Of course, nothing makes much sense. <br/> <br /> <br /> ****************************************************** **************************************************************************** > <br /> When they arrive at the dark place in different ways, in contrast to the real police that enter the house in the pair or thirty? Why do not police ever use their radio? Can the body be so quick to erupt, a process which normally takes a few months? (I know it's the photography of timeframe ... but seeds can not plan to kill people if they always wait for damage at the pretext of hunting.) How to wear the seed cats and a mask when he is usually waiting for the death row instead of the prison uniform? How can the seeds enter the maximum security prison, can rotate around the cell block, and then stop or walk again without even noticeing? If about 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) are killed, why are just one investigator working in this case? Why did the investigators suddenly decide that he would look for seed in the seed house, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victims? (Did he not think of doing it soon?) Why police detective went alone, without backing up and sending even in addition to knowing what he was doing and where he was headed <br /> <br /> <br /> Clearly speaking frustrating Do not wait when we can understand that the electrical chair fails to function properly, because it definitely goes far away from its way. He spent several screen minutes while setting up, when he could create at least some other aspects of the logical film. <br /> <br /> ***** Last spinner ***** <<br /> <br /> In short, the film acts as the only visible scenery framework (perhaps the ball is its "viewpoint") Will remember) by brutal deaths, gunmen heads, by electrocution by execution, and skinning live animals living for their pelts. (The open skin of animal skin was really unnecessary and annoying, but I understood their motive in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly killing the middle-aged women using seedbed through seeds. It is clear that it has been spent a lot and it vaguely reminds me of the classic view of "Reservoir Dog", though without the Steele Dan Soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No Is it valuable? Only if you are a dedicated fan of torture porn or are fully convinced to see the torture pornography sample. I said at the beginning of this review, although this film may be quite annoying and ill at points, but it is really more capable than most of the Bowl movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can expect that he will move out of the torture screen and will continue to be in the post of "postal".
