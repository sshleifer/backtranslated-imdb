Basically this is a pale shade of High Fidelity, which performed wonderful and surprisingly with several real winners. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not to mention the lack of any real visual story-style style. I mean, this movie is centered around the movie, yet incredibly uncertain! <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main problem is that we do not think too much about the main characters because the script and the actor (Murphy and Liu) have failed to make any of them true or sympathetic. Real way So this picture has become a series of episodes related to two people, who are not very good, interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, another thing: a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is not very romantic, <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid it. Even in its 90-minute running time it is not worth sitting ...
