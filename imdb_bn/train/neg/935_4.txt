Users who rated this movie so much, have not seen enough movies to easily compare it to. Have they all been brainwashed ?? I rarely felt frustrated by a film and some of it would be responsible for the ridiculous publicity surrounding this movie. <br /> <br /> From the first, BE is just a Chase film. We went straight to the other side by lifting each other up. And others. And others. And others. Do you see a pattern emerging? Virtually no time was lost about the plot, character development, or annoying old reality. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the other two borin films, you are pretty lost. If you have - you'll just lose - somewhere far from a movie. The great style of Paul Grangegrass did a great job at United 93, which felt a feeling overload was frustrating, but Bourne and its introvert wounds have the effect of hearing impairments from the audience only. He is running He skipped He punches He gets up to fly He cleared the tall buildings. Yada Yada Yada. Above all - He Survives. He survived like a plastic action man who survived only to create a ridiculous stunts, which he wastes more and lacked any kind of excitement. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll be alive. Yawn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I saw more character depth and exciting dialogue in Captain Scarlett's episodes. <br /> <br /> Bourne's literal self-discovery has its own journey neutral and neutral and we do not know anything from the first film. She became a killing machine. Big deal He finds out his true identity. So what? It does not have any emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> 'Twist' is the last wire and weak. Oh, dear, as much as I think about this picture, I hate it! At the time of writing this comment I already got my score 4! I will end before I continue the slides. <br /> <br /> I like the good work Flick and I love the thriller. Bourne is not Ultimatum. It's a strong, dazzling edit, ridiculous sound effects and a series of cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The concept of 'guides the path' in the Bond franchise is quite unclear. Casino Royale comes out of the water.
