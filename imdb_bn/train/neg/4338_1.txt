Really awful ... lead actors are okay ... the film, plot, etc. was completely unclear and it was a fairly consistent one ... Carlytos Wake had little or no relevance to him ... and should be the plague by the fans of Carlito's path Avoid like ... there is no mention of Gayle, in fact he ended up with any other bird, there is no mention of Kleinfeel, how he got caught There is no mention of, there is no mention in prison at the end. They initially attempted to create it like a flashback ... but I was looking for a zero point to be honest while rating it ... Unfortunately I had to pay more ... ... <br /> <br /> It's 90 One of the best movies in cash was a terrible attempt for cash ... Overall it was nearly 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... in it all the "actions" it was really annoying and slow. ... The Way of the karlatio asita fans to avoid this fiasco ...
