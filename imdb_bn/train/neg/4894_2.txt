Dangerous, perpetual shots, vain shots, vain scenery What you will find in this picture In other words, it seems technically poor to me. Musical bits are operated indefinitely (danced dance, no post-synchronized, time-critical performances of bad actors, and obvious emojiation etc). <br /> <br /> The picture is long and annoying. Finally, it makes a few points and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some comic elements are actually functional, especially the opening scene. However, the film becomes bad and bad so it is completely intolerable and ultimately impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it is not true for the film. That is, the difference between the trailer and the actual film is very close to a rip close.
