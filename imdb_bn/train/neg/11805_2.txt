See the original with the same title since 1944! This TV made for movie, just god awful! Although it uses almost the same conversation (as far as I can say), it does not work! What is it acting, poor direction? OK so it's made for TV, but why do you see a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the fantastic original? Especially you will get lost in the plot and do not enjoy the original, as you saw it! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (it's short for one time) but all bad! The actor is playing part here, just do not fit the bill! You just do not believe them and Edward G. from the original. Who could perform Robinson's performance? If you want, you only see it after seeing the original and you will be brave even if you see it! It's almost impurity!
