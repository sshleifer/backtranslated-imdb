Why this image was not advertised as a wild, quirky, smiley comedy. There is nothing in this movie that gives entertainment to the movie or not fun. Annette Bening (whose acting was touted as worthy of Oscars) came here as mannered, with its performance routines. Brian Cox's character is confusing and annoying, and playing in August ?? Joseph Cross ?? It does not seem to have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the movie is Ivan Rachel Wood, but he is not enough to support this annoying, cowardly film. <br /> <br /> The image has disappeared and it seems to be good reason. I saw some of the worst scenes in the scenes (Brian Cox and his only used toilet courts' scenes' You and me and we all know 'and' Squid and The Vale 'saw some scenes of the worst scenes), some embarrassing and most unsettling them. I did not find a waste during the whole experience. Do you waste your time ??
