About 1800 people of fools want to see a famous mental retreat where a famous doctor thinks for his patients. Despite initially adverse reactions, he was warmly invited and offered a good doctor's tour. And, as a doctor sees him, he discusses and discusses and discusses !!! And when he spoke, Lunny did not care about it here and did not do anything particularly productive. Here and there are some steps (and quite a bit annoying), it's amazing and the whole thing in the brain - the lack of amazing life and energy that is amazing for the amazing flickr. A man who thinks he is a lizard like a chicken and a garment. The visit later took the guest, eventually you realized that prisoners were taken to the hospital and tortured their guardians. Yet, despite the twist, the film is awkward in many places - especially when it comes very slowly such as an intriguing event or people are flowing inside the set. Only when the workers are hungry from the sanctuary found in prison cells, the film has no real impact. Considering this plot, it is difficult to confirm that it is annoying, but who created this cheap exploitation film! Now with the same plot and appropriate writing, acting and direction, it was an interesting and suitable movie. <br /> <br /> You know, now I think about it, it was an episode plot that was the real "Star Trek" TV show! You know, "lord cirth - the master of the universe" and Kirk and the spell has captured this crazy and his crazy followers. <br /> <br /> A final note: This picture contains quite a bit of nudity and a rape scene here, and so forewarned - it's not for kids. Actually, considering how worthless the movie is, it's not for anyone! However, the version included in the version "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the printing is so incredibly bad that it is very difficult to see these meat due to printing.
