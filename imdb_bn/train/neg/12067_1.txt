When John Carradine raised the movie for only 5 minutes on the funeral procession, a film should not work well (read AKA script and plot synopsis). Describes its character's last desires and conventions. It determines that his estate will be divided among his 4 children and servants. Children will share equally 136 million dollars, but if someone dies, that part is divided into remnants. If all the children die, it is divided into slaves. To be eligible, they will have to live in the family estate for a week. It sounds like the general plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There are small theorems like Dean's nature. They are a powerful and serious operational family, but the real dogs that start with dogs sinking. From the opening voice of John Carradine, you are hoping to take this movie with a thick end to the Mikivivalian cat and mouse game. <br /> <br /> The journey is painful and slow. We used to fly, play pools, throw darts, use "shot with a bowl of fish", minutes after the dramatic conversation between the ray crystals, constant boring, erroneous circus music, strange flashbacks, wrong-German retention publication, the fourth grade horror aesthetic and Dramatic overacting heaps. All of this leads to inevitable anticipated and ungratifying finishing. You are still happy to be alive, but pain can be very great to bear alone. Share, share. <br /> <br /> -California Restoration
