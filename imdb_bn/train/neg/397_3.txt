All right, what could this hell be? Is Spielberg a family fantasy movie for more cash on the huge success of "Third Encounters of Third Cide"? Or in the glorious days of prehistoric epic, such as "When dinosaurs ruled the earth" and "The Lost World" was frustrated? Perhaps it is an intellectual and philosophical best composition we all fail to understand? Yes, it must be! However, the creators of "The Day Time Ended" ("Spider Trap" author David Schmöller's old John 'Bud' Cardo and author of "Tourist Trap" David Schmöller) wrote that when they wrote many glue styles for this demented hodgepodge Ideas The story does not make a little bit of intelligence and the descriptive structure is insightful as hell, but hey, who carries dinosaurs, small spacecraft, headaches-inspiring lights and laser shows and spontaneously burning supernovas care for them! The role of voice-over is virtually offensive, but as no concern it is all lazy! Do you know that we do not all understand the 'time' definition? Time does not pass by rising incrementally, it is a gimmicky satirical! Thousands of years ago the spoken words are still almost floating and what is going to happen in the future is already around us. I have absolutely no idea what all this means, but apparently it provides a simple excuse for collecting screen-dance midget alien and well-mannered dinosaurs together. I deliberately call good-made dinosaurs, because at the time a prehistoric monster humbly hits the front door before accepting its goals. Crazy Plots Rolling over a family of weirdos living somewhere in their solar-powered homes. Grandpa is extremely annoying, even more grandson, is a walking and talking advertisement billboard for the granny plastic surgery, the stranger son is similar to the weird Prince Valiant and is the young mother ?? Incredibly hot! Chris Mitchum for some reasons, Hot Momy's husband travels in vain alongside the set of films for business travel. Special effects are completely fat and absolutely ridiculous (I sincerely hope that another critic who was talking about "extraordinary special effects" was satirical), but here the absolute most gifted aspect is the dialogue! Just read this wonderful example of extraordinary writing: <br /> <br /> Dada: "You know what this is, is not it? This time-space war! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, do not you know what to do? And stop talking about "Vortex", as you have some expert in the field! "The Day Time Ended" is an impossible child and impossible-boring-fantasy film, although I'm completely I understand that    কিছু ভক্ত চলচ্চিত্রটিকে উপভোগ করেন কারণ তারা অল্প বয়সে এটি দেখেছে এবং উজ্জ্বল প্রভাব নিয়ে মুগ্ধ হয়ে পড়েছে। শেষ পর্যন্ত কোথাও কোথাও আসেনি, যেমন তারা হঠাৎ করে অর্থের বাইরে চলে গেছে বা এর প্রভাবের মত মাশরুম তারা খাওয়া ছিল অপ্রত্যাশিতভাবে পরেন।
