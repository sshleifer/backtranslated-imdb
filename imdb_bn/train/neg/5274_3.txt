If you like movies in vague cities, hotels, houses, states (Ala Eagles "Hotel California"), instead of reading "Steven King novels" you have to "just go through". If you like the "invisibility" setting, start reading the King's "frustration" but check "The Shining", "Salem Lot" and "Required Things". <br /> <br /> Tired of frustration to avoid cock motif, desert, family escape or disappointment. Why did not they make this film from the "Frustration" novel? Maybe they came to the king and he went near? <br/> <br /> Susan Day and Harry Hamlin are happy again and they have worked well for both years, but they are still TV and direct to DVD carrier actors.
