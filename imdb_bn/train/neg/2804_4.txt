The adaptation of 1973 is frustrating, so I probably saw the 1973 edition with Michael Johnston and Sorcha Cusack. I just could not find any chemistry between the two major stars. Many starred and dramatic performances do not just do it for me, and what about the team in Rochester's role? The casting director actually used to read the book. Very weird! He is a good actor but Mr. Rochester! And Zelah was just, well, weird, combined couples bit together. The supporter cast was very good in support of this, and load scenes for me were the best of adaptations, but overall the novel was not magical. Of course, the original adaptation of the novel will not ask anyone to see it. Let's get a real down!
