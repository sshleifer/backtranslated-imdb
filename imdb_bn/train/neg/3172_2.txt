This film made shoddily, unoriginal trash. I sometimes like romantic comedies. If you look good, you have to eat ice cream for dinner. It's not something you're always going to do, but the experience is so enjoyable that you can ignore how smart it is. This movie forced me to think about how stupid it was for me to continue sitting for a full time. It screamed about making everything cheaper about Actually they look like they have made the film brighter in such a time. It boasts a cheesy CGI and hair set, <br /> <br /> Writing was in disguise. I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a sculble comedy, but you are not usually lucky because you really care about it. This film is so weird that you are actually sitting there and involving the unreal series of humor and completely unbelievable behavior. The events were kept in film only from one scene to the next or for the characters to be removed. Of course, how all movies work, but you should not notice it happening. Ugly I'll use this word. <br /> <br /> There was almost no movie that was really desired. I did not end up with anyone until they all stayed away from me, and I could not hear their words. Only the coolest character in the film, why Paul Rudd's character wants to do anything with a completely annoying, uninterrupted, controlling fix directed by Eva Langriya? Also, the characters involved almost all sort of sleaziest solutions in any situation. A common man just pretends to be gay for five years (and to bathe) with a woman? They might come with the best feelings, looking at the happy ending for the same scheme, where he says that Rudd is equally annoying lies, the Claptonic sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, apple women. Maybe they'll get some good looks down the road.
