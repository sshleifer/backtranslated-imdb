If my grandmother did films, they would probably make a lot better than this ... incredible bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are okay. Especially mother has proven to be a beautiful actress and kid especially in the scene where she is supposed to be awesome. But the director has understood the meaning of plot points, trilars and good scripts. The script does not become a mystery to a stimulating atmosphere. If you choose to plot by the tree then you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. Oh ... there was something interesting: the film has been since 2001 but we did not realize that the picture is so bad (like mini-DVD) and the cars are old (like 70 and 80).
