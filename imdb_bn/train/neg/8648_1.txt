Well, basically, hit the movie! It fills the ill-conceived San Pen in Blair Wich to go to Iraq, which shows the world truly about "war on terror". The script seems to have been written by the 8th grade (there is no crime in the 8th grade); The two main actors work on the whole film; They use the wrong type of camera and the wrong kind of movie (I do not know anything about them - but it's not like actual documentaries I've seen), and all Christian Johnson has taken the worst idea and suck it. It reminds me while trying to paint a picture of my dog ​​and is really looking for things that looked more like a giant turd with a bad stick figure. I'd rather see Blair Witch VIII than to sit through again.
