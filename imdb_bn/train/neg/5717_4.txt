Hello Nelly! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... but I found a hardcore horror critics really found it frustrating. He was right on the nose! This movie is played by pure amateur. They have taken one, perhaps two on each scene, the movie looked soooo rushed. The script was poor too .... They had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. "Get Your Meathooks Off Me!" Hey man, when I try to do this, I hate it. It's with comedians all the time ... But, with a horror movie and the below average actors ... the results are incredibly kind. All of the lines and situations were very expected. But so much negative feeling about this movie has made me, again, congratulations. It was a strange thing. By the little Asian guy who works in the booth as well. I thought he was great. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 5 stupid Dubbs! The tourists who spend their vacation in Asia They end up in the wrong place and take the mafia run sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story But watching diarrhea is probably more fun and watch watching with someone in a worse case. The only reason considered as deer is murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> But unfortunately, with a huge capital U., the movie was incredibly frustrating. I enjoy ankle breakdown and blood pressure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All this screams about this image. This is the first feature length of Ryan Nicholson, and in most parts he failed. There is no denying he has a sick sense of threat and taste for awful. I do not play the next film like other b Horse Flick ... unless he tells us what it will be like. Even after this disappointment, I agreed to give Ryan another shot. From what I saw from him, he was a real, devoted man. Good luck next time, because this was bad news.
