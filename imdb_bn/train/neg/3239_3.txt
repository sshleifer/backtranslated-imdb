Ah, the notorious "Guinea Pig" series ... I really want to say that I was disappointed with the whole series ("he never died", "manhole mermaid" and "flowers and blood of flowers" are exceptions ... and even those Not great in any way ...), but "devil test" only hit a little bit. There is no point of view here which is going apart from climatic (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending on how you look at it). Hunting does not really care about what is happening and rarely becomes "hateful" (often sometimes "ridiculous") when it is shaking or jumping. "Flash of Fleas and Blood" is a more violent and minor illustration of the fake "drop" element, but that film is flat on the realityism level. I admire the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they have been really long way over for the past two decades to get the crown for making "ultimate" films, but "do not test the Devil" simply. If you want to die, it is valuable from a point of view, if for some reason no problem is seen, but I can only give this film a very modest 3/10 and it is only through needle view ...
