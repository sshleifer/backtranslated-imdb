The story is seen before, but it does not matter if you can create a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on Storyboard. Alongside this, cameraman has spent a lot of time, which does not match the movie's message. The most interesting thing is, if you keep an eye on the movie website, you can read that the director has chosen to make a film with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us about victims. But I have never heard of the victims of poor camera angles ;-) It will be 1 star because the stories are okay. It does not spend more time reviewing the story, she said. It was more important to plan than filming. Because you do not have your camera, you must make a movie ... Come on. Everyone could make movies, but all would be just as good. So a word of advice to TI West is: Turn off what you want and label it. Use your time to start the plan and until everything goes down on the steerboard. You certainly have the power and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
