The Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical instrument directed by Warner Bros. Bubassi Berkeley. His indicator style has changed or evolved that the film does not have a huge production number with its signature overhead shots or thousands of additional numbers. In the last few years of Thirds, the swing-style big band is recording the year's most popular popular hits. The swing era, also known as Big Band Era, dates from 1935 to 1944 or from 1939 to 1949. While it is impossible to accurately identify the starting moment of the swing era, the connection between Beni Goodman in Lone Angle's Palomar Ballroom The last summer of 1935 was essentially an aspect of introducing the consciousness of the American youth. When Goodman played his band, instead of singing the style of dance-style, he showed his swing exhibition, the youth of the audience became wild. It was at the beginning, but the radio, the live concert and the word of mouth were the primary method of spreading the story, it took some time before creating enough Swedish to create big hits in pop charts. On the Hollywood hotel, Ben Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paji and his orchestral appearance in the film indicate that the film industry was ready to move to the musical flavor (after filming only for one and a half years or more, after Palomar balloon engagement of Goodman). Here there are some interesting musical moments here and there at the Hollywood Hotel, but there is not much to compliment except for Beni Goodman and his Orchestra's "songs, songs, lions". Otherwise, the most interesting music sequence "Hurry for the Hollywood" parade in the Drive-in restaurant and the production number "Let It Be Your Way". The film is one of the most interesting to hear and listen to Ben Goodman and his Orchestra game and Dick Powell and Frances Langford.
