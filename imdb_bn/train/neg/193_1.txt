Norman McLinn's story is a masterwork Redford's film is a mediocre. He climbed a foundation in the cool view of the MacLean brothers, and among them a story of a diary dating that was not even indicated in the story. Cipher, Brad Pitt, Carishmatic Paul, trying to play McLenne, who is a gifted outsider, proved to be convinced or depressed, depending on the meaning of the original story. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, as Father and Craig chefter, Tom Schert was as firm and brain-like, as men were likely to be one. Women do not touch any picture, which is unfortunate, because MacLean loved women in his story and made it clear, even poetic.
