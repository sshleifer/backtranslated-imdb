This movie is deeply stupid. A man wants to take revenge for crime - but when he takes his vengeance, the whole camera will be shown at the right time in his video. Can a person sit in front of a brain cell in his head and do it in front of the video camera? <br /> <br /> Only this script can not happen because no one can make their own clothes <br /> <br /> I think script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and their holes Misses so that you can run battalions of armored tanks. Plot: A man tried to take revenge on a loved one, but something went wrong in the middle of the plot, and then the unexpected event happened. <br /> <br /> These people writing this story were not so stupid that it could never happen that way completely unrealistic plot can be written. I ask the author - ask for help for your serious mental problem.
