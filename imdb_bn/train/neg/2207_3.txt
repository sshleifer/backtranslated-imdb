A combination between hammerhead mad scientist and killer shark movie genre. In some parts of type-casting, Jeffrey Combs is a human / hammerhead shark developer who develops upward crazy scientist. Oddly, this is actually his son, who turned him into this demon to die from cancer. Or something <br /> <br /> A group of associates on the scientist's private island are invited. They end up being used as shark bets or shark mates. Some unknown reasons have been brought to IT chief as part of this team. Who knows why? Thankfully, he turns out to be a passionate, somewhat weight-loss, ramboos hero. I believe that he is working in support of the first line as part of his day's job as to how to handle an attack rifle. As soon as this person sets up a network connection for the IT man, gunmen call gunmen gunmen. Or perhaps to fix a PC, should the call be determined in ground-based human collision with human-shark hybrids? However, he is amazing and preserves the day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and the movie came in a decent pace. Of course, if you are buying a movie called Hammerhead and hope that it can be a complex drama for a psychological conflict coming from a person, it does not have any reason to blame you, but blame yourself. For example, there are guns, grooms, girls and possibly an explosive helicopter. It's trash but could say something as bad as not.
