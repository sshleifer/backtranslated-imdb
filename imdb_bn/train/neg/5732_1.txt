I was all for a "bad" horror movie but this dog was a piece of shoe! How can anyone call this movie cold or decent beyond me? If you want to perform special effects, bad acting and covered in a bad script go for it! There was no doubt and the Gore factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. I will take hostel or wolf crack on this roof any day. My partner left after about 20 minutes, when he saw it, he knew a stinker. On the other hand, I just sat in the whole movie waiting to be awkwardly and saw that it is a good one. Not like that! I did not see her other movie career and I doubt if I am bored now.
