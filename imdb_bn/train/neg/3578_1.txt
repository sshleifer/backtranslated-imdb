There is absolutely nothing to break this movie. They took a lazy story, miscast it, wrote it wrong, misfilmed it. This bad conversation is badly edited in a scary and trashy story. <br /> <br /> Because of the failure of the industry, it gets worse as a trade. Who could be the target market for this. What age group? Which interested group? <br /> <br /> Anyone should make a film about how and why this movie was created. I could see <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and it's with "Salar Kya Hall of Faces of Grace" and "Monos" ... my choices are three unexpectedly bad movies I have ever seen. Everyone associated with it should be forced to negotiate in Vandamum for eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how can you take it and make it worse? I can not think of one way.
