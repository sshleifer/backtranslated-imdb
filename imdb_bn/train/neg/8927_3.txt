Mayon Breineries (Rex Reid !!!) comes out as a sex change (John Caradine - drunken drunk) and Maya (Rackel Welch) from a doctor. Then he decided to destroy male domination (or something like that) and earned money to teach the history of film in a acting college directed by John Huston (do not ask) and a young happy couple (young, handsome, hockey, Roger Herren, and Farah Fouzet - yes Farah Fouuset). <br /> <br /> They took a novel novel of Gore Vidal which was impossible and, naturally, tried to film it. They rented an Englishman with a neutral anti-American attitude and rented a bunch of suspected "talents" (Welch, Reid) and shameless old professionals (Houston, Carina, Andy Divine, Jim Bacche, Mae Way Way). All together and .... dream !!! An absolute disaster <br /> <br /> This movie got an X rating while it was released (it was reduced to an R), mostly due to the amazing scenery, Welch Rusty (Roger Heren) and a scene that Welch has had sexual intercourse with the fusset <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of scratches ... the scenes jumped everywhere and people say and do something that does not make sense. It's not all good but I was not bothered. <br /> <br /> The drama changes dramatically ... Reed is terrible ... really sad. Huston chews again and again and again in the scenery a boring extreme. Welch is not really bad as Maya but her line has no knowledge so you do not know what to do to her. The Western is rarely a movie (a blessing) and it is really sick to hear a female of approximately 80 years old cracking sexual jokes. Roger Heren (whatever ...) was too young, beautiful and not as bad as a rusty. Fousset is okay. <br /> <br /> It's hard to tell about it ... you only see it in the mistrust. To watch a movie - to believe !!!!
