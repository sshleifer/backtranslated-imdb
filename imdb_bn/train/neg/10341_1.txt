I've hired this movie from the library (it's hard to find good reasons) completely out of curiosity. I was a huge plat fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is horrific, because it is not disturbed by the text of the original novel, because it travels without focus or intention. Scenes are corrupt and do not lead the audience anywhere. What is the voice of Hawali on Plath poetry? Lady Lazar has nothing to do with Gridwood; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett Ester Greenwood (or any 20-year-old) is unbelievable due to complete casting (he's 32 years old, when he was born at Plath age), and partly because he could not do the job. Haset is all passion, no craft, no skill. The direction is medium; The director just did not have much to cover there, which is not much. The only reason I'm giving the film 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Silvia, you have to wait for someone else to adapt to your fine work in other things.
