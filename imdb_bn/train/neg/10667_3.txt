Do not fool with big names like Bart Reynolds, James Woods and Anna Archer. They are just extra glory. Their scenes are probably filming a day or so. Whatever their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you would do well. This is a sign of bad aspects through and through me. The plot itself was not that bad. And most actors were more than acting averages. Cuba Gooding Junior was terrible though. He is so incredible that I almost smiled in his dramatic sequences. And since it was meant as a serious movie that might not be a good thing. The action scene was not bad, but it was a lack of special punch to make it even more exciting. Again the good direction was needed. Pence also was wrong for a movie like this. It takes around half an hour the main character to get the action. Just a 90-minute action thriller that is very slow. Only the redemption factor is Angel Herman. She does all her good work to do. The very bad manager left his hanging. Yes, this movie was a great director with a lot of fun. Andy Cheng is very inexperienced as a director to stop it. And for its performance an action / stunt coordinator, you hope at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with this one. Avoid!
