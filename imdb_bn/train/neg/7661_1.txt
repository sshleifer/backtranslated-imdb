The bad movie title is always quick and often handed over. In most cases, it is very real, but I would like to welcome the short list of candidates in the dark alone: ​​Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nation's Adventures. <br /> <br /> I saw the 90-minute bore, I was hard to stay awake while trying so much to laugh in the film. But I felt alone in the dark (I was trying to avoid punishment, but I could not resist) I looked forward to seeing Mike Nelson and his two robotic friends. My friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about this movie. Let's talk about actions and effects as it should be the only positive part of the film. This movie contains the evil creatures that cross the alleys of Genios (they are called their genoos) and pitch black animals. Can turn invisible at random (and I assure you it is random) and get hit by the light. It also uses the current small centiped animals to control animals, which convert them into something similar to a zombie. All of these have been shown with the old special effects which were mediated in 1997. It's impossible to mess up and follow the action scenes. People shot randomly at the blue screen stage or shot an empty set of monsters embedded in the post. The light goes to a dark screen quickly when your students burn from extra work when bad rock music blares in the background. <br /> <br /> and those who had high points. The idea to imagine the story surrounding a strange investigator (slaughter) is a trench-coat wearing black-colored bitter t-shirt and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeological (READ) who is rather inactive, rather than inactive. And an official agent (draff) whose line involves a tremendous order. Three should be ashamed of their performance (they have never done any good before) and the casting director should be ashamed. I think Reid and Slaughter have to be film lovers. The film is the single most painful love scene I've never seen in two films. <br /> <br /> Then the plot comes. Impressive sense that sense makes sense to all. The rest is the best illogical. Conspiracy holes can contain collective egos of all three stars. The picture begins with the text and a story that explains the story in the background. This opening has been going on for more than a minute and the audience already knows that they are for any terrible. The details of this opening were later repeated in the rest of the film, in the strange conversation of a weird and heavy tool, adonasem was repeated. And do not end up in half of a sense. It was not just sensual in the film world, it was not only sensible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of the Uwe Bowling. Insults, that can all be said that. Mysterious imitation of its use to blur the campus. Its lack of direction with the actor. Look at the reed in those scenes where he is not the central focus of the shot. Special effect for the bullet time effect is completely waste of money. And ultimately to explain something that likes to use voice, it should be painfully obvious to the viewers. <br /> <br /> I've paid $ 1.50 to watch this shot in the second run theater. And when I laugh and my friends value me every quarter, then I suggest to avoid paying for this movie. Hold up to 3 friends and split up the rent and rebuild this movie. <br /> <br /> Shining on you. Sham ray on you You shy on Christian Slater. Shame on Stephen Doroff! Anyone who was associated with this film was Sham
