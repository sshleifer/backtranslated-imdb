All right, I acknowledge that I have seen this movie in mystery science theater 3000 (which is a huge fan), but I am not one of those people who automatically give MMAT1 rating of 1/10. Although I hate many of their movies, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I've actually enjoyed some MST3K movies. That said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (It is not a surprise that the author of MSST3 commented that it was the worst, and do not believe me? See their site.) <br /> <br /> What do I do to make this movie a good film? Example. Dialogue is very bad, acting worse, suppressing cinematography (although the best thing about this movie is) is bad. <br /> <br /> The worst part of panning is the film. Several times in this movie, the audience had to wait a minute for some events. The minute may not sound like a very long time, it can be a movie, especially this one. I was sure it was for creating a mood, but I was very annoyed. It really felt like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If there is a "suspension suspicion" that means "fall asleep during a movie", it has a lot of it. But in Scratching School so awesome, in any way I would not be in any way that could actually be interested in what was going on in the film, and thus "suspension suspension" did not really exist. <br /> <br> The worst I ever saw, and probably the most annoying movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
