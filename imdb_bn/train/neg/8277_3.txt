This can be incredible, but this movie Russia has grossed $ 878,138! It has been shown in almost all movie theater and is still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors are watching you on this special "movie", which has almost no screening around the world. Any kind of hint! Ha ha Perhaps it was based on Paris Hilton, based on another film called "Please This", which almost exclusively released the DVD everywhere, it had big screening in Russia and it earned more than $ 1 million. In addition, there was a lot of publicity in both the films, such as banners across the city, TV commercials etc. Not saying about the movie, I said it is shameless and absolutely annoying. It could be really good. Even if Jessica Simpson remains.
