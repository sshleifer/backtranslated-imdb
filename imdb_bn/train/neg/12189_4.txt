I was surprised that this movie got so much ratings, although I was usually going through grade scale 71 but it was a CD or maybe it was just a slow thriller and it was only one of the thrillers. A typical thriller is not realistic but it seems that the woman who slapped has not filed the complaint because she does not want to cross examination in court, although she will put that person down, breaking her hand, destroys her shit and does not rape her for life. He does not even know that he was the person who had feelings for him, and his family was not just sentimental. There was another problem with the movie, which had some kind of morality to move away from the movie, but everything was fine, but there were some moral questions to try to kill / beat Kadi before doing something illegal, whether it was crazy to take revenge Went, because Kadi proved to be justified by the lawyer for her family to wait for her daughter to be raped Ainibhabe something I could do, it is a wicked thing. So now I've put more pressure on my life for this stupid movie, please do not see it, at least your life will not decrease and my 21/2 hour or more is meant.
