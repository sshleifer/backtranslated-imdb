This movie is taking things straight from the bat. As a major actor, Danny Footht is automatically making some people like this movie. Confession, I love Pathless of Foothth and heard the soundtrack in this movie long ago I saw it. Danny Firth makes for a very recognizable character and a great lead. The film's independent filming style is great for the obscure factor. This movie has some big actresses. Having low budget, special effects were not bad. The way that people killed was very creative and nightmare. <br /> <br /> Now on the opposite side. This is a very short talk across the whole film, thus making it very rarely to create character development. It's tough to fear for long, static characters in life. When there is a little talk, the FO bomb spreads a lot. Yes, I understand people by swearing, but it's written like a fifteen-year-old boy and feels calm at all languages. The story, which I could make it, was pretty good even though many parts became risky and the lack of conversation often surprised what was happening. <br /> <br /> In the end, terrible fear is for sexual acts like violence, but to try to pull a story like a story, it does not work very well. Although you rent it, if you are a deadly person to redeem your blood and meat appetite.
