Strange and shy wolf. The young "red" is full make-up wear, and extremely short shorts and dresses. For about 20 minutes it has been realized that it can be true of a pedophile dream. "Up-beat" music thinks a lot like I want to hear in a strip club. I actually think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Almost, I was watching this with my daughter, I do not want families to see a few kiddie porn together. Too bad, it is very sad to sell as a family film, Joey Fatone will likely be embarrassed. And what does it do with ads as a "special effects spectacular" ??? Look at the low budget of impact, terrible gawd.
