Oh, brother. This annoying film is the only reason I avoid the total "bomb" from me because it is historically significant as the first three Stog√®ge films (when they were still not their own and still associated with that painful obscure Ted Hilly). But as a stugge fan for a long time, I want to say that young mothers, Larry and Curley are the three big assistant janitors here. Healy used the long boss janitor. They are not strongly featured through movies and their shameless on-off-strings stains make it very difficult to make their more attractive cartoon characters fun. <br /> <br /> This is mostly a dentist Jack Parle wants to get himself shiny from the audience, who made Baron Munchus incognito (Here are a good example of the level of humor: "I know!" "On some basis?" "Coffee Basis! "). His Sidekick is not any other than a young Jimmy Durante, but Schnoz is a bore himself.
