Was it a thriller when I saw the cover in the video library? No The authors are probably trying to make it why it was a 'food fr thought'? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average movie, which was a lot of potential, and well-directed, but gave a confusing story without a strong point, at the beginning of the middle and late, hoped for the poor performance of the serial killer, though he was very excited at some points. Performance distribution. Nice colorful images, nice color, beautiful hi-tech stuff, beautiful scenery, but where you are going and where it is right there are missing pages that are nice And with a feeling of it just wrap it till the end. It's OK to see if there is anything else on TV.
