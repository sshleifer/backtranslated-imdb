I saw at the tube last night. Attracting my attention to the first involved in the actor. The first scene was to get attention. Something funny is something funny. Good character development I felt the third of the film is isolated. If I did not have the initial part of the movie, I would have stopped. I keep watching observers how it's tied together. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I do not think it happened. I did not particularly like the extended period that many characters of the character are talking about magic (?). Was that another shoe? <br /> <br /> What do I recommend? No, I do not think so. Other critics have mentioned that most of the slang dates (Jim's 60's) but this was not very confusing. The last turned me off completely completely.
