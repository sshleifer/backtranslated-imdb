This image is a Japanese woman who is covering the skin with cooligraphy. <br /> <br /> This plot is quite bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot activates an ancient art form in a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the illustrated scenes in Hong Kong are certainly portraying the bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the city's mid-airports, poor living and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I think "The Peelo Book" insults the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "The Pilo Book" is a distorted, yet annoying film. Stay away from it seriously.
