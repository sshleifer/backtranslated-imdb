It closes a whip of old Frankenstein premises. A well-known scientist killed in an unknown accident and his father, a well-known brain surgeon, preserves the brain. Then his own design was kept in a robotic body. His brother, an electric genius, instilled 'colossus' in order to transform thoughts into a speed. The whole project is bad, when the creation goes berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are adopted. There is a lack of scripts. And it's ridiculous that it's not a bit scary. Well, very young children will feel good about this. If you wake up three hours in the morning and it comes ... at night, at night, at night. <br /> <br /> The main character played by Auto Krueger, John Barridge and Ross Martin. Ed Oloff played Kolsas.
