The film confuses religious morality and ideology so much that it fails to make logical arguments against the death penalty at any level. Through the legal execution of murder convicted for the mysterious end of mankind, the film promoted the killing of a parent to the rank of martyr for Christ.

The lead character, an unwanted pregnant suicide woman, finally gives her a living in a defiant but incredible attempt to save this guilty killer. Returned as powerless and frustrating pride to reveal the existence of Jesus' power in other threads of unused plot. Christ's modern colonial incarnation not only boasts him, but also deceives the Messianic ideology of all religions. He is unable to influence mankind and is waiting to destroy mankind's own soul at the end of life. Meanwhile, through a little help from Jesus, mentally unstable pregnant women have found the ability to regenerate themselves into a newborn child, which in some way protects mankind from the wrath of the Almighty.
