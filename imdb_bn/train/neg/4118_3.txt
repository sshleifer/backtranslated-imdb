During the channel surfing, we found this movie with its committed summary. We played flat, and were dismayed at the storytelling tales. We set out the burst car scene, outsusing out the incredible shoots, and set time-foam and cardboard crashes with weight. What was more humorous was the recycled scenes from "Dante Peak", where the school bus in front of the church, the front of the store collapses on the main street, overpus collapses, and the red truck stops at the speed of the golf course. As the brick falls on it. It was fantastic but there was a good smile and the audience was surprised that it was mainly not considered as a mistake in low-budget movies of disaster films.
