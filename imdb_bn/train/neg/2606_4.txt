Drew Barrym's young actor, Hollie Gooding, who travels with Happy Script writer Patrick Hyschel (George Newburn), and his "Dippelanger" or the evil young man demanded to kill his family, completely disrupted his life. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror movie is difficult to accept, though filmmakers and actors think of themselves as serious. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The name of the famous author Patricia Hyssith (he really is trying to re-write "Breakfast" as a horror film, do not believe it or not!). I think it's not quite creditable for your ideal horror movie - I mean, writer / director Avi Nash is genuinely concerned about his characters, and more than the plot to rent his film standard slasher Gives. <br /> <br /> - A stupid villain - explaining everything to the audiences, the film is going to submit a horrific, out-climax which is being believed. This picture does not jump over Gore. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drake killed her mother's mother. No, I'm not kidding. Seeing Jared Barimo only to start a violent way. <br /> <br /> The dru is always very watch and very sexy. Newbern comes off as a likable- enough, "nice" sort of people. But the height of the film should be visible with Sally Kellman, who is an attractive gentleman who is one of the scenes of a professional nun who started a phone sex business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is primarily junk, but it's funny on a weird, thick little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
