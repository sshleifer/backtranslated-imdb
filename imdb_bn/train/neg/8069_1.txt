An incomprehensible mess with a troubled musical instrument of condolence survivor, the lastest entry in the horror films "Who Are Dead and Who Living?" Two teenage couple, Shan and Casey and Matt and Anabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before joining the Thanksgiving Brake, they appear on the last end of a few burnt churches in the slutty Annabel (elizabeth Dushku, Ukka Faith, other vampires slayer). Uninterrupted vague people began to pay a lot of attention to Casey (Generic Melissa Segmillar) who did not explain, and long ago, the quadruple party was released. After moving away from them in their sev, they were followed and then sent to the unclear boys, who immediately and unintentionally 180 deliberately worked between the highway, caused a painful and deadly accident, because the SUV jumped on the dam and entered into one. River Shane has died (or he?), And Casey is dealing with the film's loneliness and crime (he was driving) when he was not frustrated by the ghosts of Shi'a or the impotent boys who did not follow him. Until Cassie's mental state, until we reach the conclusion of the forecasts, many undecided inconsistencies follow. So, who dies and who is alive? This purgatory ninety minutes later, who really cautions?
