The Terenosaurus Azteca was established during the thirteenth century, where the famous Spanish investigator Hernando Cortes (Ian Ziaring) brought his best six with Lieutenant Rios (Marco Sánchez) in Mexico, if a lot of gold stolen arises that they could claim the land in Spanish name. Within a few minutes their local Aztec savages have their first sight, in a few minutes that Cortes and his men are held captive and detained. If it is not bad enough, a couple of Ternosaurus Rex lives there and likes to eat locals, the Spanish offer to win their lives helps locals get rid of their giant problems, but with few hidden agendas and fewer than them, only for dinosaurs No, it has to see them ... <br /> <br /> Operated Brian Tray Under the title Schwarz-Smith (who, incidentally, one of my most favorite exploitation films, a Turkish shoot (1982) which I recommend for all) and AJPT Rex's Spoof Sounding (This title changed when the title was broadcast, As originally titled Tinosaurus Azteca, it sounds a foreign movie) It's still another stupid and silly Looking ta scientific-channel channel characteristics of animals, and you must know it. Based on the original Spanish Controversy Courts during his campaign in Mexico, and the film does not struggle for historic accuracy, although I acknowledge that the story tries to make something different here but in the end Teranosaurus Azteca is still an 'animal trait' in its time settings Despite some poor CGI computer graphic running with a bunch. Not sure what else I can say in spite of the usual clichés placed here, the character is cutout out of the ordinary cardboard, stupid decision and selfish one, heroic, retreating, stupid victim, who only eat and eat beautiful women here and spot simple. The film is not guessable, stupid, dull and does not really entertain at any level, although it can be moved at a moderate pace and that kind of thing has one or two half-beautiful moments with your interest. The story is not good and there are lots of holes, it's a movie that you will forget completely within a few days. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen and commented a lot about science-channel channels 'animal properties' and generally the effects of CGI computers are terrible and Tieranosaurus Agateka does not completely transform this tendency. I acknowledge that there are some dominant shots that seem to be right, but then they are completely destroyed by terrible effects. Shoot it straight later. There is some decent influence here, a heart is cut, a man's legs have been spilled, some blew out, a cool man's cool shot keeps his gut after being infected by dinosaurs, there are few found dead bodies, and some are stealing with a spear Is. T-Rex can eat too many people. Production prices are really cheaper, today's set seems to be one of the theme park attractions, and the Spanish men should be imprisoned at the worst end of the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said, I said, do you know? Day. I have never heard of any of the acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The default statement is basically you should make enough decisions that you Have to decide whether to enjoy it (probably not guessing).
