When I first read the casting this movie was exactly what I expected it to be. Perhaps I could write a more exciting plot, it is a sad fact that they kept a package of Hawler monkeys. Alberto Tamba was definitely a good skier but had to thank him (and also) that he would not have to rely on his actor's skills to earn his livelihood. He can not play, he can not talk, he can not move very well in the mainland besides his ski ... Michelle Hanzikar is a beautiful blonde girl, and that's all. She was perhaps chosen for her wonderful skills in her dramatic role but was probably not selected for her beautiful legs. Yet I must admit that he can be a teacher acting at Tomb, because he is also the worst actor and it's funny, especially considering that he is not Italian. I always smile, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually smiled me, was not found very loud.
