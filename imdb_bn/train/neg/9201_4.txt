This film reflects the D & D horror of the 80s (and even today). The fear is that D & D (or any role that plays any role) will "suck" the game and reduce the ability to differentiate reality from fantasy (and fungus, child festival, suicide etc). A great movie for any person who likes to blame the issue of social issues, but whoever plays a role-playing game, a video game or even a game, will see it as an insult to their intelligence. It was D & D what Wargames Computer was. Plus as a movie, it just sucks kinda.
