It's a French film, LOL, saying it insists on young girls with many older men ... Why are French such things fixed? When the age difference is great this, it really comes off as pervy! Valentina Sarvie is beautiful (she meets Jefferrlie's '68 Romeo and Olivia Hassie of Juliet with the same analogy), but she watched 15 years ago and her artist Taseer plays actor ... well, 50kids. <br /> <br /> Other posters have tried to explain the original Artemesia historic record (in this case unusually detailed), a great artist and one of the first recognized women paints of this time. 17th century). In the modern era, especially his story talked to us that "all the great artists were male" - most of the blasts that claim to be bits - and because the story of his rape trial is so stupid. He did not just attack explicitly, and was forced to commit a violent sexual relationship (because at that time your marriage was the only way to avoid social shame), but Taseer was a series of rapists and probably killed his wife and child. <Br /> <br /> This truly captivating and extravagant real life story - this film is very dramatic and does not require any "spicing up" - because it is a strange "warm" way to draw a foreign teenage male sex organ and Having a hot love relationship with the old man enough to be his grandfather. That "sexy" - seems to be really boring and very feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that it is the only part of Artemisia life that is considered as attractive enough for the film. He painted for decades (not before before the rape, featured Judith's famous Holophenes title), that he was the first woman to enter the prestigious Florentine Academy, that he adopted the son ... oh boring stuff. After all, it's about a middle-aged woman and they are not "hot" like teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many creative licenses for creating a movie (or a book), the historical character. You have to create dialogs, have subplots, create dramatic structures. Certain details of course can be dedicated - if the dates are moved to several years, there is no big deal, or if an anesthesia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self-portrait that she is a brunette ... and one of the big sisters , Not a skinny minny), or something like that. But to turn his story around him, and raping a romance is actually sick and boring. It's even worse because director lady. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Forest appetit!
