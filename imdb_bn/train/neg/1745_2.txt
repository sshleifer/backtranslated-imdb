The first half hour of the movie was at a steady pace and started the characters. But suddenly, everything went very fast, Akhi Kumar's three daughters, for a long time because of the girls, Akshi and John Abraham were very loud with both acting. Neha Dupiya was a highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well but lost is not as good as her performance in the ferry. Overall the film is the biggest disappointment in the film without taking any of its trailer justice. Save your money and do not see this movie, see Hira Ferry and Jhamaa! <br /> <br /> Description: The performance and appearance of a status show of the film is not a story or material scene, the plot is uncommonly a good song of non-priyatam, which has bought our own smoke! Keep it up! The movie shot in one room, the new actor (female cast) is okay because it was his first film, but the actor and actor like Priyadarshan had disappointed the established director, his worst movie ever!
