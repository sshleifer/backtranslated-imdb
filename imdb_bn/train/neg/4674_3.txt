I do not know to blame Miss Lease or his manager, but it's almost impossible to see his performance as a cathrine. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin has done a higher job - so far as I am concerned. Its character is completely very impressive and interesting. But of course, the character is not shown as greedy with the impressiveness of the character. Due to the lack of coating and lack of grace, Chaplin may not be understood as that, rather his orthopedic treatment. There are some elements of its interest in credibility, but it is understandable as it plays. Do not jibe performance Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, despite any efforts to disassemble them, it is surprising. Supporting cast is also a pleasure to see. What a teen, too, do not work together in leadership, because look beautiful to look at.
