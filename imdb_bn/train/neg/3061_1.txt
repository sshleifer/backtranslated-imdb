This picture is awful. Give me a dentist anytime! Can you believe that the main TV stations on Arab TV were like their Christmas! I could hope to entertain the crowd with Doodle Moore rather than just them. Last time I looked at my hot water bottle and saw that there was more performance, better plots, more plays and much more interest than celluloid. Even if you are not drunk do not see it!
