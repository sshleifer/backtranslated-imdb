You are seeing this without any idea about the story but you are very surprised. Even then the synopsis have painted a picture of a rather intelligent story, but the actual film is something else. <br /> <br /> as the synopsis went, it is an obsessed mountain climber, which you will see, opening credits and temptations before the reading crawl, which tells you the presence of chronopolis, a mythical city that is in the dream manuscripts Note? It creates problems with flashing light), where its residents wish for immortality, a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and look at all the people of this mountain, and have been briefly explained that they decided to contact him through pesticides, creating intelligent spheres to meet a man. <br /> <br /> which translates, a repetitive piece of animation that can produce a 5-year-old child. Create shapes, though the credit goes to stop motion styling and keeps it through a mind-nulling loop. And repeat until your eyes start off, then move towards the next scene. If anything, chanopolisians (if this word exists) really loves their stick and balls, which play continuously during the magical spheres and play the field before releasing it in "other" world. It does not get any good, when the person interacts with the spheres with another hypnotically annoying and sleeping sequence sequence. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < During the firm date, its soft colors, story of existence, scratchy soundtracks, and repetitive pictures will conquer any fans. Do not waste time.
