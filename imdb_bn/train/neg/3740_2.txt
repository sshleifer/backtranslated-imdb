All right, this picture was ridiculous. Does not that it was in the redeeming direction ?? For example, the best thing about this picture was the beautiful background scenery. Any person living in the East Coast can not see the beautiful mountains like the west on the south. I knew that camel was on the right side of the bat, but probably Dalton could not impose his English accent, so they claimed to be the southern city. A pronoun to a south was easy to exchange. Certainly the plot of the film was split, but the wrong idea of ​​the place was such that I could not have gone past. There is no meth lab like Utah ... so why did the writers think that it was necessary to publish it out of the south. <br /> <br /> There is one more thing that can puzzle me together. Why do they always create "cocking" sound effects when the character automatically pulls handsguns? It seems that all the other sound effects of the film were "Chukchach", which meant 9 mm and was ready for fire. Of course, the arms were already wide so it was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, piratecans are at the top. But hey, this movie seems to have been targeted on a specific 'Market segment' ... it is very bad. Actors can each act, but this film was lame.
