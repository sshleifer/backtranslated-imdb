This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Good Goofel does not do it but it's a good crime film done. This film should be considered STING Part2 or perhaps near the speed zone. Remember those gems! The only reason to make this film is to follow the original culture. Everything in the film was de Palma, Casino and Pen. Not a favorite character and responsible for making it blame everyone. I hope the Ridge-to-Power can make every Roger win, and perhaps it can keep a new record so that it can be a record holder. After seeing this S @ * T FEST movie I sat and saw the way of real Carlitos to get bad bad taste from my mouth. After watching this Panchanga came out of my sorrow.
