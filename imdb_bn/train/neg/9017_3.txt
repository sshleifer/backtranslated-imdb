I got caught in sai-fi before using this movie. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cane dive and avoiding a dozen times in the fire, this movie is for you. If it does not keep an eye on your interest, I'm scared that you will be caught in a fire because the film is quite bad. Acting, starting with, horror, horror, horror, horror Characters are completely objectionable, and the dialogue is worse than your usual Z-grade, Sci-Fi movie. At the end, the film reminds me of 'Hall Man' (fully escaped through lift shafts), without a dragon, not naked, invisible people. Contrary to other similar flicks, however, this was not even curious bad ... it was just plain bad.
