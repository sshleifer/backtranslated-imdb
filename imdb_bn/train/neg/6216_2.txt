9, I was waiting for a few months for this picture .... Then there was a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the story of 9 short stories and the development of strange characters. The sequence of all the awesome acts in the world is not created for a single incomplete character. <br /> <br /> Strange, the sporadic spatialities were not just out of place, they were very annoying. The story is about robots and scientists ... Why does it become a nokronomicon scurry with mysterious symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of answering devices that can be a scary story ?? <br /> <br /> How are you, if, when, why .... questions are asked for your care and it has few and less potential questions to go away from the theater. <br /> <br /> Such a movie is frustrating due to lack of depth .... The story was good if I used to paint this picture in kayani. But filmmakers rely on the reassurance of CGI Wizards and Tim Burton's. Which ... brought me but failed to attain my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been great ... writing a few again and a little more respect from their producers.
