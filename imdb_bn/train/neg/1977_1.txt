Wait, do not tell me ... They threw the movie and went out. You know, this movie was shot in a back street in New York. I guess "Gangster Bangster". Gangster rap, designer gangster duster clothes, which suddenly moved from the neck to protect the head from dust storm. I guess it was to protect the head from heat-filtering through the K-mat cap. "Budget rent-a-horse" seems to be, horses are supplied. The scene of a bedroom where the girl was talking and the man was speaking his words ... though she was speaking. You know, seeing this movie is only to make sure that it's not about acting ... it seems and it's about money. This movie can not be too much where that is concerned. Well, above all, I think this film will be the greatest movie of all times ever. Just another thing, where was the ice? At last he was able to go?
