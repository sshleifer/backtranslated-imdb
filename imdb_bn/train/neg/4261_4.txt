Poorly When the director comes to work only this happens when someone pays him money. <br /> <br /> The purpose was good for a photo of epic, great location and settings. But performance, great! I swear, in some shots you can look beyond the background of the camera, or keep an eye on the actors because nobody tells them that they are "Action!" What to do if you listen. War scenes are so bad that you are surprised - this is real for people? They could just do more damage by hugging each other. You can walk around walking or walking on the battlefield in slow-sighted scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But for what? The story is so irrational and incomplete, it seems to be growing in the growing circumstances, sometimes it does not. Conversations are stupid, love plot more embarrassing than the Hong Kong action films and funny. <br /> <br /> Through 40 million budgets, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, in the best case apparently, final results of all these efforts are placed in a shiny round laser disc on thin cover, in the video store shelves.
