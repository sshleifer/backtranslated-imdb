* Can the type have a spoiler? * Crispin Glover is just enough to send some geek's panties into a bunch of referrals. As a symbolic figure in his back to the futures, George McFly sealed him American Consciousness forever. Recently, he is trying to return to the cultural subconscious with the bridge and Willard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It reminds me, as a whole, it almost humiliates me, but not because of its content. Content? what is this? In a movie where, in half of the film, all actors have Downs Syndrome, it feels a freakshow. The other half of the film is Crispin Glover, Adam Parfere, and Cerebral Pallisi. Everyone thought about what John Waters was trying to do with DePirite Living, and simultaneously felt more successful feeling and unfortunately failed. <br /> <br /> There are many killings in half of the syndrome actors. It's a guy who has snails, and finally killing one. He is tormented by a bunch of other people, and a piercing. He falls in love with 2 daughters, in which he has a sexual intercourse in a graveyard. She has a fall with a friend who teasing her. <br /> <br /> A curious semi-interior set, this show director of Crispin Glover. She is something like control of the mind of the people, and something like cerebral palsy folk sex. Well, she gets masturbated in at least obvious scene. Other "threatening" images make it laughable, such as Nazi Swajics have crossed the Sheryli Temple, and black-looking black minaret Jackson says that they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the abuser is still working with him to be killed by affection and other people being beaten by love. They hit him with stones, and as such. Later, they disarmed him after the trial. <br /> <br /> Back in, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everyone, but unfortunately fails. <br /> <br /> What is it? Dr. Gives less knowledge than Kaligari, and more than it's theft. Clostrophobic psychological space is very much like the claustrophobic feeling of Dr. Kaligar's no-wall set. They were absolute nonsense that there were some dialogue. And, it was covered with absurdist imagery for all humorous. <br /> <br /> Problems, about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What's this? Runs out of the images. For the next 56 minutes, we continued on the same set of images, presenting new images only as a disobedient doll show. The film thinks a little more than a movie that tries to push the leaflet offensive and inactive images. It tries to deceive and confuse viewers. But the problem is quite different imagery for a 40 minute movie. Worse than, <br /> <br />, cinematography, set design and everything else is very cheap and almost unplanned. It just felt like "OK, in this way we can do it and get it to the path." It did not seem interesting, and was quite annoying. On the other hand, Dr. Kaligari did amazing cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite surprising. <br /> <br /> Ratings: c
