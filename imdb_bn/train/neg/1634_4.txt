BEGIN SPEAKER: Funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal touch-smoking scene: Chong coolly hacks his pipe bowl, light up, cough and hacks for eternity forever, then without a beat and without a beat, the bowl is properly loaded, re-lights , Re-attack. Last speaker Well, I started to lose the faith half way through the proceedings. It happened to me that the unimaginable ones are unnecessary and less than being related. I came to realize the relative stereotype of contemporary Stoner, Harold and Kumar. I just like the bright company. Still, the film is probably suitable for baked frames or for those who are so weak-minded, when they fit perfect for being deviated from Stoner - ex-captivating. Paul Ruben's remarkable guest appearance enhances the ambiguity of pre-PV-form.
