Wanderers have been consistently disappointed with the tendency to repeat themselves, because of growing up with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> 'Lots of land' is no exception. Even before I came, I had hoped for a mediocre film, that the ambassador always looks better than ever. It is now taken for his films heavy hammer and bomber. <br /> <br /> I was not sure whether I was watching a comedy in Central America or some exciting comedy. The results of Dihal's character are completely predictable. Wender's insistence on layering many so many scenes with some rock songs is extremely annoying. <br/> <br /> I'm sure many people will think that this film is important and tragic, but to be honest, it's only a tedious and long-standing effort. From the poor side <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Yes, Wonders was the best and now it needs to understand that she needs a good script writer. His films were a total mess in the last 15 years.
