I hoped the combination of films about Sassifi and Ad Benefits, Charles Badge, Computer History, and I was frustrated by the mix of vague pseudoscience and real and imagined history. It prints that his author (Lin Hershamman-Lesson) does not understand the film's issue of mathematics, technology, or any real understanding of history, but rather instead of working from a vague artistic impression. It hit me with a tired spot, because I have long been disturbed by the trends of science and ideas from the impressive perspective, for example, Amy Quair: "There is half the life of data waves", "I'm not sure half life is more than life. Good. "<br /> <br /> This movie works worse than failure in entertainment - it misunderstood. For this, I can only imagine that it can attract visitors who spoil the issue so badly. It is perhaps, I think, any degree of advancement that may be different from magic is to propagate strange ideas of science and technology.
