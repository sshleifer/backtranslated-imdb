The first cruel objectives, original, all my favorite movies at all times. It was an absolute composition. So how could they make a sequel so badly on the earth so badly. Sir Michelle Gallery was perfect in the first film. This one, Amy Adams sucks. She is terrible. And did they not find a dog that looked like Sarah Michelle Gallery? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come back Robin Doe is not as bad as Adam, but he is terrible compared to Ryan Phillip. Sebastian is fierce, deceitful, and worse than the Sebastian in the first film. And what's up with the story line up It basically goes like this ... <br /> 1- Sebastian has bad bad representation in his first school, so the film says, even though it is about her and her dating life and how she was with her girls 2- Sebastian goes to New York Come on, and suddenly he decides to surround himself. She "fell in love" with Daniel (I can remind you that Sarah Michelle Gilar quotes, "It was broken by the first person you loved because I said - so how did she fall in love?") And she All beautiful and charming, and all "good person", as he turned down the sex from the chick doing his dad. <br /> <br /> 3- He has a complete 180 <br /> <br /> I mean, it's terrible and I love the first one so I have not seen the third one. I'm better off than this prequel I hope.
