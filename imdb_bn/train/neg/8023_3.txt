After watching this movie on DVD, I saw the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as over-exaggerated. Well, there are overwhelming, and there are surreal there. <br /> <br /> It was the only part of this picture that I felt supernaturally, but to be honest, it was far more confusing than real. Other unusual images, especially the lunch room scenes where everyone is on the floor, were so meaningless that they had no meaning. I do not think of imagery that I do not mind, but these scenes seem to be irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I think the director is trying to reveal Logan's internal solidarity. I do not know what will happen or not. Unfortunately, no matter what I saw, Logan was thinking what, what was his point of view, and even a source about his mental state. I used to say that he was not particularly happy about his physical appearance, and he pressured an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought, what is the relationship between boys, it has ended, but nothing else has happened. It was quite easy to juxtaposing the confused scenario with them as compared to an artistic decision looked like a police outside. <br /> <br /> Still, the film was tedious for me and as content-free, it was a definite change of pace. I liked the Madagascar Skin too, and I thought this movie was such a story, perhaps even stimulated in style. It does not even close. There is no question for me: this film is eligible for A for the effort, but a D for the death penalty.
