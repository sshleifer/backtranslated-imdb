The ghost of Vietnam war has now scared American mentality for thirty years. Thousands of US troops went to MIA in Vietnam, or were returned to countries where they were treated, because there was no reason to lose America, because the first was a war. Many people came from the war to shade their former heaven from home and the original First Blood led to provide a little insight into their problems, because they said they were trying to travel around the world. On the other hand, First Blood Part II, a fist-pumping mess, which is a little too much to explain how tragic and defeated America may be. Stalin Tytler has another lazy performance as a special force commando, and Richard Karena tries to keep serious actor contests. Where it is brought back to the script, it does not work any better when it is known as Action in Missing and Chuck Norris Star. The filmmakers decided to draw a large S. on Rambo's massive chest, because basically the slightest constraint of the argument has now gone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this middle follow-up, Rambo is considered to be some open-air mine. He breaks stones and sweats, a prison guard lets him go and have a chat with Colonel Trutman who advised him that if he goes to a secret mission, his government is willing to release him quickly. Rambo, never came down from the hard work, accepted and immediately sent to Cambodia or Thailand (which I am forgetting) to the secret base. From there, he is commissioned to find the camp where American MIA is being speculated and photograph them. His mission clearly mentions that he will not make any effort to secure the release. Rambo is Rambo, although there are other ideas even though they have potential political effects. <br /> <br /> Certainly, people who run Rambo's work are not interested in ensuring that the Americans are interested in some MIAs. It does not apologize for the misuse of the plight of old American conspiracy theories, and officially, many American families left for ten years for a war in Vietnam. Of course, in the early 1980s, in the American society, they can not help with a plant tenant in the Vietnamese army's bed, with the birth of zongogism as a single battalion of Russians. Together, two opponents try to figure out what information they can collect from Rambo, but it attacks them with bullet, arrow, rocket and the pain of destruction. The only missing thing is that when Rambho drinks from a shrimp like a leopard and proclaims himself unconscious. <br /> <br /> To be honest, First Blood Part II is a good picture and well-known dancer, Action Exhibition. The battle of hand-to-combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few wars in which there is a dramatic tension. The rest is the only lead actor and director to create a fantasy for pampering their fist for America. Thankfully, these UberFrancers of America soon died when more self-defense and intelligent warrior films like Pluto began round. Despite the difficulties of the murder shown here, quite creative. Vieten's captain is over, villains of many action films will be envy. The Russian Commander is ridiculous as it is as spectacular as a way to bite it. The only action film of the decade of 1980s will use the law inside the helicopter. Of course, action film clinics were involved in a real conflict, but never before was this ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I gave Rambo: First Blood part is one of two tenths. It's so ridiculous and ridiculous that it's often fun. Do not require military service to know how to order something stupid. It is a risky topic for direct involvement with the only risk that is attempted to create a stupid political statement. Put the tongue firmly firmly, and it may be watchable.
