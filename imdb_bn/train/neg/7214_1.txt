Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager launched by Satan (and LSD) by his archaeologist Drunk Richard. Local fortress, the ancient fortress, where Lila and Richard drink blood, drop into drugs, join sex, dance in Lam Psychedelic rock and participate in black mass shows where people wear pants, masks and caps. And the woman does not wear anything at all. Unfortunately, such unrecognized activities have freed Lilah from the fraudulent occupation from "the spirit of evil". Leila also comes from a screw-up family, which does not help. Her older brother John seems to be in love with her, is a recluse. Her mother Patricia (Maria Persczy) has become depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the death of her father. To stop this, Debbie Gibson (gasp!), Her sister (Maria Costie), a sloppy semi-pro golfer! There are plenty of help in addition to waste more time. Two new maid (a young man who spends a lot of clothes and spies the old one), and Uddo (Luis Iduni), a radioactive magician who spies on a shyly changed clothes, torn apart his nude picture and pulls his newly-used bathing suit into the pool house Take sniff. Oh yes and class, pet Shepherd pet <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tell him, "They said I'm the opposite and I'm going to prove it!" During his birthday party, he told his guests, "You make me sick! I hate you all!" And when mom is advised to come to the doctor, she scribbles "I do not want to see the fat ass!" Debbie suggests that she forces Laila to "sanity", but Lella runs and worships again. He was rescued (again) and returned home (third time). At this moment, there are only ten minutes left and what we have seen mainly is how boring pictures of some characters are terrible and f-ed talking about their life and how Lella is acting weird. It's annoying, often mad and sunny to sit almost like Annie Milligan's movie. But in the last few minutes we can explain the title to the film - an outsider-occupied possession. Unfortunately, the best part of it is to wear contact lenses. Some cheap slash slashes appear on his arms, legs and face, suddenly he gets a lip and his eyes take the look of blue and white marbles. He started the rest of the dead body, opened some clear junk, began to speak in the voice of his dead father, entered his mother's bedroom, and wandered a little bit and called her "whore." Father Adrian came, who finally believed that he was actually possessed, stopped his efforts in temptation, the hallucinates frogs and eels remained in the kitchen and Lila kept the water in the holy water. The door is open and closed, a mirror break, a sudden thunder and raised up close to the floor of his bed. After dealing with dancing and moving around two stairs, the soul comes out of it and imagines who? Why, family of bug family! Then the monster dog turns Adrian and puts him down before putting the fire on the worm. Then we get one of the most annoying final shots ever committed to the film. It's going to return to her normal sexy self from Lema's floor. But then there is another time deviation that seems that the monster probably restored his body. It has happened very badly, you do not have any information about what it needs to do, which is finalizing a person in front of a person who has lost half an hour on this unreasonable POS. /> Contact screw, it's 10 out of 1.
