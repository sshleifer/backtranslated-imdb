'Home Alone 3' is the first movie of Home Alone movie, which is the main role and the same villains do not have the features of Kulkina. However, the plot is similar to the original 'Home Alone' movie. Instead of two humorous villains, we could get three or four of them. There are some snares in this movie, but it also has a long view with a remote control car. Slopstick humor is also consistent, but young boys and villains fail to influence the film. (For an intellectual purpose.) This film does not provide new or different things than previous films, and there are no warmth, holiday feelings, or concerts in the other two films. This is a pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh because the characters did not really do it for me. I will not recommend this film; It's pretty annoying. If you are looking for a good holiday family film with comedy, then watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.
