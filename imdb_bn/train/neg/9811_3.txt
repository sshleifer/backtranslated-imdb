Can i say ??? This movie was so stupid and stupid I thought it was a psychological DRAG comedy - they should rename it "fight pregnant pregnant cat!" If you want to see what a stupid waste of time (DIE DIE !!! "I want to queen your daughter to drag out) Jennifer Tilly is one of only" clinging "movies after being her freaky self, rent out, oh," The Bride Chuck. "It's fun to see two ugly plastic dolls (one of them turned into UGL female version of Jennifer Tilly Chakki), after which Daryl Hannah is pregnant, stupid and stupid, and Jennifer Tilly, after having plastic rubber sex, Hassbong is a food processor. It reminds me that my mother is trying to work in the house! It's okay!
