I discovered that this image was rented on packaging basis. The front zombie of the DVD looks cool and frightening. Then you get the movie and women with it raccoon mask. The special effects of zero ... even in the battle scene you can see their punches by 2 feet miss. The funny thing is that Lomel himself works in the movie and is worse than the rest of the film's actors. The only thing I can remember is that Lomel is trying to create a bad movie that people call it a "classical classic". However, I probably do not think that anyone is thinking about it but it is one of the worst movies. Made The actual horror in this movie is so bad. I'm feeling embarrassed that I've rented it and can not see another lomel film again!
