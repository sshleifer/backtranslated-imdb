At the 2006 trilike film festival, I saw this picture last night and it seriously surprised me that people actually screen the films before they are selected. The film was just terrible - I say without a hyperbolle or a spectacular purpose - it was awful. Matthew Modine's day as a leading man is the way. Gina Garner had an inexperienced and unnecessary English pronunciation - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Ruben had a little too little - she should be ashamed. The script was terrible and we are given absolutely no reason to care for the care of the letters. I would highly doubt this would pick up, but again, Hollywood people are sometimes known to make mistakes. I really think "kettle of fish" is a serious rival for the worst movie I've ever seen.
