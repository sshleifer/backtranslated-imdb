This was a nasty waste of my time. No plot That acting was so low, it should not be used as an example of what the acting class should do. It's just a commercial rip off of former Universal Soldier, which scraps under acting barrels. Sadly, VDC will have to protest against its arrogance every few years, and it is a sad fact that people will pay good money to sit through it. Such sculptures give a bad name to the martial arts movie. Comparing it, it feels Seagal, Norris, and Arnold as genius. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Videolt Leslie Nilsson can take the track and send text to her style. At least we could laugh with him instead.
