Calyphia is annoying. I believe there is no reason to be told this story. It is neither entertaining nor social value. Technically, the film is very good, performance is top rate and first-class. The story holds interest in developing an intriguing way. But ultimately the movie is sick and hateful to Satan. I do not recommend to anyone in California.
