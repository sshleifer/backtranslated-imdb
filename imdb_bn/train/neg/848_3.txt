OK, if you are looking for another Bastketball diary, it's completely wrong film. <br /> <br /> I almost two brothers roam around. The highest, the smallest, have a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, a doctor. This film seems to be possible by the fact that the drug logo in reality shows the possibility of drug abuse. It's not, however. It does not matter what the situation might be that cocaine may be fun. Most of the film focus is on the highest and its method of division. Finally, Adam could not take pressure from his job and started using them as well. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is almost no climax. What does cocaine actually do with you, it does not have boring and low budget scenes and big brother Adam's acting is horrific. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was directed. Pass and receive the award, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story film in the world of medicine, buy the rental, but do not buy 'diary of basketball'. And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
