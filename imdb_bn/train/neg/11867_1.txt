I do not think it was possible, but I found the film was worse than 'el elt'. This picture is really really bad! And it makes it worse that its Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> It looks like VHS and it gets worse and worse with the 80's rock soundtrack, which is hard to believe how bad it is at the beginning (white The skin of the skin on the tomato sauce spread room is the skin of a man who kisses?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the New York drill, the princess in English, then the pure Aussie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture won some pictures festivals on the cover (I believe this is the Utah film festival). It should be called false because none of them will be nominated for doing something like this (probably Golden Raspberry but I think it is very bad for it) <br /> <br /> <br /> below this picture is 100 Will be !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 0/10
