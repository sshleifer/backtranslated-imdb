This film is an attempt to present the theory of Jared diamonds of "guns, germs and steel", which explains how Europeans have influenced the world. <br /> <br /> This documentary's version shows 3 hours on 2 discs. I think the information may be presented in 20 minutes. Here's a complete pointless view: Professor Gerard Diamond, Bird watching by telescope, Professor Jared Diamond failed to use a bow and arrows properly, Professor Jared Diamond shot a lip-loader fiercely. Did the documentary think of a hero as a "Professor Jared Hero"? This part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. During the visit to the African Hospital Malaria ward, the diamond breaks down and is seen as the worst. None of this helps me to understand the "gun, germ and steel" theory. BTW, "guns, germs and steel" say about 100 times. "Could Europeans' guns, germs, and steel make them out of this terrible situation? Stay safe and find out!" Finally when he dropped out of business, the same part of his theory is interesting and completely annoying. Europeans defeated the native population of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor? Parts of his theory explain how the Europeans had the opportunity to benefit, which could make victory interesting, but the coverage is thin in paper. Finally, I think that the documentary only satisfies me as capable of non-European Europeans as well. If I'm not a racist, I already know it. If I am racist, Jared Diamond is not going to please me with the left-hander use of my local applications. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the elite listener for these adults. Although the kids may enjoy more than I can I have read that the book is much better than the documentary than this documentary.
