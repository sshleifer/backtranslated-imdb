Stephen King adaptation (written by the King itself), among which a young family, the new expatriate of Grameen Meyen, found out about the pet cemetery near their home. Father (Dale Midchef) then found out outside the mitemac cemetery outside of the cemetery where there is a power to resurrect - only to be buried there is nothing right. <br /> <br /> Meaning of average "horror" pictures start out strange, abusive, and inactive, and that way for some time continued, the absolute bad stuff being the ruthless performance of Midkiff. It gets a little better at the end, with the real annoying end. In fact, the whole movie is really annoying, so I can not completely exclude it - at least it has something to make it memorable. Victor Pasco, like Fred Guin, an intelligent old man, and a disgraced spirit like Brad Greenwich, is not really enough to save the film. <br/> <br /> Followers of a McGrath operated by Mc Lambert (it's a wonder that no mainstream movie was working?) <br /> <br /> 4/10
