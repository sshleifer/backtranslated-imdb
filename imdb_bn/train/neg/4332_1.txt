This film is a bad attempt to feel true fans full. What people have forgotten is the fact that the reason for winning such a genuine praise was that you wanted to think incomplete. <br /> <br /> The diner wants me to go to this movie. I'm not a negative kind of person, but the man acting on this flicker .... no comments. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigant and I was sorry to spend my two hours and my money was lost on this money. I still love the original and try my best to not waste my opinion about this movie.
