This show is probably the most successful, the most comprehensive, most generic steam pill I've seen in the children's program that has actually been successful. The main character, Johnny, though I realize that he is supposed to represent a normal child, is not selective or even tolerant. Curiosity is long, overdone (i.e. "Hua !, which has not come to see." Let's say it was not fun for the first time, even this is not intelligent) and there is no form of primitive intellect or inspiration. And to the end ... it's just unclear to see. Even though the artistic talents of the kids are not particularly critical, they still like eye candy. I can not stand by watching the show, because the art style is just ... total. The secret is, in fact, actually. Just plain crummy <br /> <br /> I'm not getting airtime so I can not stand. Although I realize that nostalgia may be a little unreasonable and should not return to my expectation ... I miss the old cartoon really. Bring Dexter's laboratory, Powerpuff Girls ... but this is a bad thing. I think it's just deliberate thinking though. <br /> <br /> Just say, I will not waste your time on this show. I really believe the cartoons are able to be enjoyed by big kids. And do not cut this.
