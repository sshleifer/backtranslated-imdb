I saw this photo on the American Airlines flight in the west. It was really bad actually the flight was considered to be long. This plot was possible (who would not like a movie about a woman who accidentally killed Elise's neighbor?) But it has gone bad over millions of times through really poor writing. At the end there is an embarrassing bad scene where a gang of Alvis's hideers is thinking of returning to the sky on the casino roof, after thinking of coming back to the sky, then they combine a group to form the "Elvis" star, which immediately shot a bolt through the lightning, roof Crash sending. Bad ... really bad. Which is the theme for the whole movie. I want to avoid one at all costs.
