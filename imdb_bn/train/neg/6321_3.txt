I can never imagine that in one million years someone wants to watch this movie. Because it was one of the worst (it was not) sometimes created, but basically it's about 20 years old and oh-out because of mainstream I saw an actor before and was trying to find this popped up. So, yes, a child prevents small leagues because he does not like the nose, it offers the main media attention and the quick solution of the cold war. The end An imagination, be sure, but one cockeyed so it will blush John Lennon. Since terrorism has replaced communism as a religion that turns away from our religion, so there is no relevance in this film, except that it should not go back to that time. Authors, performances, and film drafts are not as unused as well. I've set it up as much as I did this because I've seen this film about 5-6 years old, and still there is a little room in my heart for it, but now I realize that it is not cutting it mustard So, if the law of big numbers is true and someone finally decides to test this movie, it is understandable that there are many better ways to spend your time, but worse than anything else. (Now I will refrain from John Kerry.)
