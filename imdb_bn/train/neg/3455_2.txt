Geez! This is a movie that you think you've reviewed earlier but you did not. I mean, you do not give a shit about it but in some way it came to your mind. <br /> <br /> to be honest and short; This is one of the worst, annoying, and stupid slashers ever made. I can not say anything about this bad piece of this piece because there are honest sequences that can be made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are terrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is acceptable in such a way that it copies "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, it's not good that a movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
