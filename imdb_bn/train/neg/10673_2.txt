This movie was like a bad indie with a talent in the list. The plot was shameless, in the end all the way. It reminds me of something interesting for the 1980s home video market. I would have given it a, but there was little moment when you could see the actors really straining to make this fit. I think the worst thing is the dark water scene below. There was no light under the water, and when anyone was about to take care of us, it was near to get out of the air, this wind tank would have to be seen. There is something else to look at if I will avoid this. Good day.
