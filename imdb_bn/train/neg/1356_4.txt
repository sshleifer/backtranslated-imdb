I disagree with the first and completely and confident user who called it "unclear". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally started the film in screening in Chicago. He has worked in films for years and is the first in a motley trilogy. "what is this?" Kreis Pin Glover attempted an art film in the statues of Hirojag, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I heard rumors a year ago that "crispin glover director of all down-syndrome throwing with aerospace movie". Finally when I came out I saw the trailer and read the summary and I was foming face-to-face face-to-face. ... I went to Mexico to visit it and it was a big disappointment. If he smokes insect smoking grandmother, and dancing puppies, then he will be left slightly better, but only 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words just watch the trailer, entertain, and leave at that. There are some interesting images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but the lack of focus is the amount of frustration.
