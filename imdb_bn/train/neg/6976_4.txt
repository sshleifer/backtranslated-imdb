The fall of the new colored Western Robert Olman from Edmund Noton's book "McCabe" was abandoned during his release, but in the last few years it has followed a strict critique. Along with a complete believable boom-city scene, the characters here do not qualify for much interest, and the image (deliberately) looks steep and unexpected. The bearded Warren Batty plays a streamless entrepreneur who settles in a secluded community somewhere and helps to organize the first barbarians; Once the profit has started, BT naturally works hard for the cities who want to participate in the action. Altonman created a serious, winter atmosphere for the film, which gives some specific ideas about the time and place of the audience, but the activities of small towns in this tragic city are limited - most stories are being made with Vintet - and Altman's passions are deliberately slow. A statement is not going to be created (in fact, in fact, in fact) and the absolute actor looked at each other much more on their mind. It's a suicide picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it's proudly wear to wear. ** **** to
