Mira Brackinadis is one of the rare films that instantly established her place in film history. The praise for the film was absolutely incompatible, even from those involved in it. This photo was loathed from the first day. Although now and then some people will be somewhat wizened who would appreciate the film on the philosophical basis (daring to combat the problem of aggressive feminism or transjordism), the film did not improve the following culture, like some notorious flop. It is not called as a misunderstanding like the scarf, or the show is ridiculed as a camp classic. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the reason that the film is not terribly dangerous, loving, and not even favorite. Mera Brackinandes is just simple money. As a Hollywood mockery it is cold blooded and average-cheerful, but in a blank dotless way. Maradha believes that Hollywood is a corrupt city, but like Laurel and Hardy, Sheryli Temple, Judy Garland and Gary Cooper, they continue to attack this favorite icon. This picture implies that everything about Hollywood has its nature villas. It seems that there is something brave about cheating the sacred cow, but does not provide a logic to scoff at the first place. This film is anti-American and anti-American, and it is opposed and opposed, but all the trend of the late 1960s. Like casino royals; Ski-Doo; I love you, Alice B Touglas and other hip epics, Mira Hippie-Deppie's middle-aged attitude of youth culture. It tries to embrace that very attitude of belts. But instead of fading in joy with the mother, the mother does not try to conceal the insult of anything that comes in her perception. Murray's brainine is a stupid humor; There is no innocent moment there. Its purpose is not respectable. Time Magazine has correctly described it as a "fun thing as a child moulder," but it is not nearly sympathetic. <br /> <br /> For example, the poor Man West faced so much criticism. The film, being described as looking like everything from a granny dragon to a reanimated walking body to the queen. The eighth star apparently did not know that she saw her grandson or her grandchildren foster an adulterous genius agent for the adultery of a young man. However, the director asked Michael Stern about how he used him. Why? Because, she was obviously joke. John Haston, John Carradine, Grandi Sutton, Andy Divine, and one of the best-known actors in the film, they are only there that they can mock their age and use them to throw pictures of their images. They were cast as a ruthless self-parody like Remy Red, the arrogant, fascinating film critic, who acted like a movie. But the original Reid, Celebrity Hound, Jets-setting, talk show Gossip, can be an amazingly funny way; But instead of Mayan, Maya has changed pride, she is just illogical. Again, again for CERN, Reid is fun <br /> <br /> You see Mira Brackennez and do not see actors, you see the victim. No one is more than Raquel Welch. No one will ever blame Welch for being an actress, but it is a rule for his determination and his appeal that he achieved the success of this film and his career. In almost every scene, Welch had front and center as a target of misuse of the movie targets, but for his achievements, he showed an extraordinary skill. Of course, Houston and almost kittens concentrated in the west of the chewing scene, Welch does not have much to do to maintain good balance. Even, he presents his horribly irrational dialogue with his own death memorial, just as an indication of the self-righteous road that James Bond proudly admits to Villeen. Legendary Weilch was pushed to the unpredictable West Bank graduation and leftist director Surna kept it behind repeated oral abuse, not mentioning mentioning in a frustrating scenario after another, it made it even more remarkable that a cool and collected performance. <br /> <br /> The only stimulating element in the film is trying to understand how the movie agenda is right. The whole story is a fantasy novel, indicating that it can provide a moral, but some of those guesses that might happen. With all his statements about the destruction of "the last painful sign of traditional manhood from the nation", it would seem like a feminine gourd grapes. But as a feminist, Maya is a giant figure, a sex hunter. Besides, Mira is not a woman, but she is confused with Mayaan, who may possibly be gay. It can explain the nature of the love / hate aspect of the male as well as the view of the rape of women, but it does not explain the interpretation of her passion and supposed homosexuality for Mary Energy of Farah Fount. The film is obscene with sex, but can be accused of being in favor of sexual revolution; All sex is regarded as, if not dirty, than at least reverse and depressed. There is no help for Gore Bhadal's original novel, because it is confused and unmistakable as a movie. <br /> <br /> And it seems like a rare movie which actually hates the movie. Not just movies as a business, but movies as part of the culture. The film itself is the arcade references to the wall of old movies, which is an unusual insult to the director-screenwriter. She acted in the 20th Century-Fox film Vault and fascinated the film with snippets of old films, or to pay tribute or to give a social commentary, but to cheat the innocent Hollywood's old age. How does an artist - if you want to call Sorden generously - if he is already hating the industry, he is still working? Very self-defeated efforts <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Striites, women and men, old people and young people and hate Lorl and Hardy, and well, you name it, and it probably shows an insult for a scene. Very sad and sadly, allied BrackenDiDes may be the first punk manifesto, celebrating Nihilism of pop culture.
