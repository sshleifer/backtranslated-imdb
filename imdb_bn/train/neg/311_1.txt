I just finished watching the overboard go. I want to say that we have to send copies of this photo to Iraq and keep an eye on them. I tried a blinded woman to see this blind even and she turned it off in 20 minutes. Adam Sandler can not find a better project than this? For writing, if you want to call it, then those who are responsible should always force this film to see in hell! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were under it. Did Wallmart get a better deal on this? These frogs sitting on the store floor of each store have a big huge Bin. The only good thing in this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster, or you can trade it with a friend, but then they can not be your friend!
