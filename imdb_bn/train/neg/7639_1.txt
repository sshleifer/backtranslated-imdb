I saw this movie at the NY Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was quite bad. The first and most misleading way it was the bullet shot; That is, many slow motion and excessive anti-close-ups, which do not seem to be a point-or-a-kind aesthetic - except by showing the cinematographer's skills. (I also believe that the director was). This image seems to have come with a provocative film student. The main actor (Sam Levin) was certainly very intelligent, but the best one was the middle actor; And the rest of the cast so much so, worse than. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I must admit that most of the audience was enjoying the film; Smile and continually sighing, but I do not think it's an extraordinary thing.
