Hello where to start Cinematography was great. At the beginning of the first film, the movie started because of the first scenes, I think I was for a good movie. Then CGI Bigfoot showed it. It looked like a cartoon drawing of Lion King and King Kong's love child. It completely took away from the character credibility. Now I knew that there was no bigfuck people walking in the wood for woods because of no apparent reason but a CESCI CGI cartoon. So the whole movie was shot for me. The money they flushed down the toilet for CGI, they could spend a costume like the roger Patterson. His best Bigfoot costume was none other than him. I was a strong Chess Bigfoot film fan and I was cautious about this movie but my obedience led me to see this movie and I was frustrated by warning me about the previous opinion. I know after reading this review, you will still say "I must look at the Saskatche hunter, the Saskatchet hunters will see." Then you will say, why have I wasted my hard-working money on so harshly bad boring movies!
