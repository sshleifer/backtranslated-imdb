This movie can be so good, especially considering talent. The screenplay of Frankie Limon's Larrenz Tate was not good, especially in musical performances. He does not push the sync lip well and his stage methods are lanazeset tet, when he can be as Frankie Limon. Women's Screenplay, as a cluster of gold excavations, all the writings of Hollywood. The power that will definitely push, but it only makes the characters more unreal. Positive pictures of the film include Miguel Nunez's Little Richard's Screenplay, and Little Richard's Cameo. Lala Rokon is also a conservative role, as usual, eye candy. It is very bad that the talent of Fox in Hell berry and Vivica has been damaged. The whole frankie Limon Saga was interesting in real life. Too bad this picture had an unexpected opportunity.
