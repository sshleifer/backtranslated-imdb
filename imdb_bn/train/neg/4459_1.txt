I'm not saying that production prices were so low, but because it was terribly depicted. Is that shot lying in the girl's sari? Do we really sit there for an extra shot and see him for that same spot for 5 minutes? It was terrible, the light was just plain bad. You only see something and when you're talking characters, you've rarely heard what they're saying. Did i see the whole movie Of course I did not leave most of them, and I do not want to tell anyone that I have to see the whole thing to be judged first. This film was done very badly, and it is simply plain plain through the free and low budget criteria. Awesome movie ... If you do not want to laugh like this, do not waste it at any time, but it is not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, but how painful it makes the production bad.
