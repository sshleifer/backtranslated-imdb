Gaingige Black from Outspace, a small foreign movie about gay aliens, which discovers the galaxy until it stops in the world. Being gay, their goal is only in the male's only universe that all the people are homosexual. So, when they live in the world of women or "female animals" they are initially scared; Finally, they decided to eliminate all the planets on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> Although an objectionable title, including racist, homophobic and sexist tales, probably provides some shock value to the film, for the purpose of scandal. However, there is a little bottom below. Other critics have been mentioned, in addition to character names (such as ArmInAss), there are some jokes; I once thought about laughing at a small gay copper. I think I quickly got the point of the film, the sarcasm of bad science fiction, but later I had enough; Keep I want to end the film already (and it's a small film!). Brilliant, especially good writing.
