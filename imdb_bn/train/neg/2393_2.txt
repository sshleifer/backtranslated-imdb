I got Tom Robbins' teenager as a teenager. I like every word. It is full of sexy, funny, and fascinating scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe that it was an inferior, freaky, joyful piece junk. How is it I think someone in Hollywood has read this book and filed it under "Guy Pride - Women - Lesions". (The headline of the Library of Congress.) Now more than 12 years old people who read this book know that it does not have anything to do with real lesbians, more about real life than Star Wars. The book was obviously obvious - and I mean strange writing - written by an extremely man who loves lesbians idea (nude, all the time), but never filled one. However, no one in Hollywood said, "Oh oh, the gay director or the Ga people will have trouble doing it better." So they hand over to Gass Van Sant. There is nothing against human beings, but Gay can really be - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took the liberty of an innocent man or girl to fantasize, and male cruelty made it a neutral, literally minded legion power recruiting poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wild Comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not nice. <br /> <br /> The original formula that the Gus Van Sant had no idea what should be done with the source violently bad casting. His cloth allows him to rent very well. His ignorance of the original theorem of the novel (a straight man's imagination, not a proud girl poster employer) does not like him, which is just bad, but malicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Name-recognition Asian actors And Pat Murita, Happy Decay, was fairly fun. But throwing him as a chain was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Murita has no idea that the chink is very funny people. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat does not seem to be too screwy. . . Well, SEXY !!! He is a wise old man in the book. Miyagi is not. He is like Hugh Hefner! She is a sandy old goat and she knows a lot about pleasing Nubile and the reactionary Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they are not actually lesbians. Did you find that this is a straightforward man's imagination?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a gay friendly People But he is a deadly, Shakespearean actor !!!! You need to have fun for this role, and the camp, someone. It's tragic and sad to throw a man like a fool like a counsel for John Hart. I hope Paul Schofield get wiped out in all of the clothes wearing Thomas More, and with his sadness, his head will be pressed down. "Now, Richard, you know that you have lost your life. For shame, my former student!" And yes, John was funny (and quite gay) as heart climber. But there was no black humor, there was no ridiculous and ridiculous humor like the book. <br /> <br /> Ryan Fonix "Banana Jellybin". No talent, no training, no problem. Bonajana texts are fun, playful, joyful, (mostly) discriminatory and without love. In movies he is silent, passive, expressionless, and dull. As a taste for women, Robbins kept it in the book. "God knows I love women, but can not take anyone's place that fits." Ah, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> Umm Thurman is known as "CC Hanks". This is a difficult role. The book Sissy is really an unusual, inactive and awesome heroine. Yet, a more successful actress had made a glow in her eyes, or could walk around her walk, so that she could explain her hidden power or the secret of her appearance. Uma can not drag it, perhaps Guss has never said that her cecis is supposed to be a hit hiker with a beautiful body and giant toe. Ummma played more like a TV movie about Likemiya's daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit lazy and soft. And I accuse you, Gass van Sant!
