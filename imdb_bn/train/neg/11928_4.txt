With London's atmospheric outlook, the life of the monks begins to be busy, on a strange street and a quarrel of sunset city. I hope to maintain this atmosphere, but it falls into a story that does not go too far. <br /> <br /> Othello big, fat m Carva, the step-father of his crime-case (at least I think that it is not really defined because it is not really defined, but he keeps kids out of deep fried fried people, so believe me, he is a kid). One of his colleague Runner, a black kid who always leaned towards A to B. Until that day she comes across a silent homeless child, who expresses her desire to stop. The runner dumped the lost boy in the flat at Othello, where he started to wish quickly. The karva kidnapped the boy, eager to fulfill some of his will. But he is not sure what will really bring him happiness. It's innocent of being a child again or another hand-job? In other ways, I do not want to see the little boy second. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The end tries to despair but since there is no back- There is no story but it only works for the release of bored audiences. <br /> <br /> The author Tony Greciani, who loves Terry Gilliam, to mix some kind of religious outline, which just like all hell, maliciously. If he makes us more accessible or good explanations for at least characters, then it can be a more enjoyable movie. Whereas, when we are launching a bunch of boring loudmouths, then miraculously seems to develop intelligence when faced by the mysterious son. Who does not reveal the origins of. That's just plain matter! <br /> <br /> In addition to the atmosphere galaxies and moody scores, there is nothing to suggest this movie.
