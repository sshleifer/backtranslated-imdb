Hazzard's Dukes are quite a feat ?? A $ 53m film is worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25 year old TV show. The plot is quite effective but the fun of the fun is rarely found and Casting is quite irrational: more passengers than Johnny Naxville's play, M.C. Guyie's Sheriff Rosco is a fake thug, Michael Weston's Enos is exhausted, a seemingly ideal-imagined, Willy Nelson is waiting for the check to be cleared and Burt Reynolds is stuck in some wagons, where he was lost for recovering his earlier films as a bit player. , Bose is a playful choice to say the least of Hogg but there's a good moment with the Hackler and the hundred dollar bills. Sean William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charisma screen presences when you know a movie is in trouble? But Jr. Chandrasekhar's frustration is worse than scripting: The idea of ​​a joke was born with a concept, to do more than the original two shots and how to ruthlessly ruthlessly be born to drive like a stupid car, stants in the movie, before he became strong Determined to make any Signal film. Each episode has some beautiful post-modern moments circling around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereototypical role, but a film that makes you pine for the time that points to this day (and badly), it can be good.
