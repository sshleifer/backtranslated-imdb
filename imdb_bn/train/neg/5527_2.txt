Zombies rebellion is bad. There is no entertainment entertaining about the movie. It's shameless, lifeless, poorly played, and badly written. I've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, this film looks like a roller coaster round of Dracula. The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes. <br /> <br />: A campaign has been sent to Cambodia to find the secrecy of mind control through "junkfication". A man finds a secret and uses it for the woman he loves. Once this, he was released from the terrible consequences of zombies under his control. That's it. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> I was trying to understand where I saw men's leadership for most movies. She looked so familiar I had plenty of time to think over this. Nothing is happening in the movie. Just before "Zombies Revolt", it hit me. It was Dean Jagar. I recently saw him as General in White Christmas. I often "entertain" myself during this movie. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I did not buy the DVD for this movie. The King of London on the other hand, and it is a great composition to make movies in comparison to films. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I'm not going to 1/10, believe me or not, I'm looking worse.)
