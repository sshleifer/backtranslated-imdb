I grew up (B.1565), watching and loving the Thunderbirds. The school saw all my companions. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, after lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. Count down from 5 became an art form. I took my child to see this movie, hopefully they would show a glimpse of what they saw as a child. How desperately frustrating Only high point snappy theme was tune-up. It can not compare with Thunderbird's main score. Fortunately on Saturday morning a television channel is still a series drama created by Gary Anderson and her wife in the series. Jonatha Frank should have stayed at his director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. The film is a waste Garbage holes. A CGI remake can be acceptable, but mortality can be replaced with homo sapiens suppress. Sapiens judgment was a huge error.
