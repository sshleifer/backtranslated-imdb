LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman Dylan McDermat Kevin Spacey John Harold Cary Elwes Roslyn Sanchez Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he is a star? I would be better known than the EDISON Force Rent. Actually, I know well. But at one moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have a big name like Freeman and Spacey on an STV, you know it's two things: an indie or dog. As-on-a-shelf Which did this. And for good reason Such a plot involves a group of corrupt killers involved in a La Magnon Force Police, and their revelation in "Journalist" Timberlake is quite a courageous one enough. He targeted for his efforts - or perhaps I would say for his awesome acting. After firing the bad guys firing through the forearm, I stopped it and even started screaming and laughing towards his shooter. Just awful Seeing Freeman and seeing a helpless beard across the real movie, the original Tipfuzz, which does not seem to be as much as HBO, is all about seeing how bad this spark is. You just did not know the manager was in control. Freeman is definitely slumming.
