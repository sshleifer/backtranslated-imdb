Big as big and annoying as a Texas prairie. Even Leigh Taylor, James Dean, Chil Wills, and Dennis Hooper will not be able to float this tremendous boat. Taylor actually looks bad - wrong dress, wrong hair, and wrong makeup - a unique achievement in his extraordinary career. Hooper gives the only credible performance and Dean displays extraordinary talent in the climatic scene, which we usually do not remember - a comic actor Rock Hudson Barbie dolls have their usual prototype and it makes an amazing, what can Redford do with male leadership. There is no visible plot that can be dragged for the final twenty minutes, except that there is a paste of milestones that is slightly related to each other. Apart from Hooper, there is no development of the character, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that regularly pops up for a visible cause, such as random targets in a shooting gallery. For its achievement, the film deals with racism and sexism during the banned content, and it holds SIZE, making it an excellent choice to free unexpected home guests. With the DVD version, those who start with the second disc can release some of the tidium. You will not be missing something of interest.
