I am sitting in this movie and this is my only chance to keep my attention. If you are going to use CGI but it does not have to show a horrific CGI for future reference, if the film is more painful, then avoid what you know. It is apparently a graphic novel for the screen, but what I saw is a bad movie that is not compatible with a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All, the story was not as bad as CGI. I was quite impressed with acting and thought casting was good and some of the character's information was beautiful, because it became somewhat confusing for me, but it's not surprising that I said It only keeps my attention, but all honestly I hope I missed this one.
