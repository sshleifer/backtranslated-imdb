1st good news 3-D is done nicely, and they do not go for a zombie archive. The film is based on the true story of the high point of human history and even among the actual participants of the story: Buzz Alladin <br /> <br /> And now the meat on the matter: It's almost for Flaise Criske's! Large, stupid flies with people's eyes, the truth, but still fly. Remember when I made "underworld" versus chocolate? That was not intended as a compliment, and I had not dreamed of anyone to take it literally. This one is even less sympathetic going for it. Baby Maggots? Disgust Among the strange songs from Hollywood GroupThing, this flick was clearly on the drawing boards at the same time as the Chimps. Also <br /> <br /> Rent a "Apollo 13" and see an 9-rating movie about Real Space Program (RIP).
