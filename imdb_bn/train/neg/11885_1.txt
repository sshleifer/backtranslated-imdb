I would like to compare her with a special legend filmmaker known for her personality in New York, because it is quite obvious that compared to the disappointing Josh Cornblut, it's just a humiliating kind of director. I would avoid mentioning the 'office space' rave on the same breathing spot as this celluloid catastrophe. However, can I compare with the wake of your own surgery? It is painful to see and you are surprised that surgeons know what they are actually doing. Hiku Tunnel The type of movie you want to pull the plug into the initial stage of the production process. It was cruel to survive and this has caused visitors to suffer worldwide. <br /> <br /> the basis of the film ?? Is it really a ?? Even discussion is not worth, but I want to be careful. Josh Cornley, a temp worker with serious commitment-scare, is given a permanent job. His main responsibility was to mail 17 high priority letters to his boss. But ridiculously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My response? Big deal! That's not a story ?? This is a good passing thinking - that should be passed by any self-respecting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Main actor ?? Can you call him ?? A series is a series of facial shades that range from a strange buffoon, chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and plain formation from facial expression. Where is this director schmuck where? What are you talking ??? He is the director? Oh, my mistake. A screenplay is one thing to play in your own embarrassment, but I suspect that Mr. Cornwald is not as believable as a man, alone actor. Make sure to rest, it is not a killing character, but I was not so objectionable by the presence of the actor's screen! My frustration was visible in the scene and more confounded by her camera monologues. I mean, if viewers need an ounce of intelligence to understand this intelligence, then Kennblom insults us by our 'Action Explanation' (The first rules of film making: 'Show plays'? Show, do not say). Does this guy think he is? He has no care, no charm, and can not be judged by his Hawaiian shirt, there is no sense of style. His casting agent should have shot point blank! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Patricia Scanlon is a very funny look as former Helen Helen is mad Has been driven, and harassed phone calls from his basement, while holding a flashlight under his face. It made me chocolate to me, but the moment went very soon and I came back to check my clock for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also a mistake. Heku tunnel has no relation with ancient forms of Japanese poetry. It would not be fooled to think of an art house film because it's the title of its provocative word or it has only acted in some movies and there is no meaning in the box office ?????? There is a very good reason for this! <br /> <br />
