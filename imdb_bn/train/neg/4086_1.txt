I came at this film with high expectations. I was aware of Greenway's work and 'Tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. I wanted to close the switch after the first ten minutes, but felt that it would be inappropriate. A storm was a representation, but imagine your mind where you peeing on a toy boat in a small boat? Is it symbolic? I kept ten minutes longer with my finger 'close' button, my interest would be briefly captured. This is not Shakespeare, it's not movie. There is a time and space for this, but I will not waste my time and my study of Shakespeare has no place for it. After twenty five minutes I gave up and ended. I have read all the comments on this website and the film's uglyness is only matched by its opponents. 'It's a painting ... then put it in a gallery', 'It's a ballet ... then put it on the stage'. Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays are performed to the wider audience, they were accessible and this version helps Shakespeare and a large part of the general population - and I do not think that Bird will be happy.
