I read some comments on this opinion on the Internet "... the hostel is hard ...", "The camera never gets the scroll when it's really cruel ...". But none of them is true. The camera does not screen, because the screen has nothing to do. The same scene is repeated again hundreds of times. Women rape a murderer, hanging on a table several times, slaughtered the murderers (you do not see it during the whole movie!). The police came and arrested him. The killer jury is fool. Film over In Germany we will say: "Vell Laram Nimts" Above all, I'm one of the most annoying movies I ever see. Absolutely non-recommendable.
