On the page, "Means Means" should be finished at least one full season. As your host, you were always entertained by William Saturn, it was surrounded by dozens of beautiful beautiful leggy models of unemployed who were collectively known as "The Million Dollar Dancer". You were wise competitors who talk about interesting stories and possibly the intensity of pop culture to talk about their lives. And you had big money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> This game was a formatted failure. A good game show requires at least three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing, and the ability of the audience to play at home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I try to explain how to play the game as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A competitor starts with a single word or short phrase at the desired letter A, B, C (delicate plug for the network?). Each letter was attached to a separate question, starting with all words or phrases. Once a contestant selects the letter, they can answer or pass both questions and may choose a second letter. If they passed, they could see the next question, and had the same option. However, if they pass the second question, they are forced to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> They had to choose 13 dancers before answering them and finding out if their answers were correct. At the level, a scroll on each side will give a different amount of money. They released their dollar amount (between $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and the contestant answered the correct answer ... or gave a wrong answer ... this amount would be added or subtracted from their pot. <br /> <br /> with me so far? In addition, a dancer who held something known as "the killer card." If you select a dancer with the killer card and get your question correctly, then you were safe and the game was continuing. However, you were wrong, you had a final question to answer. If you got that final question wrong, you were out of the game. If you're getting this right, the game was continuing. <br /> <br /> Without a discount, you do not answer six questions correctly or six questions do not go wrong or you have not made money so far. The hole can not earn enough money to get you back. Got it? OK! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I have seen, was the lack of tension due to the design. Competitors can pass questions that they did not know, answer many questions they did not know, and reduce the pressure. Nevertheless, they may still find even less dollars after lowering a question, which means there was still no "drama". And there was a big mistake that they could answer five questions and still have the opportunity to win. And the pacing of questions was very slow: Often the questions were obvious, so trying to create excitement was ridiculous, as there is no doubt about most common answers <br /> <br /> Despite the genuineness of the shotgun's Tempsichorean, any real tension at any time during the ceremony The lack and complex rules prevent this program from working.
