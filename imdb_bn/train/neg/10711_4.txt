About Minion ... Well, there is a minion. A servant of Satan and whose goal will be to unlock the door to trap his master. He is a ghost monster who is a human being and will inherit the other after death. Anything that will happen will go berserker rage. Dolphé plays Lucas, a member of Lundgren Templar's secret order, who wants to keep away from the small bay. The film began thousands of years ago, in the Middle East where the Knights fled from a small part of the Templars. Then in the flash in 1999, where New York somewhere winds up the underground air. An archaeological key is employed to research / dig the key found. Do not wait, what the minute is after, and the film becomes a long wind chase scene between small and hidden and archaeologists. <br /> <br /> This movie is a low-budget B-movie flick. The lack of power in the movie, and just trods along. You will not follow the pursuit, but you will never be involved in a story that takes ideas from previous films (especially the terminator film). Fighting scenes with minion are annoying, that you never understand how good or how bad this warrior is a warrior. It became a one-man army in the "skillfully" combat a group of templars, but came one after another. And it is supposed to be around for a long time. All of this can be seen that the idea of ​​the argument is to throw the drain only for convenience. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of the Templars, the door to hell, and the key can not be well explained. We only have to accept that they exist. It seems that the story of this movie is not very likely, but enough to earn a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren seems to be sure that he wanted somewhere else. <br /> <br /> judgment: 25 stars.
