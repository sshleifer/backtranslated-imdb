I, like many other young fans, were waiting for a sila rickie to wait. This movie was not there. Thanks to God, they did not allow the name of the film "Shole" in the title of the film. Ram Gopal's rebuilding title is not worthy of the title. Camera work, space, costume, totally dance outside the place, the dialogue all combined to do the worst movies I have ever seen. You think, why the actors agreed to make this film why they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for cast. The only non-paying actress, Danta, was the only similarity to the first movie. Abhishek's role was ridiculous, did he have to pay for the wedding hope? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or DVD when it comes to that.
