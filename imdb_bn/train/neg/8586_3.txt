No frustration ... the best prixels have been acknowledged, but the story is weak, the plot has been grabbed and the end result is only to collect pieces of set, weakly to grasp and integrate into amateur. There was a lot of continuity flaws in the clash with original movies, and the rise of Darth Bhadan was so awesome that a legendary moment of modern cinema is now how a chess gossip is mocked for many years. I will not complain about the unstable dialogue, because it is Star Wars ... the original three film genres, religious feelings and cracking stories, and strange conversation added poker. Prequels were shallow efforts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Unexpectedly frustrating.
