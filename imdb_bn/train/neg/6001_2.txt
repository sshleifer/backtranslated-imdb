People remembering this show may also be crazy ... but I thought it was a live-action. I do not think I've ever seen a cartoon. But the movie? may be. I have to remember very clearly. The man bought a building like a Shoemroom. She was even red jacket. It was dark and he turned a red car and the second-level this guy looked at him. Turn around the car / guy and crash through the big showroom type windows and outside the street. And then driven off. Remember that's all. I really hope someone else looks out for this other. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
