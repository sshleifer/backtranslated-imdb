SENTINEL would be quite difficult to try to imagine something as insidid as. Many of the problems The results are terrible and loaded with plots holes. <br /> <br /> "The one taking" for Reagan during his life's efforts, as a secret service agent Peat Garrison is as big. A few years later, we were appointed Peter as the guardian of the White House family, especially the first lady (Kim Basinger, L. A. Gopic). Sudden threats arise with the first lady of the stomach, and the sudden threat to the President (David Rash, Unite 93). When PT failed to test a polygraph, he singled as an disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the president murdered plot of murder, Pitt runs himself from himself to the people. His only believer is First Lady, and he is reluctant to tell anyone about their love for each other (for this reason PT has failed in the first place Polygraph). But is the stomach really innocent? Or is he just taking time to kill the President? He is innocent, how can he prevent the attempt to murder while running from secret service? <br /> <br /> There is no logic behind the President's threat to this big, big problem of the film. What does the movie say? One would think so! But it is never given to the audience how to kill the deadly. Hmm Does anyone forget to put that script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what is with David Bregenije's (Keeferer) new partner Jill Marin (Eve Logoria, Carlito Way)? It seems that he was kept strictly as $$ - candy pieces in the film. What was his purpose again? Did he do anything other than a nice look in tight pants and low-cut blouses? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The action is very easy "what ...?" The response that is stymied by will certainly be spoken by the unfortunate enough to watch the film.
