This is a girl named Susan Montford who wrote and directed this "film". No wonder there is no credit for writing or for managing. He made this election a serious vocational error in his career. This is one of the worst human creatures of this millennium. <br /> <br /> In addition to one of the weak stories with this film, the ridiculous story of the women fleeing from four weaker ghogs, the obscure and complete lack of LOGIC <br /> ** ** After leaving the mall, she Rotate four lips with four lips. Tell me, if a woman is aggressively surrounded by a possible attacker, she will shoot him and insult him verbally? After the attack, I did not want to say that it was completely normal for the fight. But he removed the man and most of them went towards the next level. If a woman does not have surgery 1) she can do it, 2) the backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from damage, or 3) the attackers are so small and weak that she is sure she can take them. Anyone applying this situation, so he was just acting raped or asked someone who is mugged. And the way, when the security guard reached, he came in a distance of Kim Basinger, yet why not promptly help him or shout for him? <br /> <br /> ** When he opened fire in the security forces, he went to a lonely part of the city and crashed. Instead of having a triangle in the back of the house and traveling and traveling, only its red toolbox comes out and walks under its hood. I realized he was trying to fix his car, but he could run. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to say the chronological summary of this movie, because I hate people who do this by their review, but it is just that every major sequence in this movie is so stupid that I have to comment on it). <br /> <br /> ** Why should he carry the red toolbox aloud? Try to sneak away in the dark? When he was caught, one of the joker wanted to open his toolbox. At first he opposed, then finally it opened. And takes a wrench. This scene here is so rich on the fine surface of the complete failures of the dramatic effect, I want to break it, it is one of the most cruel scenes in the whole film. When asked to open the box, he opposes for the first time that if he is not open, then he plans to open himself from a lip, in the same way that in any film, there is a device that can touch the enemy / touch / open / manipulate And once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy holds that device, only that device is automatically a Asayanika supply / face shot him. Her unconscious, which was all along the Hero's plan. What it tried to do with Kim Basing, is that they dramatically pull out a brochure as soon as the toolbox opens, and collects the thugs, and anyway withdraws from him and three thugs. <br /> <br /> ** In addition to the rest of the movie, what you basically see is the wife of this sub-caste, she carries her red toolbox, wanders around the woods, and takes various tools used as a weapon for surgery. <br /> <br /> ** When he was running away, how did he go behind the lips? I think it was the scene where they pay tribute to the dead dead on the radio. Finally, the whole courtyard is so weak, because for the first reason she is being smuggled because she ran behind him from the goggles. 'On the point of view, he was a witness to a murder against them before the security officer, and so they felt they had killed him. What ridiculous Even a cold even said that they could just leave the city and come back to the city they came from, but no one saw him, he probably did not get a license plate. Even if this possibility is not working for them, then how are they being raised in hell and they are being killed to kill someone?
