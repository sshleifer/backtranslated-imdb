An inconsistent, inconsistent Hast movie for me. Experienced director with A-list Cast, especially three Lead and Spike Lee, I was much more expected and eventually felt what was added to this movie sub-run. Initially, I started filming the movie Clive Owen's piece by breaking the camera into pieces, unnecessarily repeating it in conclusion, then finding a misleading story, saying no obscure interviews, then you started the scenes of finding yourself. . Of course, the camera work is fluent in the life and the continuous hand-camera creates a lot of shots, but the director fails to give the throat or suspense, which basically falls down without doing anything of the film's main characters. Daniel Washington has been radioactive with "Shraft" movie clips and bad ass tongue conversation twenty-five years ago (even he has "somebody who does not understand him but his female" is going on, his "hot" girlfriend, some cruel incompetent and inappropriate "dirty Conversation ") and with his lightweight" Hit of the Night "relay, Willam Defoff (in some parts) rarely raises a wave. Clive Ovens plays his character firmly with English accent, as we believe the gang is Arab-based, with 90% of a mask on his face preventing the movie from playing. Jodie Foster is the victim of a tight-lipped, ice girl, another good sub-clause of Sub-Claris Sterling, if you have a little effect. Overall, it is a real mix of a movie-mash, with a light but obvious curve, actually the title starts from the beginning, ridiculating fans. The worst scenario (among many) undoubtedly is the interview of Washington's interview, incredibly, with the kid's 8-year-old street, even though the same child's suspension in Waiver's dialogue with the minute of the same child is stopped. Curiosity references to the film are made by characters in classics such as "Sarpicos" and "Dog Day After" - but there is no respect in self-praise. Instead it was like "The Hot Rock" ... and even for a few smiles.
