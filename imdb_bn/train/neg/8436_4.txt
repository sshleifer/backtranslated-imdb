David Mommy is a very interesting and a very equally equivalent director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the best I liked and it created a series of films with the help of a character that changes the complex aspects of life rather than fall into complex situations, and the viewer's view also does so. <br /> <br> So, 'killing' which aims to place the viewers' mind in normal criminal drama from the headline. The main character is two policemen, one Jew and one Irish who face the ethically charged area. An old Jewish shop owner who proves Jewish identity in the minds and hearts of Jewish intelligence detectives, proved to be an old man of Israel's war of independence. <br /> <br /> The flaws in this image were even more obvious. The awakening process is a theatrical and difficult to believe, the group of Jewish militants operating, and ultimately the intelligence finally moves towards the final violent conflict. The end of the film is smart like a mamate, but disappointed by the mental perspective of the people. <br /> <br /> Joe Menteg√° and William Messi gave strong performance, but it is very clear to easily compensate for errors in the story.
