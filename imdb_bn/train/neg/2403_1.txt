Part !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was frustrated to find out I was like two small scenes in the end. Otherwise I was basically hit the forward button at the full time. Some teenagers travel to Romania with their father and bite by a wolf and if a full moon becomes a useless. He killed his parents and friends. Nearly 30 years back but he is not a little older and is enrolled in a high school. There he met a shy teacher, with whom he bitten and with his children. This movie sucked and I did not recommend it to anyone. Instead of reading war and peace. Just Miss Hartman did a great job. See this one very young Bob Saget!
