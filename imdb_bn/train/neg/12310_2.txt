Steve Martin should try to remix classic comedy. He is not absolutely fit in this part. Like the tragic restoration of Out of Town, the film is flat on its face. Steve Martin and even Jack Lemn's wonderful performance can never come near anyone, and this is the same for the film. Dan Akrodd could play Bilko Party better. Martin is trying to recreate the classic work of other people, but is unexpectedly great while doing his own protagonists. After the movie is over, the first line of credit is the most interesting part of a movie when it is a sad statement. "The dealer acknowledged the total lack of cooperation in the United States Army with gratitude" the only line that makes me laugh. If you want to see the actual Bilko, hold the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. Those who force you to laugh, in contrast to this mistake that have never happened. I keep this movie as the classic class of Limon and the re-establishment of Psycho. None of them should ever have happened.
