I watched this movie last week and for the long time I was the happiest. The plot of film is quite stupid and convoluted in a badly designed way. The only plus found anywhere in the film is Corey Savier's impressive abs. Alexander Paul (I think his name) has a history of depression as a preacher's wife. Ted McKenzie's total and a tweet above all of his character. And if you think that she thinks she is having sex with her son, that is not enough, so they throw in every opportunity in the inefficient Sax! The final and final measure of this movie is absolutely unreal and ridiculous. I mean, who wants to carry a son to Konk who wants you to believe that he was your child and you had a cruel relationship with him!
