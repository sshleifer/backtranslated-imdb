I have no idea how this shows managed to stay awake during the show. The acting was ham-fished and amateur, the story was old news, and the development of the plot (or its lack) was less than half of my curves through each episode. It has everything to say about it, because it actually lacked any kind of substance. <br /> <br /> How do you like the pain like this? It's a fool to fool, it's an insult to your intellect. I do not know how to explain it more ... Looks like you're stupidly looking at the junk because you like to see the look of actors, or because of any crazy, you've seen the same form in dozens of shows a million times ago. <br /> <br /> I just forgot it. This show sucked, and grateful it has gone forever. I want them to work to destroy the OC. Once and for all.
