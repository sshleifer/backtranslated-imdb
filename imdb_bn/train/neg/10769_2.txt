When I look at houses and bored I found this. How can people probably give this a 10? It just does not seem that it's a feel-good movie (I think) because it does not work at that level. Poor plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; There is nothing just there. Harvey Kettle is honest, but there is nothing to work with, and Brigitte Fonda, and especially Zathlon Shake, is just terrible. The progress of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems as if the author wanted this plot to go on a certain path and write about the bits needed to create it. It's only a half hour, but 90 minutes of your life will never come back.
