I saw this first 10-year-old film. My mother bought it at our local chemert because it was sold for 5 dollars in VHS. He remembered it would be a wonderful Christmas movie for me and my brothers. But this movie is frightened by me. You can ask yourself, how can a movie about Santa Claus be afraid of someone? The film's plot revolves around Satan, in an effort to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. All right, Satan sent a demon to hell to kill Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, Santa tries to trap the sun during the Christmas Eve, because Santa does not return to his house but he becomes a powder. Do not make me wrong, the movie is fun and fairly entertaining, but in the depth of hell (which takes place at the beginning of the film), the image of dancing power and devils is simply absolute obscure.
