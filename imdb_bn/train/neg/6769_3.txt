A failure The movie was not just good. It's humor that 5 years old that would not even be giggle. I'm sure, some parts were fun, but most did not. Lindsay Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer), and she should work well on the movie. The movie should be promoted as the Disney Channel's main movie, it's free. <br /> <br /> It was the only music that worked well for this movie. Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. This song is very good In particular, Alison and Amber Watching On Sunshine and Kalegh Peter, Beach Boy Song, Fan Fan Foon <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 If I give it ten, it will have 9 songs and 1 will be the movie. Your money is not worth, but the soundtrack is.
