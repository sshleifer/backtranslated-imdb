I had a "privilege" for a special screening of 'The Attendance of Light' in a terrible convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know that when the director introduces a movie you are in trouble, saying: "Now remember, we did not have much money ..." No budget movies are bad, but when a movie If the manufacturer uses it as an excuse, then the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-festival. <br /> <br /> In fact, the 'light of absence' marks the first movie of the underground movie: It's the only dream-color gifted genre, which actually gave birth to me. Characteristic actors like David Hesse, Tony Todd, and Regi Banner, randomly enter the film and exit and prove to be unbelievable as the name of the amateur. Who is their character? What are they talking about? Who care? It's so dull, you do not care about some or somebody. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this patience test I left the theater. Not surprisingly, so most of the cast members present were present. <br /> <br /> Any strange series will be far away from this. With a little luck, this movie will never see the "light" day.
