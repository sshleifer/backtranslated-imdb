The story of the Prince of Darkness is not entirely fun, but recounts an interesting fascinating (this sensitively hiped) Dracula story (though with traditional customs). For the first time I tried to see it, I gave it half before losing interest. Again, this is a good start (especially with the thieves and then face them with Dracula), but it is less involved if I hit New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. This is a great place to set up, but its settings have not been used (even though Dracula can illustrate a heaven that can explode). Created by Wes Krawen (and yes they cast the name there), but Patrick Lucier wrote / operated. Artisticly it had some visual visions, but some dynamic editing and cheap holdings did not help. The dirty script does not fool enough. Lucier has done a smooth job that is rather glassy, ​​pours a lot of blood (make-up is achieved appropriately) and many "virgin" ads No, I do not mean virgin, this music company, it got many shots and Helsing's daughter also worked there. Oh that was not a clear planting. Soundtrack Rock Music is a fun choice. Now there are all shops in performance, but there are some familiar faces to spot (Danny Mastersson, Shan Patrick Thomas, Nathan Filian, Shane West, and Lochlin Muneo). Gerard Butler was not as good as Darqua, a presence is not formed. She was simply shined by the delicious lady of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colin Fitzpatrick and Jerry Ryan as Dracula's wife. Jonny Lee Miller and Justin Waddell's choices are fine. Christopher Plummer gave a glizback counter by having fun with Van Helsing and Omar Azzus's role.
