The premiere was provocative, but sadly the film did not judge it. Casting was pretty good and it was shot nicely - but most of the stylistic aspects were incompatible (without any impact it was quickly executed. I was waiting for Steven Boucho to follow the credits.) Character is used only on-screen coke (and character Development is marked by the rest of the rest in Boogie Nightmares), and the viewer's viewers There is no personality character for sana. A very forgotten film.
