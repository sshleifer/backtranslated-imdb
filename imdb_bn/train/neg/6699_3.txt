"Algie, The Miner" is a bad and unreasonable silent comedy. Slapstick timing is completely closed. This is a sort of fun-filled sequence that makes you wonder if they can be fun. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. It is mandatory to see film buffs mainly because it is one of the oldest examples of gay movies. Alia's main character is a cheerful guy, acting like a common stanatypic "Pansy" in many early films. This film has homophobic attitude. "Algi, The Miner" is quite awful, but interesting from the historical perspective. (3/10)
