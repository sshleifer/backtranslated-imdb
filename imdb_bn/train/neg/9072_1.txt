This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it was supposed to be a snap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screen writers had no idea what the movie was like. Do not even go along with the title movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Win Win" or something like that. Characters are not developed and nobody cares about what's happening to them! The character of the girl roommate (from the show of 70) was the only person to see. He stole and stole all the scenes he stole. Others must ensure that their college diplomas are working because they will need any other carrier except acting.
