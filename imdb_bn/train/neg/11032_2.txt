"I Love New York" Another entry for VH-1 (MTV Networks), which shows a sharp, unpleasant, recreational way of dating for women. It's the most wild, Ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and take her mom to be a simple decision course - and they will give a show in this network. Many argue, "this is a show". True, this is not bad as the "love of bad" as the previous show, but it's just bad. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of Skitt from 90 shows "In Living Colors", where Kina Ivory Weiss was imitating boxer Mike Tyson at the "Love Connection" dating show, and he chose "Robin Given" for a date. . Mike talked about how this date was correct, but how to insult this insulting mother. This event reminds me. <br /> <br /> Men have been nominated and the women they are dating are named for frustration. More - (I think an intelligent person will not be able to find an intelligent woman - and her mother will not allow you to give a name that is too hot, you will feel embarrassed when you are present on TV.) But these are professional reality actors , So why bother. <br /> <br /> This avoids me for so much entertainment about all this. Is that fake as this as its new replacement? 15 minutes fame and thousands of dollars during advertising for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make a piece.) Perhaps the surprise - want to stay in an hour with this woman? Whether his mother's next ceremony will be in the WWF! Anyway, you do this task, it is a debris of a train that you have seen many times before, so now the shock value is down. <br /> <br /> No curve or turn will destroy it more interesting trains, or different from any other. To call the "last" appearing for appeals and reality of the lowest general majority, it is thought to be ending immediately, because only one nail on this coffin.
