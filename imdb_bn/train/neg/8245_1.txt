I can not believe nobody likes this movie. I've seen much less budget indie movies, but this one sucked absolutely. Under the budget, the movie should not be demanded. Harr does not mean that the movie should be demanded. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was only a gore-fest, and that's a particularly annoying one. Acting was average, they considered all of the actors were negligent, but the story was unfortunate, the dialogue was unfortunate. Movies try to stop as "artistic", or something. It's not one of the coolest indie films that can cost thousands of dollars, but it's incredibly complete. It was nothing but an excuse for some very sick people for their annoying emotion towards the film. Here are the other reviews that soundtrack sucked ... because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by the movie's writers. There is no freedom fighter in this movie. A complete waste of my time and money.
