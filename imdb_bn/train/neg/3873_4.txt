Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Cluices") is trying to solve a modern criminal-teenage teenage girl's brutal assassination. Pat Verdusi wrote and operated this B-Flick, which is not particularly orderly, but surprisingly regarded in its leading role. Despite undermining Silverstone stone kitschy, here is an attractive young woman carving out attractive and successful. Supporting Cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Boven) is not bad, though the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp-festival, but exceptional exceptional nothing. * **** to 1/2
