I did not know anything about this picture, it seemed as if it was "ending from the beginning of an endless epic war" by a friend. That can not be more from the truth. It was unfortunate that it was the most annoying, badly written, amateurly operated, horror movies I ever kept in my eyes. I'll rank it with the movie, I think I'm the worst movie of all time ... The Battlefield Earth. Basically there is no story, it is difficult to believe that these filmmakers think that this Chess opera shoe will be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It's some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy says the girl "You smell like the moon." The girl is answering "What the moon smells?" God! You mask me with me! The scene where the person was drawn and the quartered receives some good smile from the audience, because it looked so ridiculous and the person's word FX is different, he reminded me that someone made a fart word from the mouth. If it is playing in a theater near you, avoid all costs. This movie is so bad that I decided about 45 minutes which I needed to go to sleep ... and I did it. Awful, terrifying.
