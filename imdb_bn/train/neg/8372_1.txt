I can say painful and vaguely that this planet is the worst (possible children's) film I've ever seen in my life in 51 years. <br /> <br /> I see it in my three eldest children and even they were struggling to raise a smile at all the harmful times of 90 minutes. Sensitization I will go for another day but they were stupid like the film. They do not have to pay you to pay it to you. It's really terrible, there's no other way to describe it. <br/> <br /> Apply for my spelling mistakes but I am so annoyed that my time for my grandfather has been lost, Stephen
