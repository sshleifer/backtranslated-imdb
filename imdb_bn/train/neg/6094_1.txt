I have strongly believed in writing this review for a number of reasons: <br /> 1) No doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen, 2) Until it gets more reviews, get listed on the greatest movie list of all times - it's Qualification 3) I was very lucky - I paid him five pounds for that. I've seen it for 15 pounds in stores. Do not pay much money for this film! You will be very angry. 4) There are many movies in horror series that are not rated at fair ratings (in my opinion), and this film is guilty of giving more ratings than them <br /> <br /> The plot is: A man who is not a friend Fill a trump that promises the world - good, magic power is the ability to be present to others like anyone else. Our hero turned a teenage girl cute and joined their gang - sitting on the swing, sitting in the baby. As long as he is detained and the police finds him, they kill each other. <br /> <br /> Why is so bad? Acting is very bad from the start. Someone else compares it to a school production. No, it's worse than the one that I saw at a school level. <br /> <br /> I bought some of these banned movies from the DVD company's Vipo and I was not disappointed because I was. All right, the acting is bad but the film fails to distribute in all other sense. What was the time to create this image when no gore! Okay, no gore. What else can a film like this offer? Breats? No, not even a title! It is true that this film may have a specific charm in its unique naphone but any potential buyer / surveillance of this film should be properly advised that this movie is the best, only one out of ten valuable outcomes.
