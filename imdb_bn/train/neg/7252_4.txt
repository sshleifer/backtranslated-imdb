DECY is one of the independent productions created by the obvious new comers, but it is not all the usual errors in most of the films sink. It is a specific story, it has adequate acting, photography is very good, both the hero and the bad guy are both superb people, and background music is not overdone. This is a new release of the DVD, so people will see it here to see if it is appropriate. I do not know where 10 people came, because this movie does not come in any way - even if you are the mother of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a theater was Warner's KK Rolling's many favorite and wonderful books, Order of the Phoenix. Comparing Dexy with Phoenix, see Phoenix (made by Warrens), there was no story, certainly no permission was given to the director, photography was horrific, and the musical instrument score was simply a mess. I gave Phoenix "1" because the scale is not below. DECY 4 times good - all about <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, then give DECY a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - The Shootout" or such dirty. It's original. If your expectations here are not beyond the stupid "10" scores, you can only enjoy the movie on your own terms.
