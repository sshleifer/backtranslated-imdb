This is a sad movie made for sad people. I was sitting in the theater to separate my hair, to open the chair in front of me, because the film spread to a cring-educion scene after another. And people were roaring with laughter behind me, which is what surprised me to see such a movie to enjoy such a horse **. "<br /> <br /> Nicakil Advani has six stories, no plot and no interesting character, he is drunk while writing this picture, probably because he is drunk while writing this picture, this story has no strong hold. Some of the dialogues that have been heard hundreds of times ago have been heard. One of the stories is that these couples can not achieve sex because of the disasters they want to do. It is not funny, but creative, it is proved that there is not a comedy. One of the stories (which was probably the only story of my interest) was based on the unfaithfulness of a man, and it is also a fairy-tailed boyfriend, I do not know what the Salman-Priyanka plot was, and it's a plot to have a plot Was Zohar's picture because he wanted to marry Salman and why he is not able to marry her and still take the picture? Whether Advani and Priyanka want to prove to the world that the real truth is that if the female actors do not get married or get married After that they can not act in the movie? Perhaps, with the six actors in the film, Advani could not create the film himself. So he used full-time sponsors like Times Group, and shamelessly promoted their Filmfare journals. And as well as some jewelery brands that the women of the film absolutely worship to say !! I have come to give IMDB the worst ratings and I'm surprised to appreciate this image. It just shows the sadness of Bollywood and how they hit the fans. With such fans, films like Salam e Ishqah will continue to be produced and probably a hit.
