Jim Carey is one of the most fun and most gifted comedians in today's film. With her hyperactive spontaneity and her rubber face she can just go crazy, and we love him for her. He has the ability to create his mid-comedy (Ala S Ventura), and he makes them beautiful funny passions. Or, in the case of 'Leoir Lea', create the most entertaining contemporary comedy around them. Carey has proven to be able to deal with the drama. He was both excellent at 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show'. The man is amazing <br /> <br /> Then comes the 'Bruce Almighty', Carri's ideal car, and a compound that should have been done; After complaining about God and Career's life decreased, Carey was able to withstand the power of God. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, not how bad a script is, career reform only sometimes makes funny scenes interesting. The problem is that there is very little chance for the curious because comedy is so stupid due to special effects, only some of it is interesting. Care is rarely able to improve because he has to work around special effects. The authors obviously thought that these special effects and super-ordering sequences were fun, because the rest of the movie is nothing more than just filling in careers, which is absolutely ridiculous. He thinks more like a 5-year desire for our attention, because the audience is trying to find out what's working funny, when it's really annoying. <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed Jennifer Anston in 'Friends' and she was fantastic at last year's 'The Good Girl'. He has a gift for a very comedy, but with linear lines as it is scripts, he is simply given part of bitter girlfriend. She is anxious, scary, and comes as there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> 'Bruce Almighty' was a comedy that should work. But it does not have the courage to deal with funny content; Religion Some small giggles (its internet is Yehhe), but instead it has become a comedic comedy only. It is not mentioned that it switches from spontaneous to heavy hands and even from black comedy. The movie fails at almost every level. It does not completely see laughs regardless, but it's close. It seems that the need to include dog scenes for any comedy in its film. But hey, if you pee jokes funny, go for it. <br /> <br />
