This was probably the worst movie I probably saw. This plot did not make full money and the acting was horrific. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think he's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why he decided to do this. His character, Piper, drunk without the exception of an open scene for almost the entire picture. Plus, the acting was so bad where there were several points in the picture, I actually laughed loudly. But despite that, I will not recommend this picture to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but 80 minutes of your life that you will completely lose.
