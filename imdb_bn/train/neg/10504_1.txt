I could not see more than 14 minutes. It's really a bad combination of bad acting and really bad directions. Disgusting shots used, they break at 180 degrees angle all the time. My head tries to see that load "you know". Dump in the "mystery machine" window you see light from the light on Windows ... annoying. What else ... it is so badly that you wanted to scream the woman there. I only managed small movies, but I'm sure I want a better way than managing a feature film. The story is incredible, only the long French kiss scene tells you that it would be very awesome. So much more, try to avoid any of these bad movies, save it for rent of 5 taka or more, and you will never come back for 1 hour and 30 hours of your life ...
