Warner Bros. In the 1930s many made potboilers and most of them flew fast, profitable and very entertaining. I really love how the studio absorbed the less interesting elements of our daily life. This is one of Warner's few hard-hired malaudums that just does not work. Edward G. Robinson played the ruthless editor of the newspaper, who revived the 20-year-old story of a superstition with sad results. Robinson gives a vivid performance but he does not cut that mustard surrounded by actors. H.B. Warner, Alain McMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but in the second round, the bad acting of Francis Star and Anthony Bushel is really tough. Starr is particularly bad in his big dramatic scene at the end of the film. In addition, the morality of the film seems to be ridiculous about the pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but she can not overcome the bad and beyond the strange funny situation. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this section of Drake received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (one year "Our M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
