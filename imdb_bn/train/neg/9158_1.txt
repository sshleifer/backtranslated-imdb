O god I bought this movie ... ... I saw ... ... the whole ... thing. . . All right, it'll be okay ... I know I'm fine in one or two months. Soon I hope to get rid of the flashback. I'm going to have something to eat after the movie but at the moment I do not have the courage to try any food. Bad? Yes bad very bad. Buddy Buddy Bed Bud. Wait, bad does not seem quite right across the message. Hmmm ... there is no sound to describe just how terrible it is ... not terrible ... Hmmm violently acting / acting / portrayed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do but throw it. Probably burned it I did not want it to end below an architectural drill for a thousand years. The worst movie from "Hey Happy"
