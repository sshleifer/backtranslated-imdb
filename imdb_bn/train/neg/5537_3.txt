What? Was not you aware that Scooby-Doo war zombies? Well, you will not be aware of this short film directed by Victor Halperin, who pointed out to the White Jumbo four years ago. This will probably make second zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look for Dorothy Stone to reveal her breasts because you would expect most of the zombie movies and not even look for anything. The brain is eating. This is 1936, you know <br /> <br /> <br /> So, what you see is a specific duration - a lot of talking. <br /> <br /> You'll see Dean Jagger (Twelve One 'Clock Hi) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but it's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!
