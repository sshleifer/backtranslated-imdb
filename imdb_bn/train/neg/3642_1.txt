Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with creating a lam in social events in a real event, but the ball is not legally documented in the document. How violent video games can not be blamed (I got the impression that Ben Koxi is a strange gamma), or how clear the media and the music are completely unmistakable. We can also get ridiculous views of two boys. Talk about their CD burning, subtlety !), But the movie only gets away with it because it's 'fiction'. Good try Yes, it is a great idea to relieve the influential media, but how do we know of kids who have actually planned and executed a school shooting that is influenced by the media? Or video games? We do not, and we do not agree with this movie because these kids are smart enough to completely erase the media, but are fools enough to tear a Nazi symbol on the ground? Oh, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This picture depicts the naturalness of the family, you bat on top of the head, it often turns out to be a helpless act that seems to be a serious error in the family, did not actually go out and shot their fellow classmates that the children are dynamic Why is everyone so concerned about killing the killer as "normal", when they are obviously not? A complete false and stupid illustration.
