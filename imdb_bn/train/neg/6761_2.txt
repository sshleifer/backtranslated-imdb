Let's be honest. As a film school project, created without budget and "real" actors, it is an obviously attractive film. It's a very poorly-produced product, like publishing something in the DVD for an innocent audience. If I deliberately changed the channels and could capture this image in a wrong way, it would probably arrest my eyes and attention for a while. A person who bought this DVD under the impression that I'm getting the right movie product, like a movie, I am deeply disappointed. This is a videotape TV game, something along the sequence of the old sixties, but without the specific charm. On the other hand, other actors, including Mr. Redfield (who was also the director), other actors from the campus (actually too old for this), or family members of the director who will not be present without the camera, not only from acting parades, make-up artists or hairdressers a bonnet or mullet over top hat) A long way from the 1840s. This is a small, bare studio that uses all the shots using the unmanned mounting camera sometimes, the blue screen for the outer screen. Synthesizer creates a "immune" score of Lum, "inspires the viewer's ears on multiple occasions, inspired by romantic Kara. The film tries to be" like a dream ", but it is actually the collage of the mere ideas of those shots that it has made for editing (and believe me, the values There was not too much to start with.) Now and then there are interesting dialogs between everyone, but   মগ্রিকভাবে এটি পরিচালক বা কোনও ক্রুয়ের সদস্যের প্রতি বৈচিত্র্যের কোনো ঝাপসা ছাড়াই একাধিক উপায়ে বেশ লম্বা এবং দ্বি-মাত্রিক উৎপাদন। এভাবে "আর্টস" চলচ্চিত্রগুলি 80 এর দশকে দেখার চেষ্টা করেছিল। মিস্টার রেডফিল্ড পরিচালক চেয়ে একজন অভিনেতা হিসাবে অনেক ভাল কাজ করে।
