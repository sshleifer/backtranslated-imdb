This picture is so bad it simply defies the reality. Filming is the best grade school material, suppressing acting and the director should forever be exiled from any form from forming the film. It is so bad that the comedy like that with the likes of the show can not be seen. The only things this DVD is going for it were cover art. <br /> <br /> I can write to everyone who was not unaware of this testimony, please, please, gain your qualifications and do not waste your time or money on this piece. Garbage. If you want to watch a movie for comedy aspects, then this state is much more worthy than the trash.
