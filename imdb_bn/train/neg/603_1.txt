Absolutely ridiculous film I live in London and the plot is so ridiculous that it's ridiculous. No one can be terrorists in the London Underground. It does not serve every night in a short time, where the maintenance staff checks the checks and repair works etc. The surviving homeless people are equally unlikely. Or it is not possible to get locked out even when the mobile phone does not have access to this day and age. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it is in control for a large number of security cameras in the network, another thorn next to the story. (Remember in London that there are more safety cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it is set up in a city, I am probably not known, I could enjoy it by ignorance. But this is not a high quality movie so I can not try to stop my unbelief and enjoy it to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I gave it 0/10 if such a rating exists! Perhaps I'm the most desired film I ever want.
