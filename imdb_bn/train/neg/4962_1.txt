99.999% pure shit. And another .001% is a brief moment where I thought blonde chick is going neat. Napa. <br /> <br /> The conversation was bad. The action was sucked, and there was no gender (previously mentioned blonde chick humored, alas, full movie). CGI had a suspicious respect for what I have ever seen in the film, and the Anchronyms were numerous and light. The film's only 'Ben Cross' and Marina Serratis' performance were moderate. And Marina Sirite really looked really, really bad. <br /> <br /> I've seen more efficiently produced at high school. This is like the movie launched by MST3. The head should be rolled on Sci-Fi for permission of this steaming pile in the air.
