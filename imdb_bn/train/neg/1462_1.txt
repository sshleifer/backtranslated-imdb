This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite the claim of Mixel, this movie is not even close to historically correct. It starts badly and since then it's all downhill. Hitler's father cursed his own misfortune "the truth" that he married his nephew! They're actually, the second cousin. Hitler's mother Clara called her father Alio "uncle" because Alice was taken by Clara's grandfather and raised and raised as his son when he was actually his nephew. Aless was much older than Clara and as a child he entered the practice of calling Alous, "uncle." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hitler mocked his colleagues and made his decision. It is simply an insult to take it on his dog and an insult to the intelligence of all the visitors. We see Hitler behind the dog with a trench, when he comes with a poor thing for his disobedience, he is in a hurry. In the distance we have seen and heard that his fellow soldiers ridicule a little bit of curiosity, but then the shell land comes directly to his oppressors, and in the end we are told to be killed. So if Hitler was the only person, would that scene be called the story of cruelty and humor? Did Hitler himself "proud" about this? - I do not think so. Later, Hitler cheated the poor, intensely and war criminal Jewish officer for giving him an iron cross and was scared! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a Punjabi before fighting for the father's land and thought about some committed medal from his shop, because I am sure that iron crosses in this comic French are not being handed over. <br /> <br /> Wagner's song has no quiet and hypnotic effect on all the little ones. The only producer was Ian Kershaw as well. Then they might have known that the fountain boat could float away from any "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's "Merry Widow" Franken Leah's cannon! <br /> <br /> <br /> 60 million people but how could he ever be forgiven for his extraordinary taste in the music? <br /> <br /> I could go but I could have it over for hours. <br /> <br /> It's a day to lose.
