The picture I've seen positively the worst movie ever. I could not sit through the whole thing. I think there should be some strange idols for writers, women who are pumping in the pond and trembling ... what I mean! I can not believe it was even made and the Â£ 4 rental fee was disgusting in Washington #. Both terrible images of pictures and sounds, acting ... are not good. It was a poor excuse for a movie and a memorable episode of the urine, shit, and 1 cup of 2 girls of rash. Urghh ....... avoid all costs! The girls felt that they had gone down the street and their part was able to reach them only that they were willing to take them to the top ... even though these girls have beautiful bodies, they must have been shocking to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Sorry if my first comment is very negative but I can not think of something positive and I want to think that I can waste their money like somebody else.
