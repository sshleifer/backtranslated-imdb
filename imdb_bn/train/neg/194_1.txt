This image, The Alamo: Thirteen Day to Glory, is completely rubbish. The acting is horrific, it is a lot of patriots and its historical accuracy is not always the best (historians will have a field day). It's a few good moments, but it's not enough to be interested because it's too long. Rating * out of **********
