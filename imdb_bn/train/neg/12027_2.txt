I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was going through the channel and there was nothing to see. This is a movie where you stop watching it - just for a moment! But after twenty minutes you realize that you can not stop it, how bad it is. One of those films that looks so bad is good and very bad, well, just plain BAD, it's only understandable to be able to experience confusion! Great mid-of-the-night rent, only for fabulous tennis drag. Even do not be bothered to ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Loa is so clear men, because reason does not apply.
