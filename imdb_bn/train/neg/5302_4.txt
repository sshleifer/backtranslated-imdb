Dewana goes through normal clich√©s as a picture. Men and women fall in love and marry, husbands kill family friends who think that their family wants luck, women reconsider and rekindle wonderful husband number 1. The film has made Yash Chopra's moonlight and countless others memorable. Bhabari and Shahrukh Khan gave good performance. As a villain, Amirash Puri goes through the speed and is nothing more than an ideal Bollywood villain, Nadeem Sraban's music is fantastic, all songs are bright. My favorite is Sohngez Tumi Piar na koi koi ki chahiyaya. Diwana is a simple movie that goes through motion.
