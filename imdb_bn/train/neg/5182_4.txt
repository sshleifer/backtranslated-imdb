Like most festivals, Hamilts creates an interesting watch, a movie that gives all ideas and a little execution. Though impressive for its apparent low budget, the film fails its final wrapping and it is drawn and horribly long in the clear conclusion. The film tries to survive after the death of parents, about a family of murderers. They kidnap people, remove them from blood and eat something by locking them in their bases. MacLeiller and Fergenon have some pretty dark ridiculous performances and the rest are all. The film is never realistic or it feels very annoying about that. But the first half is a wonderful achievement which taps into a wonderful ridiculous and bold mix. The next half is not so successful that it reaches the film disagreements with non-communal twists because it becomes a comical playback conclusion that makes the whole film a complete tear. Although it is no doubt that some talent was involved in this competition and although it was deeply flawed, it was original and creative. It is very bad that when it comes to delivery it fails completely at each level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
