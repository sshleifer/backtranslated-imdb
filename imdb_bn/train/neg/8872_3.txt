Major Payne was not really very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor. Major Payne's voice and mood was particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous, and the boys who wanted to do the film were more ridiculous. I will not recommend anyone on this photo.
