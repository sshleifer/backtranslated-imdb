The first scanners might not be a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no such innovation. The acting is worse, in my opinion, the story is slow and not something special. Like the conversation. Special effects are not better than the original. This is the movie is worse than the first in all ways. It's just a different thing, it's sometimes like loud and chaotic. But it does not make good films. If they do something better with the story and make it interesting, it can be a decent film. Actually I could not get everything through it without fast progress. To me, this is a forgotten movie, and much more. However, there are bad movies. A generous mood, I'll give Scanner 2 a 4/10.
