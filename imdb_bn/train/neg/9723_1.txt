Jeux d'enfants, or how the film was mistakenly translated into English, love me if you create a movie made by violent people and stupid people. I do not know how I can expect to see a movie look through such a plot: Two fools can find a fool who can do something (obviously stupid) to prove to each other with intelligent children (wtf?) They "cool dudes "Is either. I know that I exaggerated some aspects but the whole film is about that. They're getting older ... and instead of just pursuing them, they are just some of the weird people who are doing their crazy work, they think they're great people. <br /> <br /> Anyone can expect such a picture from Hollywood, but France? It is more invasive to watch the film that was created some years ago, which BTV tried to see, but far away. Avoid <br /> <br /> To avoid. To avoid.
