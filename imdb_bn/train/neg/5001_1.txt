I do not know why I commented on this stupid reality show. I saw a few episodes (in a cable marathon broadcast, when they published 5 episodes or something, I did not see the whole thing, I was only three months pregnant and I would go to work any day. Today I was just bored :-) <br / > <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, I really do. For him, all the money and prestige seems to be rarely felt. Or she is spontaneous towards extreme He married the Nightwit Federline (OK, anyone can make a mistake) and before that he "played" this horrible show about his daily life, wherever he thinks that the camcoder is run, while the Federline is there while it is facing someone or fountain Remains. He is boring about your fantasy without his fantasy, I do not take care of my part, but I will not be surprised how he feels when he is divorced. And yes, I feel embarrassed for that but I can not be. Although he seems to be living a pretty empty, shallow life. Even if I do not want to exchange life with her. If you want the road-kill TV.
