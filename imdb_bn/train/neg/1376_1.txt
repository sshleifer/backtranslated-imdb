Among all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if it's valuable to you), this is the greatest movie I can see. I know that maybe something is bad that I have not seen yet, but I saw it, and it's the worst. A friend and I hired one night because Dennis Richards was on the cover. Talk about young and disabled. He is unknow! His role was incredible small! How did he put it on the cover! IMDB does not list it in its filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a small note in the video store when we returned it and hanged it inside the case. It should read something like "Save more customers to see the complete and completely bad movie"!
