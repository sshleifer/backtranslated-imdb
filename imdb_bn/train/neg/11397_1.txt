This was really awesome! It was a terrible tale, was bad acting, and bad death was like an amateur remix but almost as well. <br /> <br /> It took a lot of my strengths to make it through, it's a good job. I will not return to the toilet I doubt it will return! This one Hummer House House makes look like a big screen Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was the last supply of beautiful women. Not one of them is bad! <br /> <br /> If you want to let your friends get along with you on the beer night, avoid this as a plug-in for you!
