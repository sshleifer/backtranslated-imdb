But a brief review ... <br /> <br /> To avoid all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. At the end of the film I was not really wise about what had happened. It is full of kyomas (Stephen Fry (3 mins), Jack D (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some obscurely recognized people, but it does not understand in any sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for Camios and a Morris small car charger) <br /> <br />
