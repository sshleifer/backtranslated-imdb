I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad that I can not really believe it. I was so frustrated to write the worst and act in human history, I was deeply worried that my heart could be attacked and killed in the theater. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about this scene, "Hero" saw his brother's crash and his brother's car exploded only a few feet away (in football). The "hero" was throwing the "fitter" expected by some tragic events and people tried to return him to a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I am very sorry" - he said right ? Am i crazy
