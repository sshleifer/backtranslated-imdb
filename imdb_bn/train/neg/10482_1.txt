One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How to define "worst"? I will be forced to tap the dance on them both without being seen yanked both eyes and then seeing this unfortunate dreck again. Somehow, a one-hit Wanderer is a film that simultaneously omits Elvis's fans, Mary K Saleswani, Las Vegas, Gay, FBI agent, and the rest of humanity with no intelligence, so that it can be canceled. How Elvis Presley Enterprises can approve the right to use in a film with a central premise of the real Elvis songs, which seems to be "A dead person is a dead person." This is the worst part of the mess - and that takes some work - the mangled script is: In 1958, Alice was quoted in the words and songs that she would speak / work in the 1970s! The worst effect? The Oscar that went to the body, who decided that the grave of Alves is probably the most photographed / recognized grave in the world with a pyramid that has a gold-covered gold record and it is located in the middle of a park. Probably, the biggest audience of this photo will be Elvis fans. However, fierce folly (Dixie Lvis Dia badge, not FBI credentials ... and I can go and go) actually fall under traditional knowledge. Disgust I used the word "knowledge" to describe this stupid movie. It's really a terrific, awesome movie.
