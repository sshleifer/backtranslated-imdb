After watching this movie, I complained about the quality of soundtracks in my local movies or whether the movie sound system could be faulty. For the first half of the film, it is very difficult to understand what someone is saying because of background music and soundtrack scratches. I was ready to blame film equipment but not so - it was director. <br /> <br /> I was told that my complaint is an indispensable part of film making. In order to create a very annoying impact in the film, music and sound should have been distorted. These days, the director will go a long way to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no word will be the same as the word or where you'll see the sound word. <br /> <br /> So this is a good reason to give the film a miss in the distortion of the sound track distortion itself (except that you can find elsewhere) in addition to the historical mistakes of this movie. You must hear distorted scratchiness in the word track and certainly not a cat's buffalo.
