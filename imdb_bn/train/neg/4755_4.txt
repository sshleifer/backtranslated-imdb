I thought the picture was good. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film were good. The first 30 minute camera angles were weird and I do not like it that they did not cover the actors completely. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the film was not really that bigger than we expect so much in this film. <br /> <br /> The dials did not understand and I think <br /> <br /> I think they are attempting to copy movies like phone boots in the context of the conversation, but unfortunately failed. It seems that they had kept a lot of views in it for the actors and there was no idea of ​​the story. <br /> <br /> The whole film is the only law and cine features. <br /> <br /> I think it was not a waste time, it's okay, but not gr8
