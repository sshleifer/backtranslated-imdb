If I see the possibility of being physically ill, then the film is so annoying ... until you believe in psychology, resurrection and other attitudes that it promotes a great time. "Re-cycling the soul", they call it here. Puh-leeze <br /> <br /> This story has been done several times with "heaven can wait". It has been a lot better. Worse, they wanted to maintain the talent of Robert Doni Jr., Cyril Shepherd, Ryan O'Neil and Mary Stewart Mastersen <br /> At least this is a beautiful picture, on the basis of language. That's about this movie's only redeeming quality.
