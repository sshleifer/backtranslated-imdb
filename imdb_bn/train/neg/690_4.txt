If you've ever seen an ash slasher, there's not much reason to see this one. Originality is not often one of the strongest positions in Slashar movie, and it is something that is critically lacking in this film. I can not say very well about the surprises, so I will do it fast. This image was one of the 74 films contained in the DPP video nasty list, and this was the only reason I was watching. The plot follows a bunch of kids staying behind a dormitory during Christmas time. As they are in Slashare, some people decide to start picking them and it is one of the worst mysteries seen in a slash movie. This movie was intrigued in the video's nasty list, despite some minor scenes, this movie can not be very corrupt, and it will not be reduced (eg 13th Friday) for example, not ending as banned. But then, banned films are banned, which are far less important than this one (for example, who came from the sea). However, the conclusion of the film is the best thing about it, even though the audience can not actually take care of it at least those who are attacking at this time; It is rather well done. Overall, it's a horrible and frustrating slasher that even slasher fans would be better to miss.
