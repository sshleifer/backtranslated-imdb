Did filmmakers preview it even before it was released? The script left the jumps from place without explaining much. If it is not a prequel or if the beginning is not clear. It starts at the beginning of the world's superman and then goes to a point after the last movie - but it does not warn viewers. Very confusing! Superman needs to weaken himself and Prozac. She is portrayed as a potential home-recorder, a stalker, and clearly depressed and confused anyone. This type of character rarely makes for an attractive hero. The end is absolutely ridiculous. At the end of a hospital, Superman just wants to kill me myself. I'm waiting sincerely for Sir Alex Skit where Superman arrives at Murray Povich and Murray says, "There are results - for the child, Superman, you dad." To sum up - OK this is the performance of Superman and Kevin Spacy, but great scripts. The movie is basically unwatchable.
