After all, I'm not American or Middle East. Secondly, I have no religion. To me, the closest thing to religion is sports and movies. Later, I believe that I will provide the best service for the release of freedom from neutrality and bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are disrespectful. This horrific incident should be used to commemorate "some" barbarous and unheeded chickens, to kill all unarmed people. Instead, what I saw in this short film most proudly attempted to score political points. Example: <br /> 1) Segment of Kenny Loch. Sure, we are all sad that this father had a difficult life in his country, but what did the 2001 victims have to do? Two wrongs are not a right?! Anyway! This movie should have a subtitle for problems that may appear to be partially incompatible with the Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most annoying Yusuf Chahain's segment. It is logical that he has problems with logic. Because America's democracy has proven America as democracy, and some Americans have voted politicians in politics, then all Americans are responsible for the steps and decisions being taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Hello! This guy for real ?? Some Americans even do not vote! Some Americans even do not know where the Middle East is; Nobody knows what religion is practiced there; And do not know the real political issues that are played behind the majority scenes. ### Mr. Chahain, That's why we have these problems in the world because you have very reasonable people. The innocent man of the twin tower came from all over the world. There is nothing to do with firearms, rescuers, office workers, bai-standers and flight passengers politics. And yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because "some" people want to choose one direction or religion. We are perceived as the perfect game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed the victims of their own bomb. Another filmmaker uses this event to push their own political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you Some people always think "me, me, me". Sometimes, it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idris Wudodoro segment is a joke and scorer of other political points. They certainly want money from international community raising their poverty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image denies memory of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best thing about this is trash.
