Less than 15 miles in Texas and being less than 15 miles away, I can tell you that this movie is annoying. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie. The plot is weak, and fake acts are fun and it strengthens the stereotyptical image that makes all the textains beer drinks, hunky-tonkin ', red necks. The terrible fake Spanish tale kills it for me. Indeed, some Texas texts have a specific point in Texas, but these people are more than this. You can not get any from New Jersey and Ohio to speak Texas. It just does not work. John Travolta should have been disco-danced or stuck in the 50's. Debra Winger was more believable as a Wonder Girl than she was a Texan.
