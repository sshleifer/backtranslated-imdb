Hu Even though an enjoyable movie is about to break the plot, torture, acting, primitive (best) special effects (which have forced me to show this movie three times in the last six years), the worst I have seen. I'm not sure what the dramas are, I know that the killer uses a portable guillotine, such as the murder scene seen on dance floor. Above all, I really do not like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest are confusing conversations and imagery that fails to improve the story in a logical conclusion (which I can not remember)).
