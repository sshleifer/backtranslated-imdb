I've rented this movie today, it seems to be a good football movie because I'm a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This movie is very religious and promotional and really unrealistic. Most of the movie says that if you have a Christian you can get something that you want in life but become a great football player! You are becoming a Christian and do not become a great football player by asking God, you practice it and do it with hard work. Ask God what you need to do and he will give you something .... puh-lease Not all right, double. Because of this embarrassment, I laugh several times. The only part that was funny when they were stupid (Cartoonist Shaltz? No, the city that was running on Adalant etc.) etc. But this movie was not really great. I do not recommend it, especially if you're not a Christian, lol.
