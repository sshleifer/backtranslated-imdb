"54" A movie based on the infamous "Studio 54" - a hangout for social elites and party clans. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character based on a real employee of the studio from 1977-1922. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it is not all shiny and stylish and no substance. It's really a great and tries to test the satire like "Boogie Knights" but eventually comes across a inferior wannabe. Mike Mike has been given the extraordinary work of Steve Rubel, owner of the Cocaine-Switting Club. It was only the little comedic role and the biggest effort of the Mayors in the slides on plays like Lemon and other comedian actors, but it was a complete failure. <br /> <br /> "54" can be insightful and fun but instead it's another folly teen flashing that is not even entertaining nor even remotely engaging. See your own danger.
