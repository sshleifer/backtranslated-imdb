This is a weird sex comedy because there are very few comedy here, but full sexuality, which is mostly behind the car, and it is so graphic that the basic institute seems to be a televisyase version. I'm not a kid, sex in this movie is your face so it can bother you, especially if you meet your grandparents. <br /> <br /> There is nothing left to mention the rest of the Rita, SUE, and BOB TOO, where each sentence seems to contain F words. This is an extraordinary Hyper-Realist British film, when Channel 4 was the principal investor of British films, which explains it for the feeling of low budget on television.
