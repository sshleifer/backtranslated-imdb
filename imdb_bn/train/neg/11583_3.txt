The film introduces an array of characters and their relationships within the first half hour or so. None of them produce any interest or positive feedback. I waited for the conspiracy to start, hopefully things will be better and end up in the end until the end of the end, but there is no reward for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a summary then see elsewhere. I do not have the cost of reinstatement. The story was not bad, I guess you had some problems with the script - for example. I thought it stunk. A view of the credits will show you that there is a nice cast cast here, it is not used in any way. This shocking works best for older professionals; I've played a long time before the actor I especially like Deborah Car Unger. It's nice to say about this picture that's all about me.
