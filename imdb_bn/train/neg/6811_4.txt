When I saw this movie in the movie 11 years ago, I like it. I still think guides and cinematography are excellent, like music. But this is really the script that has started to disturb me even more with time. I found the writing of Emma Thompson's self-absorbed and unfriendly writing; He turned Marianne into a side-role, the second puzzle for his very old, very intense alinor - he gave many 'focus moments' in the film, and often they appear there to show Thompson. <br /> <br /> <br /> I understand him spending many letters in the book, but in the book does he find out the scene of liberating Wilby? Long before the movie, the book is red and raised, which is always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> For actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marian. He has not given the best script for working with the world but he still pulls gracefully, without too much sensitivity. Alan Rickman is fantastic, perhaps a bit old, but he plays beautiful role. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she always as absolutely fantastic.
