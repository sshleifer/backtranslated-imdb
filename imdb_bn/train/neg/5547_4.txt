Not a repetition of Zombies (2 outta 5 stars), it is not the longest lost ancestor of Romero zombie flicks at the classic George. Since 1936, it's a low-budget patbular, which seems pretty cool to the viewers ... but these days seem wildly routine. In fact, a pistol was shot at the beginning of a soldier shot by a soldier coming to the Zimbi soldiers ... and one of them had close knit access bullets closely. The effect looks frustrating this day, but in 1936 I was sure the audience was gasping. The story reveals the secret of the control of mind control ... apparently to create an unstable zombie army ... but later he can win the woman he loves for a character. The film is only one hour long but moves at a snap speed so it seems to feature-length, believe me! There is really nothing to recommend it ... You can get some entertainment from the "studying" of the "Wedding" starred studio shots. Finishing is interesting ... so I'll say the movie is at least once viewed. Perhaps you can see it as an additional feature of some cheaper "4 DVDs in 1 DVD" section on Wal-Mart with five rupees. Hey, it's a good price ...
