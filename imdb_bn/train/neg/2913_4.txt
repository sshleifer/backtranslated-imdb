It looks very nice to see the improvement in the Turkish film industry, however, I expected something more creative than the tog√°n gobbucker. Starting from the script, which I believe is that it can not think of something as a wise written one. Especially the fascination of dialogue, which kept the listener in a position that if they are not capable enough to understand the situation, which often makes the film intolerable. This is a clear ending; You can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. The most vulnerable part of the scene is that the mentally ill patients are seriously unable to work like normal people like professionals !!! Do they ever look for possible possibilities for patients to work like medical professionals and work as professionals? Medical conditions that even ordinary people can not even use ????? !!!!!! The scene where the staff was looking for the most dangerous patient, with the help of a weapon to protect themselves, there was another peculiar point of the film. And that scene was appropriate for the title "Sahan Kikibilir" !! Those cinemas are not only weak parts. There was a lot of perspective in the film. The most dangerous patient screenplay was a perfect copy of Hanib, Taugan's appearance was probably the worst mistake in his very first movie! In the film's greatness and interview interview, the actors simply encouraged and forced people to see it. Zen total frustration. I would be surprised if Sahan is not that famous, then can this film be able to draw the amount of this budget ?? I hope Togane says in an interview that it is not fashionable to play a role as a director. Hitcoak is who has done it wisely and continued it successfully! He should be aware of Hitako or not even Shyamal! I hope he will be more careful and creative in this big industry later.
