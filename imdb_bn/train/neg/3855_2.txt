Larry Miller's only part was the only release. It seemed that the movie tried very hard to do something about "Mary", but I did not like that movie, and it is still less than those values. Paul acted in a great acting role, but Selma Blair was stuck in the stupidity of his cruel motto. James Brolin was great, but Paul's parents seem to have tried very hard to be the character of Randi Quaid from the National Lampoon's holiday movie.
