There is no question of questioner for this movie, the director has beaten all of us and has spoiled the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> A blurry rip off of stuff like Kriters and Graumillins, this movie has failed many good levels which are well-made film humor and awful restoration. It ended up a lazy waste of time, where bad actors gave bad conversations to innocent directors, who sometimes toss stuffed toys. They used to wrestle toys with the use of rubber crocodiles in most of the old Tarzan films, shaking them while shouting, and tried their best to make it a little threatened. It's painful to watch, and does not help by the 80's fashion lost by Caste. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by a movie security guard of many years, they are finally imprisoned for years, and the screw around the heart of telepathic people. Guard is the new recruiter, stupid, who repeatedly warns them out, 80 friends get their gang together and they leave and while trying to recover in the summer, they are together in a small event ... Hobgoblins <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole life is here, nokalhed joke, her 80's prostitute girlfriend, 'gentleman's prairie and cheerful girlfriend of the hero, and the young hero, lacks confidence and is here with a gang who wants his girlfriend . <br /> <br /> First, the scene of the infamous Rack Wreck comes in which the former military joke shows how he was trained in the army, suddenly pushed the innocent hero with a wrong mistake in remembrance of an hour. After that some things are going on, with a comedy hand-grenade blowing apart everything else on the side of a hand-grenade ends in a real pie-fighting style that ends in a Skyy nightclub. Then the end of film sort, and well that's good at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not. It's like watching a train debris, you can not take your eyes off it, it's too bad. Mystery is the perfect rental for science theater, but God is terrible you should try to see it alone and uncut. There are many outstanding warrants for fashion police still cast, and I dare someone who does not laugh directly into the rake battle. On this day, 2 out of 10, very good day.
