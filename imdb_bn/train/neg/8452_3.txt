For the first time I commented on a picture because I think that if the right person reads it, they can wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family has started pouring in a new format of movies. I have seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were compelling and tactical. My wife liked these films. I was waiting to see "Zen Zen". The trailer looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this film will have to be before the light years rather than the effort shown by the author and musician associated with this project. In the year 2003, the source (all the worst), the score was attractive as a lift ride on a department store. It was violent and did not add any mental content to the film. It worked against it. I work in film and television business. I enjoy being entertained. This is an example where I remember that it might be worse. The script was a line from another decade and I know that these women can work but you do not know it from this movie. To add to the overall experience, the last left shaking my head. A suggestion to the Disney, ABC, ABC family, and the executors of the manufacturers: In any case, please do not rent a musician or music supervisor for a future movie. They have lost their touch and they need to understand the term "contemporary", "present day" and "present" when describing romantic comedy. You have a world pass by. Von Genrek-Sartner and ABC family are the biggest disappointments in people.
