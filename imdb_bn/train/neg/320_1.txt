First off, there's not really a funny or tricky line of the whole movie. It is so sad that it is kinder. Wonderfully not very frank or sexy humorous, but f-word lots. The budget is really low, and it destroys the film. It happens in a cruise ship, but it seems that they had only one meaning for renting a small boat and only 10 ships had extra money, including a delivery Bob Thornton. Open Credit Animation is reeeeeaally cheap, and it's just unfortunate. I hate this movie and seeing this, everyone else will hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. R for the language
