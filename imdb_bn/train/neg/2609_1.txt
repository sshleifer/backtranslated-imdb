This movie offers no new or suitable. After watching this, both my wife and I agreed that the studio simply slowed it down and could take less care if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a "concept cable" movie - they have ideas about a movie and other details are essential because it will earn $$ on the basis of an effective concept. <br /> <br /> Crula is coming out of jail and going to parole is the movie. He does not hate puppies but has been programmed to worship them - he simply can not hit a flea. This does not last too long after its release and he returns to his old ways. Duration <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were helpful characters. Ardad Idle bird as Waddlesworth's voice hated me - and that's what I considered a Maya Python fan. It was obvious because they gave him a lot of money (could not be any other reason). The less self-respecting slave of the crew, Tim McInnari, was pleased to hear the black adar, but here he was completely destroyed. And Gerard Depardieu had to spend a little bit of money to get it, but he was completely destroyed. As well as some other helpful actors, but how badly the letters were written, I was trying to block them out of their minds. <br /> <br /> Overall, you'll be better off allowing your kids to watch television. Letting them see this drivel bother.
