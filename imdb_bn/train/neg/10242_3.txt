The film was composed of a white boy cluster together at school. Well there is nothing wrong with it, it looks like it went to school together with a white cluster. 90 percent cast white men about the same age. In order to turn themselves into camps in the cameras camp, boys are watching several boys in the camp. There is no plot in the movie. It only repeats the same process of blood bath after blood bath. There are some fun scenes and comedic bits. But they do not free up flat equations. <br /> <br /> Graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover objects outside of their budget or organization and they are not done very well. Anything that can not work with the white boy running around the beach covered with blood, is done with some cheaper animations. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie by watching the trailer, which is a trinitone piece. Well, trailer scenes can be as good as they get. The rest of it repeats the same kind of Munden, Anne Comedy. It works at times, but the same thing gets annoying after it comes over you. It is more like a string than Satuday Night live skits than a movie. It's a hit-and-a-kind-comedy comedy. I can see where story ideas are playful. But, in this movie post, mysterious America Madeleville is very much like England. In fact, Wheatlry says the idea of ​​the story came from that era. She plans to make a part 2. I think he thinks Tarantino or maybe doing a parody thing. <br /> <br /> For the first time in the L., Whitley mentions that he will bring the same cast back to Part 2. He was asked that he might consider another diverse cast in the next article, which he replied, yes, sure.
