Give me my money! Give me my life! Give me a bit of credit This movie was inverted. Vain and time consuming. What is a waste of energy and completely untouched. Well I understand the proof and the words of the words but give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Missing children, mother's repentance, husband blame! Check out yes! Get a life! Sorry but this movie was my waste of time, my money and my total waste. I'd rather cook eggs! No real explanation why this happened. Prison? Why? Damage? It is obvious but why? What do I do here for Oscars and cinematography that I'm doing for this wager? How much did this movie have? Well rented a copy of this stupid fool. Enough said
