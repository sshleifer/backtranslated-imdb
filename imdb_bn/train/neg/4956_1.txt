When this cartoon was first broadcasted, I reminded that it was a descendant of at least half way, I was wrong, son. I see this cartoon almost all year old, with George Clooney, Batman and Robin looking painful. I saw a few episodes and kicked two batsman literally kicked on the left and right side of the penguin, who fought like Jet Li and defeated Batman's shit and I saw another episode where Batman kicked the joker's foot. Those who explicitly used Gene Chan to enter the air like themselves. Since the joker or the penguin was a match for Batman? And Jackie Chan and Jet Lee's Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were just as bad. This is really scary, depressing, and Batman's picture depicted in this show. Awesome animation and the dialog is terrible. Being a Batman fan from my childhood, I can genuinely and strongly recommend that you stay away and avoid this show at all because it does not project Batman's true picture. This cartoon is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I strongly recommend the Batman of the Animation series, but this cartoon is nothing but a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: Do not waste your time with the animation series and this cartoon.
