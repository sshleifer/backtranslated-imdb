What is interesting that is played; Not bad, not enough. It was rather lame. Special failure or line was the only criminal for this failure. Standing alone they were not terribly bad, but there was a unfortunate step to put together. This event was definitely designed to be designed in a long wind and slow motion, but it failed completely. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame has had special effects for this disaster. Do not believe, they were kinda cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although he may have all liked to be chosen with a bit of fan recognition. An experienced actress will bring something to the part, as Appleby has never done. Scfi keeps out some really good original movies, it's too bad that it has failed so much.
