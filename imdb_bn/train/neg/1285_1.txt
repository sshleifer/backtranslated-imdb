Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was scared of this horrible figure of a person who was no less than cattle. Even worse, the thread of the whole film was sexually or verbally sexual in one form or in another language. To see it, the 18th-century Scotland would feel that there was mass populated by sex bouts and a bunch of homosexuals. Lanzi was a joke acting as a "young" mother at the age of 49 but Liam Nixon was even worse! Accepting "bathing" in the Scottish people is not an ordinary phenomenon, but it has given them another chance to show how we were sexually driven. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
