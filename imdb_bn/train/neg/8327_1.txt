OK. So this is a low budget "film" (I used quote because it was shot in a hi-8 video). Acting is universally awful, makeup funny (came from Sherwin-Williams like blood, and I saw a strong persuasion made from Halloween Wheel Kit), and the light generally seems that some of the headlights on the actors shine using the Toyota Pickup for someone. <br /> <br /> If a movie tries to tell a story, I can forgive the characteristics of this low budget. But this collection of video footage can boast any plot, no real character, and no movements. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
