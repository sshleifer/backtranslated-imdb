Why do they insist on rebuilding great films like "High Noon" "Great Noon"? "From here to eternity" and this one? <br /> <br /> Why do they think that the audience is more attractive and white than black? <br /> <br /> Why is Robert forced to wear Dopi, Broad Build, Baseball hat? ... it looks like Jim Verney. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone spend? Four hours suffer this? <br /> <br /> See the original. Then why do not you have to ask yourself why.
