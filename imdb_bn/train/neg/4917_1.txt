**** SPOILER ALERTS **** <br /> <br /> One of the funniest comedians created for screen, without any doubt. It is impossible to take this importance seriously. It will take a major novel to list all the comedy routines. In the glorious days of his program, Carroll Burnett and the company, who often acted in movies, made the imagination difficult. Carroll played Jenny, who suddenly became a little hungry, and immediately came sharp music, and everyone looked at the neighborhood to see where it came from. Harvey Karim played Oliver with the flowing people and almost like Ryan O'Aliy. This is one of the fun things of Bit, real movies. <br /> <br /> No death scene at the end. Jenny really feels like she's dying ... her make-up artist is dying to come and paint her a bit. And of course, we all know that hospitals encouraged many loved ones to go to bed with them during the final moments of the patients. The last scene with Ryan O'Leal, sitting on a snowing bench, thinking about the future of the movie business, the classic classic. She had lots to worry about. He did not recover from this.
