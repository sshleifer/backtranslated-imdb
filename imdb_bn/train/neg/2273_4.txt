I do not think it was a big disaster, but in my story of the film it is almost as positive. I'm not sure what it means to be funny about this movie, but I think it's all about taste. Personally, I do not see them enjoying their stupid lives or making fun of television, but again, I'm not the fan of Jerry Spring's tragic day talk show. I did not get bored watching this too, but I certainly did not enjoy it, is it. If you are in the mood to watch a bad movie, but which is not too painful to get busy, it's a good choice.
