I have finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. I can not believe what I have seen yet <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie. If I list all the flaws in the movie, then this review will accept many sentences. (Very bad, even though it's bad) <br /> <br /> <br /> You will be surprised at the command of the plane to rescue the plane. They did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice is a bad actor ... and the thing that I can not understand, it wants to become a hero. It is a zero .. <br /> <br /> The main drawbacks of the 747 will be the landing, a person needs only 3 or 4 tips to transmit the plane ... amazing .. as well as <br /> <br /> But I Strongly recommend this movie, because it is very interesting to see how bad it can be
