When I freed this movie from my job, as well as three similar movies .. I saw very little hope. Now this movie is not bad at all. Do you get paid for you? It's a story, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, a story of everything you want in a movie. Of course, not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it is not bad for the cheap thriller. I probably will not see this movie again. In short, this is a movie that you can see late at night in the local television station, which just wants to take some time, or you want to see it on Sunday afternoon at the local television station. Despite bad acting, clich√© lines, and sub-par camera work. I did not want to stop the movie and it never popped in my DVD player. Many of the stories have been made in many movies. This one is different, no good, no bad <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
