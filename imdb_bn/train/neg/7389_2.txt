I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with several good movies, then bad story, bad camera work and came down from the knees, he almost lost me. Before few movies remember how he was a decent movie. Now he has forgotten again. This image is seriously dark (you mention the name of any level). There is not a lot of slash and Gauss going here if it is not understood as a warning to the military. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very dark and someone else's voice is used most often. Sadly, only the attractive character was the bad guy who killed his guard to protect him from Hefazat and then attacked all the places. All right, we keep the armed guard in the holding room with the captives. However this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. There is a lot of pride if you like that king. Bad people were looking at me like the same Gash breaking every time. I'm just glad that they did not waste blood from their cruel prey. I harken you back to my summary Basically this is a horror film which is incognito as an action film. 6,200006
