In spite of its stereotype, casting 'anonymously' and a clearly low budget I think this movie is OK; I'm much better than expected to be it. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could infect humans was a little ridiculous to me. But to the end, I thought the film was well-conducted (even some scenes were a little smaller). <br /> <br /> Cast was quite good, and two leads took their role very seriously. I could not think, though, Janine Turner is a bit like a Gina Davis. Maybe this film had his face or makeup, hair and clothes, but the whole time kept pushing my mind behind. <br /> <br /> It will be a 'must see' or a great movie by a standard, 'fatal error' is a recreational flash that will keep you observer at the end.
