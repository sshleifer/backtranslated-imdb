I never wanted to see this movie, one day, for a joke I saw how bad it was! My former ideas have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I would like to question the film politics. It hides behind the mask of women 'make it big in the city', but women are the only way to make it bigger that uses sex over their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more Is little less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? This film is not the only correct wing message, hundreds of American flags and lots of cash in cash An excellent example of how the only powerful thing in the United States is that capitalism and spiritual, moral, or artistic value can not be watched in any of these movies. Money has been portrayed as the only important issue of youth. <br /> <br /> The manager of the bar says that he is not allowing drug users in his bar, and then he drows down to him the worst melting wine in his neck and then his staff and customers' neck. Anyone who knows about narcotics will know that alcohol is dangerous as heroin and can be more dangerous than most illegal drugs. And finally, why is there a scene in which the lead character is interested in the point of sex (when he is unexpected or with his lover) his father is always involved? We watch her father get a phone while she gets undressed with her legs naive camera. She 'auctioned' her father as 'auction' as her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is immoral, fascistic, frustrating and annoying to women, annoying. But what else do you expect from Jerry Brummemar?
