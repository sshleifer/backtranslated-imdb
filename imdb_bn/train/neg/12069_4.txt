Karl Manson, a Grade-Z horror filmmaker, was the most profitable director operating under the poor Moyem's low-budget budget. His films are full of obscure cows, ridiculous acting, boring sub-plots and sad dialogues. A mysterious black-liner image is supernaturally killing guests in the family palace. Unfortunately this image is almost bloody. You do not actually see murders other than the shadow and some blood splatters. The speed is neutral and the plot is rather flexible. Acting is simply capable, but the lack of ox and mutilation disappoint me. A 10 generous 4 out. Just be careful: Andy Millington's equally weak "Blood Legacy" does not make mistakes in the film of mansions.
