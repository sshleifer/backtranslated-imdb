I've seen the mask in the 80's and it currently shows up at Fox Kids in the UK (too late at night). I remember in my mind that the day was very cold and there were toys, but seeing this, now I have tears. I did not understand this cartoon show really tiring and bland earlier. It's just horrible awful! It is not close to the same league as Transformers, O-Man or Thundercut, and almost everyone has forgotten after it was almost closed. I only see it in Fox Kids because it comes straight after the Ullis 31 (it does not allow me to sleep at first). One of the 80 cartoons I want to forget after finishing the ventilation on Fox Kid's!
