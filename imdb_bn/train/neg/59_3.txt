Protocol is an incredible movie, with its only save, it plays the Golden Haun with a good cast of actors. The story surrounds a dirty cocktail waitress who has become famous after saving the life of the Arab eloquent person. The story goes half way through the movie, and the charm of Gold does not save the film only. If you are not a fan of golf then do not go out of your way to see this movie.
