A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. The G.I knows the story of the first woman to go through brutal training on naval forces. The training is the main character directed by Demi Moore O'Neil as a coach in the film because training is the most difficult and difficult to exist. There are no special messages or points in this movie or I could not reach it correctly. It can be a statement of women's rights and abilities, but it all drops under tired scenes and under the stupid gun battle at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why using ridley so much zoom in the last gun battle in the desert? It's sooooo stupid and annoying and looks almost amateur so I really want to know the manager saw that strategy. When I see his latest film Black Hawk Don, there is absolutely no mistake in the war scene (which is a lot) and they are very intense and efficiently operated. GI Zen looks shocking and is nothing more than stupid and intelligent shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is my opinion Reddie Scott's worst movie and there is no significant touch from which this great director is known. I am still happy that I have seen it in a widescreen format because there are still some great scenes and samples of Scott's power, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma and Lewis, Allian and so ..) This talented director. So i j Jane 4/10
