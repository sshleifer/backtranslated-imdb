Henman, a vampire, wants to call him after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror-comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments of this photo. I'll confuse the public misleading, but it's disconcerting someone less. A redemption factor (and I'm very generous here) can be the only half-choice grandfather in this whole world. Do not waste your money or time. Actually there is a word of advice here, if Tromas get out of the DVD but it does not create itself, all the probability is its curvature. <br /> <br /> Trauma DVD Extra: Comments with Omar and Kirk; Cast and crew deleted commentary with the second commentary; bloopers; Trauma Interactivity; Radiation march; Clips from "Terror Fire"; Theater trailer; Trailer of "Rowdy Girls", "Titas Cathers In Hit", "Conanbel: The Musical", and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My grade: D
