Man, I really wanted to choose this show. I am hungry for some good televisions and I appreciate TNT for providing these "opportunites". But sadly, I am among the minorities when I came to Stephen King of the movie. Bright, ridiculous as the king is writing that it does not translate well on a big or small screen. With some exceptions (very few), the experience of the King can not be portrayed with the same effect as reading stories. Many will disagree with it, but I am sure that in their hearts they should admit that the best illustrated King story is an uninterrupted memory of their reading. The reason is simple. The story of the story of the average King takes place in the mind-scope. He gives our inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or glimpses of unrealistic perspective. In short, the King Reader takes place where you can not place a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the illustrated King, the reader has access, we have left half with less information. It is not a great stretch that the King's story becomes a character they can read, but one is portrayed when the same character portrays it to a little cruelty. Every time the king writes, Hollywood will try to shoot everything from his word processor, whether or not it is not. I do not blame filmmakers for trying, but it takes incredible talent and circump capturing to drive the extraordinary Steven King adaptation. The task is turning the lead in gold, or something similar to arcane jane skills. Oh well, the next part is good luck.
