This is a future adaptation of Verne's "mysterious islands" in the water. Sound editing is quite bad Listen to the dialogue on the set and listen to the voice you are recording at the same time recording booths! It shot an amateur film with Boston actors and a nearby shooting near New Hampshire. For those who are living in New England and reading this comment, they will be washed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You will receive directions from the director's voice and listen to pointing out the actress. "Right now stand up." As for the other characters. This guy talks with his voice instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien people discuss with a deep voice. When he is fighting, he confiscates or congratulates the actor's voice. Special effects, people! Breast Piper's first job to cry loud! Animals are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky To start the time, the crew like Carl Zeeman Animation (1955). Special effects are fantastic. Cool music is good. The following line, this film looks like the Aquarium or Dinosaurs Planet Ray Harrieri epic. Did you know that the terrible Planet was a movie movie and the shoes were in the string budget? Must watch for an aspiring film makers.
