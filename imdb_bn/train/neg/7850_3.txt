Alexander Aja's remix was one of the brightest stains of 2006 in The Hills Hey Eye. This was not just a classic horror movie re-establishment, but it was also very nice. So, almost a year later, we were being treated for the continuation of the rebuilding. The original script, Wes Krawon, came back as producer and collaborative script, this movie failed to reach the original and rhymic level set. To test some scientists, a group of military trainees in the desert closed and at least found the relatives of the mutant family in the first movie (at least those who are new). There should be a lot of gore here. The complete lack of characteristic of this movie disturbed me. The viewer does not contradict what has happened to any such person because we have not been found among them. Even the last time of mutants and this time, there was some characteristic of something. Gore Dotless for Gore It would be interesting to have a reason to happen for this. Here's something interesting that's happening. And what has happened in the film rape scenes? Here we get another one yet for any real reason. I hope a set of these hills which will not be seen again.
