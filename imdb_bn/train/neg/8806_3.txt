How did this ripoff ever get so much love "being there"? People are saying that it is a proof, despite knowing a decent, honest man can be successful. They're wrong. Movie is the proof that fate is everything: Hope your friend does not invest all your money in Apple, not the author; Hopefully your shrimp boat will break the storm outside the sea; Hopefully you do not die the shock when you are not fortunately shot on the buttocks; Hope you will not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also political reactionary - rebels against their social constitution, lose their legs, drug intoxicants, beat their daughter, or die young. In addition, the placement of this movie (Nike and Dr. Moritz) is ashamed. A very emotional manipulative film which is very empty.
