I went into this movie to expect the best movie. I usually like wartimeime musical instruments. Dick Powell and Lucile Ball have done well with their role; However, the authors gave their annoying dialog. Love interest in them has not given any real increase; It was just suddenly. I did not think of songs; The best number was heard by Spike Jones's "Happy Pushing Face". A whole number of Spike Jones was not his fantastic musical comedy; Fantastic tame stuff, even with monkeys. Bert Lahar's comedy skits were non-stop. <br /> <br /> There were some parts to enjoy: Lucile's ball was pretty good, and there was a good selection of bit players who were able to get more time on the screen.
