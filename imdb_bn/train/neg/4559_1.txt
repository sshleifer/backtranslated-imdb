I am really aware of anyone involved in the production of this series will be surprised. The script is so weird that someone who wrote the Canadian Comedy Writers Union entrance test (and it says something!). If you want to find your telescope, but there is nothing similar to a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett could certainly immerse himself in this trash. I lacked the lack of any acting or lack of humorous power. I was surprised that the first episode - Amendment, the past of audition. Those who are invited by them I can all say they must be entertained very easily. And it is clear that production costs must be of course â‚¤ 100 per episode. And if someone thinks that I am commenting as a foreigner who is unaware of English humor, I must say that I am really English.
