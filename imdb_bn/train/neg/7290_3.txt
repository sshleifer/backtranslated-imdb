What a long, drawn out, dull movie. I'm sure historically this movie is fun but entertainment does not make it the only grade. Ralph Fiennes is one of the few extraordinary films, the English patient, Skinner's list, but it was frustrating. It does not seem to go anywhere, its character was so high and high in the beginning that my "sister" was never interested. Do not get bothered to rent this movie, instead buy a copy of the English patient.
