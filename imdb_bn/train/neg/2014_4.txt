I remember the love of this shake when I was young. I thought the helicopter I saw the most beautiful thing. It was ultra high technology for the time being. It can resist the fire of enemies, work all kinds of intelligent tasks in the air, and its way down slightly. Now I go back and see it today and this show really wondered how lousy. Casts are rarely mandatory, there are plenty of cheesy moments, and war scenes are incredibly fake looking. And almost every last grainy low-quality stock footage has the same helicopter war crap with obvious reuse. Most dates of the footage are from the Vietnam war era. <br /> <br /> Airflight is essentially a theme similar to that of the Night Rider, except the crime-fighting car instead of the car instead of the helicopter. After seeing some episodes, I was completely bored of myself. I love the theme, however.
