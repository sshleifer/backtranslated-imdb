I saw the worst DCOM. Ever. Well, probably not as bad as the smart house. It was just bad. Acting and story was good, but the effects were spread! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! Brother and Shane were the only good fight scenes. This is probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this movie was very annoying and suddenly the film was over. <br /> <br /> I'll give it four for Brenda songs, it's a very funny actress and it's a fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
