This is one of the most annoying, unexpected movies, which was unfortunate sitting in my place. It can be good every time it starts to look, more sepia tone flashback comes, later paranoid idiocy masquerading as a social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is an impressive, rebellious person who will probably live in a palace without any parent or responsibility. Supporting Castes are much more likable and interesting, but unfortunately it never gets better. We did not really understand John Stanton's character that Maddox was influenced to influence the causes of rebellion. At one moment, I thought, "Oh! Maddox is just nuts and secretly making these contacts from Stanton, the secretive brain patient! Now we're going somewhere!" But of course, until the case is over and the whole film has become indistinguishable from both the viewpoint of Maddox and the viewer. Where is the need of Faris Bullar?
