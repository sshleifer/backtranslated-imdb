What is Steven Sighal thinking? I first mean seagal love. I love all his movies till the mid-2000s. Some of the best in its first stuff style. Although this does not live up to his excellent name. The common one-fishing donkey will be expected to act as a stupid action film with Seagal in the form of the attack force (with the hero Marshal Lawson {Sigal}). However, what we get is crime crime, there is little or no action on the border of a political thriller. Seagull is always the shadow due to its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who take drugs in superhumans. What happened in this movie. Sibling dabbing is a shame, a shame and shame. Why dub people? The story is terrible. This scene got me from 2/10, because Segal requested a backup with an army with him, and a ridiculous battle scene where his hand swings like girls facing Seagull cameras! Siegel says in the movie "Revenge of a two-road road" ... Well, revenge for Steven, you need to get rid of!
