After I started seeing them again in 2002, I saw a large number of scientific-channel channels (my first was Subertoth - which I think is one of the more entertaining sci-fi channel features). Their values ​​change. Some of them are average but decent (Subertoth, Dragon Fighter, Cree Cree Werewluff, Swap Devil), some ridiculously bad, and then there are some things that are really terrible. Raptor lies next to the planet <br /> <br /> A frequent mess of a movie with a loose sequence of true-life acting and lazy scripts, a loose sequel to the 2004 Saif-Fi channel Origin Reaper Island. The effects of dinosaurs in life (including Pip Pet and Animatronics as well as stock footage from CGI and Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects I see in low-budget films. The influence of Gore is even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> A lot of commandos are involved in this plot, because for some reason (why I forgot) the alien dinosaurs travel to a planet. That's the right people, dinosaurs are alien. Outside dinosaurs What next, shark in space?!? The rest of the plot is easy. The people's cast is closed or eaten. So far, we have come to expect this in many dinosaur movies and novels of the Liberation War, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I saw where I was really upset with all dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> Although it has a few chuckles. A scene that stands out in which a man is managed by Carnotoura (lived by stock footage from real film), becomes a giant rapper after a second. Also, some quarters, this is the scene where Steven Bourne is shooting on his death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no good movie to start the rapper island, it's a wonderful composition, compared to its continuity. <br /> <br /> When I say, it's probably the worst movie Syfy ever broadcasted. It darn around the unwanted.
