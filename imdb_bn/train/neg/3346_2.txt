Baddies in a war of death vs his dolph Jaw dropping will return to the late Greenhouse era exploitation films, where bad guys are crazy and dressers often dressed in dark hair.

What bad movie god has done? I was really concerned about this because the directorial director of this movie directed by Sidney J Furi (?) Who is a real good director who is in the air in company c. Created movies like this. His ability has been his failure, or was he not disappointed or disappointed of despair? It's a turkey A watchable one but turkey is a low.
