Again, Disney manages to make a child film that completely disregards its background. About the general thing about this and the names of the original gadget cartoons. The most awesome flaws are the letters - Penny has no books, the brain has reduced from a fancy phenomenon to a character, Clovers are more show-offs than a bad villain, etc. But more than that. The horrors started from the first minute of this movie - the gadget does not help identify a Brown Inspector named Brown as a Classic Inspector Gadget. And at the very beginning, we have seen Disney's Blatant attempt to make every story a relationship between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, who makes this movie Disney-compatible only. This movie shows that Clo "Clo" and the classic Dr. Clo are almost the opposite and you will find that it is not near the original story. How could it be a good story to replace - but as you might imagine, Disney also failed in that case. The shocking movie Gadget for the entire film is only after the band and lust. Like the insult to the injury, Disney launches the "new" gadgetmobile - it does not look like an old gadgetmobile, does not work or does not seem to be, it's just the comic "Comic Relief" image. Disney is probably recognized that gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made this movie a comedy, but they took out all the cleverly running gags (like explosion blasts in Chief faces) and changed the gadget into a body. GadgetMobile is a wise-donkey, and showing "claw". Someone will tell Disney that "children's cinema" does not mean "the total lack of brain usage". The gadget should be targeted for children ages 10-12 years ... not like this movie for kids 10-12 months. Whatever the movie is supposed to be, it's not, it is repeated, the real inspector gadget. Because I like the old gadget, I hate it.
