General Tom Barnes (Angus McKinsey) runs an unauthorized test flight of X-77, which hosts a new stealth fighter with the ability to literally disappear. General Burns gave his top pilot Colonel Rachel (Steve Taucient) a job and after all the X-77 disappeared, everything got better, even more literally than the Barnes, Rachter flew into Northern Afghanistan and reached a terrorist group called Black Sunday. Under the leadership of Peter Stone (Vincentenzo Nicholli) who plans to use the X-77 flying in the air of the US aircraft and killed some people who put some bombs. General Barnes is worried about the loss of his plane and sent John Sens (co-authors and executive producer Steven Sigal) to send back and kill all these bad guys ... <br /> <br /> This American, British and Romanian The production was directed by Michael Keesch and directed by the third film, which he also released Sigal after the terrible Shadow Man (2006) and Attack Force (2007). Ricalita the Fortunately, someone decided that there was no work in partnership and cooperation between the two thanks to an unexpected public has been notified. Apparently the Flight of Fry often played the same name as Michael Dudicoff, sharing the same name, repeatedly for the word-word-word of the term 'Black Thunder' (1988). So in addition to the manufacturers, the same conversation can be used to change things like names, although I must admit that I have never seen a black thunder and can not compare the two. Fury Flight is a terrible movie, which has made seagulls especially during this period, made of weak and written waste. Although it is not slow, the character is poor, but it is poor, the plots are poor, there is no logic behind the phenomenon, and it is a very lazy production which, overall, it never believes in the audience that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or following the correct military method Being done The action scenes are tall and there's no real tension, villains are boring as heroes and it's made with the worst Seagull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The area changes, the quality of the sky and the film varies very suddenly because it is very clear that we are seeing the clips from the other (well) the films spread. Hell, Segal never goes anywhere near the ground. In action scenes there are shooting-outs that can be edited very badly, it is hard to say who and certainly Sigal broke the people's arms. The whole production is very cheap and lazy. <br /> <br /> IMDB considers this calculation to be a budget of about $ 12,000,000 which I think is fairly trash, i.e. where all the money went? Although the flight flight of an anti-war drown in Afghanistan seems like it is portrayed as my local wood, it was originally thrown in Romania and the Romanian country does not firmly believe in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another lazy and weakly produced action thriller from Sigal, Why I And bored?
