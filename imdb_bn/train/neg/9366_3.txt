I rent hybrid on weekends. What a disappointment! A stupid lame attempt at a television. The leadership that they got for leadership was very weak and running {{many things}, it seemed like he was eating that little sweet ... behind him! The wolf that he wore was wonderful, though I think the actor was very dependent on them, because there was nothing about his performance. The wise Native American Indian chick will be one of the toughest hard masks ever seen. Talk about a cow cow! He smiled once for the whole movie, and I think that's why he was sex. The sex scene was very hairy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The cold sharp teeth of the guy. They are not seen anywhere in the film. :(
