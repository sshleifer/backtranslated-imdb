A huge hit after the release of the Australian audience, it can be funny even today, but political turmoil and silence on it, irrational humor, it can do a harmful thing. It goes too long; Some <br /> <br /> Content may have been saved for a seagull, Barry McKenzie Holds is Has of the Lost, which needs something new in some way. Imagine, his ineffective Australian attitude is funny, but the film is annoying as a drag. Some say that crochure songs are the best bits, and they are of course original, but "ridiculous"? Barry McKenzie's Adventures will come down as a landmark in the Australian movie, but in order to avoid seeing most of the Australians as Barry McKenzie's (or in that case, Mick Dondis!) Foreign visitors, we should all do everything we need to do. . Ratings: 5/10
