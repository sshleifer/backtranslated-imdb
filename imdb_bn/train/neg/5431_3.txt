This is your standard premiere movie - some silly missions a bunch of cruel characters. In his signature climax, the whole cast of the film is coming together and some crazy muppet on secret money is fighting each other. Whether the winner is the title ticket, the diamond ferry, the black money, the return trip, etc. "Kadoku", the director is becoming frustratingly expected. Do not make me wrong; Closed and diverse movies may be, I usually enjoy a comedy. However, there have been some good humor in his earlier films (Huma and Hera Ferry is remarkable). Now, her films have become pale because she is using the same formula again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanusree Datta is looking great. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and snow is not much better. Kunal Khemu is okay, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
