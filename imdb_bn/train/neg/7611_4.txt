First look 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dew-Sidney Pollack): - I saw the DVD version "Condor 3 Days" - so the CIA drama is a very back-up movie. The original foundation of the story is that about 7 of the 8 members of the CIA research team were killed with the character of Robert Redford, codenamed = Condor, which was left. Who killed them? Redford tried to find out when trying to be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he involved Fei Duneve's character, mainly because he needed a place to hide, and then he finally helped him some time-lovingly after Dove. It is one of the few people in a story to run, but it does not have many doubts. The flat performance does not help and the finish does not seal the deal for enough viewers. Despite being a good director of Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performances, stories and performances are not what they should be, and that's why the film should not be.
