The movie is only about some of Clive's collections. It has no focus, no goal, no real message. Emotions are pushed on top and lots of stereotyping and abusive. This movie can not prevent the temptation of making drama where there is no existence. Every small exchange of words immediately becomes a lengthy, inappropriate dialogue, which is the norm of an acting class rehearsal. There is no substance in this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are) can not help, but compensate with exaggerated emotion, Urdu "increases parts". On acting, it's simply to be done. The instruction is any help here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, faked and tears are annoying. Portraying punk rock in aukugasi with the ho, peacocking and flash 90's outfits. Characters pretend without a role, detail and purpose. The location is arbitrary. It's Saturday Night Feevers with Boogie's Knights to the Good Arrow, which means the art is gone. <br /> <br /> Good DP I'll give it. <br /> <br /> Some pictures have errors.
