It looks like a movie we think we should like, but I do not. It was a very difficult way to become an 'art'. All flash, with no flash. There are some beautiful scenes in it, and some of them look nice, but drag them all together and it becomes a difficult task to sit through it. I hired it because of the flare reviews of the video document and I was a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it annoying and at some point, annoying.
