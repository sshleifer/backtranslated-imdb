Before you start, tell me that my experience of this movie may be influenced by dubbing, which I collected from other comments was something that was considered low. So, it is entirely possible that the subtitles or apparently the new DVD version will make a difference. I do not have to read similar books; I can only be familiar with another Japanese monga and maybe there is a lack of cultural background. <br /> <br /> I probably like dark faded science fiction stories. <br /> <br /> Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie. Although it became silent, it was tired only at the end of half. There are all kinds of problems; Let's start with what's probably the most serious: dialogue Characters seem to be unable to form a complete syntax; If they do not scream each other for annex, they are usually grunting monosyllables ("Kaneda!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Who?", "Grrr", etc.) It completely leans and leaves the maximum of bi-dimensional characters. It does not help at least in any way that many of them are interested to say something just a few minutes after the screen, which will develop away from the stereotypes proposed by their perspectives. <br /> <br /> Some random incremental-philosophical techniques are enhanced by technobbles, which even feel vague and vague by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it seems all weird, different bits and stock-science-ideas are thrown together randomly to pieces of any kind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Certainly that there is nothing wrong with a great bit of greatness and destruction; But in this case you ask yourself "What is the point of it, and how long does it last". The last 30-minute character development is slightly more than just making Hoots a pizza for some easy to publish from TITSUO. <br /> <br /> Similar to the last 2001 - From some of the solutions or explanations of a large string of images, the viewer feels that he is only watching the kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm certain that some things will claim this art industry; But to me it was just a lot of fantastic use of color and size. (Some of the music was quite interesting). Unfortunately it's all styles and no substances. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch an animated movie with "adult" themes intelligent? I'm sorry that you're more likely to find things like "South Park".
