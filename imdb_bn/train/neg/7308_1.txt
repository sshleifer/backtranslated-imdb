Liongate has not proven yet. Lately, every single movie has been unreal. I have tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they are joking about me repeatedly. And cabin firearms certainly have no exception. <br /> <br /> I did not pay attention to most of the movies, it was very frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Plot here Singer dead dog for some reasons. It is transmitted by a random virus, it transferring children to camps, the children die infections, the city finds out about it and kills them instead of helping them. Then the water is infected and everyone dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on this movie of mine and my friend, it is said that how much of a classmate was fatty and malicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, a random child and how clearly everyone outside the country was completely upset and hiccup. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why was the boy trying to kill and sit at their chair? That's the two parts of their plan? How nice. The best plan ever I can not believe getting a theatrical release of this movie. I could barely beat the DVD, let alone alone in the theater for one and a half hours. It's not scary, or funny, or cooler, or anything. It's just 90 minutes of waste which you can use ... I do not know, a tree or some plant. It is more productive in this piece of junk. Acting, special effects, and scripts are a joke. Never do not pick this. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever receives one of the nasty leg-shaving views among 10
