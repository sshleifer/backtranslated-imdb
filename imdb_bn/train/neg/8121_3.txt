Time is valuable. This is not a picture. I will definitely learn to ignore critics who waste small films like Fargo and this whole waste. <br /> <br /> The theater was packed and everyone went with the same reaction: What are the critics thinking about this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo hooks seemingly to find a mobile black girl and her white trash family. Drink it <br /> <br /> acting is fantastic <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, set, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above the 60-minute story. Characters shallow and intelligent. I was humiliated that the viewers were absolutely clear that these people could not think about each other; The audience was curious about the movie screen, what the characters would say later. <br /> <br /> I have more fun to do laundry.
