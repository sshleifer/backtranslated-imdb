A man discovers that his father was part of a nuclear test in 50 and he now has the power ... burned in the fire! <br /> <br /> I was really ready for this picture, looking under the great Toby Hooper and looking at the wild card Brad Dourife. Unfortunately, it does not rise above average-cum-violent power movies. Spontaneous suppression is a striking consistency behind it, unfortunately it does not rely on its potential and increases its plot to a greater extent. Special effects are not bad and help to highlight the film at the end. <br /> <br /> Cast is not bad, Darryf stole the show. <br /> <br /> Around, there is no classic but it is not the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
