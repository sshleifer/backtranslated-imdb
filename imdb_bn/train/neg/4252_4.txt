*** Probable spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw it today how was something like me, not too much, but not less. There was nothing like this though I do not think the filmmakers can create their mind about the kind of films they create. This is somewhat mysterious and very exciting at the beginning of the movie, but soon there will be a change in some ridiculous scenes - very clear scenes ... I also saw I fall asleep several times. <br /> <br /> The last thing is the most ridiculous though, almost splatters / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it does not have any good scenes, this film never gets "completely". <br /> <br /> 4/10 movie man
