Forgive me for expressing it, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are two extremes in the wide range. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars, slot comfortable in the good section. There are films on the other end of the spectrum that are not only significant by name. Occasionally, however, someone makes a real tragedy. One should be depicted as a demonstration of how horrible a film might be. A film that is bad Such a movie Maiden Voice <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship which is kidnapped by a gang of evil criminals, who also demanded ransom from the owner of an equally evil, planned ship. Of course, there are all American heroes of the board, full of screaming jaws and sculpted chests, who save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that creates a new depth. Everything is bad about it. Acting, direction and so-called plot breathing comfortably poorer. In short, it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence of no unfortunately audience. Even an American audience would be annoyed by its losses. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to write something that annoys me about this picture. However, his dumbar-dive conclusion should serve as an appropriate example of what I meant. <br /> <br /> Remember your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are standing in the open lifeboat of the calm sea. You're in company with those heroes who are holding a tick bomb. The hero said, threw the bomb to you and the diver overboard What do you want to do I do not know about you, but as far as possible I'll throw a bomb in the sea. This guy is not He looks as our hero swimming away and then he tries to disarm the result of the unfortunate (for him). Enough said. Such a death would be a significant qualification on the Darwin Awards website and it may also be appropriate conclusions in the production team's life.
