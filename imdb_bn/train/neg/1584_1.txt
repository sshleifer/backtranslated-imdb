I read people running from the legendary book as a batchman and I felt for the main character John and his family. This movie can be so much. Trouble? It was set during craze craze for big action movies. I saw the movie and the whole thing was pain. I felt nothing for the character and less for its causes. Yes it was funny (or funny) scene though I do not think it has saved the movie in my eyes. If you read this book, you can feel the fire of the clenomac and the heart of the person because he takes his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a low number. It was not less if the book did not read.
