This 30th anniversary DVD is blazing itself, but not for blading Saddles. Somewhere I did not see Mel Brook's name and I guess why he has so much knowledge to get involved with this pilot. My guides, who will get this fun. Of course, there might be a nation problem but it was not funny for me, because it is not funny. The authors did not try to be fun, just for cash to stay tied with Blazing Saddles. Do they expect this show to go for different seasons when they make this pilot? Flat out, they do not care. It was a fast cash cow, which does not thank God. I show how it could be useful only for historical purposes, or simply stupid and non-dependent Hollywood writers.
