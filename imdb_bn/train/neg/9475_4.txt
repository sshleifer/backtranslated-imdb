Beautifully photographed and played ably, usually, but writing is very slipshod. There is an incredible view that observers have no joy. For example, a young boy has a young brother, so I shouted so loudly. And "emotion-light bulb connection" seems very disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know, though. If you have some glasses and feel some nice to watch in some extraordinary humorous scenes, it's a beautiful movie. There is no big effort in the audience segment. But the Italian cinema, especially the Italian comedy, is usually such a lot better.
