What is this "Kuki Plays"? "Loony Tunes Land Laws"? The world's thinnest, most poultry actress (face more and more duck than Michelle Pfeiffer, and non-epic) has stopped her sister's butt, which will sometimes shame the Bagasse Bonnie in one of the most animated animated TV series.

This is not a Monty Python. Whatever the "new" goal of this garbage genius was to target, they failed with respect. "Alic MacKeeb" is a very commercial TV initiative, whose goal is to defame aimlessness, indifferent housewives and bilateral lawyers.
