I'm a Christian ... and I think this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the hard-core, Bible-Belt Christians are going to like this movie. The message is very in your face too. If you want to touch a broader audience, you will be way more fine. You can not ward around the father's Bible and carry it with him in every scene. Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> bad direction The absent man's expression was horrible, but it was ridiculous. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminds me of old ad wood movies: "O my God, man is missing!" Flat that scene is just stupid. Think about it: If you're wearing your relative clothes beside you, then you just do not shout "O my God, they are invisible! They are absent!" And start crying and yelling. You will first deny ... you just will not jump to that conclusion. See Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. The dog sitting on the lawn with my favorite shot is a dog's dress and a boot sitting beside it. I fell under the sofa. I started to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> The song was so bad and so confusing. It was as if the composer captured his film in his world. "Here's my chance to make a thriller", "Here's my chance!" Tell me how it will look like James Koval! A good score supports what's happening on the screen ... This film needs more under scores, but instead it was like your face. The text <br /> <br /> was soft. So Captain was the Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was bad: "You do not understand! People are missing!" Brad Johnson was ridiculous. Two stand-out performance anti-Christ and the old guy (sorry, do not remember their names) to "made" (to answer the question of "what do they think ???"), producers and filmmakers and actors confuse themselves Doing ... saying, "We're going to reach out to a wider audience" and "Brad Johnson is amazing" and "it's just like Hollywood movie" I came to the conclusion that they do not know what they are doing "hacks". <br /> <br /> I appreciate the effort. Getting a comprehensive audience message is a fantastic idea. The film is the best medium possible. Wide alert, signal, communication, passes of Christ, even look at movies like O'BroTHER, where ART THOU? The following line is the need to create films by talent and perspective. Unfortunately, it was not.
