I actually intended to watch this movie in theaters. It is actually sold. I actually went to see Solar instead, which was the worst movie ever released in 2002. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The thing seems quite good going until Jack gets skipped the city with his girlfriend Trish (Dennis Richards). This movie is too late, so they did not publish it in advance, it could be an interesting package. But they did, so did not. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is not one interesting thing about this movie; Everything is given away in preview. If you've even seen a preview, you've seen the whole movie, so you can think of just really hard to fill the gap. Visit the website, download preview, save $ 3.99. Without the soundtrack how terrible it is, the whole film does not have single wonders or wrapping. <br /> <br /> I hope that anyone who is in charge of writing soundtracks will be fired. Twice Most of it would be like the lyrics if Richard Martin and Gloria Estifan the YouTube were allowed to release and (in both cases I could hold the space-time series fabric with this opinion) had less talent and musical ability. <br/> <br/> Best Poor Performance, Scripts are the Best Offense Against Humanity, and Dennis Richards's 67% Steroophom and 33% JipLock Bag Best. John Paguchimamo (he was in pest!), When his acting ability came up on the rest of the cast, something bad happened.
