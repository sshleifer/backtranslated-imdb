This ambitious film is most likely to confuse the fans of the author / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Very good material (Altman's "Nashville," Lumet's "Network") is highly derivative, this wooden elephant takes much longer to get anywhere. Aside from the path, a misleading couple (an embarrassing musical conflict, a biblical plague) does not help. Both performances are not asymmetrical. Especially bad: William H. Messi, whose character and story are easily deleted; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing angst. How many times do we have John C. Really's Sa'd Sack Shotik ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will look enough) to see? Comes off better than Tom Cruise ?? His misogynist, foul-mouthed holy roller was rather fun. At the time of lying, the script was so loaded with "F" bombs, when they lost their influence at some point. Do not even tell that horror soundtrack, Emey Manna inspired and boring voice is full. An extended presentation of "One", which began with the beginning, took me into confusion at the beginning of the movie. I should pay attention to the handwriting of the wall and keep myself alive for three hours, by the time I used to enter the shore of hell. A redemming feature, which I have not seen in other reviews, is the best performance of this group, in the role of unknown Melora Walters Claudia, looking at the damaged Coke Fendand self-reliance. Its credibility far beyond all else. This picture took itself very seriously and did not know when it would end.
