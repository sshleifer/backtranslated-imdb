I am here reading post about Wonder Woman's Wear for TV Post. When making the film it should be specified, she was not wearing her traditional dress. The producers were actually drawn to the concept of WWW's joke book writer for the seventeenth century. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with many other posters for this movie. Snoozefest! I was a child when I appeared in ABC in 1974, so I was in the right age to commemorate a movie about the comic book hero. Yet I was so "mad" with the plot, I stopped watching three quarters of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not the right age to praise Kathy Leya! :-)
