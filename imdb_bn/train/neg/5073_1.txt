Plant plants try to pass it as a metaphor for a fairy tale with real money, then immediately start raving about animations. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An unhealthy stability to find herself on the playme, a humorous protagonist, a violent psychic later, a girl who took care of her once. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, weakerly defined. Some of the enemy fans have bought girls, even though you do not tie the characters. It seems that writers are more motivated to further strengthen the drama and complexity of this film than the motivation and personality of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last fifteen years movie minutes are being introduced in new, vain story lines. The author seriously needs to streamline his story. Perhaps he is trying to be an epic, but it was too much information for only two hours. But I can not help but it is surprising that a plot of many dimensions and letters was suitable for a TV series or graphic novel. In the last five minutes of the movie, I do not tolerate only the absolute lack of quality and start to laugh about the character, relationship, and how the whole plot is descended. I touched my partner and he started cracking, just as a young man was sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we just could not take the terrible quality of this film. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is incredible and visitors will appreciate their happy backgrounds and charming characters. Design. Animation guides you around; When you do not care about letters, it tells you how to feel.
