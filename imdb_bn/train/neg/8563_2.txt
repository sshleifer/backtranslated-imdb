This thread is like what it's titled. I only got the impression from that movie that Marley Matlin's character was always angry, so disgraced, and so kind. William Hart's character was the first date of his character where he was dancing. After all, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I fell asleep. I'll watch the movie with one intention ... to lose my problem of insomnia, because it has to keep me asleep. Have a nice dream
