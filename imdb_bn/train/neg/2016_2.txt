***** Alert: Spyware may have been ********* My huge problem with this movie is completely self-centered and eating self-adultery wife !! One night he stood with a thin psycho after being stalked by him. He constantly called him and threatened him and even sent a video of his night together. She is weird crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that he only thinks he is dangerous for him (and his secret disclosure). She was not worried about her husband for a second! He seems to be in danger from this psychologist perhaps for a moment ?? As soon as she realized how she was mentally, it does not matter if her husband should be careful. Maybe there was not a movie, but there really was no one so what the difference is.
