Madison County Bridge is a good version of this story. I think the end of this movie is not sensitively handled like the original English film. This movie is very Indianized, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in the movie when the hero dies, you will love this movie, on the other hand if you feel like a warrior and cry in life, not ending. But overall it is a very good thing that is managed for Indian conditions. Nevertheless, a caring wife and mother were as good. Everyone plays well.
