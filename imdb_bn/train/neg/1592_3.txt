This sudsy maternity ward climbed the story drama, set it to a special ward for "hard case". Loretta Young's main story; He is on holiday from the long prison extended for murder. Do doctors save their child at the expense of their life, or vice versa? Melodrama and feelings are dominant, and they say honestly, at least not least. For example, to remove just things, this hospital has a psycho ward beside the maternity ward and a woman roams to steal children with violent pregnancy. <br /> <br /> Just enough smile and annoying it can be recognized as Warrenor's film, mostly from Glenda Frarell, who sings gin from his hot water bottle, when he waits for jeans at his jeans, then he sells Now finds out the law against it. An example of his repartee: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be alert." Alain McMahon is certainly amazingly the chief nurse, but do not expect him to give a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is to make someone feel angry. Even if given explicit limitation, this film should be better than that.
