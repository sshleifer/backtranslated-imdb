The directors have instructed to focus on his close-up response instead of the guest's face, because what can be said about the approach, what do the opeas say? <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah It's always about Oprah <br /> <br /> Okay - Sorry for me, I was very poor. Feel the pain of my war with my weight. I feel hurt when I'm turned from a fancy shop after they have already closed. Feel good to buy my magazines and books. Feel good for my success.

Feel good to make me rich without faith. <br /> <br /> My explanation of his point of view: You are in trouble of all kinds of visitors and need my daily advice. I have all the answers in my life, though I have no match for you. I did not marry or I do not even want to be. I did not raise a family - but I know all about it.

He was just a very lucky overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donohue's style and called it in his own name. It was exactly how he was able to stay in the right place at the right time and to suck up the right demographic. <br /> <br /> <br /> This era is baron, and it makes me amazed that people can not face it. <br /> <br /> So ladies and ladies, boys and girls, and you too, if you can measure the disturbing arrogance through the door - this path is now a great curse ...
