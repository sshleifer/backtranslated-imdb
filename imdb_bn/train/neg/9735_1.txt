As I tried, I could have sat with this boring mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as lead and all supportive shields were just slightly worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just ridiculous, from stunning performances to ridiculous FX until the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Time wasted; Do not disturb. Root canal therapy will be more enjoyable. Bamboo rocks below the nails will be much more beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you watch a Uwe ball movie it will be a little worse. To get the idea?
