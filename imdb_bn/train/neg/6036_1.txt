It seems to be acting in an unknown cast, that this "film" still surprised me with another cheap slicker flick which was released. I especially have no problem with fear and slasher flicks, in fact they are my favorites. But when they do this BAD, they really take a monkey and it does not surprise you that this trend is so difficult. The story has been conceived suddenly and without imagination, people are being hanged in a cabin and this zombie / ghost man hacked. It's not the most suckable story, its abusive act and dialage, home direction, and a horror soundtrack. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and the creation of some incredibly lazy film - these bodies are out in clear daylight but still we want to believe in the night? What is the manager thinking about this step? What, he had only one day in these pictures? Was he afraid of darkness? (Even though he is walking around the sunny sunshine with a tower, he looks like his pitch black, though acting) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side to the actors seems like a person working in local supermarkets. So at least they could probably escape without landing this film. I'm sure that "teenager" plays a bingo down local pub - but he is 40-45. However, good for a smile but only in the film and other waste of time.
