Jason Lee does her best to bring fun to a harmless situation, but the film simply fails to establish a connection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Julia Styles's character is shining and cousin becoming sexy. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's why and CEMA Blair's character should be thrown in the opposite way. (Salma Blair seems more joyous than Julius) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is probably a The real real situation (which is not covered by your pants on your graduation) is your cousin who fails to make a promise. <br /> <br /> Some laughs are sure and cast (even if they make a mistake) do their best with sub-grade elements that do not exceed its unreasonable issues. So instead of getting a successful round fest (i.e. the House House or American Pie), we are kept in the middle part of some part and a bit stupid (Alta Metables 2 or something).
