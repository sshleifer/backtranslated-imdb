To cover the budget deficit, the film is dark and visually blurred, often used in low-budget horror movies, but it takes it a long way. It is very shining and pink (and almost done almost completely for boot), which you often see on the black screen (though probably the bad video transfer can do something with it). The best words to describe the plot of the film Alice, "Mourki" Filmmakers throw different (and unreasonable) horror ideas without any logical thinking and half feel that they abandon their efforts to create a horror movie. You know it when you see characters that may be in danger of death (or, some shows even even dead). (* 1/2)
