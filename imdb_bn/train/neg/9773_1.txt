When it was released, I thought it was one of the most difficult movies ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scarcus and some other filmmakers like him, the main lines have been so bad, linguistically, more than that ... but this is a great barbaric attack in his ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this is ridiculous. In just the first six minutes, I used to use half-dozen abuse as well as an unspecified number of f-sounds in the name of the Lord. I wonder how many people are watching this theater in 1990? I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> <br /> From this image, Stephen Lang has improved his image. It seems, at least in the "Gods and Generals", the Godly "Stonewall" Jackson playing. Here's the reverse of Lang's role: perhaps the worst trash person in the film and a character falling in love with a transvestite at the end of the movie. Some of the adjectives used to describe this story - even some Liberal critics - are worse than the novels, depressing, depressing. <br /> <br /> Some of the adjectives used to describe this story are depressed, depressing, semi-pornographic, and annoying. Of course, some well-known critics, all extreme Lib, appreciate the film. However, they were the only ones. Most of the critics were hateful, as well as almost all the moneylenders. It is incredible that anyone can appreciate such dirty praise and garbage. <br /> <br /> Trust me about this: There is no good, preferred character in this whole film. This is an average, sick movie: "The worst of the modern era". In other words, you are not able to see child abuse, drug abuse, tin prostitution, persistent, even two or three hours but torture and not just ordinary people. No thanks.
