To bring Asian films to America in the recent movement, this is the last film to be released here. Due to being a big fan of Asian filmmakers of all genres, I was browsing the net and came back to Swan to republish in the US market so I decided to hire it at the local video store beforehand. <<br /> <br /> Trust me ... The incredible way of action, the Crowking Tiger and the Iron Man, have completely flown the film out of water. Jat Lee will fall asleep watching the sequence of war. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better with Jackie Chan Flick! <br /> <br /> Moreover ... you think you'll see a martial arts. The girl has been painful for her parents' death, but the dream !!! In the middle of this film is a good hour dialogue, absence of idle, lack of deprivation of an incisive plot, in most cases we are being exposed, there is nothing to be involved with. His relationship with him and his relationship with the boy is even more, and the boy is with his conspiracy group, in which the producer / director is dedicated to elaborating at any time, and still dedicating a part of the film by dragging this picture. If they can only spend full hours and develop a story through another film and concentrate on the approach of martial arts, then it gets better. <br /> <br /> I do not really believe the meaning of Iron Monkey's dancer, the sequence of actions in the princess blade did not. I used to be quite humiliating for the slow pace of speeding up the killer's physical intensity and the frequent use of camera changes. I just bought it. <br /> <br /> Please do not warn you to waste your time / money with this movie. The premiere is frustrating, and the trailer can lure you too, but I'm positive that this film is not suitable for the public (probably in Japan but not in the state) and the worst movie in the state of Asia will be art.
