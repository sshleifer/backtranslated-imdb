After reading a comment on Sydney Pottier's best film, I had to write a review of this movie. After a decade of acting in the film, Pierre came back and he is here clearly cactical. His 11 pictures are mentioned in Wikipedia and do not include it. Five of his films are on the list of AFI's Top 100 Inspirational Movies, but it is not included yet. Before crossing the Canadian border, Berena and Poitiers, Ruby and City Slicker set out to find a dangerous psychopath. Some of the comedians' attempts in this film have clearly failed, and birnjas and potier ties were increasingly and painful (not entirely helped by extraordinary scripts). Curti Eli (as hostage) was unused, and almost completely ignored when she was on screen. Some doubts are made, for example, when you want to try and guess that 5 male killers of fishing trip (all their type-cast villains) I understand that this is the full application to most fans. I said who it was and I was not really trying. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Benzaro, see Sniper (1993), you can even see Struggle for his staff. It's a lot better. I will ask everyone to kill everyone by killing 3/6. It's not brave, and it's very easy for me.
