This complete, shameless, silly, selfless, and stupid film is not the final proof that the world Danny Boyle and his post-"tracing" movies may be forgotten: "The Beach" already takes care of it. This low budget curiosity was only for those of them who started their well-being, but to be safe between drugs, warmth, pride, self-confusion, bad management, or which was once a committed death of the committed director. /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> duo - which they are. One of their friends - even a large illiterate - destroyed a store window and became a director by stealing a video camera, through which he knows the movies in their "action" and then show tape of some musicians, who are actually interested in garbage. Now, I know that in recent years the UK has left incredible junk, but it's ridiculous; Music makes Oasis feel like Beatles. During the recording of the studio, two-strumpet - by changing each song and accepting exclamation, music fans will say that they will accept or leave, and they oddly accept it. Not only the total and uneven trash of music, but its "performers" are anti-social; These NEWCOMERS are supposed to make the shot call. It's just too stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue stops and does not go anywhere, and there is no point in this angry-to-bech story and there is no sense. It seems to be improvised often - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete fool. Watch this little piece of trash so bad to see. Ecclestone's I.Q. Also will be asked to agree to this dirty part. Anyone who has made this Â£ 1000 copper out of it should leave the film business before ending their own underwear in street corners.
