Yet another movie about a group of at least intelligent people who stroll around their original travel route for a small cut or in this case, to see a run-down side show attraction. Expected results are not good at all, because this particular side of the room was a few years ago, a bunch of crazy, reproduced residents fleeing from prison inmates, Dad, who is apparently a professional photographer, just stopped and photographed the place, only to find it still living. Only a few members of the family roam around for different scars. Van Tayer explodes (Surprise!), They are thinking of finding shelters and finding shelters nearby to find them, which only live by the fires (surprise!). <br /> <br /> This image is played as expected, stalked with family and killed by freaks. Some are fighting in some parts of the family, but it is probably the worst scenes in this film, because they have been badly executed. There is no visible value here, unless you count the inappropriate soundtrack of a scene that is played during a specific scene that completely destroys the atmosphere and mood of the film. As far as acting is bad, I have seen a lot of time by all those involved (when your cast is played with Cast of "Camp Blood") it is very bad.) Special effects should be frustrating and ending. <br /> <br /> However, all Despite the negative, I've enjoyed a bit of this picture. It certainly has a "so bad it's good" VB. I've made it through the movie and I'm glad to be happy even after the humorous acting, the terrible acting and the special effects of Chess. The last left seems to me to be cheated and angry, especially because this movie is not as good as starting and the last image is uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> At the bottom line, I can list countless films that you saw if you have seen it. The difference is that most of its images are good. Although not completely waste, this picture is not quite bad and distant horror. <br /> <br /> My grade: D.
