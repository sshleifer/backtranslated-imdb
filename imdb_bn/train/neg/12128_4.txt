If half of the footage of this film sounds strange, it means that you are looking at this poor Italian culture cats too much! You see, the infamous angel Lucio Flori did not make the film, he also accepted the freedom to use the cat's worst toxic killing (and more easily found) in his brain. In the next picture of Phoolsi, a prostitute has been brutally eliminated with excellence and before that some other killings and sludge moments have started. Andrea Bianchi's "Massachacare" has unfortunately failed as a giello, since a movie-crew is a compulsory and suspicious to find terrorist killers in a scary movie shooting, but it's still a great entertainment if you're cheaper. The underlying script introduces a complete bunch of all the potentially modest ones who are overwhelming, but comes up with red colored Biachi comes up and you can almost point out the killer immediately. What is left to enjoy is the real rogue make-up effect and the officially horror performance performance. Whenever there is no bleeding on the screen for the first and second murders, "genocide" is slow and almost helpless with its insane dialogues and completely obscures the photography. Fortunately, in the second half, the women are jumping on the yatra and the rusty has been spilled repeatedly by the spoiled spike. The use of music shit and filming position is very unimaginable. My advice would be to leave this puppy and go directly to "cat in the bits". That's all the great moment of "genocide", and then some features.
