The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and saw it several times. And even though I know that the seagulls are not generally good as original, but I certainly did not expect such bombs. The romance was flat, sight gags were not just old, spoken humor. This has not been the worst movie I've ever seen but it comes off.
