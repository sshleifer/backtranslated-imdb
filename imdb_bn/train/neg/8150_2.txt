If you want a senseless and reasonable entertaining hour or so, then it's ok to see it. It's not really that bad at all. Yes, I've got more laptops rational than I have described here and can pay people's patience - like myself, I have to admit - who are interested to throw things on TV in the show, but at least it's funny. Just because it's not always funny, there's no need to reduce it. <br /> <br /> However, if you read the book - or any other book in Brumymy - then you probably better avoid it. I read them all and when I first saw this movie, I despised it. I've trashed it in great detail and on other sites. The TV plot is not relevant to the reality of the book anyway and is only dissatisfied and many trusted (and with confession) dissatisfaction with Brooklya's fans. <br /> <br /> Best advice ..? See this, then read the book and only when you compare and submit your judgment.
