It was really that bad. The small poor "Dirty Dozen" TV series that has played Ben Morphi equally (often cheaper in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was ashamed. For the cast members of this movie - and especially for the Tele-Savalas. He was very fertile and fertile for the role (he made 70 of the time he made this trunk), and this critic who is parallel to Telecom with this Greek and John Wayne in most of the money in "Green Bear". <Br /> <br /> Other critics have told many ridiculous haluders that this crime is against celluloid, so I will not repeat them here. But I'll add that I'm surprised that nobody has yet mentioned the title of the ridiculously small title that Savalas wear on her big, lean heads. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that this movie has received a high rating of 4.7 in IMDB. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" across the board right. If you want a good example of hanging on a franchisee death, it's a bad idea (basically 20-plus years later) - nothing more than "Dirty Dozen - The Deadly Mission". <br /> <br /> - Awful - to avoid !!!!
