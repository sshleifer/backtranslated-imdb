Warning: There are reviews of Splilides in the study <br /> <br /> There is a dark, lively, controversial independent film in 60 seconds where there is a parallel universe. Unfortunately this level is ... Nicholas Cage acting is a vibrant, vacuum, testosterone-fuel morph. <br /> <br /> The reasons are not really valuable, there are four days for him and his large chunks to steal fifty expensive cars, of which there is only one alarm. This guy has a funny-looking ear, who is willing to be a new superman; A man operating in the X-file; A former professional footballer and two tokens black men <br /> <br /> Their enemies are police, rival car thief and cracker Bilbo, its Manchester pronunciation has evidently spread and spread to American audiences, which is now used in this kind of thing, from Daphne in Frasier. Angelina Jolio, who does not get any character; Save a receptacle to men's sexual desires. He and Cage are supposed to be old fire, which is strange, because they never get anything in the normal conversation between all movies of the 135 meter running time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so poor that anyone has a "moment" drama accentuuates in a hurricane "passion" in the background. Winnie Jones (who is famous for his famous Paul Gasgione "hand ball" maneuver and quite apt to repeat) gets only one line; Because it was impossible to talk about an integral part of the plot, but after the silence of the film's suspicious morality, his silence was fun after expressing it. In the complaint. From the London drill "Land Island" I always have her "not-quite-acting-but-it-done" after struggling through London drills with it. My ribs, you can imagine, was well and really tickled. <br /> <br /> In reality, the most adoption aspect of humor, two token black letters from stupid comedy police. This holds the biggest concepts of Hollywood; Why can not such a black man appear in a major motion picture to become constantly aware of the skin's voice, and does it endlessly? During adolescence, who said about the whole period of waking up like a whole age, he said: "Our black people do not like cold ... we are tropical people." Then he goes on expressing a joint smoker and a stimulus to watch the route. She must be the image of black people, but how fun is it? His old opponent can not speak without mentioning himself, and consequently his color, third person. "My black ass" is this, that is, "my black ass". Anyone who knows black people who actually speak? Not worried. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The surrounding system distinguishes even two degrees so that it can sound like two different movies running together. There is no background music concept here, it is a contemporary equivalent to try to watch a movie and someone behind the movie has become a full blast of his stereo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is true that its prediction, idle and idiomatic, with the least effort to build it. Apparently box office prospect is enough down for this movie. After a few years of forced junk junk, the general public started to wake it up.
