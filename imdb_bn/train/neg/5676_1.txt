This film shows a live animal poisonous clip of an animal hacked by a mosquito, and its skin is gone. I know these terrible things happen in the world, but I'm seeing movies at the moment that what I see is not actually happening on screen. These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show some people who are involved in helping other people in certain organizations to do terrible things. <br /> <br /> It should be banned and destroyed. I've contacted Netflix and other organizations to help stop this movie from the market !! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The person who creates this movie needs mental help.
