The world or even then, I have no idea that perhaps Sam Morovich could have believed that it could be an effective project. Ben and Arthur are one of the worst movies ever made. Actually, I do not see any reason why it should not be at the bottom 100 # 1. Although I did not see it, for example, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (# 5 on this publication), I guess it would be better to think that this film is very good because of this huge wound, because at least children Geniuses 2 has been professionally created. Conversely, everything, and I want to say everything, this movie is completely unusual. <br /> <br /> This image is called Christian Wright's supposedly intriguing conflict and hate for contradiction. And I emphasize "purpose." It completely and completely fails at its purpose, it leaves an ugly stain. Instead of creating a compulsory and realistic portrait of the same-sex couples struggle against society, it is largely opposed, it creates tired, cross-composed pieces of each group. The couple named Ben and Arthur are described as two crude, sexually hungry, and frustrated romantic cardboard cutouts when they are married while changing the law to change the law. This is Ben's brother Victor, who is a Christian minister who, like all Christians (this movie believed us), met with the opposition, he was loud, Priyanka, stupid and violent. He tried to kill Ben and Arthur, after being cooperated with him, he was expelled from the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think it's awesome (it), you have not seen it all. <br /> <br /> This actor (?) here is narrating a Youtube home comedy video that completely handles any void of credibility in this movie. But Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brand could not even save this clanker as the title character, because the matter of the whole hilarious and humorous dialogue filled up in every minute of the film is still there. Each view has at least one painful or misplaced quote. For example, in one case, Victor tried to complain about the alleged brotherhood or nepotism because of his brother's homosexuality. But instead of expressing this idea explicitly, he threw a stupid, completely confusing, shiny word, "You know, I never got a brother or a niece, all right, because you're so *** **** /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know it is not the dark knight, but amateur filmmakers should know some basics about the special effects and editing. For example, red cake g The six dot is not enough for realistic bullet wounds, people do not teleport across a room in. And the objects are shot when shot! <br /> <br /> Do not waste money on Ben and Arthur 7. I'm 7, 17, Or 107 does not care for you.I do not care if you're gay, straight, bi, or reluctant.I do not care if you're just "weird". I do not care what suppressive causes may be tempting to buy this beef-hip. Stay here The ability to use the release as phrisabi ccitrera quality.
