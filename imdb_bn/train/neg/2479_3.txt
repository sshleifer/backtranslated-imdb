I have learned about Windiego in Alinae Schwart's "Dreadful Story" books several years ago: According to the story, Windie - after your name calling in the air - sinks along with you and then drags you into the sky and pulverizes you. It sounds like a fantastic bizarre idea, Shawwatz's story turns it into a fairly coherent concept. <br /> <br /> No movie "Wendigo" It basically has every horrible flick clich: The family comes into a new home and strange things happen, everyone who damages them, asks them, and everyone can hear the old Indian well. I have seen this thing so many times that I do not want to count anyone. <br /> <br /> However, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Eric Poul Sullivan (Deli "Middle Mal A Malcolm")
