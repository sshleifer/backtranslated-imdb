MaMesty is a low-budget movie that tells the story of Modie Blaise's source. The movie is not terrible. It was not just my expectation or expectation. Although I was aware of the character of Modie Blais for several years, I'm not much familiar with comic stripes or graphic novels, so I'm coming out as something out of this movie. That may be the reason for my frustration. I had more action and more comedy hopes. Film-driven dialogue I think I was looking for something with a little camp value. As it is, my name is Moddie, a serious serious film. Very little, if any, "light" moment. Acting, at least Alexander Staden, is acceptable but nothing is outstanding. Others have commented, he appears somewhat helpless to be completely credible in the role of title. One of the weakest points in the Modesty movie is the action scene of my name. <br /> <br /> I hope Quinton Tantino will go ahead and spread the rumor of a big budget film based on the character of Moddie Blaise. I have many possibilities in firm faith and I am looking forward to it too.
