Why would anyone want to see this? If it was a movie posted on YouTube by a teenager, I congratulated the teenager on his mother's video camera. I might be congratulating his family and friends for performing a good job. Sadly, it was created by a very experienced filmmaker and apparently, professional actor - it created a very, very sad film. Sorry ... and very kind, actually. As I said, it made the video visible. It describes and played that just shout "unprofessionals" - how could this be?! The film is filled with dead bodies and lots of blood. Normally it will completely turn me off, because I hate horribly violent movies and do not like to see all of them. However, it is not that realistic, it is given bearable. However, I must warn you that few scenes are still quite annoying. For example, the kids throw a radio in a lady's tub and the scene with her naked and fried observer is quite bad. There are also scenes where you can listen to the thoughts of psychologists, because they are fantastic about killing women. With a level of misogyny that is quite awful. Those who wrote it are quite sick - like killing women, for our enjoyment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Black Hood without! They are speaking proudly, they said about the killings they have committed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know why - perhaps because they have such shit Has stopped it from. And, again, you have seen and heard the thoughts and actions of an insane German-looking man, since he searches for people and kills them. However, to consider the film, which I should guess is professional actor, I wondered why so many people who were elected were definitely German. Although they tried to act like Americans and the film was supposed to be from California, but these are strict. Perhaps the German audience saw this and was surprised to see how it is "realistic", but these Americans are not their fellow Americans for Americans in America! Think of a Russian assassin (who was never a prisoner), I thought why would anyone want to create a "fan film" for the illness? I mean ... this picture was meant as a snack film for camouflage? I can not see anyone else just want to see this or enjoy it. Actually, I wonder who would motivate anyone to create such stupid and offensive movies? In the 100 list below the IMDb is unable and eligible.
