Margaret Lawrence probably did not intend to be accepted for a movie of his novels, leave Stone Engel alone. As a character of Hagar, who always challenges the social ideals (Gainsay courage, someone?), And the process ultimately sacrificing its humanity. The symbol of the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) is a constant reminder of the old and new struggle and the killer along the path (so to speak). <br /> <br /> Although the film is reasonably trusted in favor of the book's plot (though it is not a story-story about a story, is not it?), I think it missed the point of keeping the film's spirit. Hagar's disobedience (for the opponent) was not there. Bram may be far more filmy than illustrated, and Hagar's father can be more "traditionally" played, so to say. The filmmaker insisted on the strong screenplay, the film would take the direct point of the house. <br /> <br /> Why can we see cell phones, organic production and other modernization along with the same vein? We're trying to make some points to create some points (eg, Muslim friends and natives). Hajr and co. The book is politically correct, so why should we see it in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget campaign, but it seems to throw it down as an excuse to send colonial political-correct messages to novels (and movies) entirely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> has the audience. It seems that we have seen the nasty men as clever and loving. Why should Hagar smile towards her tantrums? I suspected Magara Lawrence wanted to laugh with her readers, or Hagar. These people are full of frustrated and angst, and all of what we do is their smile. I do not think that Hajar and other people have judged him.
