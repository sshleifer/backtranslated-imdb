Why can not such a woman be a strong character in a movie like a sleeping lady? In this movie, Campaign Director White House dreamed of Tom Celik's leader. She can think about everything. Then why was there any relation with him on earth? It has added nothing to the plot and only successful women have been condemned. The only prize was that "we all have slept with your husband" <br /> <br /> Also, did the people who made this movie see the national conventions that they made fools? Vocationalization among the two major political conferences only shows their total ignorance of nomination and election process.
