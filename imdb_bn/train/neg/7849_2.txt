Last year, the film was uploaded by the army to reconstruct the electronic surveillance equipment in the desert, where the first film was attacked. The crew was not killed before a group of soldiers in the trainer's exercise, no one was found. You can fill the rest. <br /> <br /> This is an almost crazy picture. None of its performance is in the camera, no one behind the camera. This is a movie that was made for money and nothing else. It should have worked at some level, it could be a terrible southern consolation (where national guardians tortured some broker), but instead it is nothing. In large part you can blame the script, which is incredibly written by Wesley Crayven, which hits the same goals repeatedly. In order to eliminate any neutral tension in a scenario, the instruction is relentless and the setup of sequences involves such a lack of lack. [<br /> <br /> It's not bad, but rather poorly made and dull. Let me keep my feelings in context: Because I saw this movie because of the local movie because the film was inclined towards the last mm instead of the kids and I wanted to see why crying? Many common - he sarcastically says). I'm sure that this movie will only be afraid of those who end Mummy.
