One of the most annoying slashers. If you can even call it. I do not want to see it, even if it's the end of any kind of movie, it's completely similar. You are actually seeing a small group of middle-aged people in the woods that are really intolerable. They made such a movie for teenagers, so when they were actually aiming for this sleeping festival? My favorite part of this movie is the cover art, and this is the only reason I chose to find this movie, which was to be part of a suspense classic 50 movie pack. And after watching these 50 pack films, it should be understood somewhere else. So if you are in the mood for a decent slashher in the jungle, I recommend just before Dawn and Final Terror.
