A top contender for the worst film ever made. Looks like there is IQ of Joan Pakula. Less than one of its 3 writers and directors. Screenplay will not pass a high school writing class; "Joke" is young; The idea is corny This actor was definitely disappointed for the work. I'm in the end, I do not see how bad it is. Did it Life is too small to spend any part of watching this movie.
