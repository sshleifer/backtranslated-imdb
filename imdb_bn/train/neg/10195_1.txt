The author / director of this photo does not know anything about the film. I think the DPT of this project has been built and replaced with a monkey, because every look was too dark or there was a hot spot in the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrifying, the letters were very dimensional. For some it has been said that this film is made for poker fans and not for movie fans, who is kidding his soul (it was probably the writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even people in your money hate this project. To go into a casino and play a few hands does not give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day work. And if it is playing poker, then you must hit.
