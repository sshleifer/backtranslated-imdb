Because others have gone through the problem of plugging the plot, I want to mention some points about this movie. May be spoilers here; I'm not careful enough to filter them. <br /> <br /> - In a low budget movie, the animal design was great. It's great to see a great-to-video horror movie, which is not wasted with the terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital film is grainy in most places, and it is most significant in the strong white halls of shelters. <br /> <br /> - The design of diverse dialogue suppresses parts of this film, any change in time passage. I understand that the director is trying to emulate dementia, but it will take time to take effect for effective time flow. For example, it seems only amateur. <br /> <br /> - Plot Twists are numerous but consistently expected. I had no doubt in my mind about the identity of looted culturists, or some of the long march-bad-trump-good development will end. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like quibbling, but this photo letter is reliably unable to utilize any kind of common sense. After all, the regulatory commissions will be on a mental health center, which declares death of cardiac arrest-sent deaths to all patients and employees alone. Why the Head Psychologist will be able to do autopsy? Why did this impressive ability, or the strange choice of his religion, be a plot point in his role? What's the background Do we have to take care of anyone? And just as important as those who go to the place of their right mind, look at everything that is so terribly wrong with them, and then concludes that it was still a good place to follow a residence? This image even does not respect its characters enough for the convenience of suspecting her intelligence. <br /> <br /> The following line: See the Wicker Man instead.
