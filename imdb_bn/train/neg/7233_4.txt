I kind of feel like a genius; I think I have seen through this fake photo only one. I have seen it once, once commented, and I see myself being annoyed with close closures, the screen is always black and worse, I think that the film never resolves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he did not feel the peace in a city that caused him so much sorrow, or with himself. That and he was an idiot. It was not commented by Peter Cowie, which explains the only movie but came from the book, I would not be able to stomach it. I enjoy the French movie, but it was one that was totally stupid. <br /> <br /> The Country Priest Diary is depicted in beautiful black and white photography, but alone this can not save the deadly lazy Tripe. After the extreme close-up scene, the scene does not create interesting or relevant stories where the characters do not cut the camera and do not go to black out. This film has become a classic, it is about making fooling the mind: It reminds me of the new clothes of Emperor. Yes, the performance of Cloud Ladu is heartfelt and very excited, if you are sorry, then I feel left out of this picture because it is a poor impression of Catholic priesthood, which is an ignorant and vivid organization of corruption. The victory of young priests on the glory of mass uprising is a weak scene, but 90% of the movie will leave you with liberal self-confidence and a sorry idea of ​​the young pastor with a window. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the movie. Well, the English subtitles are often seen / read and the text is so fast that I could not read (and I'm not particularly slow reader - I've just finished Dostoyevsky within 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this image. I tried everything "selected" by collecting the criteria, and I still can not see why such a lot of critical criticism. However, I was busy with this whole two hour film to feel some sympathy for the original character, and it has never been implemented. He just likes a victim than a warrior. And for that, I say it stunk.
