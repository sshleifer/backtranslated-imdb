What i just saw I spent 90 minutes of my precious life which I have ever seen, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A serial killer clown idea is actually quite scary that many people are scared of the storm ... but this 300-pound nursery rimming keiller tears make the reading type a mockery. I'm still wondering how Character Mark can not escape from the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he'll finally be tired. The whole end came up to me and literally loudly said, "What did I see?" Apparently Brandon Dennis's cousin ... and he got it in the middle of the movie which means that he had sex with his cousin ... yes, some people want to see * shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found quite laughably was that the first scene where the scene hit a woman and she says, "What do you do?" Well, what do you think he did? The last thing that was stupid was fun, the main character of a second pushed Hit Hicker and told his AC * nt and after 5 minutes he said that violence is not helping anybody .... the author of the script gave the line to the wrong person? <br /> <br /> This movie does not understand in any way. <br /> <br /> The movie was a low budget budget that I bought (all 3.99) and there was no entertainment besides sex scenes. I was surprised that the fat shirt did not join the belly, okay. I hope the film may have some entertainment pricing like other B movies, but I was wrong. It's not even valuable to see that this is a trash piece. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 1
