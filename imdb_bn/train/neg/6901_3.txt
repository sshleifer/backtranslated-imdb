What I can say for this uninterrupted local "comedy" production is the most positive thing that is unreasonable. In fact, it is so surprising that it is surprising that how many people have been re-written by the committee went completely out of personality. It is not malicious, it is not entertaining, it is not insightful and it is not compelling. It is only a tragedy, laughable, the progress of the four people who have to change their way - and their attitude towards women - will be allowed to participate in their best friend's wedding ceremony. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Despite this, NZ has got ten nominations (Yes 10). Recently rewards. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, nobody understood and it won no one.
