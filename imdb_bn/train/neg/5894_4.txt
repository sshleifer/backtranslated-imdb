How many centuries will be passed until Japanese / Asian horror films are long-haired ghosts-women discarded? Surely, they were able to rob "Ringguns" a million times and often it worked well - which shows that the basicity is not a requirement of the horror genre (or can I be very unusual and easily happy?). However, this time around I was a bit unstable, a bit bored. This is not a bad film, it should be at least half-hour-long with at least 110 minutes in length. Compared to other Japanese horror films, there is a lack of OMC atmosphere and tension. Plus, the end is confusing: it does not understand any sense. As ring-tone: Mike came with a tone which is more effective than the smallest thing. Although it played a dozen times even I could not remember it - how horrible it was. According to Mrik, it is a matter of a commercial venture for him, so if someone thinks they have got "spoiled questions" or "audition" kind of distortion, they are wasting their time.
