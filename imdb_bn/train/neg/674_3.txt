I was known to sleep during filming, but it is generally very tired, warm and comfortable due to the combination of things that are comfortable and feeding plenty. But on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The development of the plot was constant. Continuous slow and annoying The events began to happen, but they did not have any reason or explain why. I admit, I may have missed the part of the film, but I have seen most of it, and everything has come into my own hands without any worries. I can recommend all this film.
