The comedy center has the practice of setting up a great program at times - Chapel shows, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then some people Stella, Dr. Catsz loves or hates. Then there are some defenders who have their protector but they are simply terrible - Mensia, and now Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This show is self-centered by Silverman, which may be fun (Colbert Report) but can be awesome (Mensia's mind). Anyone who believes next to it should be disappointed. This show is a sitcom and a parody of society, a program so stupid it is to lose yourself in its ignorance and it is not easy fun. Farting a woman has been done in comedy many times, because it is not something that's normal. We do not need 25 minutes. When a criminal gets submerged by a joke, it only loses its appeal - we have seen J and Silent Bob Streei, the women were not too hot, and the whole scene was even more stupid, it made it even better. But the comparison of this show was nothing more than Stella, Stella, which is an illogical comedy fun. It was well played, and I guess, a bit more of a fantastical realistic view. <br /> <br /> Some reviews are so negative (I am very suspicious of critical acclaim but do not debate fan feedback) The amount of advertisements on this show, through many programs, is that many unreasonable advertisements overtake advertisements for other programs. Many people think that Sarah Silverman has a career, and if the good show is canceled then others are still bitter. This show could not immediately make the pilot stage ever before. More commitments back to the norm, yet this show makes more. And as far as the critics are correct, the more publicly banned them, the situation is very high. Last I checked, Britney Spears got very good reviews. Take this comparison but you want me to accuse someone of IMDB for not being interested in this shot.
