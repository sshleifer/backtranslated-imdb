Although Floch has played some of the best works of Richard Gere and some good shots that return something in Lamb's days, the film extends credibility on breaking points and destroys itself against a plot that really does not go anywhere. <<br /> <br /> The movie is about Irland Badge (C) who works for the Security Department and is preparing to retire. His replacement at his office, Allison Lori (Clare Dans, Stardust), who quickly discovered that Bébéz was obsessed with his job. And that's not really fun at work. She surveys hundreds of sex workers in her jurisdiction parole. Alison Criminals went to Iroll on a lot of calls to check her "feathers" and learned that she desperately needed retirement. But even if he is not in his way, his job is good. He taunts sex hunters and even has physical conflicts with them. Errol supports his actions by making these deviants' pasts up. This "good reasoning" that challenges the audience at some level, shows us how severely deadly and how to communicate with him (by being very close to his work). <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl is missing in the "area" of Irol, she immediately concludes that her feather was kidnapped by her. But how can she know? Is Errol that good in his work? Allison challenged him and Irroll returned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll give credit to Richard Gere, however , Who very well plays the Iral character. Leisure batting Worried about everyone around her feathers. He hates those who are responsible for the supervision. He hates with himself for having something to do There is quite a change in character illustration for Gere. But there is nothing beyond that. Some of the sets are OK (dark and dangerous) but there are many other problems as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the first movie is a need of volatility while watching the movie. But that's the suspension limit. Those who push the biggest against the limit destroy the crime scene very important. Some meritorious as Erroll know that a body will not be a huge non-existent. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving the evidence. After crossing it, the film finally hit. <br /> <br /> We have never seen the character of Clear Dances, Alison, the other harmful part of this film. He almost fell off the road at the end of the movie and we never hide what his motive might be: will he stay or go away? If he had lived, would he end like Iroll? This is not a horror movie because it touches some uncomfortable moral grounds, but the story needs to be tightened overall.
