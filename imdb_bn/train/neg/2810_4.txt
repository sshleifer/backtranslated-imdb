I'm scared of many female voters who give a better sign to this film. My thinking about this movie was that the target audience is adult and male. Brutal and oppressed women, cruel retaliation and high body computation are common elements, introduced by Spaghetti Subgen in the history of the film. DJNG Rip Offs opening and hands-down. The shooter though lack of style, such as Jango Score, acting and cinematography are always intermediary but if you look for the above mentioned elements, you are in the right place. And actors do not have an Italian agent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
