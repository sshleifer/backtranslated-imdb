what happened? The 'doubt' was so much more likely to be a brilliant film - but instead it was blurred with a dragging plain plot line that would stop me from watching. The film was only going to be the portrait of Murray Strip, no dubbit was eligible for the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of its best performances, yet he has given us a strong and true character that has emerged from the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even the brightness of screen legends can not escape the film from the hills below. Since the beginning of the annoying, which did not have any power or punch - less than firm beliefs, the film was really frustrating - especially it provided so much potential through its promotions and trailers. Apparently, the director had problems with simplicity and he ended up with an annoying film, which dragged for a long time, not too much talk and adequate steps. <br /> <br /> Another was less than the Oscar nomination. Although Philipp Simmur Hoffman gave a good performance, the Oscars were not worthy. (Especially they completely left the performance in seven pounds, as Will Smith). Amy Adams is not eligible for nomination. Amy Adams had to see a cardboard box - it was a sided and plain. It could have made sense for him to nominate Razzie, because I am sure he could have won. Viala Davis has given a brief but true performance, but its performance length asks me whether the Academy should actually nominate him. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm disappointed one of the most frustrating movies of 2008. This was a mess of a possible movie and I did not recommend it. The film's only shining light is Merrill Strip, although it gives a stunning, strong performance - not enough to save the film. *** / 10.
