A small town is attacked by a board of bloodthirsty purple. The only hope is the only vengeance and the rugged survivors. <br /> <br /> In 1993, after the release of "Darkness" released something of a culture. It's easy to see why - it loads (and I mean meaningless loading), and it is found in the horror flickers of power budgets like energy and encouragement, such as "The Next Next Door" and "Children of Ronsberg's Children"; Infectious <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, it is sadly not enough to save it. The picture was shot at Super 8, so the picture is great and dark, which becomes very difficult to see (it would be great if it hides a great dramatic hide-of-the-eye.) Also the nervous casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal (seriously, What is the horror of this budget flickr and bad death metal?) Although Oscar is not expected to perform well, the performance is still harsh Amateur hours, as the actors often feel confused, rather afraid or threatened. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm not sure fans of budget gorefests will love this. Although everyone else, willing to have a little more meat on the ribs
