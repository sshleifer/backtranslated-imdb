When I saw the preview, I thought: It's going to be a great movie. And indeed it could be. The main actress was very credible, and the filming beauty is incredible. But the conversation throws a dark shadow in the whole picture. In 1610, the language level was very familiar and very contemporary to perform an action, and it removed most of the film's magic. However, the translator should congratulate, because the English sub-titles were more refined and fit that the original French signals and it probably explains the best rating of the movie found in the image!
