As the only movie I could see in this year's "Filmfare Film Festival", this year's festival will be remembered for me as the greatest ever. <br /> <br /> This movie has been declared as a boyfriend thriller, a sick piece of pain is nothing else! Forgive the language, but there is no appropriate word to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, the actor is not the best. But even the good actor will not be retrieved from the movie. For example, plot: In the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was ill, neighboring girls were not real and he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was not anything other than adultery (until there was nothing to do with sex until I hit each other until blood flowed), but unfortunately it was not the only hateful figure to show. All other things were copied by other directors such as <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The man is bright, but imagines the crazy neighboring girls, one of them (or so he thinks) There is hateful sex, until finally she realizes that she is crazy and her girlfriend and her new girlfriend are always in her apartment. Bad stories, bad actors, pictures that you want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (for 1 point, you understand that if you learn Swedish you can understand how good Norwegian is - in the evening At least one advantage - and you can not select 0 points here).
