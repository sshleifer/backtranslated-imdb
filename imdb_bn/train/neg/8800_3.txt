Deleted scenes and alternatives are edited together and with the added voice-over, it runs after the first events. Pretty good idea, but the deleted scene is left on the floor due to a cutting room and this is further proof. It's not funny as "high-quality", and in fact it should be confronted that this movie was not the comedy gold, so you got a 'movie' which was a moderate fun. My eyes still keep one or two din above "Kicking and Screaming", or "Beechchide". Your wedding crosses "wedding crashes" returned to the old school form (not for any crazy purpose) <br /> <br /> My grade: D
