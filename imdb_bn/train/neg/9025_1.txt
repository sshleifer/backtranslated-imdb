Sorry - this movie is simply a cheap TV-production. I saw many promotional posts and hope to be a professional movie like "StormRiders" - what I was presented is a low-budget movie like "Xena" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very annoying, more then more bad fight scenes. Some good ideas - more. I hope I get a chance to create such a movie and then how will I show such a movie !!! <br /> <br /> My Asia-Tips: "Musa - The Warrior", "Strymaiders", "Shaolin Soccer", "Batel Royale", "Versus", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad english
