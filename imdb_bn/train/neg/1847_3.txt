SCHIZOPHRENIAC: Another example of what happened to get together uninterrupted people together to create a "extreme" horror movie for Hello Managers. Acting, producing, storyline, FX, etc. Any kind of ... Remove the window in the attempt to create "Shock-Value". Now do not mistake me - I think myself as a critic of "Shock" movies, and Slezier / Giori / Nastia is good - but still some talent is seen that some people involved in this movie <br /> <br /> Life of SCHIZOPHRENIAC Harry Russo - A drug-addict, Fiq-Sho, who received orders from his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck to be killed. He killed Huku and other random people, took a few sprees and shouted at "Hoo-Uhs" (those who do not talk to you "Jorce" which does not speak in New York-Eyes). The ass wants to rape them. There are some weak necrophilia scenes, very little grass, and some nudity things to mix - but any good movies that you have not seen in good movies ... <br /> <br /> I can find the only release thing in this annoying movie (oddly ?) Sunny shouting - our main people, fits from Harry. He wants to kill everyone and want to do their job in the donkey, and after a while it becomes quite ridiculous. Actually, I believe that I was often tempted to believe that there was something to be done of homo-eroticism in this movie, Harry's all ass-styling and continuous shots were running with his Dong Hangin Out. In all the facts, the joker is more nicknamed in this movie, then there are some T-shows that have some T-and-in (and some perfect for good measurement). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is gently entertaining as a 1-hour watch, but I can only recommend to them that they saw a movie known as Schizophrenia: The Hoang Mangar Be honest - the title, away - the best thing about this trash ... is a generous 3.5 / 10
