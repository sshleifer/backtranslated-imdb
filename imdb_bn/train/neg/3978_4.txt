When there is a certain improvement in Rome. There I am going to get very predictable, conrived and gradually, and until these days I still consider Olsen twins' as worst. However, when Rome is not a terrible movie, it is not a great one. If I was to add it to one word, I would say passable. It's good fun for teens, but I think adults will not find much to go. <br /> <br /> When there are her best points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite good actresses, of course very nice as well. When I was 10 or more then I would admit, I really liked them and in general I still like them. And I enjoyed some of their films such as Passport to Paris and New York. Returning to the goal, both girls do not work that bad, in fact they are very interesting. Plus they are to die for their outfits, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not half bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the film is brought down in plots and scripts. The script is mostly in part and there is a hint of Dja Bhu. Most of the plot, like Mary Kate and Ashley Films, is very predictable and familiar to anyone from the Olson twins, instead of finding some tribal elements compared to it. Most letters are paperboard thin, and you do not learn a lot about them and sometimes the speed is disrespectful. Sadly, exciting scenes have been destroyed by slippery cameras, which are constantly spreading. <br /> <br /> Finally, its good points and of course can be seen. However, for my taste, it is harmless and expected teenager fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
