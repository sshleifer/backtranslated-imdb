We now travel parallel to the universe where the giant prehistoric monsters are the daily routine part of rich cities. It is also called the Godjilla, Radon, Moura Ghadrara and their kind - a strange world, and even a stranger, by the advent of an unknown flying turtle called a gamera. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The second Ran Dai studio is more famous for samurai sagas than giant movies. In the mid-60's, they decided to join the giant reptilian nation and designed the rival giant series Tauhau's highly successful Godzilla. They have wisely chosen gamer as its flag - it is a giant turtle that burns fire from its slit-tooth and wounds through the air through a fire hole in its shell (and at one point you often see the mesh shell on paper! ). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " American fighters have run an unmarked plane for Arctic eruptions - nuclear bomb blows on the board and the massive gum raises the ice from waking up. Close the nuclear power, it is immediately a growing, and the world wants to destroy Gamera for once and for all, but a small Japanese boy named Kenny has a psychological connection with the giant turtle and even puts a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside, Gamera basically believes in kind and beneficial. He is like a small Jewish child with Hitler's pinup. "Gamera is a good turtle," she pleads, then sulks, and someone in her coco pops puts a face like pooped. Global leaders listen to him, and so start Z-Plan to save the world and gamer from complete destruction. <br /> <br /> Released in 1965, Gamma is a wonderful hit. Both Japan and Japan are boring annoying infantile anthropomorphism on teenage audiences, and the gaming scene of Tokyo's two-foot stomping and North Pole gemmos are gorgeously impressive. The most surprising is the series of long live: eight original gamer film, as well as recent remixes. Not bad for a mutant reptile, whose only friend is eight-year-old Milquetest - and I've heard "Gamera is the friend of all children" I'm going to Tokyo again. Which seems to be an easy task in parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are larger than the Zero billboards in 1965 turtle-festive gamers.
