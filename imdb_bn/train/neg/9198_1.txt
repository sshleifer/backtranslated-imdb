There will be people who have green light there! The only explanation I can give is why the Dead Movie House exists. And that is the only scary part of the whole movie. It's so bad that you have to stop the movie forever. I seriously wanted to switch it out and wanted to turn the TV into a paint drying channel, but I was forced to bear the whole thing through my word. I do not know why I do these bad things for myself. <br /> <br /> If this is important then here's the basic justification of 'story' here. A resting team is so disappointed to go to some islands in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, cheap) for 'Roof of the Century' (which consists of 8 and non-rhyngic music). After missing the main boat, they will have to pay $ 1000 to some drunk fishermen. All that dough will be valuable to rave something! The fisherman warned them that the island was also known as the Dead Island (I think this was the dead house?) And they all destroyed the war. <br /> <br /> The first fruit here. Why would a small little Rave (Century My Foot!) Be held on some remote islands? Why would someone get it to load the money voluntarily? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no one else. What should a reasonable person do? Of course, run for their lives. But not, this stupid, obviously blind people decide to go for them. Very soon they discover an old ramshackle house that outside the interior as 50 times larger in the interior. For more than half an hour, around the forest, as an excuse to kill fewer letters, and after most tadiums they are back home. Characters like movies do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> This horrible disaster is jammed, it's a bad dialogue, a shocking act, a million-jumbo exposition and one hundred clips from once popular arcade games. Same name I do not know why it is universally accepted as a good idea with filmmakers. There are no references to any views of the clips, and only this trash can further reduce, if this is possible. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with saving the game for some cheaper, dull lines. It makes resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even double-Dragon movies seem to be worthy of the multi-Oscars rather than this junk. Only one Jurgen Prochnow who comes out of this with his dignity is still intact. He could only accept his money and ran, but he tried his best with terrible scripts and brought the smallest stone for his character. The rest of the cast I'm afraid to suck. Characters are stupid and desperate. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you swear and cut vain nudity, I see no reason why this picture can not be shown on Saturday morning on TV. It is not afraid in the slightest. The Caribbean pirate is more terrible than the skeletal bad boy. And where did all the bad guys come from? Initially there were only a few people on the island. Guess Because I chose to re-use this footage again. I do not kid you, you will see the same zombie will die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is the celluloid that blames the end for scandalous waste? Without any other director Uwe bow. His control on the movie does not exist. You can see clearly that the actors have no idea what they should do and Junky is not really taking it seriously. Actors feel that they are reading coup cards because they continually break through longer sentences and speak as soon as they look to the next card. It seems all too unusual. <br /> <br /> Plus the film is shot in two parts, like a small series. I really saw good TV production. And do not start editing me. This movie is incompatible with the unmatched shots of hundreds and a dozen senseless camera pans. No real skill or talent is made at this. This is really disrespectful and makes the mind bad how this unauthorized bad can be made and in Rome Romeo can not even receive his call. The House of the Dead references Romeo with some stupid efforts to make 'post-modern' reckless, but it only seems that they are in the same league as a real zombie film. <br /> <br /> This precious, 1.85: 1 anaopharyphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean, but very uncomfortable and only excessively used ADR is even more pronounced. DVD comes with extra but why torture yourself. Is this review alert enough? stay away! I tell you I destroy all of you! Punished! Damned !!!
