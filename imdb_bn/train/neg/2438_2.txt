This infamous finish of CW Watts' career drew attention through my 'Night of the Bad Test'. I'm not the first to be judged by the comments indicator and I'm not the last person in Western Europe that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best in our contemporary pop scene, even Dutch, agree with him) is an actor. Whether he should try or can not be judged. <br /> <br /> He is very fond of 'intensive care', but he feels uncomfortable in the part he is participating in. Nobody can blame him. It deserves its ranking in Verheyen's Hall of Fame by all means and standards. A story of deadly meditation that is thought to be facing an accidental death, but surviving and miraculous events have been called several times before and even a fundamental twist, a director can provide medieval stories through innovative settings and films. <Br> <br /> IC matters itself with the hospital wing and some middle-class houses. Speed ​​is dull. The tension reduces the last bit of the credibility of the musical score, because every appearance of the killers is collected by a tiring mood tone, followed by orchestral explosions at the time of murder, which is mainly proposed and in some cases can be bloodless as a small budget. Sex scenes are not unrealistic but at least relative. Although the couple from Amsterdam could do it, When dealing with couple issues: The whole subclot does not work between the Wauters and the girl. More effective psychological connections can be made on the screen if they are only co-workers, who can free their nerves by half of their physical reactions. I do not give the status of mentioning other cast members, because they all have to be cut into small pieces. Actually, most of them do not. Where I remember where the style is obvious: a beautiful nurse and two police. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in a slasher, the need to rescue himself when the horse only rescues time. (Anti) heroes mostly think shiny, mostly with clever sensation, because these red films are not often taken part in this film; They may be overcome by the confusion of unconscious about the killers. Translating into the facts, Waters kills the doctor and protects the Dema during the difficulties. <br /> <br /> No one, I'm not finished. How does this story go? Wauters makes his heroic efforts but gets beaten with an anger that comes near "A Clockwork Orange", so the driller is taking the killer's law and the pierce girl through the doctor's brain. Although this method ensures more deaths than the usual round of 9 mm bullets, the doctor survives to reach the IC 80 minute mark. <br /> <br /> I could now make my point. Intensive care is a bad movie, which can be enjoyed only by bad taste lovers, who can verify the interesting statements of Veronese and create something for themselves and try to sit through it as well. For example, the clone mask of the doctor (Halloween) and the final collision (estimated) parody value Park (at the end of Friday 13th) <br /> <br /> However, give me an overview of the IC by giving a few credits to the account which gives me a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. What he needs to do is tolerate a terrible unity by a fellow doctor / French actor and when he lets him go down in the fire to tag his big name on the stand, it seems scary. He could play his nude gun piece to finish like a cow, but in the long screen time. The end could be among them. I did not bring an inferior down by launching firearms in his shuts to crush him against a flexible fence. This is good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Enter a good real name about sincere care ... Coen Waters has learned his lesson and is fully dedicated to his music career. It surprises me that the version of the Paris-Dakar nation must be canceled before reaching her senses. <br /> <br />
