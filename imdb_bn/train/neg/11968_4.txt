It's just plain Bruce Willis, action film schtick. See it with some popcorn and your friends Rent it for the money to save. <br /> <br /> Which of these is not realistic. The war is not realistic. The soldier is not realistic. Hunting is not realistic. And why did Tom Scarlet's character talk to Willis from the carrier deck? What's that with? What can he do from the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce Dr. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most annoying of me in the village "Front row seats for ethnic cleansing" ... Looks like attacking Bruce City. So what will he do? He crawls down his belly town town. Yes How many died when they died? Oh well ... a body count was needed, I guess. <br /> <br /> And if an African man was so important, why did not he go to the helicopter with the older kids? Can he say "Duh?" Finally, the movie was very dark. Not only on the plot, but it can be very difficult to do what is happening in the night. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
