In my life I have seen many great and terrible movies. I'm not professional review expert, but I definitely have something to say about this. First of all, I have seen these actors the worst ... their acting is so real that you want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing about this dialogue - they are so tall. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear it. It looks like your 14-year-old boy can do a good job. I think this movie was a budget like my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches to you - save your time and money.
