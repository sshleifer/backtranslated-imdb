Awesome films, especially as a huge fan of Jay-Harrah and I thought Nakedo Bordado was very good. I've studied the plot, read reviews, even before downloading it, saw a few photos to make sure it's a good, poor and scary movie. So excited and deadly terrible terrible horror inside, and I was hoping that I was very disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and was not even sensible and was not very unknown, but Gotti was rather ridiculous, what was the effect of the cartoon style sound effects? Actually it was gently stuffy about it. I could not understand the concept of cactus and after following the flashing light, the mothers were disappearing in the middle of the ocean, both were well-known, or perhaps I missed it because I do not think I actually understand what I see. I appreciate the way it is supposed to be; Amazing and some scenes (strange cancerism and your mother's kiss?) Were certainly, I think they went far and not even terribly, they disrespected it which makes it credible to be a comedy. My opinion is a horror. But this is a very entertaining movie and I got a lot of smiles from me and some friends, but sadly we did not think of the tragic hope of the comedy so that it is worth a watch for entertainment pricing, but it is not expected to be scary and scary film; You just will be disappointed. If it was a horror comedy / spoof, maybe it would be about nine or more, Climax is a strange scene when the husband rides his wife's abdomen and closes her wounds, but sadly I've made it one.
