My first opinion of this movie was certainly bad. I hope to film an awesome, vague performance, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects. Actually, it was not really bad. Special effects were absolutely awesome, but I found myself in the movie quite interesting, and the script was actually quite good and decent. The acting was not bad, and overall I enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not completely worth it, as I thought it was going to be. , And I know that this movie has managed me, even though it was not good. Above all, this is a movie that should be avoided, but it was not so bad to me as I was waiting for it.
