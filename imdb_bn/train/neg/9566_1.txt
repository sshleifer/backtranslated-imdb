I see a lot of movies Years ago saw the original Wargames and liked it. Computers are still "a great mystery" for us and the film was credible in its own way. <br /> <br /> It looks like a Wednesday night's special budget. Full shit, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak, until you see the movie until you see it believing it (which I will not recommend at first place). I did not actually point out to one actor that this movie has done a good job. But hey, the script would be astonishing if someone could do a good job. Clich√© views lots. The CGI seems to have come out of the '86 edition. <br /> <br /> Wow, no, I'm getting bad mood for writing about this. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a short time to live life to watch movies of life.
