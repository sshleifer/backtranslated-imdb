This film was so frustrating. Phantom love makes me blogger by making a decision to watch (why it is called?) I thought about something beautiful and thoughtful. It had some interesting pictures but this often made random feel and made no sense. They are inserted to fill the time in fact they take. Finally the effect was destitute. <br /> <br /> I believe the film can be atmospheric, but it was not. Lack of a coherent plot does not help matters. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was not compatible with any environment. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed confusing, but the plot did not attract enough attention to me to take care of his situation. Without knowing the cast list I did not know that you see the original character as a child. The film has a very little context for the time, place or character. I was not weird, but sex scenes (some were) seemed vague and confused me further, I recognized Lulu but I was not sure whether it was the same man, the different man, the lover, her husband or she was a prostitute. I only saw that the hairstyle that saw the credit belonged to her boyfriend. This picture was directed to determine what should be frustrating (dream sequences seem to be a bit annoying with Lulu's mother). <br /> <br /> Nail filing actually gained even more knowledge, because it gives some indication about Lulu's mental state. I will not blame the actors because they did not have much to do. <br /> <br /> I was in the film because of the lack of flow or lack of flow or was it not disrespectful? But the end result was soft. <br /> <br /> I can not talk about this anymore.
