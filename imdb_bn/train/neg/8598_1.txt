Just kidding! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Although it was very bad, it was ridiculous. It was so bad because my friend and I deliberately rented it. Cherry old horror flicks are always good for some smile. Touching the plot, some voice was dubbed, the quality was terrible. But I was sure it was an explosion!
