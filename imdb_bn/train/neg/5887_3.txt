Jane Russell in prison, the same "jentalemena favorite blandasa" the title of a delightful musical comedy has proven to be an actor ?? But, sadly, those films squanders those skills. A budget, and photography in Paris is nice, but the film just does not work. Mrs. Russell Marilyn seems to be playing Monroe. Anyone who suffices enough to play Jane Russell. Some other players are out of their content. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of shameful scenes; Most of all, be warned: Alan Young Song after a gorilla suit, brunettes in a pot of African cannibals "cooked" in a musical number. <br /> <br /> This is a fun, sometimes embarrassing, resource waste. *** /> ​​<br /> Merry Gentlemen brunetasa <br (102955) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jane shook, Alan Young, Scott Brady
