The worst mistake of my life <br /> <br /> I have targeted this movie for $ 5 because I think, "Hey, Sandler, I can get some cheap smiles". I was wrong, totally wrong. Three of my friends were sleeping in the middle of the film and I was still suffering from it. The worst plot, the worst script, the worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against the wall for an hour, then I would stop, and you know why? Because it felt very well. I went to the microwave to stop the difficult movie and saw that it was burning ... and I felt better than I ever did. It was American psycho, took the army of darkness, and murdered the bill to overcome that shit. I genuinely hate you with this and for a complete day of my life, you hate the candy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
