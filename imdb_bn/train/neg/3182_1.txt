Final Justice Great Joe Don Becker is running around Texas, shooting those who shoots people. Then he shoot Malta where he shoots more people. He gets locked up many times for people shooting. Then he is dressed like a beggar, gets a gunfight with a bad guy. There is a boat movement, and Joe Don again airs in the jail. Eventually Joe Dawn, with the help of Allen from "SafeField", killed the bad guy, made the boat two or two and someone shot with a sculpture. All this and an interesting theme song, just like Mitchell!
