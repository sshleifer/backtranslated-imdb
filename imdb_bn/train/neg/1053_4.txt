Engaging Cinderella story. Horribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner is a pretty decent evil step - the mother turns to acting. <br /> <br /> Some parts are visually stunning, but this is about it. The costume range of time since the 1990s in the Elizabethan era. Until you see something interesting and save yourself a 90-minute drill. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood of the Cinderella story - I recommend "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Glass Slip".
