My wife and I both thought this version of Vitrade-Down, the Manhattan Murder Mystery TV made (BBC) ... which is good but not cool at all. The story is short-lived or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character walks face to face and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson do not have much to do. It's quite frustrating, I would say. Ian McShane's role is simply an elaborate cameo appearance. <br /> <br /> The first thing to me was "I was amazed how much money did the BBC have to give to Woody Allen to abolish him from Manchester?" He needed money, and to expand his audience, his audience would have to pull the stars out of the market for two stars. I give this image 3 instead of 3 stars because it's a wonderful background word. If you want to get something to wear or stamp your stamp collection, it will do the job. I do not have to rent again
