It's really terrible: Stylish-styled actors Scratch and Mug takes place in a gratingly inconsistent dialogue which has no purpose, no beginning, middle or end, which takes place in scenes cut together without any visual details or even cognitive purpose, something completely incentive and almost undetectable "stories". This makes the trend of film "style" worse: Suddenly a remote-head crane fires the spiral at the bottom, and suddenly there is a whip-pans or wound blind-mounted sections without any apparent reason: these "styles" only extend the project Almost invisible huge misconceptions and elements are almost invasive vacuas. Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made.
