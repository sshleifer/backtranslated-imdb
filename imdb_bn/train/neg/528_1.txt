I do not expect a film adaptation to follow closely with the novel (especially like a favorite, evening), but when I saw the book's author Susan Minot, a film artist and executive producer, I thought that the evening would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this book do not get annoyed with this movie. The two of these books are so far away that the two are not compatible with each other. <br /> <br /> Here, our character is quite different: the bride falls in love with Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Body is a drunk, anne and / or love of Harris. I do not think it's a single character made it to the screen on screen; Oh, it just gets worse with each passing moment. <br /> <br /> And, indeed, we have not learned from the Madison County Bridge that we have to overcome this story, in our heroes 'scenes,' Are not young girls fighting ugly and teenage folks just do not work in movies? This image is a disaster. leave it.
