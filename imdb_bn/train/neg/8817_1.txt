No, I have never seen the "Santa Slash" series, such as 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', 'Black Christmas' or 'Christmas Eve'. I heard about their reputation, or, MADS (about mothers against Darned Santas). I thought I would pay it because I heard it pop up as a reference in the category 'Fat Guys at Movies'. <Br> <br /> This should be against the mother, but the "killer" is not for Santa, but this movie was only flat for this movie. Annoying, long ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the boy goes to bed, but Mummy and Santa (sort) return to the living room to see it Comes. Apparently this child was destroyed for the rest of his life, even though the scene was almost helpless, when Ralphiye's father received a "leg lamp" in 'A Christmas Story'. He was very unstable, he went to Attic, and cut his own hand well. <br /> <br /> Fast forward in the future! Now, it works in the 1980s and messed-up boys into a toy factory. We think of him as a little cry, and he is equal to both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is good, blah blah Finally, it takes two-thirds of the picture to get snap? That frame is not foreshadowed from one. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say, this movie was its breathtaking building, but only because I was waiting for something to do, something for somebody As he finally finally, as well as graphic as the "Grayz Peel Kids" card as punishment, "Who's naughty,"? And I did not mention the end of the WPFF. I'm thinking it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's weird as the rest of the movie. (The brother who bothers brother, he is killed, and his solution is? Oh, kill.) Do not even open this mess on even Christmas Eve or Evil. Again, I did not see another "Santa-Slashers" but it felt bad. Due to the nature of the film, it produces suspense and sometimes has not delivered a decent appearance.
