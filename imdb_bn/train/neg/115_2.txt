Do not cast your films models and playboy bunnies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80", about Dosti Stratane, in which Bogdanovitch was lazy to marry her sister, after killing her little-life husband, it is a lot more interesting than silver on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress .. I could see some lost masterpieces of Laura Osson Welles, but instead of Audrey Hepburn jeans cavity and goddess works awful "Podolsk" hair .... very frustrating ... "paper moon" and "last image Exhibition "I can see repeatedly. This clunker I could barely sit through. Brahaha like the storm of Miss Straatenahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
