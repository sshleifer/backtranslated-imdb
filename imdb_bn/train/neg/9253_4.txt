If I can not read his name on the DVD cover, I would never have doubted that such a reasonable and old-fashioned musical instrument with the French New Wave was made by such a man. Actually, the film has come so far that I would be surprised if New Wave Ituers in the 50s and 60s hated such a movie - that's it ... so ... unrealistic. And, he has little relationship with some of his earlier films. This is not a bad thing - just a very wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> I got some critics who were critical of the film - especially when there are so many good French musicals. The songs of this movie were not only particularly attractive and the letters were so vivid and impressive. If I have seen other rich people who want to be rich or get good sales prices in designer outfit, then I will disappear. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is like a musical instrument like America, not every French music or gold. This image is not another "Les Paraphrwys de Chirroburg" (despite the presence of Cherubze or Camel Fame (Camel Woman) and Audrey Tauteu, I do not see many reasons to suggest this strange curiosity.
