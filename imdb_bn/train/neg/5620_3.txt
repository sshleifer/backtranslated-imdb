Why? He is the most well-known Bible believer who claims to be doing the same, he also did the same. It's taking things out of context. <br /> <br /> A verse of Hebrew 8; 1 .. "Now we are telling the sum: We have such high priests who sit on the right side of the greatness." The above topic clearly speaks of Jesus who was on earth and came to heaven after his resurrection. <br /> <br /> There is no connection with the filmmaker's wish to come out of the scripture. Here he proposed a foundation that "Paul was not aware of a Human Jesus, only in the" heaven "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Look, the creator of the picture is honest; Hebrews 7; 14. "It is clear that our Lord originated from Judah. None of the priests said anything about priesthood. <br /> <br /> Hey, this filmmaker quotes that Hebrew authors that the author of the book has no knowledge about "human Jesus"? It's probably Paul did not write Hebrew, but I will not go here, but the filmmaker insists on Paul, and this is the basis of the point given here. <br /> <br /> This filmmaker does not make precise aspects in certain areas, but he is involved in the same blind favors of the religion he is interrupting. Once he used these strategies and lost credibility of religion according to my strong opinion. She likes out, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and the film-maker's bias, nothing, nothing less.
