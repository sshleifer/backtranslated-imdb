Well, I could not get into the plot, but that's just maybe I guess. Occasionally uninterrupted camera-movement, however, the film received a charming vintage quality. Actually, occasionally engaged in women with genuine and spontaneous women who are involved in running sequences, Claymax is confused and confused, but still ... Thaks from Stevens, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> Finally, there are some quarrels in the hands of the camera-movement, which I guess for a while. But I do not think I'll be behind the DVD, so far.
