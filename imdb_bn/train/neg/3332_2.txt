I bought this movie for a car boot sale, so I did not expect it to be the same horror film like Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I think it's still quite enjoyable to see it. However, it proved to be not enjoyable at all, but instead of acting and the general movie was disrespectful, for example 'invisible killer' is the way to murder his victim and how all the people die, it can be just young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror film. Because of the following reasons I am saying: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women are in danger, most of them die 2) Walks behind in the darkness behind a murderer. 3) Wonderful surprise, come as a shotgun! <br /> <br /> By using three common points, I've kept you two weird hours in short for this poor excuse of a horrible movie, so you're lucky enough not to see it.
