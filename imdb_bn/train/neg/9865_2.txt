I hope this movie will be similar to "The Gammers" enjoyable by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is very popular, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The movie is made famous in this fake documentary style but it fails to deliver. Because partly hard acting but mostly writing and instruction. True, using each singer clich√© may be fun, but there is a role in the role of the game, but here it is done that it will be highly anticipated. At the beginning of each scene you know what will be a "joke". But perhaps the biggest problem is to illustrate everything above. There is no benefit in this movie, if there are captions "Lauh Naui" or the cheap 80-style fake-smile track, there will be no difference. With some scenes you say "yes, I think it will be fun", but the way it works, it accepts all the speed from possible joke.
