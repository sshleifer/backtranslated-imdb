Alejandro Amenbar is a restorative of Abro los Ojos, but this time, living as a viscosity mask. For the suspicious benefits of an English soundtrack, we naturally tolerate Tom Cruise's enthusiastic performance with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his personality, but in order to preserve our interest, we are usually given some character. His only posting denies any characteristic of his character and cruise or any erotic power in Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an acting exercise that involves the use of masks to give the actor the verbal and body-to-face presentation of the character. Language means Cruise masks only painfully emphasize its insufficiency as an actor. Open your eyes to see the original Amman of 1997!
