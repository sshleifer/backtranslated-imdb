Earth does not thank a group of Father Paragono and Nass. Christopher Lee (who later said that his producers told him that the actors felt guilty for appearing in him) was his father Paragono and had done his usual serious and terrible routine. Cast is not very bad, though most have retired from acting now. The film has a grim word effect (mainly made from old-fashioned keys), and it is ridiculous to think occasionally - for example, in a time when the sky is shown in order to feel like a frequent one. Despite this, the story is world-destructive and production is quite ridiculous enough. Interestingly one scene Albert Band and wife Jackie features; Fat band; Writer Frank Ray Perili and Charles Band assistant Benha Burton. Despite its plodding nature I wanted to really see how it all worked out and thus quite like.
