A vietnam vet decides to take a back city run amok, and anyone is removed from its way step (including women). "A Star is Bourne" was released earlier in theaters, which turned around his career, Chris Kristofers performing this action-drama Mishmash was wildly off-the-counter, worried and meaningless. Illustrating in Simi Valley, CA, the results are really unclear, with the generosity of Redneck Clich√©s and mind violence, most of George George's scripts are created. Armeiz has cast the most intriguing '70s for his movie, including John-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and some Lonnie Anderson; However, the whole thing is the center Kristofferson, who is chaotic and rude throughout. It is completely deserving of points considered as a disproportionate drive-thriller, but bad chaos (and ridiculous climax) covers the whole project as ugly spots. * **** to 1/2
