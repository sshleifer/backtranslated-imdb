The order is a trick of devious deviation as well as an unwanted plot-which is not the only thing that is similar or the reaction. <br /> Two examples: While walking through a graveyard at night, a priest was suddenly attacked by ghosts. Spirits After fighting against them, he calmly resumed his walk when his friend came. "any problem?" Asked his friend, saw the attack. "Only some monster soul-nothing can handle me." No response, surprise, just like he'd like to change a tire. His friend is also strangely ... Standard Padri training should be ... ["And then you keep the waffer in their mouth. Any questions? Okay, moving, Damon spirit attack ..." <br /> <br /> Two: At one point the priests need a question, and only one demon (or something that is taking care of now) can provide it. How? Why, you must ask a dead man! Therefore, two of the wicked people ran before the priest so that they could ask their questions, frustrated people "Hey, do not kill him!" Or maybe "it's not nice!" Their reactions were then more realistic. They never ask whether they let people go or stop - actually, they are the closest to reacting to light discourse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> / **** (four stars one) <br /> <br />
