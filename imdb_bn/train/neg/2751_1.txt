I hate the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. Huang-Rai Shim is fortunate that the creation of bad films is not a capital offense or he has to die twice for writing and to instruct the disaster. I was surprised that this movie had a budget of $ 75 million, but it was really so happy that it was such a great flop that bean hopes that another movie will not achieve the rest of the life and hence, more time during filmmaker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Should have shown. "Transformers" had another visual festival with a weak script, but it shows as "citizen purchase".
