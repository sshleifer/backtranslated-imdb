I have waited about 25 years to watch this movie, it seems to be an underrated job, since the quality of animation has never been more than once. It has played one of the best movie Villains of all time, it was a favorite series of children's books and the production of Disney Studios. What could possibly be wrong with that? As it turns out, almost everything happens. <br /> <br /> All right, not everything. Two Savings Garris in Vincent Price Movie, as a horrendous score of Rattagin and Henry Manchini. The price is naturally enjoyable, and more professional than the mansini component. They come in a class of projects that are otherwise involved in ambiguity. <br /> <br /> While the rest of the movie was filled with unnecessary adult situations, it was completely unreadable script, gradually generic voice work, terrible music and lazy animation which did not leave the place. Television shows in the mid-1990s in the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> It was completely frustrating for me. It is weird that this film was contemporary of the almost invited secrets. A fraction of it, compared to the GMD of an independent studio, has produced something more creative in its trailer. This is in continuous running times. <br /> <br /> The extra star that keeps from "terrible" goes to the price and the maple. .
