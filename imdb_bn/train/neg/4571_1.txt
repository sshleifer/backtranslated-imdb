We are presenting a parade of clear experts (some of whom are named) who ramble and pontificate in a completely unscientific way Their interviews gradually spread to lesser sections and spread to some sticky CGI and miniature plots. <br /> <br /> The film stole themes from science, philosophy, theology, and politics, assembling them without any consent for accuracy. , And then somehow drained some prosaic and illogical decisions. We believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and if the filmmakers want to point their fingers, then there is a problem to answer any other questions. <br /> <br /> It is faulty and logical non sequiturs. How do we start Quantum Mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism?

Because of violence against scientists, educated audiences will be frustrated by tears, and the film will touch anything else.
