I found a copy of the forest because I was watching VH1 special, I think "where are they now", and the video box added to the screen during a segment of actor Kalki Kabut. He played the boy's child in fear of this terrible horror, but I remember him from his character Spreads television show Freddy. This flock is a main letdown. There is nothing here. It took me four months to start it from the beginning. I stopped it in frustration, dragged it to each other and forgot it, then pressed it and started trying again. Obviously, the angle of this movie that he wanted to separate from his opponent was the supernatural, enjoyable. And perhaps, here, that does not work. I can not stand the male lead. I hope to look at the cheating line while looking down their pumps during long dialogue scenes. The situation in which the couple decided to go camping separately, is a weird and simple fool. I think the only positive thing that this guy says is that the person where the man reads and his legs break, you can see the bone from his flesh. It has fairly good gore makeup. Man, I've really reached for a positive now, huh. The horror movie of one other budget will be worse as this one would be home sweet home.
