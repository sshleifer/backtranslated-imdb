So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American pie movie in this series. Although it does not really have any relation with three American pie films, the character of the main character and Eugene Levi is believed to have some letters in it (this guy can not get good gigs?). <br /> <br /> This movie is rarely for praise. There is no funny joke. Painful to watch, especially the "southern" accessory sounds like the disguise of a British woman who is claiming to be a mountain by using the word "yal". This movie feels like a fool to me. Why did not I apply to a college where no one goes to class (but everyone gets a good grade), girls constantly clog their clothes, everyone has infirm sex sex without the burden of children and STI and you can disappear from a girl's family forever Without the thought of his mind? Indeed, the softcore porn quality standards of this series have lowered itself. Perhaps for the next, they will eventually collapse and serve Ron Jeremy as the leader. I'm sure they can only make the series one step away from Stefler's third player or something like that.
