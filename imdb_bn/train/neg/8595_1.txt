Both Lucy Alexis Liu and Silian Murphy are excellent actors, who will certainly move on to any acting challenge for them. Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers the only offer for both actors and audiences: It does not fall asleep during the psychological, annoying, highly hypothetical and unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but comedy is mandatory, extremely badly directed and <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Girlfriend, when she showed her old B & W film, she could not care less about her. 'Watching The Detectives (2007)' is not available anywhere, it reads somewhere in the Co-R, for example - questions? And then the question! The director knows what to do! Well, if its goal is to encourage the viewer to die, he did a great job! <br /> <br /> 'Hidden Attacks Liu' and 'Sylvesti Murphy' Watching the Detectives (2007) 'was a complete time waste. Please, dear, do not let it waste your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100
