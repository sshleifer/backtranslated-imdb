Someone is seriously joking while making this image. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete inconsistency that was made in 1993. Fashion and music is of 80's of importance. My guess is that it has been sitting in the shelf for some time, some wanderer controversy has taken it and it has left it to the unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> there is a plot. Kind of A strange guy meets a random man with a beard, who tells him that if he can sing his favorite song he can choose anyone. At this moment, I feel obliged to understand Lonar's favorite song by reducing the London Bridge. Why is this his favorite song? Because he's a fool. We just got one minute in the movie and the picture reached the stupid pillar. It gets even the stupider <br /> <br /> loner is atheistic pictures. I can only take this idea because the film has two scenes where he saw his nose picking. Clear that title She decided to change into a girl so she can get closer to other girls. And kill them. It's less or less. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally alarming. This movie sucks every single performance. Actually, I would say that acting is a pornographic film standard. It's really that terrible. The atheist picture will appear as an atheist picker. The movie shows her as a girl made by the London Bridge Is Foliling Down Music. People, I feel like this type even an ass. However, it is strange to see a middle-aged old peculiar hanging with school girls. And not a good way. There is an extended montage of scenes where atheist picker plays a song and a song with girls on girls in the school. It's likely to record perhaps the worst song. I'm not even going to describe it. You will know it when you hear it. And you agree with me. <br /> <br /> Here are some violence scenes, sure. And there is a benny hill style Chase sequence involving a transsexual. There is also a great dialogue that may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where atheist's prostitution prostitution tells a prostitute, 'If you get gas, I've got cash'. Lovely, I'm sure you agree. <br /> <br /> To get lost.
