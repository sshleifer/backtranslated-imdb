For a few years, in the TV show, remember to read about this tragedy about "traumatic tragedy". Cfto-TV Toronto every Saturday at 6am! I was a bus driver for about two hours in the north of Toronto and we could not get the CFTO, but you know how - this is not what we always want. <br /> <br /> All right, I knew what I wanted and wanted to see what I wanted to see was "Trouble with Trouble". Is it a beautiful girl playing the role? Was there nudity? What was the secret there? Was it a comedy? It would be fine if the show had some propaganda. At least I could know what was missing. But no! CTV affiliate CKCO, Ontario, did not create a re-transmitter in Winchester and started broadcasting "Tragedy with Tragedy" at the same time as CftO. Mysterious evening at 6 am !! One Saturday morning I got up and started the TV at 5:59 pm and finally I could see what was "tragious tragedy". Yes, "Tragedy Tascie" was stuck in Canadian content and the ruthless October 6th, so no one can ever see how terrible it is to see it. <br /> <br /> Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many argued that he "died" for the first time in this show. On the cold Saturday morning, seeing this, my body was frustrated even though I lost my part.
