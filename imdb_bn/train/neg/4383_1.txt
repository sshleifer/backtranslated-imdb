The worst Bob Comedy (and that includes some heavy competition). Hopefully, on an island with sailors, Gaisha will have a dream of a little girl from the bathtub with "running her ship". Some people bring flasher dealers and Gina Lolabrgrididae, because it has mounted the Half-Hacker on the mountain and still can not do any smile or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
