Considering the risk of having the same sex relationship in the late 1980s, the person could have done much better work at trial stage in the case of same-sex relationships between Best Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner). <<br /> <br /> It seems to me that the makers of this film thrown the same sexual relationship between two fairly attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider 90 seconds of exposing several women crotches jumping behind on a high jump pole. The film had very little relevance in this random scene and it was shown that it would only be kept in viewers interested in this blend movie. I think the producers are trying to resist even more annoying settings of boring plot and film (1980 Oregon track and field competition). <br /> <br /> This review may seem rude, but it is true. As a result of the exploitation and sexual intercourse of young Murray Hemingway, this film has ruined any achievement. <br /> <br /> Paper Thompson
