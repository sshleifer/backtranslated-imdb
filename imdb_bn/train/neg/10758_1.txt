This is probably the most annoying, bad and vain film seen last year. For some philosophical aspects to understand that the plot appeared to me, it appeared as a very bad blank copy of the Matrix: lots of sheep counted, looked good, mentally disturbed, sleeping with his gun ... + Good hard worker and shy, but looking good He-scientist, you add a 2 cent plot and you have me, robot! I was very annoyed by the obvious advertisement of brands such as Fedex, Audi, Converse etc. This film prevents commercialization and unfortunately happens to be a bad advertising site that does not end after 30 seconds. I will not recommend this to your excessive enemy, if you have extra time, instead of watching a good TV show or read the good book.
