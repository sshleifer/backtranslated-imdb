This movie is a very bad effort to make money using classical themes. I loved the movies of Superman, but this one wants to kill me. Extremely poor acting, humiliating special effects, and a plot equal to zero. In short: Superman released the world, because scientists discovered the fragments of the planet in his home, there were some places (dual), waiting for his girlfriend to be spotted in a spaceship (after 5 years, and again hooking up with his girlfriend (who is now his son , Which my humble opinion is razing at least 7 years old). And what about Lex Luther? Trying to become a new continent to sell the land? By doing !! <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10 votes for this movie, because I do not have permission to vote. If you do something else, do not go to see this movie even if you Do not do anything, stay home and watch TV!
