Sandra Lack is suffering from this picture, but then she is a terrible 'actress' anyway. Unfortunately, he called everyone else (then the real real boyfriend Clint Eastwood with him down the drain). But what is Clint Eastwood thinking when he agrees to agree to this star? A reading of the script told him that it's going to be a real graduation. This is a remarkable weak story, basically no stories or plots. Generally add to even boring, poor performance from the good Eastwood. There are no more steps than couple arguments, and as much as I was concerned, this image has come above the natural hip growth hip. Wow Can a film be more annoying? I think the paint is dry or growing grass can be more fun. .
