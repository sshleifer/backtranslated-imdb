I liked Gould Hawk and wanted one of his films, so when I saw Walmart $ 5.50 protocol, I bought it. Although gentle sunny, the film does not really hit it a stride. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is a bad taste as much as I'm concerned . I do not think this movie has been added to this scene. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I'm sure the payment for it was really worth!
