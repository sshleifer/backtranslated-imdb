I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Bront's novel when I read it a little earlier and generally enjoy BBC plays. But I was very frustrated, never thought it would be worse than that: The whole series smiled much more than I did to a novel. First of all, music (and songs) seem completely visible in one time drama (sounds that it was written for contemporary horror films) and like any other commenter, I used to spread the cameras, especially the actors. I have shown some scenes like "North and South" and it's okay but it was visible in the tenant, it must be absolutely overdone and just boring. Camera movements can not play vigorously wood. <br /> <br /> Most of the other roles were difficult to separate first and the script lacked transparency. The first letter is to be correctly launched. The little boy has performed very well, he is very nice and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> The role of Helen Graham of Speaker Ferdardard reminds him of being cold and hard, so that no emotion enters. She does not seem able to cry all in a realistic way. I just could not have left Markam for him and I did not mention the terrible hair I gave him. I could not feel any sympathy for her husband! Actress married such a virago ... Alongside, she is the only major actor who sounded my right. Toby Stephens, I'm just right, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to fit a novel related to silent things like alcohol and cruelty. In addition, the reader's imagination in the book has only been indicated and left only with the consent of TV adaptation: Some scenes are both obese and ridiculous (like Huntingdon's eyes started bleeding) and others have sex for too much pain. Time drama! I mean, in the contemporary dramas, are we not enough to see those bed scenes?
