I saw many, many Nutcracker Productions. Now perhaps I have seen this movie from a theater manager's perspective, but I was frustrated. I'm sure the people of specific business in choreography consider this product to be impressive, but from a complete theatrical perspective, I think everything from design to dance is "lack of motion picture" and incompetent. Traditionally, "weird" and impressive costumes do not seem to be what they were supposed to be (meaning candies are not like candy, fat looks like chocolate kissing, not fat), the performance was weak. To pull down a lot for the screen, and the dancer just did not do anything for me. It satisfies the whole shot (best), as if it can not separate itself from any other production. But remember, again, it is a dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic playmaker from artistic perspective, but a direct male theater director.
