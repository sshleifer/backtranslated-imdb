God, I know from America that the cartridge is so sick! <br /> <br /> Since the anime has become popular, America animators are 5-year-old cartoon with lazy-donning drawing style (Kopa Miki) or cheep Japanese animation rip off. (Usually messing up classic characters) is no surprise an American cartoon beating! <br /> <br /> They are not trying anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I heard this last night; I live in the UK and when I saw this show came first in 2005, I still did not know that the UK was so up to date with current shows.
