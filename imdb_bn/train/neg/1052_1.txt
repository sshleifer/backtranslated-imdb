***** This review can be from spinners - but this determination will be insignificant in classic and well-known stories ***** <br /> <br /> The story of the Cindella has got place as my favorite fairy tale. This wonderful story of the world will not be enough. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. If this story tries to combine some interesting ideas with some misleading photography and great design with nicely visualization and editing, it can not work. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is like a ugly docking that does not climb or, rather, never becomes a han. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Telling Cinderella so weak, the entrance or the discovery was not an excuse. <br /> <br /> Writing made me very upset. Prince Skimming Memory was the most irrational. Why do you want to marry a foolish, self-absorbed prince who dislikes a girl girl? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! > <br /> Perhaps the only sentence will describe this effort: so cheaply 90 's, <br /> <br /> mentioned in the shameful house and mentioning significant photography, matte work and production design. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella tales, go for two gems: <br /> 1) With Rogers and Hammerstein's Syndrome Musical Lesley Ann Warren. Even with a clear staging TV - look at the 60 sets, the best version of celluloid - none. An all star cast makes every effort to provide maximum entertainment. Engaging, splitting and memorable writing and music. This classic <br /> <br /> 2) Sometimes later - this Drew Barryo wax retains the historical perspective, changes the line of the story, but not enough for the effective improvement of the main points of this classic story. Principals and all supporting roles are written smartly and well-played characters.
