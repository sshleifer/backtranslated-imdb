The killings of this movie are not bad, but of course the movie. It's even worse than that. This is not worth it because of the time it slides in your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Carry on your shoulders from DVD store even does not wear and while you rent and watching it. Awesome <br /> <br /> <br /> If someone can say something positive about this movie is not understood. This was my only funny trend that did not stop me from seeing, adding group pressure from my observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is awful, the direction is worse and the acting <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see it as fun, but I see it as a clear warning: Do not spoil!
