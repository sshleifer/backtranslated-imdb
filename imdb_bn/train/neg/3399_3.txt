The birthday girl does not know what she wants - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... it just does not know. No funny or sensitive film can end in a human's land. The premiere is substantial enough to strengthen a script of interesting topics but rarely distributes it and ends up in the end. If you look at Caste, it is a real shame - it becomes very difficult, but they do not get the chance of being bright. Very frustrating.
