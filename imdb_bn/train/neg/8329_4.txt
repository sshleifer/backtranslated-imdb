I question his importance in Quiar's film because there seems to be more to gay sex than for a clear statement about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are gathered together in a fake way. I tried to drag myself into the first 15 minutes of dirty story, that could not sit alone with me. Weak plot points were repeated almost exactly though we could not achieve it the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of padded dialogue across the whole picture. More concise than the smallest 45-minute film. It was a certain erotic flash, male nudity and sexual appeal but overall the sum was not equal to its parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: Boxer / Stak's story was the most powerful and yet it seems that it has been thinly drawn. Bob has been following the team for four years and is he facing him now? I felt their cat was not developed enough to meet its conclusion in the game of the mouse. We need more information about them and are saying continuously with low parking lot / locker scenery team "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Second part: Danny wants to kill her friend Tony Jack while off. Tony does not seem to mind, but do not show interest in discovering the effects of his nude boyfriend's hobby - even after being naked. In this story, "I've missed all the important changes to make my boyfriend scream almost straight boy", "I think I can be gay and hit him because I want to spread his ass and he / she's style." < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The part added to that thought. In addition, it was unnecessary and nothing was added to the film. Yes, the actors did a fine job under the situation and the lead of four men was very sexy. Make-Up (Bridge and Cut) But it was equivalent to a grammar school talent show. <br /> <br /> This story did not have enough meat to influence gay politics. The film is not compelling or worthy enough for any statements, squandered time, and thoughtful investment. Her fierce error makes her amateur approach, it makes it impossible to take it seriously.
