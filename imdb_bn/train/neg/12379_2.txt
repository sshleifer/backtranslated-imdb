Depending on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening last night. Now I know that filmmakers have developed positive reviews because no motivated person can write this article. "Became a 'classical classic'" ?? The theater was apparently packed with friends and family of production workers, because only a few went out in the first hour. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal, which I have ever heard in a musical instrument ?? "There is no short cut, honey, wood wolf ...". She is very shy to travel around the eyes of Goddess Mazar. Fortunately, most of the tunes are lined up for several lines. <br /> <br /> Now, anyone who played wolves in this story should be engaging and seductive. Instead, we got the name of Ensignor Joey Faton, as she is not old. He did not light up with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school-quality makeup and out-to-tune music. Seriously, was this guy vocal group? The rest of the actor is semi-sufficient, but can not do much about undefined scripts. You know, writing at the same time for adults and children ?? Look under "Pixar". <br /> <br /> In a positive light, the virtual set looked great and well integrated with the actors. And it was not objectionable as "crash".
