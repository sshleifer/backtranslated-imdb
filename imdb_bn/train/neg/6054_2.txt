It is not sure whether the carpenter wants to raise the question of miscarriage and actually make heavy elephants and clear points that if a devil is a father, then a woman should be allowed to abortion, but it arises. Ron Pearl is ridiculous. The baby is looking really stupid, basically it is a Crab with a baby mount on the head. You can see elements mostly on Devil Costume. What a mess There are five minutes of this episode and 55 minutes of tidium. Very very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After the death of her child, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill the big, bloody, glorious, shocking people? No! She just puts her head down and sulks outside the room. Terrible
