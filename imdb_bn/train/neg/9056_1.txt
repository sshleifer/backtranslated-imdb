I saw some crappy movies in my life, but this one would be in very bad. Definitely below 100 elements (emo, which is). <br /> <br /> We follow two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richard Dahlin) and Kirkendels Lonny is not very happy about her sex life, so she tries to cheat her wife with candy, who is trying to keep a child deliberately. Roy, already, her sperm is okay She is being checked by a doctor so she is not sure. <br /> <br /> Now, I was returning to the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and after about 20 minutes she became faded: 'Oh yes, she She is going to be pregnant but her husband has no child. 'Spot, this movie is soooo predictable as well, annoying and annoying, is notorious, terrible. <br /> <br /> Example of how bad this image is. Two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada, they are stopped by a police officer, they do not stop at a stop sign because the boys know each other and eventually bribe the two officers in the beer case. This scene is not only vulnerable and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's not just talk but talking, talking, and never going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still do not want to think about the end. Apparently, the verdict is not there, so that the child's father. How many times in the movies ... try something new! The deceitful wife eventually pardons her husband and good friend for love and they all happily reside. Yak <br /> <br /> The best view of the movie ends with a few shots of the Grand Canyon. Why they could not keep the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> Another cast will be expected from this cast (though Thornton is really trying), but you can not really blame them. Writer, you shame! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
