I think the film has dried up ... there is no frustration for the plot ... something is waiting for an event and something like a bone has dried up. The waste of money ... Robin Williams's worst movie ... If you do not mind me It will be waiting for DVDs for a couple of months because it seems like a pattern for movies which is not good in the theater, as the hire before the end of the year. This one is ... you do not want to see or tell you why I spent my money! Plus there were only 8 people watching this for a new movie .... It was 9:50 on Friday night. I needed some more excitement or something to wake up. When they were talking about the character in the movie, the voice was very low, they could not hear what they were saying.
