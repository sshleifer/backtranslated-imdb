Mr. Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). Sadly, he has to struggle with an underlying script and some nonsensical set pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in complete "dead hard" mode with lonely and fat muscle, I'm sure he can do better but seems to be satisfied <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, mainly stolen from poor CGI and other movies. <br /> <br /> Shootouts are unfortunate - eligible for teams <br /> <br /> Not too valuable for a parloman - AVOID
