The DVD and disc cover is amazingly amazing, you think they created a movie about punching black black to sweet tooth, which is still a great idea, but the film's actors are the worst, while acting on the Bell Pearl port, good quality of porn and good actors . I was going to buy a DVD but fortunately I hired it first, plots and scripts were horrible, nothing seems to go together, so the film does not really give any idea. Using the flashback scenes, the poorest attempts to fear you are used in the 80's cottage shorts and ultimately it will push your head against your house wall.
