This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing to happen, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip Nada There are no stories. Letters are a vague representation of our most annoying people. If the film's producers try to sell it as a "motion picture" then they can file a lawsuit. There is no speed. I used to say the same story "story", still can take pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I suspect any scripts in the world can save it. My biggest regret is that I wasted 60 minutes of my life "Love in Love", but I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I might be the first to walk, but I wait a little long. Instead, I saw about 20 people walking before me.
