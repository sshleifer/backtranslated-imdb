I totally agree with the critics that here in Oscars won the 2002 Oscar for "The Great Animated Short" for "The Birds", this is not a sick element, which is objectionable to the best and interesting, of course, those who do not believe in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but there are many animated shorts. And, however, I love the dark humor but it was unexpected from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a story here: A man roams around, but a TV set (which comes every few hundred yards away) is called gray (here symbol) that he is heaven, hell, or purgatory. Every time he shoots his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I guess two of the three incidents would be funny.
