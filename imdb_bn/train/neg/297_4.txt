For the record, this picture is of interest, but it is rarely the original. In 1998 there was a similar plot named "The Landlady", a film starring Talia Shayer, but with a small character. <br /> <br /> The story is about the poor life of Anand Leer, the humiliating father, the horny doctor, the mental house, etc. Eventually he was released from a happy house as instructed by his disfigured doctor ... he killed a fool by torturing him unjustly. (Now that was the real) the doctor financed a palace for him before killing him and buried the dryer in the backyard of the house. He later fell in love with a stud named Richard, who was only married to a blues singer. If you have seen landlady, you know the rest, he and Richard try to kill anyone in the street (including the road). <br /> <br /> Most of the ideas came from the previous movie, the same Fool Sidekick which spies on its nose stick, the same popcorn spy with a bowl, spying a bodypress. It was some original ingredient, beer bottle items were brutal. Amanda's beautiful nipples were highlights in the hot-top scene. A bit of repost but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
