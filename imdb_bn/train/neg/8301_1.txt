Really bad. Why does anyone think this is a true mystery of a good movie alone. I liked the comedy as the next man and I "loved a Christmas story." It is based on the same director and the memories of the same author that why this film is astonished at such a complete failure at every stage. Charles Grodin is unfortunate miscastcast as the father for beginners. For others it does not seem like the same pacing - it is not well flowing well. Everything seems tired and bound. The pleasure of living in the first movie is completely absent - you just want to finish the film. I would not recommend this movie to enjoy "this Christmas story" for curiosity-seekers. It's that bad. 1/10
