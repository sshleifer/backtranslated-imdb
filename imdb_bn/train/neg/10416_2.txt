Before watching this movie, I used to say that I liked everything like Kathy Bates. Now everything is-minus one. James Woods is kind ... his character, not his performance. Someone told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, not unconscious, nor cliche. Ditto for Radi Quaid's stereotyping Henry Thomas is the only freedom fighter, who is not strong enough to carry this sadden mess. You enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scenery. I can give it <br /> <br /> I am a serious fan of both independent and playful movies, but it's just terrible.
