I watched this video in a video CD a while ago. <br /> <br /> I'll mention the best points first. <br /> <br /> The first movie is seen at least that it does not favor, such as a letter showing as black and the other white. The main characters are very similar to both friends and countries and economies that do not grow until it fails at the same time. Their families meet together and have teams and they practice their favorite sport, sport rifle shooting, not as comrades' competitors. <br /> <br /> But, after the first 15 minutes, the plot moved into a fork in the street. The audience believes that these friends will hate each other for some unknown reason. For some unknown reasons, Bosnia is on the road to conflict. Sure, this script adds to the TV footage, which seems to be watching live news programs in English, but these wars started from 1993 to 1992, when the war started. <br /> <br /> History, people are not mentioned because of the war in the 1990 election. The film tries to blame criminals, who was the presidential candidate and leader of the second largest party of the Bosnian parliament (SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was Presidency in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a separate referendum in March, of which it declared the law in Bosnia and declared secession. <br /> <br /> History of IDAP starts with the Bosnian Muslim Aliza Ignativic. Suspicious people from "STTH" are missing. He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his "Maine Kampf" where he said: "Islamic religion" and there is no peace or sympathy between Islamic social and political institutions. <br /> <In 1990, he was defeated by the "Pro-Yugoslavia Moderate" Factrait Abdic during the Civil War, in the IDAP elections, who worked with Christian Serve during the Civil War and treated his supporters as brothers. Abducta was barred from taking the power of Ijtagavik, who was defeated in the elections, but seized power seats. <br /> <br /> The events from above are absent from the movie, but they are the real facts that lead to war. <br /> <br /> There were many problems too. Sindh soldiers were wearing the Soviet WW2 helmet, which they did not use. Also a soldier holds an M-1944 WW2 rifle which is used by USSR not only Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> There was a chance for directors and script writers, but they chose to re-write the history.
