Van is an emotional film about people who try to nurture girls in his new vane so that they can shine. The only thing that failed to feature in this movie is Van Van Fad in the US in the late 70's. It seems to have been made entirely by amateur. It trash, but I like it! I have to admit I am 70's trash fan! Hope this is below the IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
