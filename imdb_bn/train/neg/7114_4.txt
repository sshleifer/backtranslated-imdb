As far as cinematography goes, this picture was quite good for the mid-50's. The light was several times hot, but the shot was usually framed and focused on the focus. The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was terrific. Several scenes were dragged in a long way in mysterious attempt and the effects were in existence. The attack by pole poles should be removed completely from the final cut and each attempt to bring life to the forehead was clear with stick insects and strings. I could not remember but the budget did not allow their house to be built, so they kept reference to the movie and all of the storage is coming soon. Indeed ... it was a bad movie, it was more entertaining. It was not bad enough to be a "good" film, but it was not good enough to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
