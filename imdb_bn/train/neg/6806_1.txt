Alongside technical mistakes <br /> <br /> A female can kill a Flight Advant, 4 people (including former Meyrin) using a gun of terrorists. Then, he is completely flat land. We're not talking about Sijourney Waiver or Linda Hamilton; We're talking about a regular, frightened, yet very good writing flight service. : D How to attack the acting leader of the attack / rescue squad, according to the whole level (according to the script's reason) sleeping plans and one of his team has to fly on the plane. Only he decides at the moment of changing plans and instead of attacking terrorists, the guns brighten up, to know where the terrorists, or how many, and not secure the convenient position, to find out that his whole party is easily removed. Yes, that old noggin is used. Only afterwards decided to use sleep gas whatever. And it turns out in vain for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> This movie was bad, though, I could not stop myself from seeing myself and wondering what next? : D I can not help but all the fantastic, unemployed writing writers think of themselves, it's not fair. Ha ha ha! : D
