First of all, everyone agrees that Lorenzo Lama can never be considered as a skilled actor, even honest, sometimes only the ordinary rural. However, @ *! This part of this is called Snakeeter, fully art of cinema. <br /> <br /> First, start with the plot. A Vietnam vate called Jack Kelly, Ukil Solia (who is considered as a leather whip and then difficult to do, when he blinks a nail through 2 feet and pins on the floor, you can believe) his family has been killed and his Sister gets the kidnapping sound. So she went to a solo mission to save her sister. Some potential, but still very thin to start with. <br /> <br /> Now, acting. To say myself as an actor, I was able to say something to play in this industry's history !!!!! Lama, well, myself. Clampets / Deliverance The opening plate jacks up and insults the actors everywhere, which should be shot up for their so-called performance, especially those who do not get their big break in the gifted! <br /> <br /> Finally, action. The best of gunfight is so much, and the boxing is disappointing. I saw more real fights in the Renaissance Festival (and those were the fake look!) <br /> <br /> Listen to me: Drop this PC at all costs! If it was only in the movie, you would want to avoid it! To count your brain cells, do not see this thing!
