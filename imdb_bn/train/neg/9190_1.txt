So far the biggest movie I've ever seen. I saw some pretty horror movies in my time but these take the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole helpless bakery. It is so bad that I believe in a word to describe what I want to create in this perspective yet. Please help yourself, if you ever see such surveillance and see that annoying purple dinosaur burner thirty minutes later, multiply it thirty times and you will still get a small fraction of the horror that will be in the shop. For In short, I guess you can really call it as a horror movie, but only if you are willing to become stupid by the worst of the business and completely untouched story. <br /> <br /> Real rating, -10 crappy
