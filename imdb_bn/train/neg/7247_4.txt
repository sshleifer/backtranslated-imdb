In short: it's a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants to do more and trials. It wants to be Harold and Mood, this is the Graduate It wants to be deep and human. It offers attractive camera shots, lighting, music, editing, which all have an important movie sense. Repeated conversations are smart. There are some "laughing aloud" <br /> <br /> But here it can be anything more than a flight-time-only, flight-time-killer: <br /> <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - How many times does it begin to get annoying before poisonous puppy dogs can definitely annoy the spaces with its prick hanging open? Maybe some drill helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Genneth Paltrow - He's not just here in the flat and he's not on the chest. His role should be this lively, beautiful, caring girl, who keeps himself in a wrong position, so it is very confused, and because of that, the sufferer like Schwimmer has no chance. But Gennanth plays him very dull. Combine with the dog's dog (above) and there is very little chemistry for your care. <br /> <br /> (I've portrayed someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hodson). <Br /> <br /> 3 Script and plot - stuff that can happen originally is not true; At the end of a fair and orderly bow, on all problems, it is wrapped up to the end that it looks like a staircase and the script writers just said, "Oops, when wrapping it, get a train to catch!" So they pulled out the Hollywood Formula books, checked all the boxes and went home.
