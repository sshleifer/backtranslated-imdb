Never see this movie ... This is the biggest mound in my life that I have come across throughout life. And something that's saying that. Acting, storyline and filming were absolutely terrible the best film in this world !!! Does it cost me 99 pence from censorship as it does not even give you a hit and it is only made in 2005? This photo is like a cheaper college movie, even you can see the camera in the corner of the screen. But if you really want to see it then you will see "scary shark scene" ... probably the best part of the act I have seen in my life ... ha ha I take this 2 2/2 hour of the greatest waste ever!
