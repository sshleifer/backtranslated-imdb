This will be the film that I have ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, the DVD did a good job, it was not just a movie, it's actually so bad that I think the interchange of actors (or before acting from the act) worked. There is no real intimidation and no real intimidation. Production prices are also objectionable for low budget movies that do not have difficulty hearing in some outdoor scenes due to the microphone air. <br /> <br /> All of those movies were bad that the viewers could think if they did not know any better (there was an improvement) going on in a porno. There are two lines in the movie that are funny, both transvestite walking around prostitution. (Although they are rarely watching for 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> I feel totally deceived for DVD marketing. I mean that the back reading looks bad: <br /> <br /> She chose her weapon. He selected his victims She chooses her nose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lawsuit also demands that it regain digitally Either, I'd prefer to see it before, the print is so disastrous that you can use it as sand paper. The case is a totally scandalous film, which way, hateful production, acting. <br /> <br /> This movie welcomes in the first five minutes, if you consider it to be bought, then instead of buying a 'bad taste', say it is a good movie and funny, Peter Jackson is its LOTR director.) < br>> <br /> If someone knows something about the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews), then please post it here, as I know. E, detail whether there is a bad movie to find out, or to learn how to work on this film that no one is prevented
