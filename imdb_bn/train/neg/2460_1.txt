I really wanted to like this movie, but it did not give me a chance. It is essentially meant to be a spin-off with a hip hop theme, but it unfortunately fails. It seems consistently that it was written and played by high school kids for some school projects, and this is also the goal of the level of humor No more subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary, it never seems like a documentary. And if the lines are not funny in the first place, an attempt to deliver a dead-pan delivery - of course, would be better than the streams we depend on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who prefer "comedy" to the vein of "Big Mom House" or "Norbit"; People who like "butt" are naturally seem hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and do not waste their time.
