A Christmas Story is a Holiday Classic and my favorite movie. So naturally, when I was released in 1994, I enjoyed it. I saw it the opening day and was ready to enjoy myself. I rebelled and came away digusted. The fact that a Christmas story is the true color that is strange from this strange absurd. Good to get a Red Rider BB Guna from a Chinese top. And it's not too funny. Charles Grodin is good but there is also the ball here Bottom line: 1 star. Not even bothered.
