As a girl, Hinanko left from his small village to Tokyo, leaving his best friend, Pumaia and Sawori. She returned as a young girl, wondering if she died when she was a teenager, she was surprised to see it. They were again scared to know that they reunited with Pumaia and were resurrected mysteriously through the island of Shichau. Oh boy I hired it because I like Asian awful poses and think Chiaki Kuriyama is a nifty actress. Unfortunately, if I want to describe Sikoku with one word, then it will be "consequently". This movie is stupid, annoying, poorly illustrated, vague, and the most cynical. Kurumi, like the revived Saori, has received less screen time, and her character has been given little to work with.
