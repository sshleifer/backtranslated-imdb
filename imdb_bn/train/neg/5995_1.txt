This is a really terrible film. What they did is a TV show, which was never the goal of small children, and it gives George Lucas treatment (meaning it ruins it by applying to young viewers). <br /> All right, the Thunderbird TV program was not actually the brain function, it was a beautiful formula, but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models were flown) and the voice cast was not very bad. <br /> <br /> It is the only cast member giving clear ideas about bad casting and bad acting (with significant exceptions such as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook's significant exceptions as Parker, who should be acting their character) after this journey. I was not allowed to give direct traffic to franca. <br /> <br /> The whole point of Thunderbird was that the whole tragic family was talking about how they worked as a team, prevented or were trying to rescue the disaster. Those who are involved in the disaster <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
