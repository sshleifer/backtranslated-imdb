Story: The 4-odd hour-long film entered into coverage in the adequate description of the Kargil sector incident near Locks in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the Lo and deeply penetrated the Indian territories and Indian defense. To learn more about the story, I would suggest readers to read the Kargil newspaper. <br /> <br /> Comment: If anyone is looking for a source in this movie, one can be sure that it is missing. LEO pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots of bullets and blood stories. The movie where I saw this movie, sculptures and cheers were full when the film showed Indian courage. The movie audience is similar to the viewers like an India versus Pakistan cricket match. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and for the heroes of real-life war (see 4 PVC honored heroes) who dedicated their lives so that we can see this day. This film is a great painting of the army, who fought all the rough weather conditions. The negative aspects of the film are that it is very expansive and the songs are very annoying.
