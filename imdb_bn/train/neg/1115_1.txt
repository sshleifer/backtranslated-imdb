We saw on the shelf of this local video store, saw the credit "Coppola" and got excited. This is the only time and the movie raises any interest. If I fail in an effort to make an effort in such a ridiculous film or in a serious film, I would never have been able to do so annoyingly. In general, the whole production takes incredibly amatuerish. In particular the words were horrible, especially in short bar shot scenes; The conversation was so incredible that it was incredible. Very frustrating.
