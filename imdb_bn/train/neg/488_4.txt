A terrible film! It has been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous female Renaissance painting and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is that they are not taking liberties with the truth; The story was good, that would be perfectly fine. But it was only intertwined - through all the news, the real story of this artist was made for a better film, why did they bring the fake script of this pure water? I guess the real version was enough nude people Artists quickly stop with a summary of life - if they enjoy the rest of the film with the same movie, then we could have lived for a few hours.
