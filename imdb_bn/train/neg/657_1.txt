Pram Knight (2008) <br /> <br /> directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Played: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroop, and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Three years ago, Donna (Britain's Snow) was witness to the death of her entire family in her teacher (Jonathan Shake), she had a crash on him. Now, he is preparing for his senior promotions with his intelligent boring friends. Once there, they start the death one by one because the killer escapes from prison and nobody is bothered to warn Donona because apparently it is very important to halt his promotion. Professor: I got some good smiles from the movie due to the terrible dialogue and the zodiacal character. An example: <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely bound with him (he does not seem great) escapes from prison. Their reason: they do not want to embarrass him in front of all his friends. LOL <br /> <br />: I'm not saying I'm a big slash fan. Usually I can even have fun over worse ones I even liked some PG-13 horror films. Tourist Trap (1979), my darling, was originally rated PG. I enjoyed the Poultrystist (1982) and The Grudge (2004). So it's a movie that has been rated PG-13, can not enjoy a movie with me. <br /> <br /> First, I had a big problem with the story. I do not even have stories that have slasher films. At least they could be entertaining. This is about a teacher who loves his student, so he killed his whole family. After a few years, he killed his friends and killed all his friends and tried to create it ...? Then the mistress was that I suspect about caring for someone. Claire (Jessica Stroupe) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has a pain, and I could not care less. It should have been a lifetime feature, PROM Night is not a remix. <br /> <br /> And then ... a slash film with this deadly death scene. Even though I care not that poor, some of my favorite slashhers (Holoel, CURTAINS, the original PROM knight) were not that poor, but they still did not have effective killings. Here, we found half-dead people in the same hotel room off of the screen, smuggling several times without a woman's wound, and she is suffering as a closeup on the bad actor's face. I'm sure 10-year-old girls were scared, but not me. <br /> <br /> I hate characters too. Donna was an unreally sensitive lover Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost be sure that you will never show a lover who is sensitive in your life, unless you're a male. Then our Donna's annoying friends were Claire (Stupa) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and Token meant the Girl Crisi (Brian Davis). If you think the letters of Death Proof are annoying, try viewing this movie. And do not start me in Rony (Collins Penny) and DJ (J Phillips), who gave me flashbacks for all its performance. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />
