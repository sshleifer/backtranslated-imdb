This movie is probably the worst movie of my life which I have seen - the most horrific film in the past, "Spell of Sliths", which is more than I saw at the age of 10. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, submerged and humorous dialogue, unknown plot, Mishamade cut scene, Even songs were boring. Did I leave something? Well, special effects were not bad - but CGI did not make a suitable movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I actually spent the money to watch this movie. While having contact information with Huang-Ray Shim (Director), forward to my user name "Gmail A", and I personally contact him for the claim back.
