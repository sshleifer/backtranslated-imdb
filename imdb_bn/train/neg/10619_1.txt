... but a lousy film. According to Maltin, it was an effort to create a serious horror film by Christopher Lee. Well, it's serious ... serious! This plot is stupid and slow (some people living with small children's bodies for immortality) ... This film talks about the same conversation about conversations about the same conversation. I actually dozed off several times! This photo is so soft! It is sleeping with the exception of Cast Petr Kushing and Leo ... but it was probably the love of love for both of them (they often complained about the horrific films being too violent ... well, there is no violence!). Avoid all costs ... unless you're insomnia ... this will sleep you!
