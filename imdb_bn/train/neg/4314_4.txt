I firmly believe that the best Oscars in recent years were for two reasons in 2003: <br /> 1) The host Steve Martin was his most intelligent: "I saw team members helped Michael Moore trunk." Limo "and" I will not mention gay mafia when I wake up on my bed in the bedroom of Puddle "<br /> <br /> 2) Wonder Winner: Adrie Brady has no one as the best actor. Applause) or roman polanski for the best director (genuine jerseys and bows) but they won <br /> <br /> The last year's award ceremony was not bad, but I was not happy with the way to the surprise and I was happy to come back if the king was a quarter Although not the best, the prizes were added (Fellowship was a lot better), but Jonathan Coon had some of his sliding snug He got the guy and claimed that he was happy when he had something. So when I heard Sky was coverage for British TV, I was hoping to link Barry Norman and Mark Carmod, but instead we ended up with Jamie Thackerton and Sharon Osborne! If Oh Goud is frustrated by the British TV movie critics (obviously they) I am sure Bob O'Mo and Theo Robertson will both happily win and fly in LA to give their honest opinion to the victims. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is very bad It was not, but he had no place for Steve Martin, when the place was like a sports hall with seats! In my opinion there is not much of a glitzy arena. My main problem with the event was that the "small" Oscars format was handed over to those who sat in their seats! There is no such thing as the "little" Oscars and this award is for the best animated short or best costume design because they are also eligible for the best picture or best director. All winners should be allowed until March. The Academy is proud of what is happening in a bunch of snobs and I agree with this comment that this style is insulting and if it was not for surprise it could possibly be the worst event in history. <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett A great surprise for a competitive division <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman Freeman does not have any real allegations among the best living characters in America <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx The most anticipated reward of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hillary Swank Everyone was surprised that Anttech Bening was going to win the politics of the Academy alone, but Sovac was entitled to it and gave the night's best speech <br /> <br /> Best Director Clint Eastwood Everybody thought that Scorsese was getting awards because he would never win. Actually I'm happy about this because he did not deserve it for AVVIATOR if he did not deserve the taxi driver, Raging Baul or Goodfellas. <br /> <br /> The best movie - Million Dollar Kids. Again, after another major surprise, everyone thought that the Academy would share the prize for best director and best picture when I thought that the friendly plot of Avila's Hollywood will make it a dead symbol for the best picture, the controversial issue of MDB will be much more. Voters <br /> <br /> <br /> How could these rewards possibly be understood that this year voters have decided to ignore Oscar's politics and reward the truly rewarded people, they deserve something that they did not do in the past, I mean glory Well, the heart of the ring is a beautiful mind! And with their heart alone can vote with their heads
