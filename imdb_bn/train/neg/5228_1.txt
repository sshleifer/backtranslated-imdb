I saw this movie another night. I can not even start to publish this movie sucked. Writing, voice acting, even claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible It's like watching the C-SPAN 24 hours for the comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls into the potential plane of each spot. Also, the animation of the film is very poor quality. I know that this is a movie made by a person, but it seems that he can make a valuable curvature of 97 minutes, perhaps he can make fun at least 1 second. <br /> <br /> This show can take the cake for the worst film of all time. Father It was really that bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, be clear from this hatred. My advice: do not even buy it, or do not look for it. Your brain will be more than you.
