This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only freedom fighter in this movie is that the next time people ask me that I have ever seen the worst vampire movie, I have a fair answer <br /> <br /> I think it is portrayed as 35mm, so it's already strong like hell. I could not bother to comment, but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to film) that it was the best movie from the matrix. Let me lie to this lie. <br /> <br /> There is no good in this movie. Everything gets tacky yells Actress Kusree. The battle corridor is the worst I ever seen. The war scene is incredible amateurish. Imagine a girl helplessly flicking her arms around a circle and providing weak kicks which do not hit a cat. Obviously, the director dragged people out of the road to give their role in this film. <br /> <br /> I know the director does not have many budgets for the film but still good films have been made in small budgets. Unforgivable
