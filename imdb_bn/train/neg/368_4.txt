This movie is really stupid! I saw it 11 years old, even then I think it was pretty ridiculous! I only recommend this movie to kids under 12 years old. I have not really cared about it, but I think it answers some good questions that children need to be aware of, such as: 1) What does happiness mean to buy? 2) Do I think that I think they will not give me permission? 3) Do not buy money for friendship? 4) What is the money? 5) Do not tell my parents if someone tries to hurt me? Imagine, these are very unrealistic circumstances, but I think if parents discuss these issues with their children, then maybe they should also watch this video so that their children may be seen / scared to get hurt.
