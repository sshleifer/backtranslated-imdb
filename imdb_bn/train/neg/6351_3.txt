Potential spoilers. <br /> <br /> There were some good performances - especially Chloe Sevigny, and the comedy half Radha Mitchell - this was not simply an engaging film. The segues in part of comedy and tragedy were not awkward or sometimes obvious. This viewer first confused the confusing thing that the supporting cast is different in two half. I thought that the people around Melinda would be the same people in the beginning, would have different reactions ("he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said). However, we have two completely different stories and two totally different women, both of which are played by Radhe Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Two playwright from the first scene - Comedian and Tragedy - supposedly taking the same premises and going from there, but two stories are only related to tenuously. They do not support little about the discussion, which can be seen almost as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a frustrating film.
