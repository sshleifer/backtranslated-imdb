Nail Shipman tried a plot to lead a Chase of Finland last year's 'Back to God' country, and he sadly failed. This time, it seems vain even though he does well. There are no plots left behind 'some new'. A short premiere, which prepares the hero (co-authors and boyfriend of Shipman) to save the girl (playing Shipman), then it is nothing but an exciting, impossible chase. Of course, this Maxwell is playing an hour-long ad for Sedan, but the whole film is ridiculous. I do not think he is d. D. It has learned a lot from the last minute rescue movie. Griffith or his parodies by Mac Senate and other comedians, which he is imitating. Interestingly, Srpsman has written and directed himself as the author of the movie story, which is his protagonist as a writer (again Shipman), although he does not make it even more tricky or humorous, although he Tries. Again, many skipped the author's joke, 'Wild and Whale' or Frances Marion 'A Girl's Folly' (both of 1917), like Anita Luos. At least, Shipman gives the impression that he does not take himself or the film seriously - and no, despite his claim, 'I'm new,' Hackneynid.
