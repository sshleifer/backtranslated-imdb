This is a strange movie, which is in the outer space of the Santa Claus on the clouds and fight against Satan and its smallest procession ... but it is still a little fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> has some real smiles. All of them were deliberately controversial, though. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie "Santa Claus Martian's Winner", "Santa Claus" Doodle Moore and John Lithgo, or Team Allen with "Santa Claus"
