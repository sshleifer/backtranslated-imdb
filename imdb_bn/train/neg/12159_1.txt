I can not believe I actually saw it, but I guess I want to know whether this movie will be funny, fun and fun at the end. And it did. Climax is sometimes the most poor performance given by defense lawyers - so even a fictional story beyond real life was even very strange to it. He can not behave in front of the court in any way in this planet. And perhaps the world's worst prosecutor. Why was he in court? He did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. Find out a simple search ring of her home. But do not go He prefers to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the entire trial - that was. Blonde crazy was given a true-drug for its innocent proof but was not Brett. The madman could prove that his sick emotion was almost an altar on his house in Brett. But do not go again. During the court scene, I kept silent in my mind that he pulled out the spatula from his hand and pushed him several times against his head. Even the real weirdos that do not look silly fake like "I'm innocent" And what does this movie tell us? Do not marry a woman with life insurance: As soon as she falls under the stairs, her husband will be thrown into prison, guilty or not. Evil, evil people
