Well, I'm not an American, but Steve Martin is never in my cruel Scottish opinion, and our posteriors point to the south-east until the people are funny. Phil Silver as Sergeant Bilko was a funny person, no doubt the expert author and director of the series and all the other talented team working in the series who perfectly contributed one of the comedies to a funny and timeless situation in America that ever produced. Someone might try to transcribe Phil Silver's character to someone else. In my opinion, from Peter Vendor's Inspector Clausau, the exercise was repeated for Martin's unexpected efforts to repeat the exercises, reviving a demonstration workless career. Some of your partners say, 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character', I will say 'Baldaradash', his scripts will be forgotten for a long time when Silvers and Selar's people will be rich for coming generations.
