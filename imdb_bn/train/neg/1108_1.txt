Fluff is a horrible and dull bit (bloody fluff, but fluff). Wrongly written with harmful and wooden dialogue You do not care if the characters (in fact, even the actors themselves) are alive or killed. Little grace or charm, a little step, a little bit of the whole thing. Probably set and setting will have some interest - that the gap between all the building boards could be true to life's life. Framework Encounter is unnecessary and confusing, and the character of Hoppling Cashier is both boring and inactive.
