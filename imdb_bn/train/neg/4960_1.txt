I was a great fan of Batman Comics and I was frustrated when I could not find Batman: Animated series on TV I was excited to learn to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I saw the first episode of the premiere and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, painful Japanese anime. Then again, almost like every modern day cartoon. <br /> <br /> The character designs are even worse. Batman also sees, like Birdman, like Katvomann Chihuahouman, see more like the red version of Ben Hulak, Penguin Kung-Fu Master, Mr. Fridge, some unwanted things with ice on his head, and Ridler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson similar (funny It's because I do not expect people who are crazy about being ankle and obsessed with puzzles) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst characters Designed around jokarera. They made him monkey / barbaric Bob Marley / Kung-Fu warrior! Joker is considered Batman's most fierce enemy, but he rarely creates threats on this show because his crime is so stupid and meaningless. His plan is to keep his joker gene at dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman is an impressive and complex character because he is afraid of the death of his parents, so he fought against the crime. This version of Batman does not seem to be deceptive by the death of his parents and it is not very interesting. He is not a detective, just a soldier. If there is an enemy, he will not be defeated, he will not study the enemy to find weak points like detective, he will only create a giant war robot to defeat them. Many times this event does not look like Batman, except for some other brainless anime, which is nothing but stupid warfare. <br /> <br /> I hate the most about this show, what they did with villains is that. They have taken away some of the things they relate to and relate to them and their stereotypical evil turned bad guys. Man-bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a toxic scientist who has studied the frog to remedy deafness. While testing himself, he accidentally transformed himself into a giant bat animal. In this show, he is a crazy scientist who deliberately does not want to transform himself into a huge giant bat animal. Just like all villains are like that; None of them, with the exception of one or two, have the real purpose for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characteristic is Mr. Freeze. In the comics, the refrigerator was only a mad scientist, gifted author Paul Dini wrote the "Heart of Ice" episode of BTAS, which gave Fries a new source that made him more tragic, three-dimensional and favorite villain. This episode was so popular that fans accepted it as its original source and it was used even as comic as its source. Even the painful film Batman and Robin used it as its main form. At this show, before being frozen Mr. he was a small jewelry thief. What is the guess after Mr. Fridge? He's still a little hole thief! Great Origin <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I do not dislike this event because it is not like comics because I like BTAS, Batman Cartoon, came after it, Tim Burton's Batman movie, and probably, the fantastic Christopher Nalan Batman movie. None of them were loyal to comics 100%, but they were still very good. The problem of this show is not like comics or BTAS, but it is such a lack of depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I have given this program so much hope, but as much as I see, the more disappointed me. Batman Cartoons I miss some good old days that everyone can enjoy.
