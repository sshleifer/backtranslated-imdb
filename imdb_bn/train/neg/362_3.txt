Do not get confused with Madonna's film "The Next Best", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly, campy off of the Wall comedy, which is eager to launch a magazine named "The Next Big Thing". Various and up-to-date reviews of artists. This low budget indexing makes "chalk and back" look like a masterpiece. Fraud with lazy acting, poor sets and costuming, etc., "...
