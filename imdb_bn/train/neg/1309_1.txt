This movie was extremely annoying. It is not more than 15 minutes. <br/> <br /> I usually do not write comment but it was so bad with such good and excellent opinion. I think in this case we have one step closer to honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep in this movie 3 times. About 4 hours after waking up from 8 hours of sleep <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Rewind and catch because you will have to sleep again.
