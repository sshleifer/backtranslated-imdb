Whatever the attributes of the film, it is a bad study. As others point out, the film shows local people in Iran in Arabic, instead of Persian. There is enough knowledge in this area to lose credibility to someone who has enough knowledge. Horizontal can not be different from actual. <br /> <br /> Other real flaws: Running a train in Afghanistan, there is no railway in Afghanistan. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a phase (red cap), and before the time the movie was set, Fiji was banned by Turkey. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many cases. I think the filmmakers show an exotic woman, and the sari was what they decided to make her foreign.
