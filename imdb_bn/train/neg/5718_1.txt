There was no characterization in this film and it really showed how this talented hack had been taught to learn this Sikh. All of its characters in this movie were so unlikely and I could care less. The best point of this movie was the last credit and after this reason the shower for hours long I felt so dirty to have lost money on this dirty load. Hey Janius ... Tridents and Yakuza are learning about Asian culture from two different places. This dog's view was so suspended and vulnerable. This DVD proves to be effective, I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So the kids do not waste your cash in this garden.
