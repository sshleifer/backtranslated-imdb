A really bad sequel. Part 1 had a lot of fun moments - Part 2 was only bad (in an annoying way) and clearly the money was shrunk from fans. <br /> <br /> Sharm on you, oh well! <br /> <br /> The only small moment in the film is the Hallez Schneider, who apparently looks like the other letter P * ED. It is very easy to detect with him ... <br /> <br /> Scrapple run / absconding. The director must agree to all and immediately quit his job. Acting is worse than playing a second-grade school. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is horrific, but can the cinematographer / sound friends blame?
