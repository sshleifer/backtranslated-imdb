Early movie director Griffith; This is a magnificent happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Merion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen is making music of the palace's Mineral (Henry B. Walthall). When the King lovers discovers, he decides to act as a horrific adver alen po-typing revenge. It is difficult to believe that lovers can not hear the plan against them; Actors are alternatively trying to look at the cry (lovers) and calm (cement mixers). The sets made "the silhouette room" on the stage too. The performance is okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** Sealed room (9/2/09) d. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
