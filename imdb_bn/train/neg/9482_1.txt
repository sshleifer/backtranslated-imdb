Do not waste your time even, let alone pay for this piece for the day! How did it get me crossed? (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I have already kept this trashy movie short, but, well, ...) The act was horrible, as they all read the lessons. The plot was weak, the last ... phayeh! I think cinematography is the only thing that has not completely sucked ... well, probably the word was just fine. One good thing, if they can make this movie, it can also earn some money with it, but there can be hope for a photographer with a real concept. So, you take all the heart! I think the same actors have the truth ... if these people actually pay, you can!
