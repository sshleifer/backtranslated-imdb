But there are not many of them. Perhaps I saw the worst "main release" movie in my life. The worst for this year. There are no comments on plots, cast or acting. Problems that are beyond all. What happened in the screen is completely annoying (not funny), completely stupid. I do not know why I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, due to Steven Martini. He really tried. The bottom line - 95 minutes of washing the toilet with some brain cells. To avoid any costs.
