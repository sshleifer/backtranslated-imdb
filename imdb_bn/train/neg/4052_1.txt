I just saw "if ??" I can remember the advertisement since 1968 for the movie, so finally I was interested to see it. It could be an American perspective that never went to British public school and missed some social references, but I thought the movie was horrific. As a matter of fact, as others have mentioned, almost the entire movie often takes rebellion-time rebellion to be isolated. For others, whether the last scene is real or imaginative, there is no rebellion, but a shooting anger. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know, it may be a bad form to judge a movie in subsequent events, but no one here can avoid it. A person wrote a message board post to not compare the end of the movie with the incident in Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But on the other hand, there is a difference between Clballd, Harris and Chau and on the other side (Malcolm McDowell), I just can not see it. Four of them were confused that their gunfight was going to a ___ - which they did not take responsibility for faithfulness. <br /> <br /> which brought me: why do they hate so much in the school and in such a kiss? They are adults, or close it. They are not in a military prison, like the prisoners of "The Hill", better British films from the same time. Nobody forces them to go to college and beat them with whips, without their aspiring parents, need not be aware of the nature of their children. I got the chance to get admission in college, except that I could not stand against the ruthless, cruel order by the perpetrators of my potential "brothers". I have taken the results of not being "in" with the VAT supplier, and I can not say that I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Trasis himself is the second coming of Lenin (whose neglected photo hangs) mainly in his room) he will go outside and in the next election Michael Organize a Fitter Union for the feet or free the work. If he wants to be Jack Karaoke, then go to the street and start writing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In the real world, the person said, an audience would say, "Why did not you tear it out? Change your shoes?" - Do not allow imaginary letters to give you a trip to yourself because you do not dare to order a common alternative alternative method for them. So it's here.
