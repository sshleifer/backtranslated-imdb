Although it's not a "great movie", it's something interesting and memorable about it. Like other commentators in the film, I saw this childhood. It has been thirty years since 1952, but I have not forgotten the story or its ridiculously difficult headline. See if it has the opportunity. For decades it will look like a small size. Compared to any other film, it faces the "progress" of the historical drama at the beginning of the 21st century. It is quite attractive to a young audience and is quite memorable for the old. In addition, it is easy to choose letters and see their passage through time.
