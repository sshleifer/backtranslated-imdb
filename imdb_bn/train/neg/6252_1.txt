Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in North Korean Pao camp They are torturing us ... we learn the bad guys from North Korean communists ... we learn to grow slowly during Americans' beard torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but finally I broke up Smile at this movie out. The scene when Mr. Reagan communists are not saying that he wants to be with them. Then, he requested for a bottle Brandy. Then, he took drunk fellow Dieu Martin to take sulfur for healing cold strain, Mr Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is stupid as they come. So, when the drunkards get some protection from the drawers, then guard them by the empty box. I'm sure there must be some boxes; But, of course, the Reagan gives them a lot of shock to express them empty. Yes, it will be fun! I think "war prison" will mainly apply to family and friends who work in it - otherwise, it is consonant. <br /> <br /> * War prison (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dave Martin
