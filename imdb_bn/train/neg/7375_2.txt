This movie was severely in the presence of Steven Siegel. Or will I tell Steven, so lazy! Seagal disguised his voice for shots where someone like to looped for shot, like before, very good or very fool for re-dub his own line. Earlier he did some films, but I do not think this amount! The film looks pretty good, the script can use some work, but some parts of this movie are like real movies! Of course, everyone has been told, this picture is quite bad. <br /> <br /> It was much better than Sigal, who became his cartoon. Do not disturb. There's something too much on a buckle for this one! This is the last time I really have for myself and Sigal film. Did I take such a long time to understand?
