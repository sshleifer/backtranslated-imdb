I find myself annoying to read through all these positive reviews. How much did I enjoy how much I enjoyed as the worst adaptation to my second favorite Zen Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, some reviews have already been mentioned; Only this is a hammer-up, extra acting, impressive mess, which ends in the end of the credit opening. <br /> <br /> Although many characters mis-imagine and Ian McGregor or Tony Colette also do not have any performance that is Paltrow by their deserving, worst. I've enjoyed playing his role in some role, but here he is despicable - he is self-aware, nervous, slouching and completely disconnected from his characters and those around him. A highly frustrating endeavor - even a perfect Emma could not save this film.
