After reading the novel before watching this movie, I was very disappointed by the wood acting and ignoring the pride of the producers. I think this image does not reflect Broncott's work, but rather a shallow love story. In the short two hours, due to the film's collapse, the film has lost a number of key features, which makes the book a burden and progressive, as a result of which there is a slight groundbreaking plot with little grounding. There is no build of romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so these two characters have incomplete interactions that can not help you, but imagine that their 'love' is obscure. This is so much injustice in Bronte's novel that you do not give Jane's joke and bravery that attracts him to Rochester, and no arrogant attracts him, and does not give any impression to her. <br /> <br /> Despite bad scripting, I think that some characters have been portrayed very impressively, such as Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Pole, but overall the product was poor. Given a good scripting, probably the film will be more successful. See "Jane Jane" (1970) with Jelah Clark and Timothy Dalton for an extraordinary production.
