Woods Harrison and Wesley Snipes are grouped as a hustler at the basketball court. All right, that's all right. It's a good comedy and leaves a lot of room for a good story. But such incidents did not happen in some annoying minutes of this film's cruel attempt. After the movie went into the first twenty seconds, it became irresponsible, annoying, and ridiculous. Woody Harrison is my favorite TV. Characters, Cheers to Woody, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance", I came to the conclusion that he should be playing the fool fools fools. His acting movie was as dull and poor. In this unreal film, there was another actor Rosie Perez. I first liked the movie with Perez, but I decided that because of his work he had to enjoy other things because he was not a major character and did not have many lines (right thing). But now White Men can not jump at it, he has created a central character with many lines, which means that the audience should keep his incredibly annoying and voice of voice. So after seeing this picture (the word has been used slowly) and much more than listening to Rossi Perez, now I can say that I'm a white man and I'm ready to jump. . . Close to building a twenty story apartment.
