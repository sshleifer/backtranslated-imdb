How nice. What a terrific adaptation is a beautiful novel. Here are just a few gripes. - Removed two main characters from the screenplay book. Plots have changed diversely. - Voiceover words are hoisted directly from written passages (which can read well but do not have the same time during conversation, especially with the style of the writing of the channel). - Activated more wood than a log cabin. (SP Bechstein) - This is supposed to be set in 1983 ??? Looks like more like this in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be nice, I could not bring myself to show myself to this movie, so it is possible that it was released ... (quiz). I really hope nobody will show this, or at least someone who hopes to read something better (A La Wonder Boys). I like to chase as a writer but he will be ashameed in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No star.
