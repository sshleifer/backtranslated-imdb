In the 1960s, the Safifical Hippie was an inconsistent film about a man related to religious worship, who fought against them 16 years later. The man is a child with one of the other religions, who hides the police during hijacking and lives in a small cabin by the river from another person named Haq. The discipline killed some of its followers or some people in the city. It is difficult to understand which characters should be tracked or the timings of a scene should be visible. The leader gets parody after 16 years (I got from the box - I miss the amount of time in the film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most, the hooking and the holering. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The picture has been merged badly, to explain what's going on. Some of the effects of the sound were quite bad. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of cracking a whip. A woman fire a gun, and we do not hear it in the fire, but instead hear a ricochet! It does not seem to have been for humorous effects.
