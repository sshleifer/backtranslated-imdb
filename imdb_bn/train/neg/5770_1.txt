If I make a movie thermometer, this movie will be completely empty. In ten stars, I will rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: Null Star Video Quality: Zero Star Sound Quality: Nine Star Actor: Null Star: <br /> <br /> It's like high school students together One afternoon with camera, creates a plot and shot a movie. This is a lack of artistic quality that I see as kids walking around high school to see this movie. <br /> <br /> However, something unusual should be said for unusual depth. The "shootout" in stairs is sometimes one of the most train-breaking fun scenes. After all, the warriors simply pour each other plastic guns, push them behind the back. The pair actually "bullets" the bullets of each other's existence. No squibs, no sparks, no empty, just waving around spraypainted squirtguns. If you want to eat two old people "actor", then give him a spin a day ... you have cleaned the fridge, carpeted, smoothed all the dumb people, made fork, and looked at the book. .
