The worst movie ever made !!! Check out the original movie reviews from the film's professionals. Check out Rotten Tomatoes on the Web for some good independent reviews on this movie. This site has been commented that people with apparently some financial interest in this movie I find positive comments very confusing. I find the negative comments against this film so amazing and positive comments, such as the Academy Awards speech. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie has been damaged !! I can never believe a film like this. Why will Hollywood waste their time such as junk? This film is nothing but an effort. I ask myself whether the frustration will actually sink their money such as trash production. I went to Blockbuster and told us that the attendants did not even waste our time or money. I have not heard and I do not waste my time and cash. Please do not make the same mistake! It really is the "worst movie ever made!"
