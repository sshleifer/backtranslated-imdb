A man's story that has unnatural feelings for a pig. Unrealistic comedy is a terrific example that starts with an opening scene. A formal orchestral audience is turned into an insane, violent crowd by its singer's crazy chantsings. Unfortunately it's a common tale finally stays silent with very stupid stop putting it too much. Even those who from the era should stop. In the mysterious dialogue, Shakespeare will feel comfortable in the third class. A technical level is better than you might think with some good cinematography by the great Vilmos Zsigmond in the future. Future star Sally Kirkland and Frederick Forest can be seen briefly.
