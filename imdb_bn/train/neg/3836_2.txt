I did get a very disappointing movie if some of the first commentators did not see the first picture. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a funny weird kind of humor if you (highly) morally questionable premise. However, it fails in an unreasonably important area. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and nonsensical plot line with Gordon Sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be involved in conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics for the third world war - perhaps on free computers ... or perhaps not. Blurred, long winds and unintended The lack of a significant completion is so damaging and what is terrible and totally irrational to the present. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ridiculous. Later, he became worse after achieving his romantic ambition in the film, then removed it for some ideals based on very little evidence of vague value. <br /> <br /> Many pictures do not make me feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
