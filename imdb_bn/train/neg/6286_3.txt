This image is pure, distilled, unadulterated, annoying. Before entering the dark room, I did not know anything, I took my seat. I think the poster was inspired by "mysterious and suspicious" bloggers. Also, Lena Hayd is excellent and unusually sexy, and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable guy nearby, so the cast seems reasonable. Maybe it was his name on this title that inspired me to go with it instead of doing anything else. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , In a very iron and unenthusiastic manner, by those who are arising from the evil doppelgangers who mysteriously destroyed the mirrors. There may be a great movie behind this idea (actually, not a real concept, your mind, but still ...) And in fact, if the filmmakers break all the supporting cast and get stuck in the story of Hyde, The Broken is a reasonable 20 minutes short Has done. <br /> <br /> In one scene, for example, a mirror itself hit a mirror sitting in a main room; They look boring but quickly forget about it. In another scenario, a mirror is pushed into an empty room and the "step-by-step" of the left hanging on the wall is visible in a Dopalganj. If the first mirror broke, why was not there any dangerous Crowley to come out? Just a little romantic? There are many scenes of characters in long light flash flats, they have cried around the corner saying that they have heard something, but there is nothing watching and running. We start to think, why this dirty Doopelgang does not want to try to frighten them? The characters are scared and you have an opportunity scaring the audience. But we need to start threatening each other, in the audience, theater, theater, if we want to make a thrill during the broken time. However, once we have spent time with this miserable double, we are totally disgusted why someone is expected to be afraid of them - they just stand beside them, their face in their faces, perhaps innocent after killing others <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some nice moods and tactics and I say director Sion Ellis next time to make a fantastic screenplayer Stylish and mysterious film can create truly suspicious.
