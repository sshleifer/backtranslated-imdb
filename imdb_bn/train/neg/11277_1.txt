There is no doubt that this movie is an impressive cast but unfortunately it does not help with the movie's main downsides. I do not understand why the directors do not satisfy why they ask actors / actors to use their own to say that they are not their own. Fiennes just can not do Irish and Fitzgerald Russian is not very good. How good it would be when a voice is wrong when no voice is played. As the main problem .... the plot ... what was there? I guess some sort of story was involved but it was filled with holes that I could not wait to finish the film ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
