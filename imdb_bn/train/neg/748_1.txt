I love the movie, and I want to see any movie, just give it a chance. Finally I can say that I found a movie that I did not see all the way. The act is very drunk and stubborn, CGI seems to have made the computer mix with the minimum software in its mother's bases, and ..... its long scene ... walk !!!! And this movie is three hours long !!! I do not even have 15 minutes until the DVD is forwarded fast. The scene with the alien is very small. Umm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", this name gives the name "Walking Long Disease War". To make this cost 5 million dollars! Do they spend the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but in a positive note, the scene you need to see is that the aliens first started killing people. That's sunny, people are not going to die, but because when they return to skeleton, they still squirm for 20 seconds. So .... I said, if you're a boring fan, Style, Action-less movie, Here's a DVD collection for you. But I did not write it for you, I wrote these billions of people for billions of people who would hate this movie. You do not have time or money <br /> <br /> <br /> I know by this book, but the book is not so long, and I have a whole book / ward / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Only Steven Spielberg will get the version, it's not all good, but it's 10 times better than that !! <br /> <br /> I gave it a big, fat zero 10.
