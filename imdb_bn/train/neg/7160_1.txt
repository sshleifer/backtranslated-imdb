Well - when Jasmine Miller's camomo appearance (becoming exaggerated more than Exorcist IV), you got the high point of the film, what did you get? <br /> <br /> A little bit rock n 'roll: Put two kids in the basement, which will drag your baby with Bug-dried mummy (Do you still think Do that - a bracelet?), Christopher Walken is a dye job in a bad situation, and a little girl, if they develop him, it can be an interesting character. <br /> <br /> I understand - that they are going to meet their relatives again. After that ... <br /> <br /> Problems: I think there are some interesting flashbacks because their mother was killed in a car bomb attack (I think). This is not connected to anything. <br /> <br /> problem: do we need grandmother? Now, grandmother can be attractive. He speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can do something about it. What they can do is its tobacco habit. The problem: They throw a real sheer character as a husband. Is he typed-cast (what he would sell to his devil? Maybe he can look at the trust fund managed for him) or he has been against the type (after all, his hair is good and beautiful clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad guy. Not a good one. But dislike. Why did they do anything to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: An old boyfriend shows up. Husband ruins him down. She comes back to push her husband. (It gets quite stupid, but at least that motivates the character.) <br /> <br /> Now - he is a drunkard, he is a drunkard; She could only be married for her money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. Blind uncle takes our heroine to the basics so that she can show her mummy mummy (are you following it?) Who may come to life. Actually, you know he will come in life, the song melts. A small girl lives in the house, grandmother wants tea (so the door is open) and she gives the old woman with a cigarette. Finds the duration, the old woman. But nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife lose the baby at home, then lose their bedroom. Uncle gets cut in his throat basement. The leading lady has nose-bleeding. Husband drink They both drink. In all these voices, the first verse implies a miracle - Omigad - an abortion when the leading woman was at the age of twelve. <br /> <br /> Despite all this dazzling-thread material, someone managed to get a story on the screen. Under the circumstances, there is no bridge, a terrible horrible graduation graduation from light trouble, no long-term view that does not go anywhere; Sailor, really, for the sake of care - and there was the place to go by that direction - to feeding the lonely baby, she is smoking grandmother who grandmother, but not, is smoking her worst results. She got good hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> There is no small, no plot. In a dark library there are just a few random (predictable) violence, the rain is neat and sound tracks are coming in between us. You have to create a movie of some drones and Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> production standard was good. Oh Nice scenery, nice dresses. Cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. My poor
