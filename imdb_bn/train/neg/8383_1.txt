... Ever. Below this I'm not kidding Some kind of theater should have had a warning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse. This movie is clearly the goal of some slow turtle in sandbox. The story was stolen silently from the 10 minute bug Bonnie cartoon and then stretched like a painful minute, like Mr. Fantastic, at 90 rupees. <br /> <br /> I think when the Weinzers were fun. I think that blaming Hollywood's pressure on consistent rate for producing their produce. I feel sad and annoyed that they think we are fools enough to enjoy the 90-minute kick-in-ball jokes with a thin plot based on cartoons. <br /> <br /> I like almost everything about this movie. I will not loot anything but actually the child is helpless on the left side of the Marlon Wein's mouth. What I did was like the end of the DID. Not the resolution of the movie, but the end is true where we all stood up. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it definitely deserves less. I do not think that the six minutes of writing the script, they are a star value. This deserves a Razzie and I pray to God it gets it. <br /> <br /> When people must learn; If you stop paying for this stupidity, they will close it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Do not do it at all costs. You have been warned.
