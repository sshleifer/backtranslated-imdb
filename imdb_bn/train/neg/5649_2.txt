I do not think a show under the right conditions is too bad. I've suffered the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not actually lawyers. Based on these programs, anyone who is actually banned from protecting law and order, what I heard was that incident when I saw some interviews of the show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This may be praised in some situations, it is certainly not here. It is so funny that women always harass them at the ceremony. But since they're literally doing all the time, I have realized that this program is going deeper. Trying to spread some of the deadly, dramatic and even tears moments of this interesting fact of the actual show, I fail to compensate for the continuous loss of interest that I am trying to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Allan Shore does not affect the bright and unrealistic "public service announcement" where he spreads his views. Dinie Crane is just boring. I was ashamed of him and for the writers of the epic show of colonial props for copical statements. <br /> <br /> I am giving two stars because in a while I think the effort to cope with contemporary problems <br /> <br /> I think the author of the show has become aware that sexual harassment performed by Danny and Allan Even those who had invited them from them were respectful. The thing is, if I do not do the treatment of sexual harassment well then I have no difference, but I think that the author has artificially misused abuse with sexual procession, hopefully my liddo is coming back for more. I'm no longer a teenager, and I think if this program is committed, then its rating could not get ratings of the lowest general indicator. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm writing this later. I realized that it would not be much better than this. It's a shame because it's a show I love to love.
