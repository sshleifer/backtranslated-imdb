The matter must be compulsory: A group of people fall in love with gaming a step by creating a fake Medieval World full of fighters, kings, kings and castles. Wargaming delves into an interesting event that "exits" from reality and sometimes solitude in our existence from the logical need - some can relate to almost everyone. Character ring nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts are a mix of forecasts to the Lord. Most people are just enough to see it. However, this movie quickly turned to viewers with the stereotypical thumbness of the nostrils, turning to the view of Vargaming's insight, which "it does not get". Filmmakers think of Wargaming, and this special, often waaaayay with a lot of fun and funny acceptance in a short time, making a film about drssing adults in gears and making a film about pounding each other with a foam sword. 7-10 hours a day to play games or to remember the last star devastatingly, any letter is talked about and why nobody should sit on their computer for any reason we should take care of. However, instead of creating a strong story with the help of a clear story that filmmakers themselves understand a subject, it just does not seem to care about choosing to focus entirely on the game. Moreover, the characters do not compel themselves and you become annoyed with them: not a big one - when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
