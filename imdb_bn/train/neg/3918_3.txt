This film has been the greatest reduction in movie rentals based on IMDb Review. Overall, I've just found it as a second-rate movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Chung is certainly portable as antihiro, and the Mau thighs brightly manage her character. On the other hand, Mau wu makeup (facial hair) is so stupid that I could not take him seriously. He looks like an overweight teenager for Halloween, complete with a $ 4.95 stick-on beard. <br /> <br /> There were so many special effects that "unwanted" was good inside the house. The tree-tongue saw something like the giant Flickr of 1950, although the PV shots from the zodiac scene combined with Sam Raimi's trademark shots in the latest "Evil Dead" trilogy. Pieretechnics are almost as dull as the WHO-HUM and the final battle you can get. (Actually, it reminds me of the "Low In Space" episode, where Robinson is caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> This plot was not particularly original, and numerous fairy tales have been called the Bar in the form. There was no mystery and no plot twists. In fact, you know correctly because you have known the characters that are good, who is bad, and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I returned this image to netfix and then I sat down to write this review. I was first checked to produce the date of the work. Yes, it was 1987 ... In 1967 I did not think that it could be. And that mostly sums it up: The production value and the FX are generally of the 1960's. The plot and action seems to be very old, because Hollywood actually made some interesting and challenging movies in the 60's. <br /> <br /> ** *****
