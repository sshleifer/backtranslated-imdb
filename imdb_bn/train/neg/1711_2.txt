Well, I think Jabber's Bloodbath Trilogy was bought and it would be strange fun of the mind. Without that fun, what is it? This movie is really stupid, it is not about the development of a plot or character, or a story that is missing. The basic problem of this movie is the killing and the gore. Basically, each murder looks exactly the same. Some of ZOmbies ripping apart Yeah, okay, but you also need some original killings. I mean it really got the lam, just like the same in each kill, shooting the same way. Did the beat me? I love Gora, and this film does nothing for me. It was just boring. No storyline, the same hair view again over again with a different person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love the shotguns in video movies ... radical hair But I could not have children myself. This is a good point in this movie, but there is no one in the film. I understand that "Jumbo" helped with many floods and more than 100 jumped like Jupiter, how many people they involved and got help from the world is quite calm But overall, it's a terrible film.
