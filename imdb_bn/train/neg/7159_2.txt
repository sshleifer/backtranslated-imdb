I thought that a bad movie could not be found as a "Texas Chess Genocide Return", but the film is in competition with it. <br /> <br /> I'm watching a movie when I'm not a person, but after 15 minutes I started doing that. I woke up, and started looking at Eleven. Why do I deserve that? All movies were a torture, it would go fast for me to see it completely. <br /> <br /> I could not work on one of my favorite actors (Mr. Wallken) right now. I think he did a favor to the director, or he really needed money, because he was doing the film after the film, he was destroying himself; And so fast ... <br /> <br /> What movie? It's not a terrible, stupid plot, but it's horrible (but I really like one played by Jared Harris), the effect is very bad, the lack of death and blood etc; In three words, it has something to do. And I mean this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I look at the video cover, I become more disappointed that this picture was presented "Stephen King". I think he can never present this bad word, no? (I rent in Argentina). I do not recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 2 out of 10. (For example, I always say in my "Texas Censor Genocide Return of Review of Review", always a bad movie, why it's not worthy of 1 in 10)
