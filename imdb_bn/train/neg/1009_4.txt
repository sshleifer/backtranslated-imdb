*** Reviews may have some speakers *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Movie because it was interested and it was its top performer like Kevin Spacy and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake Palak, who is a journalist who suppresses a lawsuit that can lead corrupt police in the police force of Edison police. LL Cool J. Dade, F.A.A.T. A police officer in a special force named. (First reaction acidlet technique). She is grouped with bad police on an "On the Angle" named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we are taking away some bank robbers of Lazarov and Did, but at night they are drug addicts. I do not want to give away too much, but people become bad for drugs. Polack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a trial involving Daises and Ledger. He investigates that unclear game and Ashford, suspected that something is ugly. Wallace (Kevin Speacy) who is FRAA The team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt police to justice. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you can say that the performance of Freeman and Spesy is quite unimaginable. Dylan McDermott is the only person to deliver. She made this movie a complete nuts case and a believer from me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He said each line the same way and shows the same emotions. She was good in the deep blue sea and no paid movie like Sunday. The film starts with some nice steps but gets it through the rest of the film. Finally away from being satisfied. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this picture. I'm putting on eBay this weekend.
