If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. Omega Man comes to mind. From studio credits, they are avoiding scattered, unnecessary, big budgeting technologies that identify such movies. In addition, the set up and primes had been nice: those past four past is irrelevant to us, they are trying to stay away from a contagious infectious fatal disease. What a bad thing! I became tired of a movie endless stupid, unexpected, wimpy, void, arrogant characters. Some of the pictures that are described in some time I rented it, and repeatedly shouted to the TV, "No, do not do that!", "Why are you so stupid?", "Look!", Etc. The real lack of character development is clear in half. A movie will give you a strong personal connection with at least some characters so that you actually care about what can happen to them. This is not one of these. Also, the film should have been more involved.
