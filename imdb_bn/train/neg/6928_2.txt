All other comments have already said I'm going to say, anyway here. I thought it was first in Italy, sorry about Italy. I was not bothered because waiting for something. When did Dr. Tarar and Professor Feder sing that song? Is this Alan Personon? A Brentwood 10 pack saw this and was expected as standard, terrible. Streaks and stuff are full. The movie was an inconsistent mess. Fooled music and weird characters. The first man asked in the first minute that the doctor was worse than the patients. I thought "doctor" would not manage this "war" scene. Although there were some good looking babes. I think this fool ass movie is always throwing in a nude chick or two and that you get hooked. I gave it a 2 for the righteous women. That bird would like to drag people to pull my own eyeballs. Po was probably about 3,000 rupees in his grave when this thing came out because it was based on his story.
