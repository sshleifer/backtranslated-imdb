Film production of this wonderful waste of money, which can be stupid and insulting as rich and famous politician. Tennessee plays Williams's one (daring) and played by Joseph Lozy (with the dead body) and Taylor and Burton and Neil Coward - this project must be sure fire is projected in the palace of the mountainous mountains of the Mediterranean. Winner in 1967 when presented Universal. The result is so stupid and tedious that it almost defies faith. Apparently this movie is spectacular but it is the power of nature that allows setting and setting it to a real house instead of changing it. Taylor lying in the belt, drunk conversation, noel covered herself, makes herself funny, ridiculous and annoying viewers of plot and weird dresses. BOM is a dishonest, money and talent admired a waste and clear proof that the rest of the famous people worship can be as foolish as the rest of the world. Not even fun Just terrible and crazy wrecking waste.
