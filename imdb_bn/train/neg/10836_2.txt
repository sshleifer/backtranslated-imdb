"Magnolia" is an extravagant, malicious acting showcase that adds a little too much. Like "Aye Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a non-series of episodes, without any worries together. The camera spills through the hollowways and corridors, the sad letters glimpses. Where are the people to care for these people? The general theme looks like many people who are worried about others (excluding John C Reyri and Phillip Semur Hoffman's characters), and self-destructive jolt who are dying in pieces. I was reminded of how much I liked "Shin" because of the unwanted giant of Armin Mela-Stahl's father and mother. There are many unreasonable, unexpected characters here, why do we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> I said, there is nothing about "Magnolia". Paul is splashed onto his canvas with Thomas Anderson's ideas abandoned. The bomb has two ideas in particular. This happens at the last minute of this 188 minute. The camera flips from one character to another, and everybody sings a song from Maneer Caf√©haus Folk Music. Sweet, but ineffective, we can not see what their string is all together. The other concept that I mentioned is completely unexpected and can not be expressed differently as it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has played a great role. Especially Tom Cruise, who has stalled a performance, I do not know he was in him. And John C. Raley's recent memory is probably the most decent and really good deals. But it's all added up. When unexpected incidents happened, a girl behind me in the theater could not hold it, said, "This stupid!" My feeling will be the majority of Moviegoats agree.
