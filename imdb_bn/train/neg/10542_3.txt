Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem in his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Cabard), for which the mental extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him catch him, was resuscited with the first power. (He was given the devil after executing him on the gas chamber) and his weak body . However, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (.. who has the ability to understand what he means), must stop channing him or many women will die in his bloody hands. They would want to seek help from Lion Marguerite (Elizabeth Aleen), who tried to inform the first director-general of his Catholic Church, but denied access to a weapon that could stop channing. Channing's heart liberates the world of its wickedness. She will accept it and extend her hand to help Russell, while Channing can help Tarek to prepare for some kind of Satanic ceremony / event. <br /> <br />, Michaelit Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, Russell becomes the partner of the role .. So you know what will happen to him. Like this type of film, everyone is dying around Russell, but when he tries to kill Channing, he only kills another weak poor soul of the poor soul. <br /> <br /> Pure secrets pessimism. Finish line gate. Try Philips and Griffith, I'll give them these, but they will not have any chance in such a spark. The grave, which is usually as always as heavy, is actually handed over to nothing more than a stupid villain who leaps into the air and tosses nasty quips.
