Eh, do not flick a special good slasher. So acting, effects, decent yet familiar and unknown soundtracks. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there are about three deaths which are made for a good view, which seems to be something. In addition, many letters revolve around, do not realize what is happening, or do not pursue after the red springs; Time to kill more than humans. There is another death, and the killer is an equal chance killer, no partial implementation. The killer also likes to set up other people as innocent people kill. Identity is not revealed in the end, and the purpose is very thin, and we do not really care. <br /> <br /> The image runs near Christmas but this is not a big reason. One scene is enlightened by Christmas light, it is about it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Some dialogs are missing in some opening scenes. It should have been stronger than the end. We think we have what happened, although there is a chance to do something else.
