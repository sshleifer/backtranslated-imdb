I'm actually amazed by this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary good rating quantity. Now, I respect the opinions and beliefs of the people, in this situation, I do not believe in the educated Christian doctrine. However, the anti-Christian campaign is slightly different. <br /> <br /> This film has a valid point, but they represent very little and very biased contexts. I'm not suggesting to see it. In fact, I think everyone will have to see it and decide whether to decide on it. And the director is actually more than the one who teaches the Christian. Instead of searching for the topic, it seems like the personal obstacle of the Christian school that affected her childhood. This is not restricted to incredibly na√Øve or fundamentalists in most of Christians, there is no restriction in it. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes from film passions without permission, sets an interview with his teacher, and presents only the former and almost the only anti Christian Christian writers. I think the headmaster is the lowest world and I think his attitude was perfectly justified. I firmly suspect that any Christian believer in the interview was asked before an interview or even before the interview. <br /> <br /> As with saying this, certainly some new and interesting facts are not found here and some very basic ideas about the Christian question. But the way this whole idea is produced is often objectionable, very unusual and horribly prejudiced.
