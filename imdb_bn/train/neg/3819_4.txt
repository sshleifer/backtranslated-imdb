T.Z. Post, college professor, he gets a false letter of $ 750,000 heir. Now with financial funding, he has withdrawn his savings of $ 4,000 and eventually goes out and lives. After sending his luggage to the train in Chicago, he met a travel voodilill troupe and made good decisions for him to take a look at Broadway. On the occasions night, the poor professor post had to fix the problems of hiding from his creditors, the relationship between girlfriend Pansi and Fuji diva Allan, and still need to be sure that this program will continue. After seeing Keaton's silent gems a lot, this pain was pain, but I felt, it could be very bad. Casting Cuts Durante, Todd, and Selwyn come very annoying at times, but still preferred. A Pre-Charlie Chan Toler disappointed show director as well. 90% of the script was written badly because MGM is trying to pass it as a poor man's film as Marx Bros, where many eyesight is flattened from the beginning. At that time compiled with Keaton's drinking problems, this movie is just a sad moment in Booster's life. Rating -3
