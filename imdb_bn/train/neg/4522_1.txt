The most misogynistic movie of all time? They are not referred to by '68, should they be removed from the brown face white people playing "Indians"? Although my favorite parts are the bark of the bark wow bark bark bark bark barks bark. Rape fun! Who knew Let's see, "The Hastler" (Fat Boss's character actually handles the pool when planning to destroy Indians with leadership rebel couples), terrible acting, so nose-star-what do you think-what-think-music signals, The film lacks the lack of Indians in reality. And who do we want to be routing? I have to say that Quantin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his movie continues to compete against powerful women, I have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynistic idiot. Why did I see it, you ask? Do not ask.
