The writer's block was so badly set, or the ideas were so dry that they were forced to include a terrible scene where a young girl was defeated on the back of the van and then immediately vomited back in the car (mind you at least the price of this film briefly). Headlined one of his friends in the gunfight; on the other hand, we were already treating another woman with numerous episodes of graphic reverse; Once enough ... we got the message! This is really taking another level toilet ridiculous! If the script and the performance were good then I could easily forget that I had to see a film shot in a low budget video easily. This was a fairly original story, a clever (only) direction that we could get from the inside of the van; This way it feels more realistic. We can not see any shop, such as a shop or a field where many women have disappeared, and it can add many necessary tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible.

I want to go home' One of the girls has been followed by the psychopath; Rape victim and shot by a screwdriver, seems to be a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was horror (apart from the spell). These 5 main actresses have played acting letters during long post strike! The word was so bad that I had to see the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seemed so easy to work. It seems, he must have given the only directive: 'Skram girls' <br /> <br /> And for Screaming ...... If you see it, please make some Paracetamol ready!
