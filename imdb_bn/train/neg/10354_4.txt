I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled on this movie. After having a tender memory of a book like a child, I decided to test it. This is a movie that you must pass. <br /> <br /> This is not just valuable. It is very annoying and reluctant I think that small children too will be like this. There is no magic in the book. This movie is not awesome, but you are not taking care of yourself for ten minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The witch's character is not very good. Working like a family is a big deal that's going to happen. I know it's a children's film, so older audiences must not look very deep into us, but the whole film feels that it has been written and produced by people who have never experienced a movie before. <br /> <br /> At the final moment of the movie I was skipping the DVD and instead of trying to fix it, I stopped it and sent it back to NetFox. I do not really care how it finishes. Ignore this picture and instead read the book.
