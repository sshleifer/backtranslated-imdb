I think you want to give some points for brave courage to write a musical around the history text, but how about some decent music? <br /> <br /> Howard Desilov's cartoon performance to grab the interests of other drug kids? <br /> <br /> What is William Daniels' camp for contemporary (period) acting style appealing to the population of the 1960s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all "jokes" about New York and NJ? (I can hear Gafaving on the blue-haired broadway audience.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I found the whole piece, it is boring and very difficult for the screen
