This is a weird movie, you can call it terrible or you can sit with friends but it can make you laugh at the killer. Kinky comes back to think again and again. Amateurishly shot, even worse work and direction, perhaps someone played. Special effects are funny but music with a flying monster baby will certainly hit the biggest. See what you got while killing. But not, do not try to take it seriously. 'Porn Holocaust' has been regarded as a tribute. Since I did not see it, I can think of it as bad because of respect. It should be given 1/10, but it gave me a good smile or two, so it gets one 3. Excessive ego, nobody has worked only. If you are squeamish away, gore more than laughs Did the makers laugh to laugh?
