What a crappy movie! Worst worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No talent-what-ever-actor, stupid plot. Who wrote this script? Was there any script for this camouflage movie or did the director put the record-button on his camera accidentally and then decided to upload the image? Are these kids meant to be a movie or a comedy or what? My friends are younger brother in class 6 and he and his classmates have made an amateur-film for their school-projects that exceeded this geeky movie .. This is the worst movie of my life! There is no excuse for this flick!
