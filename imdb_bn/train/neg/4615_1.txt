I can not have the maximum attention-span, but this is the second movie that I refused to see all the way, and it even bought DVDs for "classic" conditions. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I was waiting for a resolution, something to laugh, something to interest me, but this resolution never came. Rather, the text was ridiculously amateur, the film dragged and discomforted, such as someone who spent a TV series in feature-length. The Academy was in drugs for nomination for less than 8 Oscars. <br /> <br /> Again, I repeat myself. In this second movie I refused to see all the ways through. The first was "Cleaner". I hope this gives you a hint about how bad it really is. 1/10
