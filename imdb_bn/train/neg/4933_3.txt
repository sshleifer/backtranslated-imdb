This movie was not bad when compared to the original first two sequels first. It is directed at Martin Kittsre on the 13th fame Friday. Acting is really bad, but Gore and special effects help make it interesting. I like one thing about Mad George Screaming, its effects are so wall-bound and intertwined that they'll show you a bad movie so that they know how crazy they are. . The film is not really all that poor, but there is a fantastic nasty eye rib in the midst of a toy maggat (what ??) in the middle. Mickey Rooney was present as a guest that was probably not very enthusiastic but needed money at that time, perhaps? If you like the weird 4th installment (all my 5 favorites), you probably like this one. I like better than matrix! Enjoy.
