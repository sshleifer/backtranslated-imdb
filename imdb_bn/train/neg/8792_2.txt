This film is another example of the curse of East Asian film: One or more different stories roll in one film. Other critics have probably been above it because there are a number of references to "first part" and "second part". How can you have any character development or a deep plot when characters and stories are featured for so short time? I was enjoying the first part, it suddenly stopped (it was not "ending", it just stopped happening in the middle of the story) it would be replaced by an insane and totally incredible second part which almost resembles the girl's apartment restoration and clean (Wow !) Looking forward to the day when I was given a decent script for working with Wong Kar Wai!
