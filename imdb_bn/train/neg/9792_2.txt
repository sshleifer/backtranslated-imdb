At first it should be said that I have studied fate and then based on my reasoning division. <br /> <br /> This nick disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of Monga and Ovi. It was just a hint that what it was behind was what it could be. There are many deficiencies in dough. Alcard is not a sympathetic character who secretly wishes for death. Walter's story lacks betrayal. And Nazi villains are planning to get involved in the war, completely absent. Instead, the animation makes Gary Stu Villain an incognito, which is defeated against all the intrigue. <br /> <br />, the animation is not separated from my initial complaint, but it does such a bad thing.
