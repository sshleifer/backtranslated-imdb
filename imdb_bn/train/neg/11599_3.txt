The only thing to keep this storm from the overall disaster was the attractive stylish touches. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Still it was handled nicely, especially ink bleeding and color hijacking. In addition, another good scene with a monster motorcycle. <br /> <br /> That said, I was happy that DVDs are going out of a cheap business, because it was quite awesome. I bought "Sol Survivors" at the same time and both the films were annoyed with the same dream that you have dreamed. However, there is no redeeming of "Soul Survivors", or it has made some sense, at least it has some stylish notes mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Attractive, the DVD lets you go 8 The 'nightmare' where something actually happens, the only way to see it. Scripting in creative cow's moments is rather intolerable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
