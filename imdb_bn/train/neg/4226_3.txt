Wow ... I can not believe how bad Jimmy DOOM is (archive vol. I've heard the rumor, read reviews - but I had to make my mind for myself. Well, tell me - IT Blow !!! The worst act of any film, which was involved all must have been accomplished, when everyone was involved, completely destroyed and sunny Gorer FX, a visual plot, my "The Seenematography" which my grandmother had illustrated with her camcorder, no Tinker - Made from tin-foil - The list continues and <br /> <br /> Three people are stuck on an island, where a strange c Rali plastic and tin-foil out with the sword. Two captive islands are freed with the rebels of the Ficax, and the rest of the day is being preoccupied by the "tribe" ... it is a lot more ... <br /> <br /> In real sense - this is among my most cruel movies. A. The budget was about $ 200 and was fully spent on Gore FX (which was not a bad idea ...). There is nothing else to do with the zombie dawn-together with many more W. W. Dialogues, including the humorous looking Gore scenes. This movie creates promets like any other budget: The Lord of the living dead is like Titanic. ZD can rank in some "bad-to-good" sections - and I guess you're watching it with some really drunk or high and MST3K-style friends - I guess it can be shown this way. But not by me. I hate quite a lot about it. If the Zombie Doom or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally alarming and included as a "bonus" on the release of ZD's Shock-o-Rum) Andreses suggests other works of Chechnau - then he should be banned from doing anything, never again, under a death penalty, With made There is a fun Kung-Fu war between the next half of the film, and many blood - so I will give it very generous 3/10 - please myself and avoid it.
