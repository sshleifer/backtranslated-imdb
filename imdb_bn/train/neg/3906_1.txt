I managed to kiss one night and went to the movie theater, to see this one, thinking I was in for a treat. Boy, I was wrong. Considering the genius involved, this will be the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone was wrong in this, and I think it's incredible to read this site that there are people who really liked it.
