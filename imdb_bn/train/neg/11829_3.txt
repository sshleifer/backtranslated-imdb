I watched the 82-minute "Boraat" tonight and I went around the movie, and I was quite disappointed. I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit, and I regularly go to see animated movies. Who says, I found myself and went out almost at one point, but I was waiting to make this image better. Has never happened <br /> <br /> The visuals are stunning and the top notch of the voice work, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a little bit of the title of Budubud Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is this one of its animated features for the ADD-set. It later registers as a zany slapstick routine afterwards, jumped by an space filled plot, which dragged each stop to reveal an "important message". It seems like a lot like the Oscars for Animated Division, and considering the way to score with critics, do not be surprised if the Academy makes it wrong and provides its hardware. But if you are looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, then take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
