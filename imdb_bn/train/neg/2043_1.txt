Terrible, terrible, terrible <br /> <br /> At the beginning a boring comment and some nasty autopyos are not made in a good film. Again I am convinced of the certainty and skill that some people have achieved a movie production and yet they do not feel proud that what they did is a painful scandal. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think about the feature of the release so that I could at least maintain the balance of my criticism but only I can remember that Pink's opening track was good .... I see it Wonder <br /> <br /> See your danger, annoyance can kill you.
