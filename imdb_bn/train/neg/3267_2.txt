Wonderful about 'amazing Mr. Williams'. The problem of this movie is its main actor, Melvin Douglas. She was a lousy actor and lazy with it. For most of his career, he allows his good looks for his lack of ability, a glib method and writing some good scripts (usually but not this movie). I hate Douglas as an actor before I know something about him as a personality; I have learned enough to learn and ignore his politics. I'll give credit for giving Melvin Douglas one thing: his chromosomes created incredibly talented and sexy actress Ilyana Douglas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> to calm down! 'The Amazing Mr. Williams' is a comedy, but I have never smiled. Douglas plays a general dress detective in a genocide squad named Connie Williams. I have never heard of a police detective called Kenny, but if they call him Kenneth Williams ... Well, what does he carry? The whole city is going about a serial killer because of a panic, killing women. No purpose is given for this; She just wanted to kill women. Mayor (Jonathan Hall, better than usual) brought Williams to the carpet due to failure to catch Captain. <br /> <br /> The approval of the speaker. Cheap, rude, uninterrupted, and illogical Joan Blondell plays the mayor's secretary. (She does not have enough literary words to make a character, much less type file.) Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and dogs, so it's quite obvious that they are going to end together. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < You do not want to drag Malvin Douglas! He is good on six feet, and he does not even shave that boring skull. Similarly, William Powell was the same actor as Melvine Douglas (but more talented) than the actor. When Powell made himself as a woman in 'Love Crazy', his perfection was in favor of tearing his head: a real sacrifice, Powell needed to grow up again in his next role. But whatever the role of Melvin Douglas in this film is not even a razor. He plays his drag scenes with the same annoying reminder he used throughout his career. The Amazing Mr. Williams has some great supporters who made Hollywood movies. 30 'so delightful. Edward Brofey is bright here, touched as a criminal and gets fun, who gets unlucky furlough from his life sentence. Enemy Donald MacBride is a policeman who has misunderstood the killer, and he is frequently lynched by the public. Ruth Donnelly is pretty: as usual for her, but here she gets the chance to show her talent away from Warner's Brothers backlot from her usual room. Jimmy Conlin, Lewis Alberni, and Greens Dave Willock are all right in the small land. Barbara Paper (which I usually dislike) is also good here. Fairly unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some screen time; I always hate him, and he gives the same performance of every movie ... but some viewers enjoy Ibern's one-note performance, the reasons I can not feel. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with Hollywood character actor in the 1930s and the role they play, then tell you a murderer of IMDB's cast list. The problem with 'The Amazing Mr. Williams': Everything is very clear. I will rate this movie by 2 points by 10 points.
