Yes, my death is clearly better than watching the tunnels. Indeed, some of the deaths were quite real and Gore was good. It was like a misty horse riding a mountain. But <br /> <br />: 1.) When "children" (high school or college?) are discussing a horror movie in the kitchen, then everything is almost a correct quote from Scrim (1996). Big breasted girls etc .. <br /> <br /> 2.) Did Steve do not have painful Randie from Scrum? 3.) In addition to what happened in October, what was the relationship with the movie with the movie? Extremely unnecessary if you ask me I think it's ridiculous when the horror movies of the 80's were ended when I pointed towards the fingers in a dragon or paingram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow they've created Sam Raimi reference !!! 5.) Why Gary and his sister are in this movie? They had nothing to do with some of the characters. And so psychic that he could not even see his own death? 6) When Gary died in the bathroom (at that time, deaths were only tromba-lucieas) how could she hear scream when she was down, but she could not hear if the door was closed? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggie - which is primarily Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So if you are a shayi and do not have fun or do not laugh the whole picture, will you survive? 9.) The mutants were quite calm, but they started walking to the Chilean Connor's diet. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve Had stayed there and was surprised she went? 11.) There were not many killers? The moth laughs, but they do not face any other. <br /> <br /> 12.) Did the others give flashbacks? Half of them do not know that they are dead or alive, so what was with her? 13.) Why did not they kill Gary and his sister? 14. Why did not anyone call the police? And obviously everyone knew who lived in woods, why did they not carry out any kind of attack? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires- so how is he "turned" one at the end? I am with everyone else on the monster "Haha?" Finally <br /> <br /> <br /> The death is better than the tunnel, but still quite drunk Considering the involvement of Samhain's plot, they still do not understand why they are in Ireland.
