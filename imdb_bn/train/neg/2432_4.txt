Do not say a lot to this one. In the first 10 minutes you can make a plot quite a lot. There is nothing too wrong with this movie, very little action for an action film. Occasionally there was an opportunity to explore letter emotions. I'm still uncertain whether an action film is the right style to do this. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without paying attention, because it was a little twist and available plots. I was probably guilty of it, so it might be better with the second watch or with continuous attention. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (But in my best 10 of 10)
