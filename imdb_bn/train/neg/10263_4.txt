Yes, The Southern Star has a beautifully forgotten headline in the song set by the heavy set of Crona Matt Manoro. It miscast nicely with George Segal and Ursula Andr√© as an adventure couple in a large diamond search, this bloated and founded a lot of tone for rather dull features. Harry Andrews (with a strange pronunciation, a minimalist) a snowfall, a stock of wildlife stock, and minimal writing and soft photography by Raul Cortard, and you are connected to the totally unreasonable ramp through Senegalese jungle.
