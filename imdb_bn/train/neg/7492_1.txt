Apparently, most visitors do not know anything about Europe, history, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe as well as the history of Hitler and the Stalin era. NÃ¼rburg (and many forgotten trials throughout Europe) were the revenge and injustice to the winners. Do you think there was no American, British, French or Soviet protesters after WWII? Any American, British etc. were war crimes? No Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, no Dresden, no hamburgers, no Berlin, no Katyn and so did? The Germans were also war criminals, but the justice in Nuremberg was not in actual consideration. The main points were: VE won! Germany will be destroyed! (This was a book titled in America in 1941.) <br /> <br /> This picture is a terrible, unconscious American brainwashing machine, wrong, false, propaganda, impartiality and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... why was the New Yorkberg process not enough? This picture is a nightmare. After 60 years of total darkness! In Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on this dark (and the lack of hatred and atrocities and lack of self-criticism) are the real reasons for the killing. And there is no war criminal in America ... Bravo, America! Very clever Even Stalino will be jealous ...
