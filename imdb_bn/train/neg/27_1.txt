Terrible movie Nafe Saeed. <br /> <br /> These lines are just fillers. The movie was bad. I do not know why to expand that. It is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting sucks and writing is just moronic. All the way is bad. The only good thing about the film is the Dennis Acquired Breasts. Even though that was a terrible and unneeded rape was destroyed by the scene though. The movie is made of weakly and completely incredible pieces. <br /> <br /> Okay, I am going to send the lowest textbook for this brutal rule at IMDB now. First of all I wasted my time watching this offal. Then I feel obliged to warn others I've created an account with IMDB only to find out how bad I am to publish it to discover that I have to write the Fragazine article in the film. Completely unnecessary.
