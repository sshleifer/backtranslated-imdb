Playing Skippy Eddy from "Family Relations", gets picked on a wussy 'metal' who nerd. When Sammy Carr, who died of his favorite 'metal' singer, then he scattered all the posters of his bedroom wall. But later when he received an unbroken record containing the body of the 'metal' idol of his body. He sucked in the ideas of first revenge, but then he does not want to take it as Sammi. Which really does not seem to go to the hospital of its main victims until that. This film is almost ridiculous and there is a lot to do with the real metal like "Rock Star". OK, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my points. And there is a formula I can root anyone for a guy played by Skippy from "family mortgages". Jean Simons's chemistry is okay, and Og Osborn has reached the congratulations, I congratulate him on her, but otherwise avoid it. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Candy: Alice Richards gets extra, extra in addition to topple at the pooling party
