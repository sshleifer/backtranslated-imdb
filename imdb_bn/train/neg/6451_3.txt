"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) has collected a team from High School to reconsider the cabin's position where his two brothers Wess was absent. If they were there, a reptile creature in the form of a human being (reminds me of Gilman's reminder from the creation of the black leggue) waiting for the right time to choose one after the other in the desert. A biker, Alan Ripley-type is a bad-ass female, CAT (Chess Mastersson) is an underground military bunker in which he exercises the test, as it also works as a safety net from blood clots. CAT knows more than he (he suffered loss of a child), but there is another innovation point that most of the team has no idea. This creature can be more human than them ... and some of its former identity can be hidden on the deception, except that another person is hiding after Wase's death. Cats contain many mysteries that the group unlocks near the cabin. Thankfully, a large part of the film stays away from animals which jump into the air and we also see through the eyes when the lazy screen. This movie has Dawson's Crick-type Melredramatics, which often prevents any real tension created in a small giant film. Eliciting directions in the direction is rather very bland leading to a relatively dull experience. Cast rather life less and reluctant. Pretty Maggie Grace (The Fog Remake) may be the only draw for this photo.
