This effectively affects the transformation of a girl in the adult, and the family is very sensitive and innovative with the experience of cultural conflicts with experience. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is aimless and highly religious conflict, road construction projects, secondary and even quarterly sexual life, a mysterious person living in the forest, a bunch of racist gangsters, at least three different Carnival, The complexity of the local church politics, and and over and over. And it also does not include the real central plot, which is only about the expectation, dreams and frustration of two girls (and their entire family) while bending their life. When I realized that the whole thing happened in the whole summer (and the so many films that were done within 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is composer, every plot point is predictable, major life changes The incident happened and then forgot about 10 minutes ... and some incidents are very annoying. The most shiny one that involves a horrific crime (fully expected "turn") and then completely forgiven and forgotten since the whole incident. Similarly, a second character dies completely after a few minutes and another "wrapping" is provided. It is completely mechanical, ultimately related to all the loose ends (well, not only movies but also thinks that you think about it).
