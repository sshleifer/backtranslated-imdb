The first of all these movies is not a comedy; Unless you really can force yourself to laugh hardly Second, the movie is slow and annoying. Acting is not bad but special. In a small town to fight each other, there are two Lucky Luke comics (with one big bigger ear and one big ear) ... If you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie, you can laugh much more. Religion and dogmas are not the best sources for a good comedy, and this film is nothing more than justifying this rule. Comedy has similar topics like 'Home Teacher'; This was some good moments. My final comment is: Do not waste your time and money to see this vague and annoying movie.
