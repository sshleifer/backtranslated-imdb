I wanted to enjoy this movie. It was very slow to move and boring. If it is on TV it lasts 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer had a defective foundation. If it is dependent on directing life, then why did not anyone see his writing as "loose"? He then directed it at a snap motion that could be the source of some people who had stopped during filming. The music is transmitted, but for a different movie, it is not ... Soap opera seems likely. There was a time when Armen was talking about Maula's story and did not understand the dialogue. I was not alone, because I heard a few nails about who told me. Why can not Hollywood make good movies? This one was a great story nugget, but only poorly executed.
