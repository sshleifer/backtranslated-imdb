This DVD is noticed to anyone that it will only keep it and run it in the continuous loop in the background. It is organized as a continuation of the Grand Canyon music videos, which sets the pieces of Tangerine Dream music into pieces. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is slow and slow, instead of being transferred to DVD, and is shown gradually. Is it a very expensive DVD?
