I'm sitting in the middle of this television, why did I think? Why Dianne Keaton agree on this trash? The film uses the pointless, closed plot line to distribute trash in thousands of homes. A new level of cinema takes a political agenda. The film was meaningless, and all credibility was lost due to excessive use of stereotype. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Ketan tried to make this movie a suitable creator, but in the end he must remember the old adage that you can not polish a bird. I hope you do not see your new year's day as another stupid movie. I know now why the networks started bringing series on Sunday night, to get rid of our trash!
