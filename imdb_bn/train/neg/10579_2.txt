IMDb Takashi Mike was banned in the Master of Horror-segment, Imprint, USA. So I think I will translate the Swedish review I just wrote for it ... <br /> <br /> There is no hope of this episode of Ikir's killer-director Takashi Mike. Series And the Imprint's DVD-cover seems to be very effective. <br /> <br /> It's happened in a remote Japanese birdloos for most of the 19th century and it talks about a journalist's story. Como, the woman he has left behind, and for which he promised to come back. Tired and discouraged he reached at bordello, hope this will end his long journey. It proves that one of the prostitutes, perverted and calm girl, knows about Como, and the violent man tells him where he is and what has happened since then. The story that he told him was frustrating as disappointing! <br /> <br /> The first episode hit me for this episode, how irrelevant it was that the Japanese cast was a clear American in English - English. But I will leave it, this is not a big deal. It is a big deal but the rest is tragic. Miike's story continues so slowly that in 63 minutes I could not help watching my watch several times. The extended pair-scene, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, is unsupported - and pornographic confusing - even the scene did not become attractive. I just felt like it was violent for violence - with no sense of style or purpose. The only scene that excited any kind of emotion from me, was the picture of bloody embryo images immediately below the water flowing ... and, honestly, they felt only the only passion excited. <br /> <br /> Journalist Billy Drago played the love behind him, the most memorable for me, like Frank Nitti - White Claude Killer of Al Capone in Brian de Palmas de Ach√©bles (1987). I always thought Nitessi's Drugs Screenplay was very painful (and I mean it in a good way), and perhaps I was almost nervous when I found him very scared (not good) for this reason. One. His acting can flow into any feeling or sympathy, which can actually lead to some bad reactions. When his character was reacting to the horror, Como was sitting in a sofa and turned out to be trying to escape from the horrific act that Drogo had shown. I am grateful that most of the stories are Yuko Kudhh (a Gaisha, a reminder of 2005), who played the distorted prostitute. <br /> <br /> The last part may be frustrating, maybe it could be rebellious and horrible, but I just saw it like this ... you know ... "Blah" (and I was looking at my watch again, umptieth time, just want to end the crappy episode). Maybe the last one laughs me a little, but thinking of a part of Red Dwarf's episode and the tops of Craig Charles and Danny John-Juals could not figure out, because there was an eye on their eyes. They look like the alien ... lucky, if you've seen that episode and want to look now, I'll forever ruin your last scene. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when finally the impression was over, it was the only thing that made the pain of seeing it, listening to Edward Sheram's main title theme (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series Is) and - if there is anything - a big friggin warning, what do you think? <br /> <br /> One can dictate the costume design, by Kitico, and say, at least, there is nothing lacking in style and refinement .. But there are many other films and TV shows that are much better than showing Japanese "Gaisha-Fashion" This is nothing but inferior but I am disappointed. Tacky Mike's Masters of Horror-Episode is boring, vague and unmatched. In other words; Really, really BAD!
