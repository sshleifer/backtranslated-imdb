Do not bother trying to see this terrible mini series. This is a six-hour bore, an incredible love triangle which is not absolutely chemistry for each other. This story has no heat, no real passion, no real romance. It is a dry, annoying, drawn-out, and uninspired as they come. And it does not even meet the expected level of technical expertise. Take six hours of your life and use them to do something better.
