This movie was just bad down. I like shooting movies and usually come away from most movies and could find something I like, but it was not one of them. There was a lack of substance and intensity in this film. I get it, Finns raises the hell of a war and it's great, but the story is bad. You have no actual connection to any characters and there is no real story line to follow. If you just go from one random view to the other side, the story that is trying to be stated is not flowing the structure. If you want a war movie that keeps you annoying and surprising enough, without the battlefield, then I'll recommend "Downfall" (WWII German Film). Or if you like a big storyline and a lot of activities, I'll recommend "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean Film). These two movies will not disappoint you as a winter war.
