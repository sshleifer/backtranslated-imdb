I do not often comment on movies, but I have seen 5 reviews of this "movie" and decided that I had my own review. A trainer in mine received this image in the mail, mixed his academy with the screeners (AMPAS, who had voted on the Oscars), and how ruthless this film was, was so enlightened that he brought us to class. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in this picture, the scenes are horrific, highly edited (often used in wrong "24" style photo-in-picture techniques), and In most cases, objectionable, performance (especially lead, even failing to act as a bad actress) Someone actually failed to understand the role of a role, that is, the plot set up. No setup! I did not own halfway through this movie, and the rest of the class knew what the film could be. Open Crane shot, which sets any kind of killer, has never been addressed, and now I think about it, perhaps it was meant to be a flash-forward, the rest of the image was flashback, but it decreased. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At times, this film gives me new confidence in the power to make my own film.
