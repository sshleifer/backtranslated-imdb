This whole hobby of film was directed by Bill Rebin, who was partly responsible for the genuinely notorious anti-classic Monster Ago. When I was near the cold end, I reached the incredible conclusion that the picture was worse than the 60's. The story ?? As it is ?? Three unreal Millionaires inviting a group of people in their remote palaces to play a series of MacBerry games Anyone who has managed to survive the end and ultimately survive $ 1,000,000 will win. This is a very simple plot but Rebane is still managed to manage the stranglehold stance in some way. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes sense too much. And then it ends. Weirdly I mean exactly what is all finished? I guess you have left to draw your own decision. Production value and performance is without question of the value of a pornographic movie. Pamela Rohlader (Shelley) is not really good at all. She is so incredibly awesome she is mandatory. Sadly the same thing can not be said about this shit-festival, it's just a contract basement rotor.
