OK, the box looks promising. Standing beside Danny Glover, Hyupie Goldberg imitates the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in at least five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy And I must admit I'm laughing about ten minutes after the end. The film has the following elements: a hateful and insulting neighbor, annoying legal justice, rushing, talking about lining, and death and arson. Ridiculous, huh? No, please, if you do not hear any reviews, please do so here. You can not even force yourself to see this bogus. Shit! I said, tremble! Should anyone put this name there should indeed be sued.
