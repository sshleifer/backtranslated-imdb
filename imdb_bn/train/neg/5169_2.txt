WARNING: I advised anyone who did not read this movie yet. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see them all, Hamillats confirmed that a fun entertaining entertainer was done, which it was not to entertain me !!!! I thought that this film was a bit of a horror story, a stupid plot and a turn at the end of the movie, which was very annoying !!! OK, so people who eat other people. Yes ... notice I did not call people human, because they are not humans, or I wait they feel, oh no, hello, they did not tell you !!!! So okay, these people are cannibals, or they are imbreds, or what they do !!!!! I mean, maybe they just came to see the "thing" that people like to taste or, they have eaten cannibals for a long time, or maybe this movie was Horizontal !! Is it !!! !!! So if you think Hamilton is good, why would I ask you why, why, why, why was so cool? To me it was terrible horrible !!! Hamilton for a big book !!! Go away, tooth and nail, or Borderland Entertainment for entertainment!
