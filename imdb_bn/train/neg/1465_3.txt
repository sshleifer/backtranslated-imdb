Firstly, I want to add that I am like a historian, so what I look for in a film based on historical facts is actually based on historical facts. But this case is not here though. Of course the movie is entertaining and all but based on the fact, it is not really annoying. Hitler was not semitic against his anti-youth, he even worked for the Jews before World War One. But it was a time of world war, and after that he wrote his opinion about the Jews. Its upheaval in this movie was not an annoying little brat as a child of Hitler. He had a less or less usual encouragement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was not impressed and unstable as the Portrait-Ed here. In his short years, he was a characteristic personality, who through his character made man "fascinating". His unstable behavior and anger bursts started at the bending point of war. <br /> <br /> I want to see a movie about Hitler's life which is based on historical facts and not complaining. Hitler and others, for example, when people point to a blaming finger, I really hate and tell the wrong stories to draw their pictures as pure evil. Actually it is really good to tell stories, because it was what everyone can learn! Anyone behind this movie did some research before making it. Because they think that they do not know what actually happened. Hitler did not even fired in revolutionary procession, his shoulders left his socket. <br /> <br /> Seeing this gives you more to see a good documentary.
