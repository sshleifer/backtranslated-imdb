Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through a bad time in personal life, not for her career. After being a cruel boy actress, she was obscured with low-quality mediocre films. He has been saved from the dark past, this image remains as a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The image begins with an attractive compound, which is very memorable from Brian de Palmer's "Rising Kain"; With the story set for a horror / thriller that has multiple personality disorders with a plot. Barrymore's star, Holly Goodning, a young girl who is trying to create a new life in California after her tragic past, apparently her other personality killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past comes back to Hunt as her evil personality, willing to destroy her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of chaos, Patrick Hyss Myth (George Newburn), trying to help her to face her past giants. <br /> <br /> In contrast to De Palma's underlying thriller, most of the "Dopelganj" is a middle film that does not fulfill its purpose, it ends in the worst ending conclusion of movie history. Although Barrymore is certainly not his best player, he dignifies with the above average performance. Although the rest are in moderate to painfully bad over-the-top performances, Leslie Hope manages to be the best among them. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and the effect of de Palma is quite obvious. Although the movie tries to create literary references in almost every line, but dialogues are neutral and wood acting must not do any good work. It has a fair share of nudity and extraordinary reasons and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects are accomplished by the outstanding KNB and in fact it is one of the few good things in the film. However, the strange use of effects in the last context in the entire context reduces the effect of KNB's work and makes it wonderable in a different movie. <br /> <br /> This is not an excuse for a low quality BMW, as it could be an attractive movie with a better and more coherent script. Sadly, we all have a middle film that gets worse every second. Eligible for the beauty of Barrymore. 3/10
