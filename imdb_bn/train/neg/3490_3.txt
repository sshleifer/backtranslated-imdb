After enjoying Gene Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was finalized, so I tried to get out of the investigation of a jockey death through this second-string screwball - but I did not finish it until the end. Orthar, a picture of the film, the movie magazine fashion, which wants a misunderstanding from another husband William Powell or other wedding shot, but I never feel for him because the character is just a string of advertising (he is a heroine trend type), but once a maghbazar Inside - 30 of all the humorous women - she faints). William Powell has worked with Mrs. Arthur for a long time, but you never know it from the end result; They look weird standing next to each other, hesitant over their banner. Powell's valent playing actor is frustrating, the audience's laugh break is integral.
