In this "film" low-budget, handheld camera tried to prove Flickr's follow-up to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one, fails, and how. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that so many so-called "awards" garbage has entered into this leafy city ... it makes you wonder what they did when these critics submitted it .... <br /> <br /> Failed to describe how words really dissatisfied the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Do not forget to play ABYSMAL, a complete and reliably durable piece of this so-called movie creation. <br /> <br /> It does not have any redemption qualities, seriously - whatever. Save your cash and show a tremendous low budget glare, there's plenty of it - Dead End, Blair Witch, REC, but a few names. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or time in this piece of trash by pretending to be a true movie. <br /> <br /> Think of all the other comments! You have been warned!
