One wonders why this image was made: If this plot is not ridiculous then it is absolutely incredible, characters (small verses experienced crane, very fascinating) are completely expected, completely unclear and impossible to understand (maybe after a few philosophies but for this you are a MNS There must be a tendency; to read the book to fully understand this concept) and the act is bad. French filmmakers showed the basic concept of incorporating "Americans" and "silly lambs" like Americans in that continuity? If so, it is a total failure. Although it was quite successful (and has a culture condition like the first French serial killer film) and it seems that it is considered to be a good product for exporting. Strange.
