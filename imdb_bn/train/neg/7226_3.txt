I love comics Although I understand the story completely have problems ?? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought what I was prepared for. Wonderfully I understand the main plot ?? But some extremely weak decisions where made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - looks really bad "CJ man actor" - close ups? ?? Why? It does not work at all !! Horus - and other Egyption deities - were successfully created in CG and very comic versions. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a civilized movie with real actors. <br /> <br /> What a shame!
