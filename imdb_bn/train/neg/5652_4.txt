This is not a bad movie ... but your girlfriend shows you this type of type. The story is not bad .... It takes only one and a half hours. It is difficult for me to remove this film because I really like its opinion but the story was long and thin ... very bad. The main character does not really seem to change that all from the beginning to the end. I go through some "life changes" and he can barely break a smile. I really had the Mac really good. His strange curiosity prevented the movie from being completely disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this film. If someone can explain it to me, I want to know.
