Mary Lou is a spirit whose soul seeks their revenge, let those who come back to its firing in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie was originally performed in 1986. The movie falls in the strangest 80's <br /> <br /> However, Mary Lou's soul tries to do bad things to people and tries to take the body of a person / stupid special effects. Whether he is successful or not, you have to find out. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is based on mostly boring and vain character clusters. This is not really a sequel, the only thing that gets matched with the first is the name of the high school. It's average. The horrific blur falls behind, the eagle, the nude nudity, the Catholic Church. The main element, the annoying movie. <br /> <br /> Activated enough to give 3 out of 10 You can waste your time while doing something else.
