One day after the work, I became relaxed and became a movie channel. The movie came over on the guide and started interesting so I tuned it before it started. The first 30 minutes was enough to make me interested, but the lack of ability to play Jamie Fox and slow movement movement would make me want to get up and find food during filming. If you have any credit for acting in this film, it will go to David Morsh, who tries to make the movie attractive. After all, do not plan to influence your friends by selecting it as a tenant for the movie night.
