What was the worst movie of 2003? "Hat cat?" "Gigli?" Mother! I propose that this was a harmful little film from the beginning of the year. Written badly, badly edited, and (if I can be so brave) is played badly, the black hole in the movie "The Order" - a movie is not so dense, even from the smallest entertainment from the horizon of the event of the suck. It's not even accidentally funny, such as ("for example") shows. <br /> <br /> You know that the producers are estimating that their audience is not going to be smart. They originally renamed the name "The Sineta Eaters", because they thought America was too stupid to understand the sinful voters, even though they went a long way in explaining what a movie voter was a sinner. Instead, they saw a completely generic title and opened a photo of the White Laser where you were enough to reach there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, you know, they were right! My former girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me. Congratulations, the producer, you've met your target market. He liked "Grease II", so you're in good company. At the top of the topic <br /> <br /> Heith is a certain Catholic monk (you guessed it) that the counselor of the attempt to investigate the assassination. He has selfishness, probably because no one will believe in his right mind that he knows little about religion, less than a divine beggar. The only other member of this order is a funny alcohol folk. As much as I wanted to see the return of funny alcoholism to the big screen, his humorous efforts reminded me of all the Darks in my high school, who imitated Monty Python, they think that if they like exactly Pythons they will be automatically fun. You know what kind of people I'm talking about <br /> <br /> If I say anything else, then I'll be in danger of producing spoilers. Actually, it was really for me to ruin this movie.
