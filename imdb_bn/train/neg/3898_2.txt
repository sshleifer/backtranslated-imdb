I'm so sorry, I know that Fasibinder is still considered the best director of post-war Germany, and most of his films are considered "master pieces", but in 2004, when I could see "Lily Marlen". Wondered everyone is up to this movie and away! Acting is terrible - Hannah Shuigla is all very happy! - Changes between Nazi-glamor and the battlefield are ridiculous, the whole film seems like it is made within two days of a detective. Perhaps it was the same and many people consider it to be "real art," but for me this film is just bad and cheap. Compare Wisconts to "La Kadut Degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lily Marlen" is a good movie ...
