For $ 2, Roger's Video Store bought this movie. I've now enjoyed a good B movie and then it looks like a good one. <br /> <br /> This film is "quite narrow and very playful for" 1970s ". Unfortunately the storyline is difficult to follow and many things happen in movies. Actually, after watching it for 45 minutes, I stopped it, and after one week, I could see how slowly I could see the whole thing. <br /> <br /> This picture has good spots, but you wait and wait and wait ....... <br /> <br /> If you're in B movie then it's just for you. Maybe, just be careful that the film is slow and not high. Really happens, and I do not mention many story lines ... <br /> <br />
