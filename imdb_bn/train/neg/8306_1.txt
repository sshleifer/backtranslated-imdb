Brick's passion with Daniel Smith is frustrating. Leave alone. With all the constant attention he will probably become psychologist, depressed or bad up. Princess Diana and how she feels wished for privacy. Now the poor little rich daughter Ashley Olson just wants to stay alone. No wonder that Greta Garbo has become a laugh and said "I want to be alone". ET cut this little girl? Is there nothing good to report it? I do not care that many people who really did have her birthday cake and balloon color. However, I have never heard that Anna Nicol won any court case against Will and his legacy. Who is paying for Larry, Howard, and the little Daniel Lifestyle? Could it be ET?
