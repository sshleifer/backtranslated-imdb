Oh man, I know what you think: "With a title like that, I can not go wrong!" Yes yes you can I also like the title, but I hate the intelligent child who was "a little helper of Satan", I also hated my mother, and my sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated them all! People, it was the torment that saw this sometimes! Just do not get 1/10 because becuz are less condadidering the budget, they are okay. But oh man, I hate those actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be worse, I suppose they saved lots of money by using Halloween masks for the killers, and finally Jesus' dress was stupid. Oh sorry, do not look!
