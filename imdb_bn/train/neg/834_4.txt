I found this time, to be a perfect waste of effort and money. I know Disney always showcases lack of creativity when creating "direct video" - but with the "new perspective," the plot of the original movie is always low when it is repeated ... soon again they will be able to re-release new movies and new movies with new songs and It's called "a new version that we all love". Nathan Lane wondered back to his role in Timon again. The real "Lion King" Timmy and Pumba, an animated creature of the world, started a narrative journey that really happened to us the real story ... as they saw. <br /> <br /> <br /> Timon is now the protagonist of the story, Jadad Jadad Jad, Lord Buddha ... <br /> <br /> Musical sequences of long and animation shit Voice talent is impressive for a video feature, but again, when you remember Matthew Broderick, Hupi Goldberg or Nathan Lane is having something of real commercial material? Overall you'll hate this if you prefer the original. It is humiliating because it is equally wrong for children and adults. And that sums up about it.
