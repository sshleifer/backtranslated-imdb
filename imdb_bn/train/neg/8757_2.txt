Apparently, a movie that predicts upcoming trends in British films, it's so laughable that it's ridiculous. Tommy fast? Hive? A song from the movie DOES Spencer Davis Group, included by two creatures, and Beatles live film operates live versions of their twists and shoots (all 1:20). But above all, a strange exhibition of British music in 1964. Oh, and Harman's Harmites.
