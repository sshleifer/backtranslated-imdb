The beginning of this movie is a great sound and some nice laughing, but if the movie changes once it gets animated, it quickly lose its appeal. <br /> <br /> There was at least one reason for me that many animation colors were very silent, very silent. It does not look good at at least VHS. Once it breaks and looks great, but not often, also come the letters and go very fast. For example, I'd like to see more "Moby Dick." When the movie starts to pull, it again comes back with the Dragon's portal and the film is strong. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not memorable or capable enough to compete with animated movies over the past dozen years.
