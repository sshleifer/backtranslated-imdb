From the category of good and funny cartoon series, in the last three or four years, two years old, two years old and indeed horrific tournaments due to "ragatats", obviously the clerk-sepote should stay away from the idea of ​​the militants. After dumbing all the letters down, even adding some stupider, replacing some voices (although I like the nancy cartwright, he does not have Chucky Finster!), And there are no ideas of continuity (ex .:: The day I saw another in Kimi, Tommy and Chuck everyone. The new puppy has been found; but the dog mentioned above on the next episode has never appeared), you might think that the makers can kill Sho for displaying kindness. But noooo <br /> <br /> I say this special issue that sucks it! Even though not as terrible as the crocodile episode, even with the grandfather (my god! He used to be the best character of the show but now he has no real purpose) Finishing is unexpectedly fluffy, and this and other crappy new episodes ('98 -0101) are the only things that kids can contact with adults. Oh, what a fun! <br /> <br /> There is no star for "Ragatats all grade up". Klasky-Csupo, remove this show before it gets any worse.
