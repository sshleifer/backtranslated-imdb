There is a dark fairy tale of 'Maldolosenna', with its children's plays, forest setting and the discovery of the remains of a fort. Yet at its core, the film is basically an unusual sexual survey of teenagers. Fabrizio Wrestle begins with a sequence of dreams to apply the impeccable metaphor of her moving hunk, the film promises Laura's mental torture, her love for the girl, and her romance story with the same malicious syllabia. The film's mental complexity does not qualify for the film, but there is no doubt that the image of nudity and sex is unnecessarily absorbed. The look of the film relies more on its superb position rather than the particular cinematographic skills, and the film's greatest asset is frustrating, and there is no doubt that the children's singer-accompanying soundtracks. With the quality of his strange dreams, the film is quite interesting, but in the same era, the guests of Louis Malel and the bright 'black moon' next. For the sake of pornography, the ability to debate, in contrast to many banned movies, 'Saloon' of Pasolini or 'Why Park' of Larry Clark, for example, the film is unknown from an artistic perspective. It seems that the movie has lost its ability to shake slowly, so perhaps Maladolensenza should be praised for maintaining this power for thirty years after being released. But the shock value alone is one reason the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The image has a protector. Still not so in Nazism.
