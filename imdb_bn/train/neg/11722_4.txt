The contractor's problem is summarized by the opening scene. Black ops killer James Dial contacts so the CIA want an international terrorist dead. Terrorists are appearing in London's Old Bailey Court, why do they want to stop terrorists when they spend the rest of their lives in jail? He is going to be out of the way in any way. Did the CIA not have the chance before the arrest? Through some scope he does not get a guilty verdict, then kill him. There is no logical reason to kill anyone in the highest security jurisdiction. <br /> <br /> Because the premises sets the story, the audience may prefer to ignore the plot hole, but the Ascension itself pumps the fuel into the fire. Dial colleagues are running a police bullet and crashes in the taxi but the dial is managed to escape. So can anyone be caught by some of whom, some of whom can be seen by some of whom somebody else? Congratulations to such a plot. Then the dial said to a police inspector, "The airport is surrounded by armed coppers" and still runs the dial to escape easily without explanation. The whole picture cheats its audience depending on the things that are not explained. This is an important supporter of Emily Day. Why does he help a wanted fugitive though? Your guess is just like me <br /> <br /> This is a fairly poor thriller and "big name" will not be taken by casting. Wesley Snipps used to qualify as a film star but acted in more inconsistent films and killed her career. Charles Dancing also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions as Holi and Ellen 3 in the big career but again this is someone known for appearing directly at renting the best DVDs, and he is basically playing a camio role. Lane Headie's choices may be a big player in the movie, but they must fail to start their resume
