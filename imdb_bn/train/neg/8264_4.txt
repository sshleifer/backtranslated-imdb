This is a film where the actor is fined with all the fine, especially Brigad Bacca and Eric Paladino, in a film where every three couples meet with a situation that seems to force the screen to rise or make the story dynamic. In other words, they seem to have turned into a movie scene, not in real life. Even women working in pip parlors have ever come out with one of their customers, but this does not seem to be realistic in writing. Also, when one of the characters meets the film's overweight girl, it seems artificial, just as they argue between each other. Again, the actor is all good, and the moments of this movie are beautiful, but overall another indie, which can use some rewrite before production begins.
