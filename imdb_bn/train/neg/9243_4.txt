To do this simply, I'm not western lover. And I have never been sitting from the beginning to the end, I decided to look at "my darling clematine" and looking at all the ways by seeing how painful it was for me. Initially it was as excruciating as expected. I played Sunny, Scenery (Your Value Dessert, Horse and Cowboys) got teetering music and its time on the annoying and painful edge. However, after talking about fighting myself psychologically, it became easy for me to endure the first 20 minutes. Focusing on cinematography, and John Ford was able to do even the worst conditions (which I think was dust in my opinion), it became interesting several times, it was much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not say that I finally enjoyed the movie. But it ended very well for me, which ended me, and she influenced herself.
