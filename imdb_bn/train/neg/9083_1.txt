It was so terrible. It was not fun to see it all. Even the scene where the girl is using vibration, even the movie is not too fun to see. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with the composer is not even fun to watch. Or if you saw the only part of the movie that is just the girl of the couch using the vibrator. Maybe they could reveal a scene in the theater, maybe the film would be enjoyable at a certain level. My suggestion, at that moment, fast forward, see it, movie revival, see it again, review, repeat. Perhaps you can enjoy yourself for that way in 2 hours. I have never seen this movie in my grave and any bad movie of the dual generation.
