This movie really shows her age. The print that I saw was terrible because of age, but there is a better print. However, this was not the main problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was originally a silent film that only deaf dialogue (only a few sentences) was spread in the film's most amateur version. Sometimes the letters turn back or they talk with their hands on their face - a merciful effort to loosen all their lips and hide that "cleaverly" (?) The film is w Well, it is true that this check film needs to be dubbed in many languages, but it was really stupid and clear to do this. It just looked cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked less budgety and stupid. Although it is a matter of shame, because there was a grain of good story - a young girl who is married to any older man and / or women has no interest. But in the 21st century, some people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. Naked (and somewhat glossy) Hudi Lamarr even with a few glimpses, that's not the price of all that fuss with the film when it debuted. Even with the standard of 1933, this image was a badly made bud. The only interesting thing about the picture is how Lamar showed different looks than the creation of Glamor's Hollywood in 1936 when he came to America - he looks like 2 completely different people. <br /> <br /> This is not an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, I do not see such rave reviews have been achieved. For technical issues alone, the movie can not rate anything up to 10 or something.
