The film's main error is its underlying script. It goes back in Betty's story format and the reconstruction of clo-short films. Klaw's reconstruction is working well, unnecessary reviving them completely around them. Page Richards, though not a wonderful actress, has done a decent job overall. And, occasionally, he carries an extraordinary similarity to Bettie. Also note some of the trusted details of the note. Clothing and clothing work well, as some in the direction of the set. The set is usually unusual and the stage-Y feels, but the era seems to be. It's sometimes surprisingly well-lit and the color palette clearly makes sense, which gives a vibrant, retro feel overall.
