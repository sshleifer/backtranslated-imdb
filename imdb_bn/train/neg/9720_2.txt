This movie is simply boring. <br /> <br /> It tries to copy some of the effects of creative directors such as "Amelie Pullen" Zunate, but it's too much. The dialogues are bad, something bad I've ever heard, Gilim Kennett is not convinced (I almost did not find him very firmly), his father played very badly in the movie, the story is stupid, the end .. <br /> <br /> I think I did not like much more movies than "Le Pact Des Lups" from Christophen Gans (and I watch about 80-100 movies a year), but at least Ei some action movie and there were a lot of good actors. <br /> <br /> I could not comment here (only rated), and when I saw ratings and comments, I thought I'd write down somewhat. <br /> <br /> I guess we will not have any problems to sell our DVDs: Our big collection is not bad movie !!! <br /> <br /> I'm open minded (I'm SF, Western, Drama, Comedy, Silent, Awesome, Imagine ... Cinema!), but this movie was so annoying that I felt like I lost one and a half hours.
