Imagine that Barbara Cartland has found a deadly murderer's face and ... what's going on with this picture. The promise to open <br /> <br /> has been shown, but soon it closes all the tendencies of being a thriller (or even a fantastic love story), and only because they make this story very clear: they create another re-hash To fill a gap in their women's viewing market, the 'misunderstood, annoying bad boy' (André) 'innocent', 'lusty beauty' (Palla). <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling any time during the making of the original seat, filmmakers went straight to the money-shot: Bad boy claimed to be a wonderful beauty. Then follow a string of pseudo insincere and heavy clichéd love scenes with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Undery (unexpectedly) admission of being a 'poet' is impressive to spread around the qualities possessed by a heroic hero. But when we say heavy, underlined authors and what they say it still hard to believe <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For, the story is exaggerated, style and innovation needed - they are all absent here. This is not an unexpected day in a modern horizon, it only happens when poor people are born with weak and rather stupid women (with loose holes in elastic), who, after meeting him, seems dangerous as rabbit slippers. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <p> And the poor Dougray Scott seems to be drugged as he shambles through his part. This is not his best work. Interesting glamorers brought Urgan Prokov 'Vashan' and Andrew Lee Pots as young photographer / brother. A good movie will be closed to sister and instead keep brothers.
