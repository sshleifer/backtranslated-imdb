When I rented it, I could not wait to keep this movie in my DVD player. Then after I started it, I could not wait to get it from my DVD player. Actually I saw all the movies. My wife and I waited and waited for something interesting, but never did anything interesting. Reading the box really read like fun. Looks good on the movie scene Ben Stiler fun Jack black fun How could this movie miss? Well .... Miss it! This is the unexpected "comedy" I've ever seen. It was a little fun to say no one thought. It's just a really throbbing movie Trust me Avoid it .... without it !!
