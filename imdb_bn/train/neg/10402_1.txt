Well ... the vibration I got, originally started in the 1990's and I found the movie quite enjoyable. However, they continue to do vibration II and III. Believe me, those movies are beginning to start without a doubt, I mean, donkeys ??? Now, only God has been able to answer the question "Why would they make Dumpster Dive one of this movie in God's name?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad film, it can not be considered as an image of a bad movie, because it is even more than that. Although I tried to sit in it, I noticed that my eyes started bleeding, and I hoped that the little girl of the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. Do they really think that those who woke up in other movies dressed like them as we live in the wild west will do better (with the exact same thing)? Actually, I never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheap ways to find out which burns well.
