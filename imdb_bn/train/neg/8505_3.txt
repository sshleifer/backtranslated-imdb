"Semana Santa" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino is not a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows among people. Mira is an Italian accent which falters from time to time. He just could not speak English? All other characters have compulsory Mexican / English accents which are confusing. The dialogue is very bad and it's delivery timber. Cinematography looks beautiful, but saving this tripe is not enough. The next part of this review includes spinners !!!! <br /> <br /> Villain looks like going on in the final period, but then returns to Sylhet and shoots a cool stunt under the railing. That just shows no originality in this script. Avoid!
