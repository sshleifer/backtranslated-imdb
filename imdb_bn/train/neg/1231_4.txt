Della Mayares (Kim Basinghee) is a high-ranking housewife who lives in a private condominium with her two children and her disgraceful husband Kenneth (Craig Schaffer). Della gives all attention to Johann, neglects his house and annoys his face and Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she went to the local mall to buy wrappages for gifts and she could not find any parking space. When he saw an old car on two spots, he gave a message to the owner that he called him "selfish cosmic". When the molage closes, the driver of the old car keeps the driver of the old car and threatens him with four birds? Chaky (Lucas Hash), Afro-American Hue (Jamaica Star), Chinese-American Vinh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomas (Louise Chavez). When the security guard of the mall protects him, he is shot dead in the chaky's head, trying to run away from the culprit and drive the car. However, he was chasing by the gang while crashed his truck near a forest. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I saw the trailer of "tray wash out" and I was concerned about watching the DVD. . Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this uninterrupted and incomplete collection of clichés. Della Myers is presented as countless as unsafe and neglected housewife and wife; Motherhood is her only interest in the idea of ​​her family. He pursued by four average criminals, but he defeated him with a toolbox which seems to be Batman utility belt. Therefore, the plot irritates that so annoying. The criminals' gang was created by the favorite cliché of American movies, Afro-American, a Chinese American and a politically correct person with Latin America. Kim Basing has a moderate role, but his children are too young for a fifty-year old. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encanto el Esta Fora" ("Although he is out")
