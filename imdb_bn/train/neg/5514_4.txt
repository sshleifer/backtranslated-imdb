I do not know about you, but what I like about Tom and Jerry cartoons is between two characters (often violent) interaction. Seeing the mouse in Manhattan, Jerry wakes up to make an adventure in Tom New York, and as far as I'm concerned, this is definitely suffering from a cottage! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another Apple and J fans who comment here on IMDB could be Big Apple, I could not wait to finish this spontaneous garbage I can see the next cartoon in my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was the only part of the whole episode to enjoy when Jerry bought 'farm' around, hanging hanging unconsciously hanging down a hundred feet from a broken candle, busy road.
