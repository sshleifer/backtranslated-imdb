I want to say that many people dislike this movie and do not realize that it is impossible to understand, I was fully able to understand it. An extremely uncompromising effort of a plot line. <br /> <br /> I do not like to toss this word, but in this case it fits very well. The director first introduces the material in extremely highly "arrogant" ways and is even worse incompatible. It is incompatible that it represents the element in a dirty detachment order, which we believe is that the director was very drunk and remember that any scenes come first and they are frustrated within 2 hours, they expect us, the viewers eventually end up with CARE's <br /> <br /> <br /> I respect the spiritual movie for what it is. (Creating a story that does not relate to real life compared to reality with real world), but there is nothing weird about setting up a story in modern times and setting up a modern day world which is not able to engage the listeners most importantly. But more, the only one incident together is one dislodged series that is barely tie together. The best way to describe the experience of seeing this image is to see a story; Perhaps it was a very good story as it was based on a book, but the camera can not catch the necessary moments and is not frustrated by the way in which it seems to be in a consistent way. <br /> <br /> Compare to Stylistic Movies. Compare Gaspar No to "Seul contre tous". He gave us a coherent, extremely compelling and intelligent deep story. Although this film does not offer any intellectual studies and it is very stylistic in isolated representations, the director has finally abandoned the industry of good story and what we have left is the mess of organized events together. <br /> <br /> Yes, really one thing can be made ... at POINT. But as I said before, the audience will reach the level where they easily say "care for them." It's like going to a supermarket and buying a non-almious gradually grocery for a man to watch stories in a satirical mundane. Even with murder it is completely unintelligible and unengaging. Nowadays, many people can understand something that they do not understand or can not understand easily to be scared of fools, and in every way the movie considers the audience to be stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time in your hand, then consider this movie considering what I said about it. This is a book based on a book that can be presented in a very effective manner and it is my bottom line argument.
