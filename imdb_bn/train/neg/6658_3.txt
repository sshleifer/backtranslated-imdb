These shows have some facade qualities. One theme tune has a modest melody. The show has a nice premises. Also, I am probably minor, but I like Wanda. I loved that caring truth, and Timmy is more a picture of Mother. However, despite all this, I do not like this event, it is not isolation but I think it is very annoying. <br /> <br /> I will not say that it is the planet's best animated show on the planet Earth. When I use that term for an animated TV show, I think of Peter Pan and Pirates, I think of Darkwing Mail, I think Skoo Doo and I think of the tailpin. And I hope I'm not alone who really likes wild thornberrys and gets resent that it gets poked fun. I do not think it's the weird parent planet Earth's worst animated show. I took it boring, and overrated in some ways, but it is not Nicodian's worst show. That chalk zone, God is unwatchable in that show. But the worst animated show I ever saw was Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a trick, which is weirdly animated, unreasonable and frankly a dishonor. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not like is this animation. Characters, if I insult me, forgive me, have very strange facial features, and many backgrounds are silent and lack of color, which are nice to watch Spaniard Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys. Finding letters with Wanda exceptions very annoying. I do not believe such as Tara Strong (v. Timmy I do not find very likable as the lead character, he is annoying and sometimes patronized, and he also creates a poor decision as well. + And his fear gets my nerve. + I'm not really strang but this show. Another boring character, Cosmo, is the supposedly funny character. Instead, his joke is as irrational as they may be. They are either a) concreved, or b) known After. Timmy's parents are terrifying characters, who do not fight about their son, and wear their personality very thin. <br /> <br /> The line of the story is very irrational, and I wonder, where I have seen this before. I was unaware of the episodes after the baby's arrival. Even worse, the script suffers from a complete absurdity, a child, an idiot, and a complete lack of energy. <br /> <br /> Finally, the worst event is never to be, but to sit through the poor for the animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable. 3 / 10- There is freedom of redemption, and if I like it, then fully understood.
