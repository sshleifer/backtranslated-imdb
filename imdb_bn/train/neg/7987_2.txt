I am this "woah!" One was not sure. When Opoku opened in 1982, but now it's just silly. The film's message is clich√©. Circle-sight is confusing. And at the end that grating is terrible music. And I really like they want to install the seats. After a lot of walks, what you want to do is sit for a few minutes. And when you hear that it is a very nice movie to watch! Sit down, okay? Wrong! You stand against short railing for 18+ minutes. Disney should make new melstrom like lively attraction and replace this dull, lazy film. Not fun leave it. In fact, leave Canada completely until you eat there. Add UK directly.
