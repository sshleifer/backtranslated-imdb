In a while, everyone made Disney a movie that surprised everyone. One that keeps you up to the very end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this film is sure to make a ghost and kill and rape your village. It's terrible. If you like a stupid, stupid, expected "action" movie, go ahead. I believe that young people can enjoy this, as they always like when it is good. But I, I like the movie where it's going to win a toss. This film never gives up the bad guy. Ultimately, when the brave fighters are kept in an "invisible" pit, you just know that they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, but it does not have to be a puzzle or an impression for more than 10 seconds, even if there is no problem at all. If you want to see some acting set designs, watch this movie, if you want to see good acting or see a good movie. Watch a Superman movie, it will be much smaller, and kids will like it more. For example, the scene where the army is fleeing from the armed gunmen, and the bullets are blocked by railing of the fire. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just a little Paul) These movies show the giggle and the dull, unrealistic roles of film and film industry that it provides a great deal of film.
