I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park, my father. First of all, I want to say that the story behind this movie and the Amber Alert system is good. But the film was created very badly and the act was terrible. My biggest problem with the movie was Nicole Timmans and the second half with Father Glen Park. The part of the story that was not entirely accurate was the surrounding incident. My father was suffering from mental disorder at that time, and without any desire to harm Nicole, he picked up. She likes him like a girl and believes that he is rescuing him from some harm or neglect, which he probably believed was coming from his mother, who did not pay attention to my father for more than three years of his care. And briefly raised her so that her mother could be a joke. The film depicts my father in such a way that he was going to harm him in shape or shape. The interesting thing is that Nicole spent many nights occasionally on my forefathers when Sharon used to do or did whatever he used to do. Because my father was originally considered violent because he had something that could be his truck's weapon. My dad was a landshower. They were the things considered as weapons Landscape equipment that he kept for his truck all the time. My recommendation is to take this movie through a grain of salt, based on a good story and true facts, but the story of the film (at least Nicole Timmans - part of Glen Park) is mostly wrong and portrayed as failure of the director to discover the truth in storytelling. Interestingly, if the director had interviewed Sharon's friends, then knew the situation, but I did exactly what I posted here.
