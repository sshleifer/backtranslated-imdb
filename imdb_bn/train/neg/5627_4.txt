I saw this movie, it is interesting to see how narrow it is to black men. The film spends its time showing how powerful it is that black visible person (save for a heroic moment). In most cases of the film, the other black men in the film (and black women in black) are visible, visually visible, as in the background. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was firm and sympathetic. Visitors can easily identify and sympathize with him. There are some fairly visible and three-dimensional support letters that are light-skinned, and some have some white letters of warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Unintelligible shadows in the background, no consequences. Such an awesome error, but something unusual but mainstream media.
