This annoying, Las Vegas casino hasest movie is pluggable in almost impossible to see and engage. This is something that you look for to do even better. The only two beautiful things in this movie are superbly associated with Stella Stevens, and both of them spend the event that the scripts she's going to top are expected. In the mid-70s, many big shots of Las Vegas (when it was still a cool place to watch) and the fashion of the day is also good for frustration. Otherwise, a big Java. Rahino DVD has made a very good widescreen transition, but less than 10 years it is still not valuable for my modest views.
