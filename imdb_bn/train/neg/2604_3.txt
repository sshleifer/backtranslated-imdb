Dopplganger has his moments, but they are less and far away. <br /> <br /> Basically, it is a pop-mind thriller, ghost story, and a grade B combination of awful. Drew plays a young woman in Barryme, who was frustrated by his past ghosts (most of his family was murdered, and he was at least, in a case, the main suspect), or is it a very bad case of multiple personality disorders? George Newbern is the partner of his new room and most of his work centers. <br /> <br /> The character of Neubar is quite sympathetic, and both he and Barry have done a good job (though not good). Medieval (sometimes) complete horror scripts and unexpected instructions seem to mix the remaining performance in confusion. Leslie Hope's character is memorable, but so annoying you want to forget her It is so badly thought out, acted and gave a picture that it effectively responds effectively to how much the film has earned. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is M. Knight Shamlian's first results felt what might be expected. Bachelor Film Class Acting for two leads and the script is only good enough for little care about them - at least until the film is fully and fully realized. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - Send your Dopplenor, but face mouthpiece to avoid first
