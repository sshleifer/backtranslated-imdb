I can not believe that any official reviews of this movie alert people of the fact that it has a very bad sexual attack scene. It seems that our culture is not only sexually explicit but violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it does not condemn the attack - for example, the woman who repeatedly attacks and pressures are not responsible for their actions and nobody else does it. When a man quarrels over him, he is prevented from attacking him, but "you do not strengthen a woman to sex, you will quarrel" ... a woman's point of view, the movie is a landing. It "throws bones" to let women be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the film is more defined by romance - which is characterized by the imbalance of human sexuality, the human being, and the concept that they love women. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use his fighting skills to try to stop his attackers off. He does not even apologize to them - rather, he seems forgiving. Overall, there is a frustrating and annoying movie with some great cinematography and some great fighting scenes, but not as good as a hero by a long shot.
