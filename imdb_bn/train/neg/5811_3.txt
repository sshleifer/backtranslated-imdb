I did not see this movie in ages but I would comment on it, because in most cases it has silent silence in my memory cell. Originally there was no award to start the gateway, at least 1) Sam Pacinpah Films, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens 3) There was a relatively painful way for an hour and half the time. By comparing <br /> <br />, the 1994 version was more than a terrible piece for the red red hit Alec Belvedin and soon met with her divorced wife Kim Basinge. McQueen and his immediate wife, Alic MacBride, also split up shortly after the film's version was created, and one could give opinion of Baddin's picture to his marriage counselor, whose image was an idiot. Let's start and get out of the way - Alec Beldwin sometimes had nothing to do with the Cooler King, and this resurrection made me so angry that this part of Baldwin was proud to assume the main role Steve McQueen our memories Challenge. Like anybody else, the image of Pikinpahra 1972 was a satirical piece that indicates that it is a parody of action / adventure carpet style. In contrast, Beldwin, Bjinger and the company seem to be trying to uncover more serious tone, only Michael Madison and James Woods' unclear unclear villain characters are coming as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is undoubtedly intelligent and unlike a basic level that is hard to put into words. One was not enough to see, because it was not something new, but it was made to be shamelessly. The Pacinpah film was really a stylish little entertainment, which was a bright mood, where this version is a slogan which does not take much less or nothing. Its existence has no artistic significance and some uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they suffer from enjoying the film. <br /> <br /> So I do not know, perhaps it's a film that helped to start the wave of unmanned waves, the name of the renowned stars of artistic baptism is the name of the brand actor / actress, which is not really good at all. I always want to see a filmmaker, try to come up with a new idea of ​​a movie and get flat on something real. This movie just wants to drag my eyebrows and it reveals that Mr. has been released after 15 years. BELDWIN has become widely known as the biggest shock of Hollywood. Thanks to God for "Team America" ​​to keep him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
