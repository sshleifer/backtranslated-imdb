My interest in Dorothee Stratane created me to buy this video. Although it was a great actor / actress, there were a number of sub-slots going on in order to maintain interest. Plus it was not just that interesting. The dialogue was rigid and confusing and the story simply flipped very close to be credible. I was suddenly frustrated that I believe that one of Audrey Hepburn's last films I'll always love John Ritter's best slapstick. He was very kind of here.
