Comedy-drama of a badly played two character is suddenly transformed into horrific terrible-to-Indians vertebrates, spontaneous special effects, exploitation of nudity and ugly violence. It is as hearty as a politician's handshake, as is obvious as a car salesman's pitch, one of the worst films in the history of the universe. Perfect and nasty draw.
