"Private Practice" is a fairly successful and well written "Gray's Anatomy". Cast fabulous The premises can even work. But the text is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Gray's Anatomy episode was supposed to be my first warning in the incognito pre-pilot. The plot was just Blah. I thought maybe it was a mistake. So I set DVR to tap the pilot and all other episodes. <br /> <br /> I was watching the pilot, I thought exactly how the actors could combine such a bustling pilot with a show. Pilots are supposed to suck people and keep them coming back more to them. Exciting, flash, great writing, a curiosity with a clifaner that will answer throughout the supposed season. Surprisingly, there was no one in this show. <br /> <br /> It's a vague idea, I'm waiting to see the second episode. And although it is a little good, it does not need to be interesting, which can not miss on TV. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this show from my show list. IMO's efforts are not worth the effort, and I would be surprised to create this event even in mid-season. Pass this up one's folks
