It will be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. This plot looked like impressive 57 passengers. But with the next film it does a lot of good work. The plot was done the worst way. A few minutes of horror moments in the movie, a flight attendant standing in front of the Flying 747's open door and trying to shut the door out of the air 250 miles per hour?!? Then the plane, from a few miles to 8,000 feet, is also impossible for the experienced 747 pilot for thousands of hours. When runway (obviously straight straight) he is ordered to pull the flaps, HUH !! Come to the flaps to ensure the lift at a low speed, when you use the reverse engineer on the runway and give the maximum power! I can make almost big and big mistakes in the movie, but my answer will be the English dictionary's size. This is a movie in which you want to miss, it takes my word for me!
