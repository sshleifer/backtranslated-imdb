There is a basic aspect of the Forbidden Movies of the Year - it can tell you a story by presenting it to you. There is no need to say what the audience will think, because they can see it. Here the action is divided into some parts of the most fierce description that is revealed to the obscure public - the sensitive fifth-genial prose. And it should be unnecessary because they have a fine cast here and some pretty safe and visible shots. Maybe Jabbo felt that it needed to be emphasized in support of the basic story. And he could have been right, there was a lack of basic credibility: the 70th Edinburgh was not completely full of a trend for the Velvet Underground, and a soft spot with a soft spot for a beautiful brain. Very handsome and new looking fabrics that try to link all that together to the letter cod intellectuals, it is very tied for my taste.
