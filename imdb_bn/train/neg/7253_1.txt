We rent DVD for a better western hope The picture was beautiful and the scene was reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. My problem with this photo is here. <br /> <br /> In the first place, why did the bad guy kill mine owner? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . No character developed for bank owners or bank employees. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the extra-judicial judge and the judges do not listen to the sheriff who makes even more foolhardy. Martin broke his link and rope even more ridiculous that Sheriff returned to his city at the end of his gunpoint and saved his wife from the bad bank employee. Will he come back after sending the gang quickly to save his wife and arrest the bad bank? Just send a note to the judge that the gang has admitted before killing the train ???? !!! Overall, very sad acting and no point in the movie.
