Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and it is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did not like it at all. In a scenario, to give a scary film more about a suicide victim, in a scene, she has been given an opportunity to return to the world for a short time to live her life without ever wishing to live her life. Follow the sticky sex scene. Why are they painful, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sexual act. I mean sex we are not porn for porn. Little Girls Blue is also not an artistic way, but it still looks very erotic and beautiful. Of course that girls are very clever. Here we have a rather overbearing lead actress and that does not help things. If you find lead from the unexpected side of your adult film, then I do not have any painting vision that I'm going to enjoy. Sex scenes get baked up from Yak ... I mean one of them has a snake. So this movie just failed for me because it did not excite me, but instead stopped me.
