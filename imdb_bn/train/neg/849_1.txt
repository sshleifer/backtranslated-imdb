One star All of these deserve the documentary. <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated to see a movie, for a while, the documentary day alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the "Waking With ..." series, it closes Marvin's spin with Nigel, yet all the fun facts informative. And even though the prehistoric man has never been interested in me as other prehistoric creatures, it is still interesting and unique to explore I've seen all the other docs from the series, I think I should also see it, especially after looking at better reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> This doc is for those who have better reviewed ... What do you think?! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a terrible flow, which was incredibly stagnant to say (information is skunky and sometimes out of place), terrible effects (which are a few moments of CGI Especially makeup effects included) and additional MTV-style camera effects. <br /> <br /> While talking about the effect of makeup, a reviewer here mentioned how ridiculous this scene was when the caves came across this huge size and how it looks like a 70-man-in-suite horror movie. . Well, there are many moments that people used to portray the people of APE as humorous and used to do ridiculous things. None of this helps horror camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> What is the worst part of it is not shown in interesting or dynamic way or looks remote. It does not even look too seriously to take place. The predecessors of the series did not have any emotional touch. Remember the fate of the Ornithochirus (SP?) Episode "Walking Dinosaurs"? The episode that I saw came to me on the tears of tears. This is related to things that are most likely to be lacking in them. When you are more involved in the matter and it has its own personal story, even such a speculation, you care more about its surroundings. <br /> <br /> The only preservatives to this production are fairly well-described. (At least in the BBC version I saw) and music. Otherwise, if you do not want to laugh well (which I frequently go on, but usually follow the rolling eyes) do not rent it until it is done. It's not related to shelf with "walking ..." docs with others. <br /> <br /> <br /> And did you know how to create this doc or not directly associate them with series other? Hmmm ...
