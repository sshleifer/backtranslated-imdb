Summer holidays are the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neil Ah Wilderness and the makers of Lake Megan's Broadway musical adaptation. The Harry Warren-Ralph Blen song is not memorable about the exception of Stanley Steamer's song and even this is suspicious. <br /> <br /> It was right after the release of this film that MGM Mickey allowed Rooney to go and I do not think it is a coincidence incident. The film was created in 1946 and was released in 1948, so Mickey played the 26 year-old Andy Hardy. At the age of 17, he was very young, who influenced radical ideas in the attitude of a young rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four MGM films from 1946 to 1948, one by one, a remake of Killer McCoy Robert Taylor's Broad Riders, Andy Hardy and Love Smiles at Words and Music. Among them Rooney was playing an adult part. Even in Andy Hardy's film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy who returned from World War II. Why did he know this Louis B mayor only. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes the summer holiday worse because Walter Houston has emphasized on the father's character in the original Ah Wilderness. And Broadway Show Tech together, which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, played the forbidden uncle Uncle Sed by acting great Morgan, and it's central character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Deanne step for Zuni Garland, Rooney's sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell show an adult learner to the girl. The original play has kept him as prostitution, but this is the Hollywood code, so all Marilyn was shouted to young Rooney. <br /> <br /> It was one of the many gifted people's hands and they did their best work, but the summer holiday fades quickly in a cooler spring instead.
