In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDVY musical instrument contains only two things - a painted version now with Ten Daly and the original script. (Well, Vanessa Williams is good to see.) But that's what I have. Most casts seem to be walking through this event - there is no idea who Chem actually is and who is actually not surprised when Harry McAfee is played by George Wendt, who thinks he will return to the studio repeatedly. . Jason Alexander Possible, but that would go to Wieg and I saw Bugsy Malone good dance. As I mentioned, it is better to have a version of the script, but I hope the youth do not see any musical instruments there, and do not judge them by them.
