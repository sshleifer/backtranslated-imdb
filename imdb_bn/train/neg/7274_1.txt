"National Lampon Goss to the Movies" (1981), it has been said that the worst movie has ever been created, even from "Inactive Space 9." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no rhymes or reasons for these inactive vinettes, and there are no visible story lines. <br /> <br /> Another critic of this site wrote that the only good point of this movie is the naked scene. True, Mrs. Gonzale and Dusnerby flash some of the meat, and very nice. But the directors do not realize that even T & A needs a good story surrounding it. There is no one here. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst among three categories, including Robbie Benson and Richard Wyommark. Here, we can see Benson as a young man, the intelligent beaver police is being linked to a curious old timer played by Wimmermas. And for just a moment, those of us who are still seeing this irrational cinematic exercise are worried by the idea that we are going to see a liberal story about how young-ideological copies have shown a pure change in the old-timer expression. Police work But no kind of luck. As we have said, this film has no value. It's getting sick all the way to the final fade-out - which is more broadly stretched than it should be on the screen. Apparently the filmmakers knew that they had a bad thing, and wanted to create it at least.
