Scarecrow is deemed to be the local graduate gaiety by Leicester Darvic (Team Young) teachers and fellow students at high school where young American town was set up in Emerald Grove. The poor children suffer from humiliation, rape, teasing and general honor by misusing their colleagues every day. Unfortunately he never gets much support at home as a whore of the mother and after Lesser bothered one of his block, he strangled him on a corn field and strangles the poor boy. However, some witchcraft will happen (no, this picture is not good at all), Lester's soul is transferred inside the field that she uses as a body and to take revenge for those who tormented her and made her life hell .... </ Br> Emmuel Itayer co-authored, co-produced and directed the role of a movie known as Dufforq, according to the IMDB Credit List.  , যদিও এই নামটির কোনো অক্ষর আমি মনে রাখি না , আমি মনে করি যে সেরেক্রোর জন্য আইএমডিবি পৃষ্ঠাগুলির দিকে তাকিয়ে যে কেউ শেষ হয়ে যাবে, সম্ভবত তার ভয়ানক খ্যাতি সম্পর্কে ইতিমধ্যেই সচেতন থাকবো এবং এটি ভয়ানক হওয়ার পরে আমাকে এটি বেশ ভালভাবেই বলতে হবে। Scripts written by ITEA, Bill Kingingham and Jason White, use the story of a person waiting for life to survive, who, without prejudice to the appropriate cause of their vengeance, may be able to take them directly to straight forward. We have seen it before, we have been very scared of the killer before, we have seen the teenager killed one by one in front of each other, we have seen that a vengeance was taken before the loss of one of the people, we are wise Victoring villains who make fun of them before they kill and we are in unfinished small town Seeing Sheriff's making matters worse. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's a fun to see at a drunken teen slash level level? The answer is not a crushing to be honest. The film is a terrible character, horror dialogue, an inconsistent and predictable story, in which there is some harmful lantern when Scherkor kills someone, he asks, 'can you dig?' And the so-called twist ending that is made to leave open things for a single pouch is just hair. The film moved along a reasonable speed but it is not breathy and is forgotten dead. You know I'm still trying to get someone to be robbed and a chicken can be killed with a stick ... <br /> <br /> Director Yarier does not particularly work here, killing scenes with poor build up There is no tension within two seconds of introducing any character. Also, I'm not happy with the killer SquareCurro dude with these back-flips and some scenes of wind that seem to be in the Matrix (1999) or some Japanese Kung-Fu flicks! To give some credit to it, the actual SquareCross mask looks really good and it looks pretty nice but it is a little bit rather than a one-fishing device. Do not you think it would be annoying all day to bury a chicken in the middle of a chicken? I know he is a killer scary, but I still say that he hanged with a wooden stick throughout the day! There is no nudity and there is no need to write anything in the cow's house, there is a decapitation, one burns the mouth, someone is killed with a chicken stick, someone gets stuck in the neck, some get stuck in the head of some sick people, some have burst their heart and some have Stuck behind a metal that is coming out of the head. <br /> <br /> It was apparently shot in 8 days with an estimated budget of $ 250,000. At least they did not waste any time in essential things such as the development of stories and characters. Technically these mostly points, shoot and hope for the best things. If you see a man on the floor who broke his heart, you can breathe clearly ... The actress sucks, the guy who played Leicester's wax blocks is the most stupid and the masked mask, because he played two roles in the film and the makers kept him in disguise They wanted him to be ridiculous and let me start his accent Do not ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Badly played, silly, very unlikely and very sugar too. If you want to see a great killer scarcous flick, see Scarecrows (1988). Do not be confused with Gene Hackman and Al Paasino film SquareCro (1973) or the upcoming horror Flickr SquareCarrow (2008). Two other popular video signals in SquareCro Video Video, Scarco Slayer (2003) and Scherco Gone Wild (2004) became popular.
