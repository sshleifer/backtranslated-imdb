I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis that you know about the movie and almost no plot, however. I have also seen several critics call the ISIS a 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to slap on the shocking hypocrisy of these demands. <br /> <br /> First of all, what will we do to cover this movie cover? It's right: behind a transformed woman. Whether Zarichi's attempt was on the charge of racist rape - and I do not believe in it - next to the point fully. The movie will not enjoy hard-core exploitation crowd in addition to any of the titles of sexual harassment and sexual abuse and the element is so graphic (everything has been shown in real penetration). <br /> <br /> Rape is uncomfortable, cruel and difficult to see in movies. There is something to say about presenting a horrendous crime in such a brutal light, but there is no reason for this scene to remain visible for 30 minutes. There was little development of the victim's character and one of the rapists was only slightly developed (just minutes before his murder) so the scene was not involved in the psychological phase. In fact, it is only presented for extreme sexual violence and you can tell through the IOSB movies that it only attracts the crowd of exploitation related to IMDB (Caligula, Kanibal Ferrax, etc.). Finally, some critics have praised the so-called documentary style and lack of soundtracks. But how is it considered inappropriate in other movies (acting, script, etc.) I doubt it was a financial decision and the film looked like a documentary because she literally set up a camera and let her obscene actors do their work. <Br> <br /> I'm not going to talk about the content of the ISOYG of my high horse. I'm all for the exploitation / horror and video nasties love. Actually, I only give this movie three stars because it actually puts more envelopes than some other movies. However, this has also been made weakly and after rape, is relentlessly annoying for the rest of the film, as we see a bunch of ho-hams, most of them were murderers and waiting for the credits to roll. <br /> <br /> It's probably 70 fans of exploitation, but it's probably worth a visit, but I'm telling you that the film is fairly bad and not really valuable for its notorious fame.
