I grew up with a scuba (I run again where you live) I love scrapie, daphon, and not feeling complete without the whole gang. But this sad, the mystery of the Scooby Doo is not an animated comedy-bad jap of bad spy. I liked "what's new", they had to give some time to a makeover in a dilemma :( and try to lose many generations of * sex * drug jokes, but this "confiscation of a formula" is confiscated and it should not be attached to script name They even tried to do some lunatic punctures with the theme song. Now I'm going to watch my DVD, Scuba Do DVD, where you can see this new serial from my eyes. Washed over the glass.
