This movie is really awful, Benn's eye-candy can be played with this film for any other mistake. <br /> <br /> The writer / director / producer / chief actor etc. Perhaps the best idea was to make a movie with almost all the problems that affect gay marriage, family recognition, religion, homophobia, hate crime, and a gay man of this time, but Trying to spread the problem in such a proud film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the home-based brother is played by most camp actors and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I'm advertising a chicken Flex Saw more passion). Acting is rigid, and the dialogue is mandatory (a scene where Brother Detective was feeding his line highlights). <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this train made of debris and throw any other garbage in the distribution, and if he is thinking about doing it then I have some suggestions - do not do it.
