Anyone who saw the original has to go out of this terrible rebuilding and destroy. Alex Beldwin is trying to imitate a word for late Steve McQueen's word reconciliation just does not work. Beldwin has done some commendable work, although it is a flow starting from the beginning. McQueen had a caricature, never try to compete with the star. Ali McGro's role was enough for Kim. McQueen is considered dangerous, dangerous and credible as Doc, the film was excited and mysterious, Beldwin and the company created it in a comedy, I smiled one and the only time I saw this sad movie. And the awesome hairstyle for Michael Madison is today's more exciting and credible actor! The makeup people took it for makeup, what they were thinking. If you want to see the way to make films on Picnic's movie, get real!
