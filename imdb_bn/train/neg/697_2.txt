Two things are good for this picture. This is two unknown celebrities. First, in Daphne Juniaga, the first look of a small and cheerful movie, it seems that still steals his body, stole it very soon, which is all that he is, and that is that. He apparently started his performance with his next project. Second, the composer Christopher (Chris) Young's score prevents the star from getting a star ... Yes I know, not more than one star, but it is much more in this movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the college students are just stupid, intimidated, who try to clean a dwarf. Due to the split, one unexpected killer, blah, blah, bah, one by one ... we all know where this is going. <br /> <br /> Look out for eighteen minutes with Daphne Jungo, then close it.
