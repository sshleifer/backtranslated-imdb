This picture is probably Muslim-supported. <br /> <br /> Why do I write? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he is wearing a Muslim because of his head and clothes, he kept his omelette and his clothes. She is a six-year-old child who wear the same head wear and is probably probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. Thus the main character thinks that it has become a Muslim and his child has become a Muslim. Christians who seem to be reproducing a child, one of the other male main characters. At the end of this film there are more Muslims in the world, so it seems.
