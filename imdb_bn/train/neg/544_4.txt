PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (Is this just me or does this guy always trick to trow AB in their movies?). <br /> <br /> <br /> Kansas: 1 hour full (jokes were flat on at least say). Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav The main stupidity in AB's decision. Let me get this straight and believe that Akshay must take some responsibilities for him and possibly misuse his son's soul (which probably will ruin his relationship), and is actually a good way to tell him the truth? WTF? He thinks the letters are very soft, that his old father will soon die due to cancer, but insult him to feel strong? I do not see the only reason here? The biggest mistake of the movie is easily. <br /> <br /> - Being Akshay Stunt Man. LMAO's !! We say that he finished 1st place in college and earned a degree in MBA. But when it comes time to support his pregnant wife, he becomes stunt man. Ha ha ha !! How to actually apply for a normal job in your field? Or heck, where else is your life in danger? It's something incredibly stupid to write. <br /> <br /> - Finish. I hate this sort of melodramatic shit. Everything is pushing down our throat to be sorry for AB's character, which I could not do. The whole thing reminds me a bit more of Skark (which I hate) in the KNNAA. Feel sorry for the people with this "illness" Shirt has run its course. I felt more like puking than the sympathy for the Old Man. It did not see the final 20 minutes or more minutes and thus it had to be fwd. The whole thing <br /> <br /> Below: Workout is known as a very good movie. Its obvious director, Vipul Shah, sees this as emotionally fragile chicks and old age, who can actually take a lesser look at a story that actually makes sense. Some decent musicians, fancy dresses, plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power, and they will happily open such garbage.
