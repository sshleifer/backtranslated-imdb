The average of the show. It does not let me laugh at all. However, I think the Courtney really brought it down. She does not look natural. He has all these three ways, all robotic. He is speaking calmly (with a word), he is speaking naturally (with a word), or the thing he or she starts talking naturally, and gradually starts screaming. However, I'm screaming because of her cheeky "love, because I do not have a lot in the set". <br /> <br /> She continues her awareness of this fun thing as an intelligent actress. It's annoying. She really does not produce passion because you can not really get her personality, and do not be upset. She has her husband, doing all these stupid things, and there is no response from her. Very dry and plain acting.
