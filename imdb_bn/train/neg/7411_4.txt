An interesting concept involving an alternative level inside a hospital. It recalls - Stephen King "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and the episode of the old twilight zone. The atmospheric strong, set-up was great. There were some very clever "time loop" moments that are always intimidating. The story was a vague reference that led me to believe that all of the upcoming horoscopes - time slips / ghosts / weird bat-winged Danish and a tempered heavy metal horse-clad will be explained. And that dark floor was deadly given down to me. Based on my view, the film does not give any explanation behind the events. However, some obscurity is always welcomed / welcomed in these types of films. In the dark floor it took the new height to the ambiguity. I do not expect wrapped things in a beautiful ribbon, but I should not feel "Hu? .. What is it? ... I'm close to dosage? Probably, I mistakenly hit the chapter?" The Dark Floor kept me deeply unhappy with the suspicion that "it was a dream" which was a shame because I was finally on board and enjoying the film.
