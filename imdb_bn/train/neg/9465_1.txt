This film has become completely ill from acting, direction, writing and industry, and it was better to spend money on shoes for land mine victims. We got so sad that in order to maintain parental attention, children's children will have to fill their movie with their sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> The doctor's grave is now running in his graveyard, "dirty ho" "and fake animation scenes, etc., etc., shamefully, they blame parents for bringing their children in the name of the curse, trying for teenage boys And some sad parents who do not see this movie throw them into cruelty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These guys should stick to making MTV video. How did this picture get in the world> Perfect 10 as 400 votes out of me. (Unless it's the manager's family )
