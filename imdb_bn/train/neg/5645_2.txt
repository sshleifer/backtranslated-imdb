"I thought I would be locked in a padded cell and they would be impaired" (thus a printed imprint of the conversation from "Mint State". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The authors have found witch mushrooms, they will create such a weak "Hyundunite" and bring such rubbish on our screen. A padded cell can be found. <br /> <br /> Niyam Cusack did his best, (as other actors) But definitely his talent deserves a better car than this. The height of irrationality reached, and this particular "mind state" is best buried and forgotten, and of course "keep in a box and lock in the drawer".
