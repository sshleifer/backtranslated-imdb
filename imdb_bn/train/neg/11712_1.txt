The only reason to remember this movie was (and still) the greatest waste of all time and spent money. I was 17 years old and at 18 was my friend. We were at the age when the action movies were ours (most just the second most) to enjoy. We felt so humiliated, we wanted our money back, but never got back in time. <br /> <br /> This image is edited. When the truck was hit by more vehicles with rocket launchers attached to the truck, this truck insulted the viewers' view of the mischief by misbehaving the racket in rockets of 4x4 Voodbug Bugs. Please carry platonium rockets at a truck? What's worse is that the VW 4 rocket launches off 15-18 shots. You will see two of them with 4 rocket fire in VW, the last connected truck will be cut, the second will connect two rockets, the other will fire, then the other will fire, then move to the front of the truck and now it is full 4 rocket set. <br /> <br /> We expect a big finish that never happened. Looks like they just went out of the money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
