I saw this movie, and sometimes, I believed that this movie saw me. For several years, the stage has destroyed 'Furus'. <br /> <br /> A responsible parent (I speak to parents now), I (you) will not give my (your) child, sometimes participating in this incisive video festival. In order to inspire a fellow student, a fellow-viewer is considered to be a satanic, illegally 'pendant'. He is weird, malicious, impressive, and totally cruel - the bogey is made from human flesh, invisible to adults, and the children tempting with life can never afford it (without any possible income by individual denial and intelligent maiden year). He is a peddler of simple answers, and false ideals. He is not all morally conscious visitors. He is Satan's own Ron Popez. <br /> <br /> I mean this prayer (I emphasize on this literally and figuratively, ex) that this movie does not jump into the DVD format. I am hoping to be sad due to the death of 'making a yellow film' on the cold night of 1994. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention it. It comes a lot.
