In 1969, a mental school drama, "Way Shawl Overmac" in Denmark, offered a kind-hearted Danish proposal to American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), flower power, 13 year old helpless, cruel master lindam-Sevensen (Bent Mejding) left the hanging half-ears from the office. Lyndam-Sevensen, a school director who is portrayed as a fascist savior, is in control of the local community. Lyndam-Sevensen has gone too far this time, and his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, was not already enough drama), and excessive stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie'), Frits justice Stood for. <br /> <br /> What do you say It is so helpless, excessive (acting), and so tragic, that this extraordinary as a 'family' picture - excuse-filling for the movie fails to satisfy the unconscious non-Scandinavian audience. Sorry, Kind readers of Denmark, such a catastrophe can happen in your thoughtful journey. But this is not a story about 'becoming a man by fighting against the system'. The boy will never become a man, rather instead he is a helpless, big eyes crying. If you call a church in a small town, under the leadership of a dictator like the cartoon character "system", I'm sorry if something went missing. <br /> <br /> If you are in the family picture, look happy feet instead.
