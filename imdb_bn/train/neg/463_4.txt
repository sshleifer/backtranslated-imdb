The blonde and the blender were unclear. Actually, it was a rip-off female version of Dam and Dumar, but it was less fun, and they used to use too much background noise and music. If you ask me a lot of background noise and music! It is extremely annoying and completely effortlessly. It does not pick anywhere fast, and I was even more frustrated because of this helplessness. Perhaps the only thing to save me from this movie was the last 30 minutes. I saw it a bit entertaining and interesting because it's over, but this is the only part. Also, I could not help but did not help anything like Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richard's letters. Although this movie has not received any smile from me, it keeps my attention. I will not ask this movie to be completely avoided, but there are thousands of good films to spend time and money for you, which are more than gold and blunder.
