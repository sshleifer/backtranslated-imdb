This is not actually a zombie movie, if we're defining bodies like dead ones. Here the dramatic Armand Lock (played by incredibly young Dean Jagger) regulates control of the zombie system, although its 'method' mentally manages his thoughts and turns the minds of other living beings into their hypnotic slaves. This is an interesting concept for a movie, and in its continuation, it was done more effectively by Fraud Lang. With the film of the movie 'Dr. The Magnets The Gambler (1922) and The Testament of Dr. Mabs' (1933). Unfortunately, for his recovery of his former drunken Claire Duval, his unfortunately, unfortunately (Dorothy Stone with an evil hair by Anne Hey Look, played Dorothy Stone) is really the key issue. The film has an early start, because Locky was sent to end the destruction of Jumma from there through a military archaeological expedition in Cambodia. Some types of compounds (where we got the 30th set and clothes) he announced his involvement with Claire and then just five minutes later he announced his love for his pill, Clifford Grisson (Robert Nolland). It's strange that they talk to each other without having eye contact. This was a great movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000, if they did not roast it already. <br /> <br /> It is never seen how lock will actually learn 'jammification' secrets, but using it, killing his enemies, carrying soldiers and bodyguards, creates a giant army of rifles. We will not see this timeless strength of will until John August in 'Benan to Planet Urja' (1957). Finally, Claire agreed to marry her, if she returned to America by resurrecting Greson. Louque agreed, but actually turned him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On the night of the wedding, she realizes that her love will begin only if Cleari leaves her love. To achieve his love, he did so, created 'rebellion' of the title, in which his slaves rise and attack his compound and kill him. Grace hugs Claire, and we think of the end of an illustration: "Those who destroy the gods will be crazy at first." <br /> <br /> So really, this is not bad for a movie, despite having a low IMDb rating at present. Looking at the repetition (?) Someone can see artificial scripts built in well! Dean Jagger still had to develop into a good actor, and is almost strangers in his youth - really his own hair? We consider him more about the role of his cold, old man in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). This story has set a more fundamental theme than Halperin Brothers, the previous movie 'White Zombie' (1932), in which Happles used 'Jammimification' in the world of 'Maggie Baleami' (as Madeline Parker) as Robert Frazzier (Charles Bymant). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Zombie '(1943),' Night of the Living Dead '(1968),' The Last Man on Earth '(1964) and its two remixes. In modern-day films, 'Horror Express' (1972),' The Serpent and the Rainbow '(1988), '28 Day Letters' (2002) and its continuation, as well as many, many, many others are also mentioned. <br /> <br /> This is not really a zombie film. Judging from this film, it is more than a semi-Gothic romance. At the end of the 30's and early 40's, it was fewer below the number of billboards in the world below. So I'll give it a 5.
