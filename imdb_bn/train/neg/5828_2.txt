<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She can create eye candy (and I am candy ), But his ugly and basic artistic emptiness reduces all pleasures. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that many people do not distinguish the same (but only on the surface) like the works of Jodowski, and more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovsky or Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey and were never bored by the last scene Has been ...) M. The industry, like Barney, confuses and closes the viewers, which may otherwise appreciate the experimental movie. The general empty post is the modern "conceptual" industry. And check his interview. I just do not buy it, sorry. And so annoying. <br /> <br /> I was not bothered to see the films of Alexandra Jodoroski, though the Drawing Restraint 9 was frustrating. Especially when it offers the possibility of something, in order to say something in a non-linear non-overwhelming way (eg starting and preparing for the preparation of the ship for the great dancer and ship. "Meeting" ships on the ocean ... It was feces) "pearl" divers ... everything could create a great surreal movie with some content. But it's not. Dressing up and fake teas An awesome scene and ceremony ... how is in vain and philosophically inspired but only available? <br /> I have some great visual views, but the whole movie has become so annoying and totally empty and fake It made me sick physically <br /> <br /> and it does not have a good tempo. I like moving movies slowly, but in some scenes It was boring - because it was provocative and fake - so I had been forced to show the artistic vanity scene for a long time ... <br /> <br /> This kind of movie is just art and spiri kill t in my view. <br /> <br /> I like more Jordoski !!!
