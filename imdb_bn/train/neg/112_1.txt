This picture is just plain horrible. John Ritter has been reading Pratt, 75% of the actors are supplying their lines so that they do not have their coup card, poor editing, awesome sound mixing (conversation is difficult to accept conversations) and a plot does not go anywhere. I never used to say this, but Dorothy Straatan is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Pant Hansen delivers his line with Ben Stein's passion. I started to wonder if I was not dead inside. Even the children of Bogdanovich are terrible (the old man is reading his line from a coupe). This movie is critically endangered. Bogdananovic could not get another project after 4 years Please do not see it. If you see it on your television list, cancel your cable. If any friend suggests it to you, revise your friendship. If your spouse wants to see it, you are better to find another soul. I'd rather gouge my eyes with Lawn Dart than to sit through this piece of garbage. If I can enrich the word in one word, then the word will be: The saccator
