This Santa movie starts off the weird and I think Santa might be a pedo. Instead of normal elf toy makers, this Santa has kidnapped kids from all over the world and sings some songs like "It's a Small World"! I think there is no child labor law on the strange unstable plane that he lives (this is not apparently North Pole and not in Earth) !! None of these kids seem very happy and I want to break down the commandos and rescue the tanks, although I guess for some children of Third World War, conditions of this work are probably an improvement over the local sweatshops. I'm sure what they do is to sing and make toys. <br /> <br /> Then, the scene suddenly changed to hell, where a lot of ghosts and dancers danced like Barclay musical instruments. This funny devil put a stop on those who go to Earth to destroy the Christmas, pitch, order one of them! Personally, I think that this movie is already! Satan and his IMPS are really kind of kind - like the hot stuff from Harvey's comics but with the cool evil goatees! Or, if you're Puerto Rican, but like a vejigante mask with a bath! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "A group of violent kids who want to tear Santa and some rich children are the battlefields for Devil and Santa! So, if Prince of the Darkness (Donald Trump, not another prince of the dark) can steal him and get worse, he'll 'win' - what, we do not really know! Indeed, when they force him, you think that the filmmaker wants to be Santa, as he has all these great powers and beat the devil on the children's souls! Later, Santa met with his friend Marilyn. She asked him to make a special powder which makes people dream about a beautiful dream. How much Santa does in the film (like a cheerful chipmun), I guess he must use this drug! He immediately sees an iron fist that makes him a magic key that opens all the doors. It seems that he keeps the kids as his personal "helper," what makes me so worried about this magic! During Santa's Christmas Eve Ride, you see Lupita behaves like a little angel - one problem is down. Santa is now spending time to care for rich children whose parents are selfish quarrels He gave them some kind of crazy cocktail which resolves their problems awkwardly - they solve two problems. This is a rare event where alcohol / medicines help the kids and solve the problem! And for little muggers, he gives them coal! Frustrated due to its losses in Santa, the pitch then tried to steal the sleigh (which is drawn by the obscure animatronic deer). When this fails, he destroys Santa's 'magic powder' stash! As a result, treta can not disappear to avoid the dog. Oh, oh ... if a tree is stuck in Beta Ford clinic, how can Santa slash? Will St. Nick get to the bottom and win the monkeys or demons demons off his back? If you care, tune and see. However, be careful that the image is bite-crazy crazy! <br /> <br /> The technically speaking, the film is intense. It's in color, it's really proud. Music is mostly done in a body - with bad songs from kids, perhaps in the recent memory I have heard the worst soundtracks. And the story is just unavailable and very, very, very awesome. A Santa just kidnaps the Devils and kids, simply crap-tastic. This is a movie that you should never show to kids but create a great movie to watch with friends so that you can laugh from beginning to end!
