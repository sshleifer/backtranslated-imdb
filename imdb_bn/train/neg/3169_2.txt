This movie is one of the worst ones in the year. The main characters have no chemistry and are terrible acting. Paul Rudd is the only one who has no talent, and is the only one that is not boring. I have never seen a deputy parte housewife, so I do not know how the Eva Logoriya was in that show, but it was horrible in this movie. It's like to know nothing about acting. All her characters are whine across the film, and she does not pull off a **** and can still be entertaining. And another girl, Lake Bell, shows a little emotions and it's like watching the coupons as you read them. <br /> <br /> For the story, it is so cookie cutter. It takes B's surprise from the point. Can be used as a Scratch with cut much more. This plot should rotate around it and it works as the soul. <br /> <br /> Last messaging: This is not valuable.
