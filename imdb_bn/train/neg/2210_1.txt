It was really a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Every 1 movie was trying to be serious, which made this movie so much fun. I mean to come to the shark's head on a human body. It can be any fun. Good works keep coming to the sci-fi comedy movie. I never thought the movie might be more annoying. If they keep it, they will have to change the name of channel or channel channel of comedy science channel. <br /> <br /> I'll wait for 4 seconds, from Fi to the next blockbuster movie. <br /> <br /> I'm ready with a bottle of popcorn and beer or a bottle of wine and ready to laugh again!
