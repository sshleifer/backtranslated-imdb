New Commission Commission surprised by a group of Fox TV officials who are sitting around the table in a boardroom. <br /> <br /> How to target something like 24 or West Wing? One of them says, but they all agree that it will be very expensive and unlikely to be damaged if cheap TV stops. <br /> <br /> 'Well, how to combine some great comedy writers and doing a quality thing?' Another proposal and the spot is fired on. 'Good writer does not know how much money is spent!' Big holes. 'So we've invented the reality TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'm listening ... 'Boss replies, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, so let's make another copy of it,' Blendman added. <br /> <br /> But there are many CSI clones, how can we stand? 'A naive junior is searched and immediately dismissed. Stand up! We can not confuse people! Let them have more of what they like! 'Big big screams. <br /> <br /> 'Let's add more violence and make it really gorgeous, we're a fox,' another case is from a sincere answer to the head of the head, 'Now you're getting it!' Do you know. 'We could have made them the Devil Crimes Unit,' he is definitely going to add a roll. <br /> <br /> 'By Jove, he got!' Big laugh, 'And the victims are very nice and weaker women can wear very low on the screen.' 'Well that would certainly confuse people from the mean acting and poor script,' indicates Blandman. <br /> <br /> "It's grown, okay, we just want a name," the chief declared. 'Can we call sex violence violence?' <br /> <br /> 'How very literally, how about killer instinct? It reveals violence, but sounds like a basic institute, which has many sexes. ' <br /> <br /> 'Big question', 'PureFact', then they all leave behind each other and cancel the arrested development.
