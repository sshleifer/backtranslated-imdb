I was a big Porsche fan, and was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Heim, the 80-second-child star abusive drug is as soft as normal and the comment will be up to the dot / minority actors; Saying they were all very mean. It's a great movie as a trip to the memory lane of 80 - some weird clothes, some good shots of Colorado backdrop and very silly despite the bad ones. <br /> <br /> For everyone, please do not like the 80's movies, do not waste time watching your time until you love the old school Porsche (it looks especially great) because of the life of life Very bad to see very bad movies.
