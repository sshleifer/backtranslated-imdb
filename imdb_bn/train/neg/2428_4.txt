Most of the things will remember the worst bad movie because of their sticky, sticky, camera-work and quick, confusing cutting. If it is fixed with most of the films like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderberg, then I am not against such stylistic devices, but there are many ways in this case. It looks like leaping jump and light flashes, with every flight in Mexico City and the story is very thin and realizes that it is very thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest frustration is to understand how you are going to finish the whole thing. For the movie that is violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is impossible for the story to be told many times and with much depth and character development. Another disappointing aspect of that movie. I want to monitor top action flick but I do not need any reason, but the film tried to support the trial of the murder of Washington's character and failed to deliver any credible performance. Nothing happens in the first half-hour or more that are depicted in stupid archetypes and clich√©s and when the action machine starts rolling it is cut quickly, which you do not know what actually happens. So the movie does not work on any credible play / thriller level, nor does it work as a pure action movie. The film, however, is not as bad as last year's totally objectionable blockbusters, but I do not understand why so many people claim that the movie is a bit fresh and is so cool. It is a very long way for a video clip and it has very little content for a movie.
