After watching this I can say that this is not a bad movie, yes, there are worse guys, there are some good points in the film, you see drunk adults, get horrible deaths. And eating some science tests of beautiful looking rats, and getting wildly, drunk janitor, cranky doctor, and yes a thong underwear is a girl that absolutely no shame, silent jocks, I can not wait for personally, these rats feeding screwed fools , I was rooting for rats, it was a good compound, the first part of the movie, with the scientific explanation about fat, though It was tense, and a little back story, but I think that when the drunken drunken horny teenagers come to play then it is destroyed, in my opinion the rat, which is lost, was named Brenda, so there was a mice, a cgi was a rabbit, dressed in a beaver suit Looked like a guy, this was quite schloy, lam, but, completely horrible, not.
