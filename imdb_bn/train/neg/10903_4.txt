Rob Schneider is a famous comedian because of his movement, face and "no-no" performance. This time he is in the animal. Marvin is a hero who is trying to be a hero and one day, does not call anyone attacking the assailant, so Marvin will take the case and save the attacker. But on the road to crime scenes, he got upset in his car and was really hurt. What he does not think and his life is not the same in the next general day when he learns that he has a living creature. Of course, we got our lady trying to reach our main character but in her efforts, meaningless. She is played by Kane Haskell. There are no negative characters. Negative character, I could use this metaphor to fate. Marvin will find again, how to make a normal man again By the way-her animal instincts, it helps in some situations. Schneider's performance is a so-called. The film is so unreal that it gets stupid in some moments, it is one of those movies, which I have known above as funny in mind. So watch this for Monkey Style Rob Schneider, but it is not one of the best comedians, or one of the best movies of the scanner. He is an outstanding comedian, but it is not his best film.
