This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have seen quite a few movies. It is passed as an art film, but it really is a piece of trash. This is a good quality of freedom, but it can not be respected by Sally Potter. The plot of this movie is not unknown, and I guarantee you will start to laugh at last. Especially where he started singing It's absolutely unreal.
