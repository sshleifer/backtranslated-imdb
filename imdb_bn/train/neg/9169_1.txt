It gets really bad. Thousands of bullets used during filming have the effect of only half-way release qualities. There is a common error everywhere. Acting awesome, save Kirk. The story is like a hole-hole, and believes the film is a video game itself that only kills the film, if it is not a corpse. So all of your life is a waste. I have an option on this rating scale that this would be given a zero.
