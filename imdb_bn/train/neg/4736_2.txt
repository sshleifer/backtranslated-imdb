Deserve the movie 2/10. 1.5 big for the girl, (I'm sorry, I favor, I think the only brightness of the beautiful girl movies), and 0.5 it seems to be smaller than Azmi 1. I saw Ajmer 1 and 2 1 Seating. I'm amazed to be able to sit through it myself. <br /> <br /> Talk about movie plus points. The girl Uyeo Aya is beautiful. There is everything to save the entire movie. Actually, if the main character was male, I am sure that most people (with me) did not touch the film. <br /> <br /> Now talk about minus points. First, it's with real drag, lots and repeat scenes. The dancing and the azumi scenes are coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Generally love Japanese playback flashback, and this movie is very Secondly, the film is very unreal in historical settings. I do not think of unreal movies. But this movie is a bad way of showing creativity, throwing Nijjja working on beer and spider webs etc ... It reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinwi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover, how the effect of the film "I do not know" can be expressed, director films kill blood (around literally) around people ... without understanding the person's head ... etc ... etc ... etc .. Many of these show looted. It seems that anime effect is strong in this movie. It's widely deteriorating the show. Thirdly, is Ajmya not supposed to be a killer? She is like a man like an army, it seems she is a woman. I do not think you'll see the assassins charged with the army camp. The only time I felt that he played "killer-like" when he killed Kimmassa Kata in the end of Azumi. Finally, the plot in both films was thin. This is a linear plot with no development and wondering in any way.
