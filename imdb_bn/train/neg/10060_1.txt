The author has determined the "journey of discovery" to discover its "roots" in the South Tobacco industry because he believes that the film ("fully and well-forgotten") "Bright Lif" is about his ancestors. It does not, and in fact, discovers nothing about the gentle interest of this innocent innocent and self-confident glory film, it is suitable for screening the reunions of the director (director) Drunk family but certainly not commercial - even for non-commercial release. A good reminder to remember why most of the independent movies are taken through the main studio - because they are not boring, irrelevant, and there is no interest in the directors and its immediate circles. Avoid all costs!
