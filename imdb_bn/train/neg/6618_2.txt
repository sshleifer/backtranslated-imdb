Overall Performance: - Ultimately wait long AAG screen hits. Unfortunately, it can not set progressive fire among the viewers. The first thing to talk about the film is the idea of ​​restoring a great Shol. And Verma makes an excellent choice to change the overall backdrop of the movie. If he repeated the backdrop of the same ramghurtha, people would say it is nothing new. Different backgrounds are appreciated but he is not worthy of the way it is presented. From the beginning of his career with the SIVA in Telugu, he used the same light and background. I do not seriously consider the light of this guy Varma or he may not have another negotiating strategy like Gordon Willis's godfather. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH Why do some body use many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots !!!!!!! Shot section is hair. Characters can not carry any emotion, the performance is not of their mark, the story is bad, the background is really frightening. <br /> Buban: - Amitabh preferred his job. Verma made a great villain like Vika, Bhatkur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to compose the greatest characters of Hindi film ever. Gabbar has no comparison with Baban. Bobban is more psychologist than a villain, yet there is a soft corner for his brother (this is a gift from this movie). Amitav performance is not his sign. His face is kind to himself. The scar on his nose, the black and white movie symbols forgotten villains. They never did what Baban did. Babban does not compare with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Narsingh: If Verma does this, it will be like a Bachelor's degree holder with ABCD education. It's good he opened the secret first. But Flashback is kind. Verma could not use a great actor like Mahmallal in his sign. <br /> <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character of love. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raj, Ghumoor: - Does not consider any physical problem or at least this character. The complete failure of the movie begins when the director can not work on the close friendship between Hirose. This character does not carry anything in this film. <br /> <br /> Ramgopalabhma: Its quality is decreasing. AAG can be fully regarded as a C-grade movie. Suddenly the fire of retaliation, the problem of a city, true friendship and highly acclaimed ridicule by Dharmendra and meaning for fun. AAG does not carry an emotion with its character. It is very weak to tell stories that viewers can not feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with Sholay, yet you do not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare see this movie. Ramgopal Verma will be burnt alive at the IAJ!
