I do not know about this movie will be so great. Even worse, why should anyone be bothered to see this one? First of all there are no stories. Someone might say that seeing a movie can be valuable to watch a movie because it brings some strong feelings (laughter, tears, fear, ...), but in my opinion the film does not even do that. <br /> <br /> You just +/- 2 hours to see the pictures. There are more useful things. I think you can say that the movie is a test and it is brave because it lacks all of the above. But your valuable time is 2 hours and your money is worth 7 euros? The answer for me is: no.
