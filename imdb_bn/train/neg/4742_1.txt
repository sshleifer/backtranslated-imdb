How nice. This was probably the worst DCOM. I saw the first half hour and I laugh. Brenda Gin played with the popular Girl Wendy, along with Hend Jack Boyfriend, and stuck firm friends determined to be friendly queen. He is supposed to be saved the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches him the skills of a snake, tiger etc. and he has to learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to know about martial arts and Chinese culture but acting and casting was awesome. <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <br> Laughing at laughing at laughing. Shin could not do anything, everything was completely incredible. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and tried to think about something similar, and the thing I gave was Power Rangers. This movie was so fake and stunt so powerful that it was just stupid and stupid, that it was just stupid and stupid. The letter was not liked and I could not stand to see it. Disney really takes time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that qualifies for Disney Channel, such as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Fig, Reid It and Veep, and Stew of the Subbbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action-adventure and corny joke, you like this movie.
