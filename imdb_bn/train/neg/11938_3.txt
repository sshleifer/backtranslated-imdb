The movie starts well enough. It got by a brilliant green meteor, got superpowers (the ability to telekines, X-ray vision, unwantedness, flight, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, heat vision, and the ability to grow plants bigger and faster). And war crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, stay dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all this filth, the film has good direction. It clearly states that if you try to take the gang alone, they will return to your home and hurt you. It says that gangs and communities will have to see their real enemies (big adults who use them for their own ends to crush honest people in a gateway). It also says that if they are willing to work as a community, then the superheroes destroy predators who do not need them, which will harm them. The only message is really that the voters should make sure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H. W. Bush) are not very miserable. <br /> <br />
