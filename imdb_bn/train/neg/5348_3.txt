Investor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate the Smithsonian Institution to its problematic contraction / extension machine because he and his wife Dian (Eve Gordon) are ready to go away from their son Adam (Bug Hall) for a long weekend. Owen's brother Gordon (Stewart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Barlett), and his children Jenny (Alison Mac) and Mitch (Jack Richardson) were volunteering to care for Adam while their parents were away, but the fate is their (and the title you To be expected), raised up is accidentally zapped by Wayne's shrinking ray. Kids carry Amok, their smallest people will have to fight with pests, carpets, carpets, fork and other threats. It was bad, mostly in video signals, honey, we humped myself humorous. I was laughing at that movie "Roach" Stuart Pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, see their own risk!
