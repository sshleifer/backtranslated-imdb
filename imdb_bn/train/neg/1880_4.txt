Despite a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ainger Rogers movie, about 6 years ago I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but the plot knows nothing. Unfortunately, the song is interesting and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and fun, you can not just like 'Beck Unemployed'. While trying to be a longtime partner, he constantly ruined his career. 'Astaire Charter' is not the usual humor and Alan of other films of his character. <br /> <br /> Important to watch Zinger Rogers songs and a great solo tap routine.
