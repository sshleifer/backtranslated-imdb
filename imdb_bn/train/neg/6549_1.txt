I do not want to be made but this movie really surprised me a lot. During the whole picture, I was fine ... erm ... What is this movie? I do not get all the animations. Perhaps this film is only suitable for the 1980s. During the film, a group of people went out. After the movie, many people said, "What is this?" To be honest, I can not believe that this film was awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you are planning to watch this movie, I do not strongly recommend you. You will regret it. I'm not kidding You will only see that you are wasting your time and money and will see it.
