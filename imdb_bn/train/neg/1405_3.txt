"A Daughter of Pain" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's best musical instruments. But there were always some good moments in Ashtior bad films. <br /> <br /> At "Damascus", Astaire is an American musical star Jerry Holiday who is in London on a private visit tour. She meets Lady Ellis Marshmorton (19 year old Joan Fontaine), who meets a beautiful English heir, who kicks back on a cab that is going to flee from the crowd of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage of her rich aunt. He tried to rescue her from her family country Manor House, but soon discovered that the house workers are setting a bit on which Suitre Lady Elise will marry. Kegas (Reginald Gardner), Conwing Butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), Braty House's son, everyone helped Lady Ellis romance with Jerrio and make sure to win their bit. <br /> <br /> There are many problems in the musical instruments. First, the POG is a plot based on a novel. Wodehouse (who co-authored with screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. While Fred does not dance, our (A) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Kegas and Albert have to withstand and bitterly annoying scenes against each other. <br /> <br /> Butler and house boy especially irritating. They are one of the dimensional stock villa characters, kind of guys you just want to punch in the face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect female leading female, and miscast in a musical instrument. He is very different from his beautiful appearance and beautiful smile, character-based, very little for him. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen, along with this trip, are also Jerry's promoter and his diary secretary. Both of them add some necessary chemistry for this plot, and there are some funny lines in Grassy, ​​but at the same time it is very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Steven's movie direction was not good. Occasionally, cinematography is terrible and off-focus. In London, we tried to convince the audience, not Hualieo, we created many visible scenes on the street in most of the streets. (They must have used a lot of dry ice in this film.) As well as George and Ira Gershwin's songs are great, and have become standard music songs. And of course, the dance of this movie is exceptional, thanks to Hermione Pan, Astyar and her dancer. <br /> <br /> But the number of musical and dance numbers is ill-disposable and ill. Sometimes, because casting seems to start singing and dancing, well, time for their song and dance to start. The number of musical instruments seems to go into randomly confusing plot. (At one stage, Butler manar goes out of the house and is not lonely in any other way due to any obvious nature.) The numbers include: "I dance and I will not be disturbed" - Fred could dance well to London streets full of terrible traffic. He has some great "rattan-twirling" with a rolled umbrella - but Fred ends soon when jumping on a passing double-decker bus. (Broadway musical instrument, "Crazy For You," Harry Gonner has made this version better with a group of chorus girls.) <br /> <br />  "Keep me tested" - Fred, George, and Gracy are an English cottage Do not dance to a threesome three. George and Gracie Fred step by step step by step step by step step by step, step by step step by step, step by step, step by step step by step. <br /> <br /> The house, Fred, George, and the grassy floating floor, barrel rolling, and funny rooms make fun with the mirrors. This is the best number of movies, but it occasionally repeats a few times. <br /> <br />  "Looking Things" - Fred and Joan Fontaine work together in a film together with the number of dancing stars Wood behind the country's manor estate. Thankfully, this is a very easy dance number because the young man is not a great dancer. <br /> <br /> "A fog day in the city of London" - Fred roams around the horrific Manor Estate on the day of fog. When he first met Joan in London Sometimes it seems that he's going to fog in some way is not sure - like too much musical instruments. <br /> <br />  "Excellent job you can get it" - A great song is misused in movies. During a social show in Manor House, Fred is drawn into a chorus of singing this song singing lazily singing those dour. Each time Fréd joins, other singers look at him as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Gorner had a good dance number in "Crazy For You" with this song)  "Drum Dance Number" - Fred and Joan escaping, Fred will have to stop and frog a final tape dancing number. Drum Group As usual, it's a great dance number. But there is absolutely no need to prolong the film. <br /> <br /> The shortest moments of the film were for Joan Fontaine, who decided to tear a high-profile balcony in the country's location to prove Fred's love. With the jump from the balcony, he found a conveniently-placed trapeze - it's exactly, a * trap * - hanging from nearby trees. Fred (or rather, Fred Stuffman's Stuntman) jumped from the tragedy and from the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is owned by the DVD only for the dance number, but you owe the man who discovered your remote fast forward button. >> The FF button lets you avoid other annoying scenes in the movie to get the number of dancing.
