For beginners, the larger part of this film is that these six Idiots videos themselves videotaped "Funny" (more interesting than viewers), drunken, stupid acting etc. ENDLESS FILLER There is no nudity here too. I'm not saying a scary film needs nudity but nothing helped to enjoy it. None of the death has really been shown (you listen to them), there is only a little bloody and no gorgeous. There is a real horrible one - but it does not end up. <br /> <br /> sucks acting with a few exceptions. Dori Burton is as horrible as the main woman and Tom J Jones is lousy as Oz. Chad pops up as Allen Brad and he's awesome. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and fierce and all of her giving this nasty. And Jeff Conveye plays a small role in playing a beautiful role. <br /> <br /> Lots of logical laps - they have realized that two friends have been killed, talk about sexual harassment; Boston's response to the murder of a friend is funny and what will happen to Lawrence? The invisible without a trace at the end of his character! Avoid It - Fake, Fool, No Gore, No Nudity. <br /> <br /> Rated for graphic violence and some prejudice.
