It was a disappointing movie. Considering the ingenuity - The army likes to laugh and always laugh - and the star will have to laugh at this movie. It was a couple worth of chuckles, well, chuckles. Steve Martin has got a lot of fun and looks like Dan Ackroyd should have a dramatic role, where he can follow Robin Williams' leadership and never win an Oscar.
