Sinitra, Martin and Haire poor performance. Fairly unused support letter Annoying talky with no real plot. You can finish the pages compared to the pancake, with more loose ends, you can connect between four signals (that is, if you care about these wooden letters). MacLaine is the only real resource. The last sequence of the "Chicago Hood" search for the Sintra character is ridiculous. That order music is also poor. And in the final scene when Martin's character was removed from her hat for a woman, she said a "pig", almost find a stone to go out and drop it on my television screen.
