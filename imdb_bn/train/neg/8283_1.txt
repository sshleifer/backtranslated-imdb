It is embarrassing for everyone and everyone used to make this joke. Whatever I personally find about Jessica Simpson and her genius or something interesting about her, whatever does not care much for a way or another. Similar to the movie, it is something that will not be passed in the film school. The script is a mess, played violent, and true Luke Lynn Wilson (co-authored with "bottle rocket") it worries me what he does wonder. He cried "old school" with a loud shout! This does not belong to the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please do not see this reason for whatever! I have seen that this comment is so bad that it is good, but it is genuinely very kind. When we stop watching the singers who can not clearly try, hopefully soon it will end. The worst part is actually some decent actors (Penelope N Miller, Rachel Leigh Cooke and Luke Lys Wilson) who are part of this dump. As far as the plot is, it is almost non-existent and so badly done and written (yes I know it is another Rehab) I am very doubtful that anyone would think of something in this regard. Please do not waste your time, but if you do, sorry for the actual actors involved in spending time with this bomb. Jessica Simpson is beautiful to you, but the singing stick, although I do not have that too a fan. And to anyone this image, I will not put this in your resume. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
