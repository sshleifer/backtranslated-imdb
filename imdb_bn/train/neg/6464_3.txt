Look at Marlon Brando on screen as a master yarn chesling complex details look like in a piece of mahogany. Brando's performance only makes this film visible. The plot is insane and ridiculous (not ridiculous). Other big names appear to be making great efforts to give the characters the characteristic of some small images of humanity ... these letters have humanity in the wet cardboard. Everything about the technical aspect of this movie is moderate or simply plain horror. The director threw fridge frames and slow motion shots with brutality. Adult music destroys any indication of cartoons and dramatic effects. It's not something I really see in a movie, even the dress was off. The respected brands could not move away from the terrible touches they gave them. I've heard this movie "David Lynch-Esquier" and "Strange Fun" ... not even this. The films of David Lynch have created evil creativity - this film was not creative in any way. And do not confuse dishonor with stupidity.
