Usually I do not like movies directed by Sydney Palack ("Firm" exception is a bit) and I'm never a fan of Robert Redford. Still, I thought "three days of condor" must be appreciated because of complimentary comments. <br /> <br /> While the widescreen is pretty good for the cinematography and Max Fon Sido works as a terrible professional killer by doing a wonderful job, I found the whole thing too frustrating. The picture distorted paranoid atmosphere silently, but everything was destroyed by the destroyed plots, which do not seem to be any sense. <br /> <br /> This movie is an unhealthy ending that I have ever seen, which really goes winding visitors. And what can anyone say about the strange romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would like to see more than once sitting in this piece of waste once more in Hitakoos's films.
