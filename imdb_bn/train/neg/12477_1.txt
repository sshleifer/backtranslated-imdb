This is a movie that you and a bunch of friends are drinking around drinking water, eating pizza, and laughing at this. Unfortunately for me I could not find myself alone watching this one. My friends and I rented a big block of movies and almost never surrounded it. It was behind and figured that there was a waste I did not see it. So I did it, and I was fascinated by how terrible this movie was. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad movies, and perhaps I do not like this hero, I probably liked it. So absolutely cruel. The whole movie I hope is that he will throw that stupid sword and someone kill him! She is not a very brave thing in the movie. He is a mad, hateful, stupid thing. There are lesser value than villains. And what was with all the nude girl? I mean, I love nude girls like the next guy, but the movie was put on that department. <br /> <br /> Well, if you like bad movies and a horrific "hero can stand up", then I'm sure you liked this scalp of a movie.
