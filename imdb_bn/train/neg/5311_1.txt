This is the worst movie you will see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the hole from me to this one, for me. Frank Zapa is a perfect example of what props are once referred to as 'chapnis'. It seems like before the 1970s power station destroyed the scenery. The music really sucks. The acting is wood and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. When they copy the techniques and ideas from other movies it immediately and brazenly obvious. The values ​​of the beggars of the side <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
