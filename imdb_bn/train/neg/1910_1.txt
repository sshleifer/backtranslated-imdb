I tried to see this so-called comedy, but it is very hard to bear. This is a bad, narrow mind, clich√©-raided movie. Definitively not funny, but very annoying and annoying, indeed. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste time - and there's nothing left to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
