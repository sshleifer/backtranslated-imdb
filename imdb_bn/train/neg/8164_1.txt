I saw this photo with my cousin and uncle in an actual movie theater (probably $ 2.00 one). We were around 11 and 12, I guess, and really scary movie. I feel so excited because my cold uncle lets us choose the movie (and maybe we can not do it again!) And so frustrating later !! Not just annoying and scary. The only memorable thing I can remember is the Corky closet from Silver Spunce, and it was not all that great, only I recognized someone. I saw bad movies before and this is always stuck in my mind as the worst. From what I can think of, an annoying, illogical, waste of our collective $ 6 waste and film waste. I've read some reviews that say it's a clock price and I say, "everyone's own", but I'm not even bothered. Not even bad it's good.
