In the United States, only a few films have been made about Rome, which have not been set within a short period of time, or after Julius Caesar. Hollywood's sword and moon epics are mostly Christian themes, which make it difficult to enter the history of Eastern Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and some resistance in Hollywood was encountered because it was not Jesus). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture which is not only preceded by the time of Caesarea and Christ, but in Rome on the Italian peninsula was set when there was only one city and excluded only the despicable King made of Tarquin and Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; It is not the bottom of the leopard, and production quality rock, is played and characteristic cardboard. I can only imagine what the conversation was like in Italian, but it was very loose with English in wood. I first got some good smiles in it. <br /> <br /> I did not see many movies in this genre, most of the 60s of Hercules missed the movie. It is fun to a point, but the film continues, it becomes somewhat annoying. One thing is certain: If I used to see this film of ten years old, then I liked it. At that age, I went to do something with Roman and the sword. So at least, this trick brought back some childhood memories.
