At first I started this review and found that I just agreed to write and warned people to save their money !! <br /> <br /> From this hull I saw that it was among the worst pieces of trash. The storyline is probably the most probably predictable garbage that you probably can propose. If you expect more than 24, you can use the money that you use for the ticket on the big screen, flush it to the expectation of the toilet. You can enjoy more. The act was terrible, the plot was completely unreal, (finally, with the so-called "Twist") I must say this, eventually surprised me, I'm not mentioning the plot twist that surprised me, but instead of a bit of the whole movie They were not assembled as the only scene of decent steps, they ended so fast that I did not even realize that Until the credit is rolling and its time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because Michael Douglas apparently wanted to play Kefar Sutherland, though Douglas Agitating agents, taping phone lines, hacking into systems and carrying people with its followers, Satherland low-powered agents Who plays always ad mood even when things are not going that bad for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type rolls to love our 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I just frustrate all areas of this movie that you can promise. This may be better than the rebuilding of "The Foggytic" / "In Line of Fire" but written with mental disabilities
