I can not believe they could spend $ 17 million in this movie. Clearly acting badly, harmful scripting and effects that you can do on your PC, incredible plot competition ... is a reporter who can get a major job in an unidentified stewardess in the United Nations? What? Not only that, the message of this movie is so impossible that you think that they tried to put your back on the head with full size crucifixion. This movie will promote the singer and everyone else will ridicule the meaning of such a ridiculous hoax. If the makers of this film really want to persuade people to Christians and show the meaning of believing in real life, then they used the money to help people in real need. Now, that / could actually / some people hear them actually.
