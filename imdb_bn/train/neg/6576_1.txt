I totally disagreed with the opinion that this is a good film. This is a complete SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. Story development is weird Mia Kirshner changed from a fun girl to a innocent girl to any convincing reason from fun cock. Also, all the actresses seemed to be old enough to be a college student - the students of college seemed to be 30 years old - to bring the rest out. I've seen it in just ten minutes and started fast progress to find sex scenes. All sex scenes are hair, hasty and, most important, no frontwards. All sex scenes were sunny, they considered how much clothes were there. Do yourself a favor - keep it down and save yourself a few bucks. Conclusion: Story - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, score - 0 out of 10.
