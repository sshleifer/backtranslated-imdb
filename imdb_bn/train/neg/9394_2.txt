Oh, man, how much less serial had fallen since 1952! These dull things are precisely serial types that annoy Annie Wilkes (from Misery). The heroes simply escapes from the trap by adding scenes that are not in the previous chapter (and that probably can not be there - tell me that when Baddies blows the plain in the 7 to 8 episode, they will not see the characters jump), but I think this Serial stock footage has world records. I mean, most stock footage! And not just from other cereals (apparently all the flying sequences came from the King of Men and Captain Marvel's 2 to 3 episodes of cold "molten rock" scenes), but from yourself! Episodes 1 to Episode 8 has been repeated in the entire "Moon Tour" sequence (which is probably the greatest of all time, it's 30 seconds long and the letters do not seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere)! And episode 10 all the scenes in the previous episode! (Sometimes the MST 3K Episodes 10, 11 and 12 did not do any work, why they did not have to do the whole thing again after 9th, 9th!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Science Factor Start over. Sunset moon ready to see! And the people of the moon can not breathe their own? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough, it is very gorgeous and stents (usually the best thing in the cereals) are less and far away. Visually, do I think that the bullet-shaped (or lemon-shaped) helmet of the commando code is completely ridiculous? The way the rocket was cool, the movie was not bad (and the people, it was terrible). Tank-like vehicles are not great, it seems like a bunch of kids made for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think is that the protagonist of the hero is in the house instead of the usual muscular (Hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But he is so unexpected ... <br /> <br /> Not too valuable for Nostalgia's request. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (Watch the memorable quote section for BTW, a real woman Libby pearl).
