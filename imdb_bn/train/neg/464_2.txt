This movie is not a funny thing, it tries to be funny with the link smile, which is very dry and annoying that the movie is only 2 hours of torture. I was thinking about one thing in the whole movie, "When will it end". If you have one thing in their hands, they have very little gentle moments, which is why I gave it a complete 2 stars. It is unreasonable and uses almost all of the old blond joke in the book, even those that were not the first time fun. It is basically a movie recorded blondes belittle and full repetoir of blonde joke. <br /> <br /> To add all of it, this movie has become worse than the humorous blonde, it is not worth paying any amount, it's just that bad.
