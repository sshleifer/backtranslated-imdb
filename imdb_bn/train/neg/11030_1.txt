I recently watched the film at the 30th Gottenenburg Film Festival, and to be honest, it was among my worst films, which I was unfortunate to watch at times. Do not make me wrong, there are funny and entertaining bad films (such as "Manas ?? fortune to hand") and then there are terrible bad films. (This falls into the next section). Cinematography was incredible, and not in a good way. Cameraman deliberately left everything out of focus (with an inappropriate nipple shot), the light was "somebody running around a light bulb" and "non existent" The actors were not as bad as soap actors as bad but obscene actors, and each line gave them the impression that they came as a total surprise. The only released feature was the look of a masked murderer, a classic look of a La Jason Varishis from "Friday 13th". Plots were extremely poor, and the last even worse. I would only recommend this film about what a horror film should not be, or perhaps a sleepy sleepless sleep.
