How nice! Very terrible stuff. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor Rhodes, Land in Sardinia, and this remarkably ill-disposing Tennessee hooked up with William Loosey, director for Williams Fiasco. Taylor incredibly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly. When Curiosity Burton claims to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor realized his time up. Extremist extremist - It is difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly or if William's intention is to make their characters so unexpected. If that is so, the acting is brilliant! Burton copies his lines several times with twelve words, but Taylor scribbles his scripts. She's really awful. So Neil Coward as Taylor's Katie Con Confidante, "Capri Witch." <br /> <br /> Boom is a fast time and how fast life continues - two standard Williams themes, but it is so misguided by Losey, in which Taylor and Burton did not spell it for the viewers. Most of their crazy silkworms, the film has completely thin any substance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are great pictures of Beouem - The beauty of Sardine's beauty is to get the camera out of focus! Supporting Cast features Joanna Simacas, a magnificent doctor of Tomorrow and a great Romanola Valley like Michael Dunne as her nasty dumb security guard ... both he and his dog make a number in Burton!
