From the critical acclaim, I hope more from this movie and Tamara Jenkins. The story just moandered along and does not seem to have a point or a plot. And it is difficult to believe me that the 14-year-old girl (her age or her mature) will be so annoyed about losing her "virginity". Maybe I'm not too young to be related (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problem connecting with beautiful Shakespearean stories or I was not living for those settings. Casts are very good but unfortunately do not alow them to engage the script audience for them. Overall, the slogans were at its moment but if you do not want to be reminded of the halter top and tube socks, I would avoid it.
