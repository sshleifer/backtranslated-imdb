Just think, the total cost to create "Clark" is $ 250,000. How did they spend 45 million dollars to create this glorious music video? A real unknown cast, two or three sets, a special effect that I could see ... I know it's spent in a skillfully designed, costly, tone screenplay. Shoot, that bar will cost a bundle. However, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer will catch some produced for less. I'm just not surprised that he did not blow up anything. <br /> <br /> However, I think it was not a terrible movie. The female lead has some good chemistry and the soundtrack seems to be just right. IMO It seems only sad that the production of this intermediate project can be made for $ 5 million without any losses, and a meritorious merit of $ 6 million can be made.
