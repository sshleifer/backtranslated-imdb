Terrible !!! I do not want to be very negative, but this image contains an IQ of stupid monkeys. No disaster. I could not believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are very weird and beyond the camera, the camera works from time to time, just awesome, sometimes soundtrack music for the musician's lawrence, I've seen this movie to see how bad it might get. Some side actors "actor" total disaster. Sorry but all my toes and toes and anything that could hang on my body hanging down below. Harvey Kettle is a great actor, but who knows that he is in financial crisis to participate in such a Fiasco film. . . . . This movie should be presented to all the students of all movie schools so that they teach a lesson for a movie
