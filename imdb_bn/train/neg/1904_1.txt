=== Small spoilers === <br /> <br /> I like many, huge Jerry Br√ºhmer fan. So when I saw hanging in front of all the beautiful posters, and trailer coming before MI: 2, expectations are increasing. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big car Fresh from Nick Cage and an Oscars - Angelina Jolie. What could possibly be wrong? Many <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (which makes it really hard), not exciting. You are a black person who is always making racist jokes about himself and Woh-ha !! Did you get a comedy? I do not think so. Tension is completely out of the photo. The first (and perhaps it has been said many times) does not have any sympathetic characters, so who dies, who cares? If you can steer the assurance that a psycho will kill Nick's brother until he steals 50 cars within 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (brother) is walking back to the street with Nick. What is this tension? Do not worry Then came the best bit of romance between Nick and Angelina. He looks nicely bored to relate to all these stupid lines. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' Did you see anyone 'What was wrong?' Etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is only one fuzzy hope left: the carriage travels. They are not saying at least because the trailer looks like it was complete, and there was only one. Caught in a very long one, shocking camera movement. I really had the following problems following the verb. <br /> <br /> So this is an employee movie? A thriller? A romantic comedy? - There is no need to make decisions, just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 strikes out of 10 and I think I'm generous.
