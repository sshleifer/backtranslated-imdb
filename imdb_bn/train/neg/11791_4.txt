I do not have this The movie probably has a pretty good budget. It's very good cinematography. It has excellent pacing, good editing and very good directions. So oh why did not they appoint someone to finalize the script, so it is not so impressive and why do they appoint such violent actors who can not come out of paper paper bags? This movie may have been better. Most of the time it looks good and good, but ultimately you realize that the film was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's a good production but bad movies. Actually very bad. <br /> <br /> And Yale? Come one, really!
