At the Fiji Islands, the greedy and dishonest owner of the Wallola Resort Premal Park invites investors and guests for the inauguration party of its compound made of hotels and zoos. When a small thief in the college puts the virus in the security system to participate in a Skywish Hunts, then the biggest attraction of the zoo? Sabretoothes from advanced prehistoric age to DNA found in fossils ?? Running, hostilities and guards kill for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredible and crippling "Invasion of Siberarth" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. Characters are not awful and fun or fun, and the story is a bad collection of an awesome Jurassic Park Rip Off of Clich√©s. Basically all the lines and situations are poor and fools, but when the guard explains that Sabertoths prefer to be killed for bullimental and fun. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Atac do Dante de Saber" ("Attack of the Siberarth")
