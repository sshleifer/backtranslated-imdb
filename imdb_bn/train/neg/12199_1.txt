The first idea was to liberate the refugee, standing on the tree in the open place, 'Wow, again no idea: 1. Can you cut iron with a knife? Maybe Vietnam made? 2. Mortar - use for hitting a moving man? O my God, you Americans will really know about arms! Do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar?
