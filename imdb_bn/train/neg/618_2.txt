I've probably seen among the worst teenager slash films. I will start with the bad part of the film, which covers most of the movie. Above all, nobody can avoid: Strict step. I swear they were based on how they looked like a random child in the street. Second, the work / development of the BAD / Unauthorized Charger. You know half of the kids here who died here. All of you are exactly that they deserve it in one way or another. Scarco's character was overdone, and the cheap rip-off of other great fantasy assassins like Freddy or Pinhed. Next: BED Dialogues: Scherkro was filled with awesome one-liners that would make you laugh, because it was terrible. Like a line "Let's go to humiliate some small creatures!" Really just leave you with a eyebrow raised. Last but not least: Next closure: Bad cutting. How old was Lester playing? 30 likes? Behind his head was balding for God. I can also say more about this movie, as it is a special effect on cheap, it is the "high school film class" effort, but the point is understood. It just made bad films at worst times. For movies that appear to be "good": - Help for sleep, low, low standards, sleep-induced sleep apnea. A very cheap smile, or even a molten.
