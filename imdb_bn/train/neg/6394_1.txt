This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The acting was bad. Setting was unreal. The story was unreasonable: a comet that was once displayed in a night would appear. Decided to visit the world's most populated comet. Then, in the morning the next morning, each of the selected comets turned from radiation to dust. People's clothes are still intact, still there are living plants, but people are turned into dust. No bones, nothing That's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people but keep their clothes and other organic matter intact? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Their makeup did not even look horrible for a stranger child. Insane garbage pawns me more ... and they are supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> then was alive. The comet was guarded by zombie-dom and death who were surrounded by steel when passed. Can the steel block the comet radiation, which inevitably burns people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> In the same way, 60 films made with humorous films of the movie are created in the background or 80's hairstyle which does not work for any purpose and you want to shoot your television. <br /> <br /> The stellar part of the film focuses on these characters: Two Star Girls in Star Trek and Chakota: Voyager. These three letters were completely unreal. Who will be robbed day after an apocalypse running throughout the mutants eating meat? There was a four-minute horror scene in the whole movie, and most of them had dreams. Outrageous dialogue between these scenes, which seems to be South Park intelligent. The silence of the initial dialogue was painful. I could have made better films with four monkeys and chats. Never see this movie.
