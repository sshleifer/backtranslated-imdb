I still do not know why I forced myself to sit with the whole thing. The price of this "film" Memorex DVD was burned; I thought I saw the end result of a group of middle school students who stole their parents' camcoders. This is the worst movie ever made. I really want to blame Haroon Yamatsu for two hours from my life, stealing from my life. <br /> <br /> So apparently, it seems bad to be purposeless; However, if you end up in hell and are forced to see the 90-minute coil of Du-Do, you will see that Yamasato is trying hard to create a really cool flick. The actor tries to perform dramatic kick-ass performance compared to the tide, but approaching Marine. <br /> <br /> Cat acting is just ice tips. Camera angle horrible. Story C-movie is the best - this plot is not good enough to consider the eligibility of B-movies. The dialogue is trying to be dynamic and malicious, but like everything else is shit. There is rumors that a hard copy of the painting actually attracts the fly. Plus, the techno score is annoying ... it is not tech because it is non-stop. All right, the music played full-time in the background, how bad this thing is working as a reminder. I do not care what litigation demands, I do not buy it. The purpose of the BOTS could not make it worse, because it takes it very seriously for itself: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very low budget. But it is no excuse for the suction factor to set its record. Big films are not born or budget. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, some people will try to protect the movie. Two, maybe three. They will say, "It's greenhouse chops!" Or "sugar in a good way!" Or "It's too bad, it's good!" Those people are stupid. A movie is good, or it's bad. There is no such thing as a good bad movie. But there is something like fools like stupid movies. Do not make me wrong; Numerous non-banana-critical movies are enjoyable and entertaining. Whale one BOTS are not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest runs one and a half hours, and my modest opinion, it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "film" is the DVD cover, so the next time you are near the Wall Mart DVD Dargah bin, you will see it - do not touch it, just look - and go quietly.
