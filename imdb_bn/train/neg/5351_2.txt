If you like the first two films, I'm sorry to let you choose this. It's really bad and unnecessary video, probably made of TV. Still foolish but wise scientist Owen Szlinsky (Rick Moranis) is still living with his family and his own organization, Szlzynski Inc Unfortunately his wife wants to be free from an idol, Owen is so stupid that he narrow his statue and narrate himself to his brother. Then he shrinks his wife and sister too. Now adults home kids will find a way to get them bigger. Repeat mostly with two or more new things each other. A toy car roller coaster, swimming in the dive, etc. Pretty poor!
