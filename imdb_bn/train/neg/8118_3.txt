Well, EYEboy, I must say that someone unifies me and tries to make me fun when it ends me, especially when it seems intelligent like you. My favorite part of your post was "But there is no bad guy's bad guy here, Kimos, I'm asking you to stay in the movie with light bangs." <br /> <br /> All right! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, I like movies that do not have complete work until they are done well. I'm sorry, but Secrets and Lease does not fit into that category and only a very bad movie. I do not really see many non-American films, so I was lost, and could not understand what foreign movies were when I saw the secret and the liars. Perhaps if I judge foreign movies with a different value, then in a few seconds, secrets and falsets can be one of the highest rating films in IMDB. Hmm ... if it's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy Bagger Bits @ midohio.net (new e-mail)
