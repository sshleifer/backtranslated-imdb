An excellent performance of Alix Elias is otherwise misleading and highlighting the confusing plates. I've probably seen this movie 12 times, and with each run, I get less and less pleasure. Why is the mucaki so passionate? Is that ever explained? Do they reflect our absence, poor animals? If they are, why is it not more obvious? Why does this movie not only penetrate into disguise and make that connection clear? Another part of this movie that annoys me - motorcycle ride A little giant jacket on the front cover advises tourists 'like' roads. Sun glasses say 'cool cool dude.' With all this I'm ready to fill the wafer for easy rider. I get all the Munchies (1987). What gives? Stay tuned for the Grimlines series if you are a fan of small, wise-cracking, reptile dolls - this will give you the treatment you deserve.
