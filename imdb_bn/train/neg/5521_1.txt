I just came to see this movie and decided to see what others are thinking. I am amazed, those who give this flame reviews see the same movie! This is probably a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has many holes that will make a great dive for fishing scenes. The letters were not well developed and the story went so close that I asked myself "How did we come here?" At least half a dozen times during the movie <br /> <br /> Cast members lacked any chemistry. This is probably related to Antrix of Lindsay Lohan during the movie. It was clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but did not play their role. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to watch ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save your money for its value!
