What was a D movie hell? Bad acting, bad special effects and worst conversation / story I've ever come across. The only cool thing here was Coolio, there was a nice camie as a freaked out policeman. However, the rest of the pictures are awkward and annoying. It's not even bad, you can laugh about it Just plain shit And anyone who compares the Avial Dead series can also compare Tamba Rider Indiana Jones (OK, OK, at least Angelina Jolie was in grave Ryder)! 10 out of 1
