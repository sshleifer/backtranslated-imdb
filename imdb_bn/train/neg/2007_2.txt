Cast OK. The script is sometimes weird, and it will take time to determine what the point of the movie is. I look forward to dishing myself. An uninterrupted statement of Shahan Bit War. I think we were supposed to notice it ... we did. This is a house, you did not do more than kill 40 minutes. Shower part ... huh? What was that about? Literally, I have a client, "OK you can use our shower." to yawn. Angles are trying hard ways. There was a set of wood, suddenly it went away because you can see correctly, then the next is deep and the animals are going to die. Ultimately this annoying ratio is a horrendous movie.
