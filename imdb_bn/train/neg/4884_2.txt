Criminally Insane 2 is included in Satan's black wading / criminal crazy new DVD and this is also a good thing, because I have seen a movie and there is a signal (especially something that is unclear as such) I am always weird I am satisfied with my curiosity now and this will not meet again. Most of CI 2 is nothing but "Flashbacks" in CI, Ethel's footpath, remembering the memorable memory, I guess. For the 13th Proposition he was released from Napa State (wondered what he saw when the cramps were there?) And Ethyl immediately sent half-house to an excellent elderly lady managed to call "old". All this is pictured with a video camera so the pictures and sounds are rather unfortunate, and it's even complete with a few "rolls". Of course Ethel is sending her into her things, which is her and the food, especially the guy that witnesses to witness to one of her works of Maya and extort her dessert. Also, you will be surprised at any half of the house for a large drawer killer with a sharp knife in kitchen and rat water under kitchen sinks. Guess that all misguided "faith" matters. If you like or prefer fatal madness, there is no good reason to see it in any other way than curiosity. One wonders why these manufacturers are even annoyed. 10 out of 2
