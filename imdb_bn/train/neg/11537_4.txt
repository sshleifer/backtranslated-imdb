I have been following the progress of this movie for quite some time, so maybe a little more expected. I used to think that Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer were both good at doing what they were able to do and meet Dan Reid but unfortunately this does not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really understand that it is falling in a sequence and it fails to affect the drama, the horror and thrill content, because instead of focusing on one, it performs well. No <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Curiously, in this case, Dan Reid felt that it would be very good to do a job in this revenge film that goes deeper in revealing more human bodies in all the letters and gets more detailed in their mental state. "Wrong! There are some basic elements missing, such movies usually have some sort of alerts. Do not do this or it may be something that tanges but there is nothing to sort it out here. It will only happen, then nothing will happen for an hour, then something will be interesting and then it will end. <br /> <br /> I have tried many things in this context and in Dan Reed's cap. There is no problem with her indicator's power but while writing ... I would say that instead of trying to be very clever, she should retain the formula for the type of film she is making, and it will have a quality film.
