<br /> <br /> My girlfriend just wanted to see it for Richard Gere <br /> <br /> I think I've lost my time and money and told my girlfriend that this is the last time a certain actor / actress has it We go to see a film. I hope he learned lessons because I had trouble keeping him in his seat. From me, I already paid, at least I wanted to see, hopefully it would be a little better, but I could not hold my breath and thankfully I was a victim of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not black and white, it is black and black. The main character (Richard Cer) is almost as bad as his registrar, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unreadable hard-core criminals and bad ones among them were really very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, completely helpless for this job. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to utilize the popular theme and it gives a cheaper, dramatic and exciting turn that is simply unrealistic. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to engage in violent activities such as murder, cruelty, rape and torture - which seems almost inappropriate. They are even attacking a wolf in movies - how much less you can get. <br /> <br /> I will collect this image and do not come to the United States and go straight to the DVD. It was supposed to have been in other countries, but it was only due to Hollywood and Richard Gerr. Trust me without gears, the movie is not worth a B-series movie.
