Close to reality and deeper than "Breakdance", Stan Bath's "Bit Street" is still a great show. Again this image is only making cash incentives for 'breaking' madness, but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which expresses concern about the lives of three young friends and younger brothers, everyone is growing in Queens in New York. Each has their own unique talent. A hostster, a DJ, is an artist who produces' burners', while the little Bo 'Lee is a hot' hip hop 'dancer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although the story, and its young cast are similarly struggling with their character. Therefore, it is almost completely awkward to keep awake music and 'fresh' dance throughout the day. <br /> <br />: The choreography for the club and street scenes is sharp again, but it is only "Bit Street" higher elevation. Unfortunately, the film has really been late, hoping it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
