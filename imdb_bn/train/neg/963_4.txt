There is a big mistake to 'see the possibilities'. You know director Emil Ardolino from 'Dirty Dance' and 'Bone Act' and can have some fun from him. But I think I have confusion to you. She made a really, really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies as a child. The child grew up to Robert Doni Jr. and Jr. met with his ex-daughter Mary Stewart Mastersson (complex, Hu?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They love each other. Then Junior's former wife Cybele Shepherd and Junior are in love. I do not have to mention that I love Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> His first role was Robert Downey Jr. being his worst one. He copied Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shepherd proves that she is not fit to act in movies after launching the moon. <br /> <br /> However, this weird comedy can be used. As an inhibitor preventive.
