The Oscars Academy Awards Festival had some weird disasters if this flick would win it all. It has a celebrity superstar with all the gods, excellent plots, extreme special effects and extremely good acting skills and each role certainly. Well, this may be the scenario if the world is upset, but not so. Instead, it is the worst nightmare, not just bad actors, but it seems to be reading the teleputer scripts with bad dyslexia, but very few in special effects. For example, the devil costume (which must be seen in the course of course), I have ever seen the most joyful things. Whenever I saw the red-black so-called giant on the screen, I could not hold my smile. And at the top of things it seems to have been sent by the conveyor belt to the funny animals. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as I did. After the release of the film in 2003, IMDB checked five votes less and thought: "Well, this is a shot that can not be expensive, bad". <br /> <br /> Yes it is possible. <Br> <br /> I'm not going to cut even more words in this movie.
