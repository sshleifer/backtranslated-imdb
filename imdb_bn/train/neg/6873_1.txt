At the beginning of 2000 the TV production was weak and bad. Such marks (emerging, lost, imprisoned, disfigured housewives, or monks) did not have the exact hit on TV before, which could attract the attention of the audience of 2000 and hold the interest. Titles (Realty Hunter), (mutant X), (The Lost World), (Shiite), or even (Baiyau Hawaii) were not enthusiastic to see you and follow, or at least not that funny and interesting. What time is before them (Special Unit 2) There was no exception. Actually Black brings the 'Xfile' to the spoof! (If this particular unit was 1). But even according to these brilliant sources; It does not work well. It was committed; At the time, a decade of some X files had some satire in the "supernatural" case, so the normal soul could lump it silently (imagine that Mulder is male and female!). However (Special Unit 2) is not the most powerful of it, or it is powerful for a strong comedy show. It was extremely ridiculous, for example, every sexy situation must have turned into ugly hateful one. It enjoyed that bad taste of illness. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and most of the actress was unbearable. Her chemistry (Alexandra Lee), as well as no supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Of course the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny job. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than its original idea. Including (writer Ivan Cazz) other co-workers and co-producers (seven days) or (24) after other tasks, it will be a low point! Despite the individual personality, it has been directed to be a stupid tongue for most of the time. So that was the goal, so they really made one of the silliest! And indeed, it's the most rare time to be grateful for canceling a show after 19 episodes!
