... because 100 times 99, producers are lied to pay you through their teeth (or someone else's) or they * gently * buy sensors *. <br /> <br /> The Shock-o-Ram movie proves this once more true with the release of "Feeding the public", perhaps potentially deliberate but completely perfect and neutral entry into the zombie style. Friends, this is not just a budget budget, it is a group of very low budget films, I'm sorry - I know they love their family - they will never be a significant diversity of fashion. This is a bowl of Muayin, people, and it is not just cheap reasons. <br /> <br /> Actually medium, but I do not blame the actor; They had no direction. The script was semi-baked junkie fiction, because it was without any sense of the actual conversation of a movie. Characterization is the best slim, weak dialogue and no thanks to soporific direction. I still mentioned that the script and direction are beautiful hair? They are There is no drama, no excitement, no great character moment, nothing at all. The whole part of the government's suppression of the government is a "commercial break" of soformal and unexplained tales that deny discrimination, and oddly add to its ridiculous finish. Sid Fields will not be happy. <br /> <br /> How will this reality be evident everywhere when the government can suppress the truth in a poisonous zombie epidemic? Why would they give more than an impressive effort? On this day and the age of cellphone cameras with wireless access, what could they possibly do for more than one day? Now, if they cover something, like their own blame ... but do not seek the possibility of "feeding the public". Instead, it will not miss a total lack of near-production value outside basic filmmaking equipment, to live in illiteracy and poorly managed events to excavate humor and / or significance. Did anyone get the payment in this movie? I hope the actors, if their time is lost like carrier dark alleys this time; At least technicians have been able to awaken some legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will get some benefit from "feeding the public". Gotta is unusually qualified for any of its ratings, and there is no definitive piece or memorable impact. They all oddly forgot, actually. There is nothing to fear of KNB. <br /> <br /> Junk like "Australian birthday" even "Andy" was "Feeding the public" Sorry, friends, go back to the drawing boards, and accept your cheating marketing with you.
