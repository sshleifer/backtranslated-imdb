I saw this movie in the city a few months ago, which appeared as a granendale in the movie, the only reason to see it. Another local people there sent me an email announcement for a repetition because the first was sold and the people ran away. His editorial commentary in his progress is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk. <br /> <br /> If you are Neil Young Fan or" Grendendell "near / around (If you later got the real name Avoid this movie, it's an ego trip for most filmmakers, it's not a smart plot, music is just fine, and too many songs are unreasonable to follow the small discipline of the plot. It is impossible. <br /> <br /> is a wonderful warning, because there is no wonder. <br /> <br /> I would like to give it 1.5 / 10, but it is only worth the $ 6 value for viewing people made in movies. I could rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make yourself a better movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * environmental-message movie with no plot, then rent Koyaanisqatsi.
