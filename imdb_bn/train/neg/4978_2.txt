This movie has lost me with Crossover RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was like a scene cut from the hawk and pasted. I told the half to Bauwie, "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I saw it because I love Chris Bruno from the "Dead Zone" TV show and he's done his part. He liked a strange pronunciation, but at least he adjusted for the whole film - unlike any of his castors. They moved away from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments about how this movie is different from the source material. However, even on yourself, this movie's plot is not good. It's just annoying, even the budget even does not excuse. Having less budget means that you have at least one good story, dialogue and decent acting. Those things do not cost a lot. Instead, they spent half the guitar CG and some modest dresses and spent their money. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to see this movie.
