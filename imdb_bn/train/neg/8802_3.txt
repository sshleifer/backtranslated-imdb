Look, I like the professional action film, but it was very bad. The kind of bad that you want, can get your life back in time, it's kind of bad that you think "how they first started to think about this film on the world", while you want to go to the kitchen to grab a snack during the bad movie It took more than 50 minutes, it was so sad to have fun seeing leprosy which you think you've rented a Paoli Shore film I think ... I can not understand how bad it was. <br /> <br /> After saying this ... there was some semi-funny smile, but they all are less fun than this fun. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but all the concubines that were kept here from Uncarmo were made here for a good reason ... it was not a little better. <br /> <br /> Do not see any benefit (or in the US) on your own, and do not see this DVD ... it's a good movie that awaits the film and you do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> I'm fine.
