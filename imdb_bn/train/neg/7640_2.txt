I found the Eden curve very weakly, which was hard to see. However, I would like to tell you about some of the acquisitions about the setting and clothing of the 70's decade of the weather. Visions of "Return to the Earth" and the interest of sexually transmitted drugs and drugs, which were not dramatically depressed, were corrected in the later versions of 70, such as "Do not Tell the Incognito" except for the Brotherhood's generosity made by East Coast Intellectuals, instead of one in Virginia it is more in New England School. Probably thought, where I think the "good ol boy" mentality is still such an elitist school Has dominated. One. Another topic that I admired and related to is that at the time when homosexuality or skin-to-skin homosexuality was not so much linked and I appreciated some of the gay roles related to these recent overview images. Outside of Castro and Christopher Street, 80's were considered very sad to accept "gay culture" in some of the norms, and these define the movement and outweigh too many gay men in their lifestyles. I appreciate the film as the main way to remember more natural ways about our sexuality and personal relationships without "scenes".
