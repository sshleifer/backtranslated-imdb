Eventually I could not even bring myself to see this movie. I did not see the whole picture because I could not comment on the story and because I could not see it because it was 'actor'. First, in most cases they worked hard and I'm sure their scripts were only in the hands of the frame - but this is a small problem. My main problem with the actors is not really their fault ... anyone has cut this picture! Come on, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought that at the age of thirteen, did people go out of fashion with a new wave to play in prison? I can not see a movie where one of the first lines, from an older man to me, "I'm 17 years!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Do not be a victim of this movie, go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this movie.
