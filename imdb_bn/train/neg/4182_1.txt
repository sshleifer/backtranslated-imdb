This movie is not as awesome as most of the scientific-channel channels. I use this to see the gray CGI blob and fake blood close up, such as the amateur special effects, which mean blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variety. However, I thought that I saw the potentially low level of injury that the science-channel channel had suffered. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine putting a rubberized sack in hand and glowing with syrup? Who is the main alien vampire of this movie. You can definitely see the fingers inside the rubber sock doll. Talk to the Victims of Prey, and talk to Vampire Hunter's Vampire Translavnian's rubber sock dolls. How did Alien Vampire Transylvanian learn? And there is no transfiler in Romania? So what they should not talk to in Romanian? Why do some small towns have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflexes and hold the rubber socks with fingers clearly removed inside the alignment head; Then you will have to deal with other alien vampires. There is "Leatherface" who likes to wear their victim's face. Then there are lots of mouthpieces that seem to be plain ugly. Then the annoying Valley Girls and their lovers who tear down the human traitors and the space colonies, so that they can break the defense systems so that the space vampires can attack. Finally, if you think all the fun and ridiculous values ​​above, you refuse to deal with Network TV's third-rate cast, which consistently constitutes this group of angry heroes, which are constantly fighting themselves. Why is the movie of almost every Saifai channel using characters that are annoying, abrasive, filthy, or completely disrespectful? I hope you will win the rubber socks yourself.
