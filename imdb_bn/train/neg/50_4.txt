With three "horror" films, the person requests the visitor to "not be out" with a man next to his house and (unfortunately) why we give three stories to prove to us. <br /> <br /> The first story is a car accident couple who meet with a young two psychos. It leads up to two completely expected twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, orderly, and orderly. Predictable but enjoyable <br /> <br /> A man was involved in running after a huge amount of money was stolen in the second round. His car broke down, he attacked the dog and jumped into a nearby clinic. Very obvious, poorly done and extremely slow. Even in 30 minutes it is very long. Well played though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It's a beautiful, single woman involved looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feeling and an excellent sexual scene. But (again) expected and even distant fear. <br /> <br /> It ends up very stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone should be shown first, but that is it. Tune it for one after that then turn it off.
