I'm a huge fan of fighter movies. Some of my favorite are: Bravehrart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching the mongol, which is absolutely awesome, and what I strongly recommend, my Sergei Badrov was high on the movie. But it was terrible, terrible, even merciful, not a strong word in this case. The whole movie was waiting for me to do something exciting, but it did not happen, at least I was expecting a big epic battle at the end, but it was also frustrating, even a little random, running with the sword ... there are a lot of good fighters, this one Not one of them.
