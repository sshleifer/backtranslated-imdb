This movie is very much like a hostel movie, * BAD *, without acting and much more mystery. The ingredients are there, but you do not really feel anything for the characters, because violence is not very effective. Some parts are just curious ... to force a snake down no throat. What's that with? That be scary or poor? It's just stupid kind. For torture, there really is no (no man is about to roam at the beginning, which they do not see in any way). The main bad guy says, "let's die slowly", but the slaughter kills them all very quickly. Death is relatively fast Yes, I watch the "unrated" version. So, overall, I'm not seeing the worst cow movie, but not all good. If you leave this one you will not miss anything.
