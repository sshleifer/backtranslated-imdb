This picture is very cute, and like the Tarantino <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It includes good sound, editing, set design, etc. <br /> <br /> Speak the word in this movie. Absolutely shocking I'm never too confused by the soundtrack, <br /> <br /> And we talk about low budget, movies made in Chile etc. Remember these days have been great words and have never been much more attainable. Anywhere More information about techniques and techniques is available <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad. Especially the foley are place and inappropriate across the place, atmos equally terrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during the movie, the result of poor sound editing. The sound inside the car is awful, the sound of the car closed doors is awful. The lady sings the word is wrong. Foley is either overboard, or just like the person of the person just got bored and let go. Space is wrong. Everything is wrong about it <br /> <br /> And yet, creativity limits do not allow the way, as well as the film tries to be brave. For example, aquarium sound is used in street view. When we are not supposed to, we hear the word. Sound editing before the visual cot. Every tactic is used in the book, and still the bases are not here. <br /> <br /> In the editing-advertisement we have seen the scene using heavy jump cuts, we have tinkering with timeline etc., etc. All these techniques are imitating an excellent low quality <br /> <br /> The overall mix is ​​shit, the word is shit. And so, the film is shit. With regard to so much basic error, which movie can be considered for prizes and high praise? Chilean cinematic new wave? Does Chile have the best creative output to offer? I do not expect, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that more selective and good talent in Chile can avoid this plagiarism in its plague content. Equally, this film is probably praised by the so-called 'world-movie' enthusiasts so much unreasonable criticism for the same global cause. They probably revel in its trashiness Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This image is garbage. It is not all mouth and no trousers and 6.8 ratings worthy of. The film has all the production quality of a cheap Tantono, new waves inspired porn!
