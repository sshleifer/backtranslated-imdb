All day I have seen dinosaurs now, and they have the same basic problems all day long. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in firearms. They just do not seem to have _told_ about them or anything. Close the dinosaur bullet _bounce_! Maybe it's because they have disappeared millions of years of gun discovery, and the laws of physics were different then ... Ah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to chemically work today, they will be risky for quick project (even subsonic) lead projects. It's that easy. <br /> <br /> The most difficult glasses of today's planet are reptiles, brains and crocodiles, completely weak for basic rifle fire. They do nothing magic. You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scale on their backs. They do not have armor-holes bullets or anything special. Small bullets surround them, they just do not kill them. Large (but not really) big bullets are preferred because the challenge (like most games) is to kill animals with one shot, so it is not run. (Hunters feel immoral to allow it to stop and stop unhervested.) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by shooter. Among the words, and even a non-lethal wound pain, the maximum will escapes. An exception to the big Bear, which is so vague that they are madly mad by the fatal wounds. Cape Herbal is regarded as extremely dangerous because they are well-known as charging during wounding. We saw the bigger picture of the torch torch at the time of the lion's pride to rescue the calf. A big cat will run if it runs, but if it can not be frustrated as a final act of frustration. Where a T.Rex fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior has only been observed. With these large creatures, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying a suitable big and powerful projectile, and / or many of them quickly apply to change their charges. With a T.Rex, of course, it can be a serious problem. I saw a T. rex poles (they are in a museum suburbs) and can be disrupted enough to carry a gun. Small flaws can be a more effective method to chew his throat with lots. Small bullets will still _penetrate them, they will not just jump because animals can kill easily! <br /> <br /> So here is our cortez and its male (this scene is probably the Mexican campaign, apparently captured by American citizens and dedicated for the pyramid). It seems that all these human festivals are t Rex coupled with bloodshed, which terrorized the continent. Instead of just being cut in their hearts and feeding funters, Cortez et al-Aztecs talk to their victims and allow them to kill. All right, maybe their M-16 can not be like the son of the "Carnosaur" series, but they are _do_. Flintlock, Crossbow, Tap Stick (Large, Made from Plants) and Towards It may be less unfinished than the whole squad of soldiers, but they have a lot of people and I want to bet on them on a quick dinosaur. Oh, wait, a _cannon_, about a 4-incher. Tiyanosasera hanging ticket! So they put a trap with a group of men, passionate, pieces of a rewine, and the first one in them. Cortez indicates that they will not have time to reload, so they will have to close the range until they can be specific to their goals. T.Rex completely ignores their villas in flintlock fire, and we see a crossbow Bolt _and_ cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it The credibility is over. A crossbow will defeat the Bolt Curtains torque armor, and a 4 "canon ball can break the wooden mound of wood! It can get _certainly_ of any organism hidden, rubbish, or hollow to run this planet. To prevent a 4w" banners Think?) And here T.Rex, standing still, is not even bleeding. So the cortez pushes towards Ravine, where it starts to pull, which (guesses by magic) it penetrates into it and kills it. Yaaay, indicating stick! <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs are not completely idle for gunfight - they manage to open their eyes with a pistol. It closes, so it's not like a beer or sculpture at least in the film. <br /> <br /> They killed the second dinosaur with bombs - made of ammunition and beef filled with jewelery. My money will still be the cannon. It is focused on the direction of engineer function - all gun power is focused on one side. A bomb power is much more diffused applications. A _real_ bomb (which is not a poor bomb) has a steel coating that has very high pressure explosion. (Think: pipe bombs vs. firecrackers.) A pill inserted into the firearm will simply go to the POOF. (That one believes me.)
