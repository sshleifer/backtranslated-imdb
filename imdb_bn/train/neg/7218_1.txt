There is a view closer to the beginning after a shootout where the horse is running. If something red catches your eye because it is parked behind a bush by a white van trail. I thought I saw bad but this is it. A white van is a white van. They did not catch it? Oh well, and I paid the top dollar on rent. It wants you to grab your friends and keep them all 10 grand and create a good movie. The conversation was so slow, acting was mostly okay but due to poor nature of filming it could not be taken seriously. The Sheriffs looks like a door with a door trimming specially today. I watch this movie, and keep the cabin boy away at # 2 at worst times.
