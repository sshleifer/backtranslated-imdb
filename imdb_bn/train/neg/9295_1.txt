I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Beautiful cinematography and beautiful landscapes can still take the movie. I was expecting a restoration of the hero, but this is a lot worse, because this movie got a bad reputation in the first place of Kung Fu Cinema. Any credible character (even in the cartoon world of Kung Fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no intrigues and twistsome twist. <br /> <br /> This movie is so annoying and so frustrating because it reminds you to try to play a make-believe game with a baby. Every time you think that your stupid fight makes sense, they invent another ridiculous curtain, which has no meaning ("Oh, you just think you got me with your super power and 10,000 ray guns, but I've got my vitamins with plutonium Eat and Teflon, so your ray gun does not work and I'm lazy to your super power. . "), The child can continue, because they do not really care, because no one is fun to listen to. However, for viewers, especially for adult audiences, this long film is worse than being in bad gases. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Always fall behind you, in which there is a knife, but it will hurt more and make more damage until it is fake, (c) if you rush into the heart with a knife, especially the old In China where there is no casualty around the corner, (d) Kung Fu does not last for a few hours during the crack of frost, and (e) sometimes it is valuable when explaining your character and their motivation. <br /> <br /> In any case, go to the hero again, because at least in this little world it is understandable.
