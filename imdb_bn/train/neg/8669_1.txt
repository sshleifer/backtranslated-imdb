First and foremost, I liked the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's kind of a walk down to your skin and after that stick with you. This was one of the best books, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I hope this movie will be fine. Like Jason Roberts and Jonathan Price, there was a lot of potential with a great cast. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, it was dumbed down. Bradbury lost the horrors of the book forcibly to maintain minimal violence. All the scenes from the book ... are gone. Everything that made you squirm ... gone <br /> <br /> and then have the acting. Like many of Disney's movies that have thrown in the 80's, the kids can not work in this movie. And, this has caused me a lot, none of them have seen 13 but 9 or 10. They did not talk about their strong friendships. They were better known they were better. <br /> <br /> If you think of Jason Roberts and Jonathan Price, Mr. Halloway and Mr. It will close in the role of Dark. But here they just do not care exactly like. What they want to do is stop some mortgage or something. This is far away from some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Palm Gray was fined as a sorcerer, but Dust Witch Chennai did not draw well. She does not have much less evil and the appearance as she has done the book. <br /> <br /> and what was left out of the book. Ballon Night Chase, Jim's house sign, Mr. Dark's real death, Mr. What happened to Kogan, matching-round, the fate of the lighting rod salesman, the real death of magic, and oh much more. The special effects for <br /> <br /> and 80 were also bad. Moving around with a rotating horse, one thing moves and wanders around, and that strange green fog that is not really something to do. <br /> <br /> How could I make the film different from the original novel, but it made blood droplets. Do not see this movie and read the book. It's a classic in Bradbury.
