I was skeptical of the movie going to be bad I have a Duke fan from the way back. There are three years in the DVD TV series. Well, I was right. The family decided to see it. I wanted to see the general jump again and was a bit better in the Chess jumps scene. But to add it, the film was a silent version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was unfortunate. I can honestly say that real-world clothing was just as open, the explanation of Jessica Simpson's Daisy was simply horrific. Sorrel chest and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you're an old try and true Dukes fan like me and you are my three kids you will be very disappointed.
