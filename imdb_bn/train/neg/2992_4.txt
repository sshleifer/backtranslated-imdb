Beside the Slasher Films of the 1970s and 80s, perhaps the second most popular horror sub-section of the walking dead, In Slashar films, to get the whole thing 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween', there was a picture of George Romero's 'Dead' photo on Flickshaw. Shortly after the first two successes of the series, other directors wanted to pay cash. Many Italian directors were especially interested, such as Lucie Phulcci, who was known as Romero's 'Door of Dawn', 'Zombi' in Italy and in some other countries, and was known as Phulasi's film 'Zombi 2'. Apart from walking, Romero does not have a relationship with the film, but it's a good film of its own. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a signal was born. <br /> <br /> Process: Many beautiful, lovely scenery. Great score Acting is not good, but it seems to enjoy playing Cast and Experience. Slowly slowly the motion continues as a fix. Lots of cheese and unfamiliar laughs for bad movie lovers Make-up effects work well. Many bloods and some decent gore. Cons: Nearly the plot is less. Nothing you've already seen before. 'Return of the Living Dead' closes some pretty nicely from the first couple of movies. Cardboard Characters. The 1980s rock song was not very good (I'm not saying that all the rock music is bad in this period), clothing, and overall feeling of the film. Final Thinking: Lastly, it is not really the real seagull of Phulchi's classical classics. Actually, I do not know where the film was released or whether it was ever picked. For those who did not know, they were sick during the production of Phulachi and left and were replaced with Bruno Matti. Mata's films are funny, but many good cams are fun like this movie. And these movies really look for something interesting. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So bad- it's a good rating) 2/5 (serious rating)
