I was looking for a cute, easy comedy to spend time, but selecting this picture proved a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing about it. Firstly, the script is stupid and not funny, depending on a fertive tortoise for tired, recycled jokes and laughs. In my book, it's not funny, it's kind of gracious. <br /> <br /> Low budget effects (if I can also tell them its effect) with horror movies In many places it seems like any indie film shot with no money. <br /> <br /> ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richards frustrated for some money they agreed to take part in? (Look at their recent movie, they will be present.) Despite wearing the dress, Pamela is showing her age and completely, they do not come sexy too, have fun alone. <br /> <br /> The movie is not even so bad-it's not in the funny fun. It's just worse, as everyone involved involved it was sick. Avoid <br /> <br />
