Character acting is a bit difficult, as the actor appeared on the screen for the first time. Unfortunately, one of the best actors, Gene Simmons (played a role in TV trends in TNG and night heat), died quickly, and then his performance could be significantly missed. <br /> <br /> <br /> The main role is illustrated by Mr. Ballard, Cliff Robertson. Cliffe was forced to carry the film with her physical language for most of the time. He does not do a poor job, but an actor is asked to plug the oceans on empty screen times, while the characters do not spend time doing them or acting. Robertson's most memorable role has been played by Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider-Man films.

It is a stupid disregard for the only dialogue that has passed, many passes in peace, one thing, and a few works. It is a shame that MST3K boys did not hold the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this film works for "nothing" that lives.
