Well this movie is amazingly awful. I am sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they can not write their lines. Sometimes distributed with a little annoying, which makes me believe that they are not taking this film seriously, and anyone can beat the monster slasher to see this overwhelming stop. I could not help when watching this "animal unknown" but thought that there was not much of a suitable author on a budget or crew. But, if you go to see it for a smile, you'll be happy, the film is a shame to make fun of me because I do not see how anyone can see it and be proud to pump directly into DVD clips. Action thriller / want to be awesome. Film fightfest lighting
