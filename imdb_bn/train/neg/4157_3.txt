Above and above all of my suicidal underlings decided to see this top page as a modern bullshit, takes the more appropriate title above. <br /> <br /> Horny, scary, suspenseful, well thought out, all these things are failing to fail this film. br /> <br /> This will have an interesting, slow, gradual effect and to create one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet this film does not try to be fun and it is one of the huge achievements of movies, it becomes a comedy, even without trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> An old man across the whole film, who amazingly sits near Santa Claus zombies and is nearing smashing the vampires on the ground. This failed to believe me the film's title, why did vampires and zombies fight against this vampire vs zombies? Oh well, there was more error in this rent than the title. This is such a; A wide variety of viruses have been created across America, which make zombies like many actors like your average tourists. And yet there are only four jumbs in the whole picture. Without another problem, all the places are deserted without one store. Of course you'd like to see zombies or roaming a bit in the woods. In fact, I believe they just wander around the forest circle, since they do not have enough budget for film in a greater position, or the director does not want to waste filming his precious time differently, he was busy in such a small trawler in wooden areas so that he Troubles with the kind of trivial issues. <br /> <br /> The director was so joking that he did not have enough time to rent. Large enough cast or even an editor. And so he said while trying to play eight members to make garments and to do vague work, although I think he changed his name and started snapping randomly in film releases, "Is not it hard to perform?" The only reason this "film" found its way into our bag because, because we confused Jason v. Jason, it is strange how these things are happening. And this night, we made it, though, by tearing gas masks at night and snatching on our foreheads, to avoid this annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yes we finally laugh, but I I am sure he will do a lot when he gets close to him ...................
