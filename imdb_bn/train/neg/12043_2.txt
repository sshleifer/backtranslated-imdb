I like Brad Pitt very much. He is not referring to the actors, faces, pectorals and the rest with the brain and intellect. Since I saw him as "Thelma and Louise" he is disturbed me, who reminds me? "Troy" did it for me. He is new Brigitte Bird The difference must be obvious. Men, Americans, etc. But Brigatier's message comes to mind. He is so beautiful that when he plays against him, his most effective "Calyprene" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Hijack" makes his own humorous humor make him almost accessible to humans. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Picture still with Pitt, will cover the walls of semi-naked incognito fans in the spell of the spell position. Curious, "Das Boot" is one of the best films of the second half of the 20th century. Wolfgang Petersen is directing this? Well, I think it's very hard to say that there is no scope to work with the new Briggate News.
