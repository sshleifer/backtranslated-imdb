Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, lost a housewife here in the sea to attack his son as a man in New York, and attacked his wife in the house attack. The horrible thing "cheap death" has been absorbed for the cheap jack thriller. It is not difficult to blame in this memoir: how the conversations are fulfilled in the context of full-fledged criminals, and supplementary characters are laughingly written (especially a disgusting judge who allows an accused murderer to go outside) courtroom. Low rental production is insulting in its selfishness, especially in our cities, violence has increased. * ****
