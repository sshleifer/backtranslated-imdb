In 1977, two crazy lesbian (Sandra Lock and Cologne camp) of this civilized film is hoping to find a place to live in the house of wealthy socialite doctor George Manning (Semur Castle). But these two think that there is a different plan, when they leave George's wife town, they take control of the house, dragged George, and kill the delivery boy while destroying the place on one evening. Concerned and annoying films, but the two films give the same bizarre way to the end. Most of them dislike it or after 30 minutes will be caught in this ridiculous movie. Some people consider this religious classic too. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
