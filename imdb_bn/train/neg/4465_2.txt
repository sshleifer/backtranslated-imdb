Following the final success of Amnab√°r and Beluugu, Spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. As a result of such a television-based production, such as El Segundo Nombre has been written in all movies, but it gives acting and worse guidance. I did not read the book at Ramsey Campbell, but I'm sure that the author of Do Who Who's Mother does not mix much with this terrible production. Avoid it in any way, unless you search for a lonely sleeping night in a new movie theater. 2/10
