Plot Sinapassis: Hong Kong, 1966. Victorian tunnel man Paul Wagner was killed by his associates with his wife. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated separately. After 25 years, Claude instructor Chad of Lad Angle and a smuggler from Hong Kong Alex joined forces in retaliation for the assassination of their parents and demanding a right-hand tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Gene Cloud Van Dam and Sheldon Latech worked together, previously "Lynhart". Van Damme's dual roles ("Most Risk" and "Transcriptive" are others) are among the first of three films. The plot is very easily accepted in the revenge story, the only freedom fighter in the film is Van Damme's performance as two very different people ?? The famed rich kid and the rough-and-tumble, the hard guy chomping the cigar. As it goes, Van Dam does not work very well in any role, though Alex is gentle with her. The brothers make mistakes for each other, after being different dresses and having different hairstyles as it is confusing. Say Yeung Baddies makes for a very deserving henchman.
