.... a dozen good movie ripoff Especially Steven Martin's "El Story", which was fantastic at least, was fantastic, though his girlfriend played his girlfriend in his film. Yes, naive boys and girls, "20 Dates" is a ridiculous phenomenon, although I'm not quite sure that when he started, the purpose of Miles Barrowvittes was. I thought that he started the project semi-serious, then quickly realized that if it is not annoying and is not funny then the situation becomes even more ridiculous. As a result, it is an uncomfortable, cheap and disrespectful feeling about the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Someone points to the smartphone, the film has two "dates" cases and restrictions on Miles have been imposed and they still appear in movies, which are impossible because it will require a consent form. It also seems to me that most female professional actresses (not famous albums except Tina Carre) present as "dates" - they are just very nice, smooth, thin and comfortable average citizens in front of the camera <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of using only the credible women, Berkowitz produces a classic flaw in this type of casting such a very thin actress, which proves ( Even in a curiosity) more credible and fun He is probably skating about his real-world problem, and seems to be the characteristic of the movie and the original world of Mylz Berkwitz, (his real life IMDB credits actually exist without this film). Even in the world of film, his ex-wife did not divorue him to be appointed. I think it's worth explaining to viewers (abandoning the real life dates of Mr. Barkovitt's alone) in a luxury apartment living in the most expensive urban environment in the United States, in a luxury car, and providing valuable food. When the restaurant has not seen any source of income when she is there. (Does he have a drug dealer? From his wealthy parents, there is no source?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "20 dated" is painful , Embarrassing United Nations fun Mr Barquitz's idea of ​​a trick should be his character, when at the restaurant dates, it has been announced to his colleagues that he can give diarrhea or constipation to the saved food - perhaps most children's belly humor. <br /> <brakovits did not make any films before "20th day" and did not create any single movie in the last 8 years, appeared as an actor in someone else's film or whether it was a writing or a kind of credit production. My intestine instinct has told me that the film does not finance "Eli" (gangster moneymakers who show off camera), but it is probably paid by Mr. Barkovitt's rich parents, or perhaps a disappointing abuse of credit cards. Whatever, we all can easily rest that Miles Barclaytz or his creative efforts will not be able to see anytime. Hallelujah !!!
