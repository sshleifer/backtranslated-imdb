Realistic movies, sure, except that the characters do not seem to be scared. Billy Jane tries to kill someone, she feels bad ... but she could not see. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier. No good thrill, realistic sequence. Not always shooting, that's one great thing. Good shooting I hate the order of the helicopter, because only the terrorists kill almost the whole seashore ... I give it *****
