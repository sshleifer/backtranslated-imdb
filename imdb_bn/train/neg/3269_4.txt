Except Merrill Strip's performance, which is always like a note, I want to avoid this movie because its quality of its "Week of Movie" quality is about it. But if you remember some of the concepts, it is valuable: how a couple can tolerate the media test and how they are treated in different ways. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Australians are different from "us" (the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically bring about the "curiosity" air about them. That the couple involved religious (most of the culture) and the Adventists (different) So their lifestyle and mentality are suspected to start. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we are facing strange question. The real story then behaves differently in society (and the world), how we deal with different opinions, different beliefs, what we do and how they behave as suspicious. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the word "A dingo my baby!" Without smile and there are cartoon posts, sorry, all about it on the web. But it has been discovered in a few years following the story and the film's success (as you will find in the web search) that a large child dunked by Dingo. Experts in Dinggo have shown that this is not only possible but it is taken by a baby dingo (probably a pair), perhaps it can be eaten at the moment without expertise and traces. Still, instead of killing Dingo to protect the children, why did the people protect Denggo because of the danger, why the question is back, why a woman's influence (expression) is so cold, she is considered guilty, and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
