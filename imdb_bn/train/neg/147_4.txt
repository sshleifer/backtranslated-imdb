Another horror film to add to the "Valentine" stalks and slash movie lists (think "Halloween", "Friday 13th", "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). It is certainly not as good as the movies that I have listed, but it is better than most of the reprint released after the "Friday 13th" movie. One of these films was the 1981 Canadian made "My Bloody Valentine", which I hated very much. "Valentine" is a better movie, but it's not saying too much. Plot: At the beginning of the film a innocent young boys are excited and ridiculed by her two classmates. Then the film came a few years later when that classmate grew up, then they were sorted into one another. The killer thinks that the little boy is now getting bigger in retaliation. But what is this to him? Can anyone else be? "Valentin" is an interesting cast where there are Dennis Richards, David Boris, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capps and Kathryn Higel. They can do what they can with what they've got, but a relentless script really does not judge them anymore. However, there are some scary moments. <br /> <br /> ** (Four out)
