Tell me something about this movie. I have seen it twice For the first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining for me. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was awesome. Really I do not know why I was funny earlier but now ... I could not laugh. There was nothing even little entertaining. It was just stupid. The story was weak. There was nothing special about acting This film has a great actor but still is the best mediator in acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is racist. Really Do not make me wrong, generally I do not complain about racism in movies. But I complained about the lack of black people in films like 'The Shawlin Temple' or 'The Street Fighter''s only black guy is one of the bad guys or ... whatever point you are. People are watching racism everywhere. I'm surprised they will react to a movie like 'Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. This movie has no asian. There are no white people in good guys. Actually, there is only one white man in the whole film and he is the leader of the bad boy. All the best guys are African Americans. Do not make me wrong, good people are not black or white or yellow or pink or green, I have no difference ... what I care about is that we can actually see a white person in this film. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It's not just realistic. If the only black person in Japanese film has no problem with 'The Street Fighters', most people in Japan are Asian citizens. However, if there is only one white man in American movies then there are some problems - most people in the US are white. It is a completely white cast and is filming a Japanese movie just as Asian as a bad guy. Not just real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the movie a rate of 4/10. If I did not have fun with it as a child would be 1/10.
