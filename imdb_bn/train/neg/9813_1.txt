... and I saw something bad. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. Activated by Jennifer Tilly as poor - as expected. Daryl Hannah did a good job, but there is nothing near being able to save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of this movie is that the plot is so weak - although based on a good premise - the author uses the "stupid heroine technique" to create a contrivave mystery. When all Darley Hanna will be hidden, she runs out in front of her followers. The scene in the hospital is weird. Without releasing a plot that can be passed, I think it would be difficult for a blood-borne petite woman to be pregnant without being hospitalized. Lame Very hair <br /> <br /> <br /> Save yourself a little while and take another glimpse.
