I acknowledge that I did not finish this movie because it was such a wonderful fool and not worth seeing. I saw it with a room full of kids, who was not laughing at the stupid and weird ridiculous. The director, Bob Dolman, Sprinter and Janetilia seem so overwhelmed that override the big story I grew up with. This is not a good film for boys! Apart from the absurdity of the content, the film is merely a stupid stream of stupidity and there is no intelligence behind it. What is a waste of a perfectly good story When you were young and loved it, then read the book, but do not waste time watching your movie, which makes it angry by making it fierce. Instead of buying your kids books.
