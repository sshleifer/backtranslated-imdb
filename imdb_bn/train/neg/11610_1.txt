No doubt Frank Sinatra is a talented singer as a talented actor. In the end, very few actors can get a scene in a scene nowadays, and that is what they call the Seneretra modus operandi. <br /> <br /> I think it was like in the 1960s, the movie really started the tank. The Tony Rome intelligence series was not even smaller than trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Hellem series at the same time. Perhaps even a James Bond contest, but nothing really worked for Frank during this year. In his personal life Shamble, his music spread ... Sinatra expressed more frustration in the 1950s. Perhaps in the year 1965, the last film of this time was probably the Von Ryan Express.
