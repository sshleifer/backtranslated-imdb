"Plan B" fares strictly according to the numbers except one thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> This film has a "star" and its usual, ridiculous, arrogant, graduate character that has fallen in love with "Pretty In In Pinkie" and has been paying attention to it. Never been amusing from ever since. Grating does not even begin to describe its performance. Ricky (Mark Mathisyn) is a muscular, blonde, struggling actor who (gasp!) Is worried only for his hair and legs. Talk about a stock character ... u At least three other letters are a bit more engaging. Lisa Dar and Lance guests are struggling to imagine who are a poor, hopeful, caring couple. Since they are not the queen of the Hunina, their roles are considered to be somewhat annoying and they do not have enough screen time. Sarah Mornale Gina, your normal and handsome young girl, who has not only played the right partner of love, but did not play. I saw this character one hundred times before, but at least its performance has crossed some shorts due to its prediction. <br /> <br /> I had an enthusiasm about this film, it's the promotion of its small stereootypes. They mocked him and presented Russia's character with the sole purpose of making fun of the street. He was portrayed as wild, unconscious and amazing shallow. They were just getting up warm though for normal nonsense about gays. Guinea will decide for a while because there is no fate with Gina. Really tell me. When Gina was throwing her friends with a gay man in a Christmas party, that was not really bad. Her lesbian date was very short hair (I'm sure all the lesbians do). She has been very annoyed (like I am sure all the lesbians are working) when Gina was nervous to keep lipstick (!) Eventually, Gina expressed her frustration when her date hit only about every woman and closed her mouth. Of course, we all know how homeless people can not be so faithful for few hours or even a few years, is not it? <br /> <br /> This image was created based on tired and anticipated evidence to start, but this statue, combined with extraordinary performance of the action, sank down in the depth. Of the movie. 2/10
