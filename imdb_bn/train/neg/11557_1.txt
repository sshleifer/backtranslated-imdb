* Siler * It's fake! The whole thing is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Allan wants a fortress and his title that is a lord and his cousin brother or brother or half brother or something like him. So he runs this all-encompassing complex and inefficient plan to run the Allen for L.A.SEOOVIE-DO. Most of the films have been picking red chicks and attacking them. She is not even killing them. He falls asleep and the girl becomes extinct and she thinks she buried her somewhere. If he sees the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he can say he wore gloves! My God wasted time. Do not be bothered to see it, rent it and sell it if you've bought it and still do not see it. Fast! Please make yourself a favor and stay away from the night out. I give this stem-o-Lantern stinker.
