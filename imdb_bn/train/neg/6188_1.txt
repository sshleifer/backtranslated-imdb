This is until I saw Jane Zenad by the worst adaptation. It is uncertain whether the screenplay writer Bronto read the book. George C. Scott is boring as ridiculous and Rochester - when not just plain old acting, anger. Susanha I've seen the most care-style of Victorian films in the 1970s. Characters rarely speak to each other, so the deep intellectual and deep love found in the book that has been lost is gone. The last is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version. It's true for the book, it's a novel you read aloud to yourself. Dolton Rochester as Superb. GC Scott is ridiculous.
