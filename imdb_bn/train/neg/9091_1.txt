Seriously, I've read some reviews of this movie, and I have to ask, are you watching the same movie? Yes, I give many credits to the Director of Setting up the 1930 Vintage Los Angeles Revival, but what is it? <br /> <br /> No character is liked, the story seems to be aimless, Karen Black is not only a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (And his character "Homer Simpson" wants me for an animated version.) Oh! Then your weird baby actor, Creepier Billy Barti, etc. <br /> <br /> It is one who loves movies cinema buffs and the rest look at each other and go, "What is the hack!"
