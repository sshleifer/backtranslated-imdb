I must definitely tell you that, I certainly do not own Bollywood movies and only seen a handful. However, if you never meet, do not start with this one! I've seen this one till I've enjoyed it, but I just can not stand this one. I could not finish this picture in front of you that you had to say - it was annoying. Why was so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the film. He is more boring than Jar-Zaar Bunga - which I could never believe. He is so annoying # @ ^ # She spoke in a falsetto voice and I think comic relief is meant to be. Instead, he just grated over my nerves and wanted to die ... slowly! His voice, his behavior and his absurdity - he could not just shut up and affected the scene he saw - and he would have to die! <br /> <br /> AK-47 Bullet Thieves had wonderful powers with the heroes comfortable. I'm not a kid - there was a scene where unauthorized boys took small assault rifles with this assault !! And, again and again, they avoid taking a single bullet and beat ruffians !!! It shows the activity of Stamen's "Rambo 2" hypocrite !! <br /> <br /> This picture is so loud, loud and loud in your heart - it's bloody my brain! It seems that the image is affected by the metha! Crazy camera angle, insert music and action, action, action ... This film is clearly designed for anyone who can not take a film with the plot and wants about 100% steps. <br /> <br /> 4. Two main characters and their actions and motivation create zero sense ... nothing! <br /> <br /> If you are the most popular action and Bollywood fan, you can stand up to this movie, but why can not I see it in the infamous 100 list of IMDB? Wow ... this picture is bad and very bad !!
