What a waste! This film can really be somewhat modest, but especially the writing is bad, and the main characters are rather shallow and selfish. Mike Mears was good, and historic entertainment was well-formed in the late 70's, but overall, this film was a big waste of time. Instead, to watch movies, related to the same theme and the same basic timing frames, the wonderful buzz night.
