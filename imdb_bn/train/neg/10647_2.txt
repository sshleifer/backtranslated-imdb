The last Tarzan movie starring Jonny Weimassular (after "Tarzan and Hunts", a year's wonderful old appearance is poor), yet it can add to the trinity look better. It is clear that RKO has tried to make a wonderful departure for Weissmuller, shooting in beautiful scenes in Mexico, the country's top star (Andrida Palma) and multiple award-winning cinematographer Gabriel Figaro, and bringing reputable composer Dmitry Timkin to do the same. Accounting Although it is low cost for filming abroad, it feels more expensive than any other film in Syria, it takes advantage of the original Pyramids as Acapulco beach and Aquinasia, and with impressive decorations for all the scenes related to the Temple of Balu Temple. Especially on exterior, steep stones.) Cart Newman should be in the role of director instead of Robert Florie, who gave it very slow speed. Newman's "Tarzan and Assassinson", "Tarzan and The Lizard Man" and "Tarzan and the Hunts" worked well, and finished his career in classic "The Fly" classic management a year before his death; She became the television director on the floor after a few extraordinary films. If weasullar feels tired, the chip playing chips are not as good as others, but the worst character is Benji, who is a terrific mailman who sings awesome songs (which has a Caribbean air, a place in Africa and shot in Mexico!) Annoying and suspiciously suspicious taste, It was a sad departure from Tarzan of the Wassuler.
