0.5 / 10 This movie is about something absolutely good. Acting I have seen the worst that ever, is really amazing that everyone is very awful, here and there, just a few. The side is a comedy, low budget frustrating, the score is horror, I will not say that the film has been edited, will be ruthlessly cut more appropriate words It combines serial killings, voodoo and torrent cards. Dumb Dumb Dumb It's not all terrible, special effects are hopelessly lame. The whole ridiculous is bad. The writing was unexpectedly bad. Cinematography is really cheap, and sometimes very cool, and camera-work is horrific. Again, how does the movie actually all actors? Bunny
