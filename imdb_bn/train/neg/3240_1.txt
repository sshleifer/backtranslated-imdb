This is Japan's first guinea pig film and it is the most sick of me. Eventually a few days before her assassination, a girl tortured a girl. And at this point, I would say that these movies are not real! They try to be realistic as possible, which spreads horror films. <br /> <br /> The scenes are sick but in many cases unreal. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kicked on the floor with her girl! And how foolish it is! The sound effect is also unrealistic and not knowledgeable. In other scenes, the intestines of the intestines of the intestine, for a very long time, tearing out the body's wounds, severe wounds inside the inside of the eyes and terrible detail and distorted like stuff. There is nothing very unfortunate and original inspired film and absolutely valuable or cinematic. The first entry is the most ill and most amateur guinea pig, although it is not bloody as the next part, Flesh and the Flash of Blood, which tries to frustrate as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Problems of the Devils Probably the most things I've seen and things to snuff are the earliest things. It is still the difference between (definitely) faked s (n / t) uff, genuine "snap film", that nobody really dies in this movie. Since thesis is so, I can not recommend to anyone on this **** y and annoying. They do not understand anything about a great horror movie movie and its true meaning, considering it. I saw (as a part of this series) as a curiosity and now I know how this is the smallest trash. They work only on shock level and it's not very valuable cinematographic achievement. Probably the most trivial movie I've seen and the Manhattan Mermaid (Guinea Pig 4) Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. So this is my book quite extreme, but that's all they are.
