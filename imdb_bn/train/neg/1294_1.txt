The central theme of this movie appears to be confusing, because in the relationship, setting, acting and social context, everything goes from the same place: Confusion. Even Harvey Kettle seems to be coming out of his element and lacks his usual defective transparency, direction and intensity. To make things even worse, its character's name is 'Che', and we only say directly (direct, narrator) in the film that she is not a guy named Che. Family relations remain unclear until the end of the movie and once it is defined, the family is divided - young generation goes from America. So clich√© Other reviews discuss how the film describes the impact of the child's family; However, the political position of the director is worst, and we are never sure who is responsible for bloodshed. So they lost their property (earned through gambling) - So what? While making a movie of the Cuban Revolution, refusing to take a political position, it is a strange and playful choice. The movie was not mentioned in English! Why are these Cubans talking in English? They do not have permission to get Cuban movies. And if family life is most important to visit here, but if we could understand who would - we would all know them by 'familiar' - the cheap way to clean up the relationship across this movie! The acting was mostly shallow, woody, and incredible, almost all of the time were closed. 'Special' visual effects were confusing and confusing. American film references - and black characters such as Greek chorus - strictly debunked, intelligent, and often out of place. I only saw the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity, or something I pointed towards it. It never happened.
