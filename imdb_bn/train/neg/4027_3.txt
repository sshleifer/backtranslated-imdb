This will be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. The lack of continuity and complexity and its total political correctness makes it a child with only good / bad characters. The world is not just like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite implications, delms etc. However, I hate most about this movie, Bola's friend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, they can actually be better than father (wow, like this ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Akro. I will propose you for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
