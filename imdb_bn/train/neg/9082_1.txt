This is the worst movie I ever seen. My favorite actor has a couple of it because I was deceived in thinking it might be good. Now I want to punch Jason Schwarzman face to face this role. I was physically ill after watching this picture. I never really understand Hollywood There are many people trying to break, I'm sure you can look up and get very good. The worst movie that you made in this way is equivalent to Ferris Buller instead of this emission. Gaga and jeans advertisements like hairdressers gradually add to the laugh of the film. Glad I avoided this film and saw it on TV. It proves that you should avoid the January release of all costs.
