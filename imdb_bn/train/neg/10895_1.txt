I have seen many bad films. Most of the time I can enjoy a painful horror movie for this. But it really feels bad for the new extremism. <br /> <br /> It is very strong, for this a plot never goes anywhere and takes time on it. No shock, no horror, no mystery, just a few hours people lock themselves up for an hour and a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A bombshell on the ugly horror genre, to avoid all costs <br /> <br />
