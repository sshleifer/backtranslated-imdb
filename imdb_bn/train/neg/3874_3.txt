This movie was so anticipated that for the whole time you are expecting that the obvious suspects are innocent, and there are still some big breaks. But ... it's not. He continued to work just unclear, and he continued to ignore it. Mary found terrible evidence in her place, and she still believed in him? And what was that "trap baiting"? There was no trap. He said to him face to face, "Forgive me, I must kill someone." He went away, and it ended her They try to use other suspects, (ultimately, like the old Carnival girl), but they are completely unused. In fact, all the characters are resorted. They have no depth, and the setting is simply weird ... who is hanging in the recycling factory ?? Its sticky and nothing is better developed. For example: when she leaves her place after beer, and she finds the pictures and she goes out and she keeps on catching her and they finish sex in that car ... What was it? His response was not illustrated. He was scared in the car, as it really got raped - but then we see him sleeping the next morning. booooooooo it can be very good .. sooo a lot better
