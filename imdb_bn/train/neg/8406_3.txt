A memorable line from a short live show. After seeing the episode where this line was presented, my Brotherhood Intertraction Flag Football team started using the line to break our hoodles for crime. Instead of preparing / break, football in our quarter said and the rest of the team gave you the BEET response! Our opponents had a fun way to break the wheel in their head, this show saw. Using this line, I forget that we add a unique element of the season. We had our best season of my time in college that year and due to the reason we were having fun using this line in a small way. The event was a bit tragic, but it remembers the memory of the Western Virginia Tech's Intermedial Flag Football Squad in 1977 PI Kappa Fe.
