I always wanted to see it because I love Chess horror movies and with such a title, I was sure that "incredible matching man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> This was not actually. I mean, the performance was modestly bad, there were some classic bad lines in the script, and special effects seemed to have torn apart a main actor, so I have to like it. Unfortunately it's really draggy in this highlight. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while returning my tax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To be justified to the poor people, it will have to provide some unusually long lines directly to face - like IM Man Like talking with his wife on the tracking: <br /> <br /> "I'll find him with a geiger counter." "Is he radioactive?" "Just a little bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is. Ted looks like a mini-dyson, trying to find only the armed zombie killing machine. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan failed when he found a large peg of a tree. "Oh God - it's his ears!" Listen to the audience I'm very happy that he's cleaning up. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm making fun of this movie rather than fun. This is only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it continues and incredible matching dude is more risky about sticky friction while eating more people in my opinion. I think if you are really throwing stones, you probably like it, there is no pop-tart at the time of the film, because the lead actor really feels the same to the end.
