Okay, do not we start with this little jewel? Mutant slugs start to take a small town in New England (?) Only a man can stop them ... and that guy ... Mike Brady! Now, that was not ridiculous enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> Footage of slugs is known as stock footage. Slug attack or where they do not matter, the same shot of the slugs is shown oozing all the places. Remember, this singular shot has at least half the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was being played, drag, steal your wallet, delete your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD I'm sure there's more bad, but you're being hard pressed to find it. The only gem was ... you're guessing ... Mike Brady! He must take classes at some night at the YMCA, because he was good at the bunch. <br /> <br /> for horror? This picture will not be taken seriously. Do not be afraid! They're slugs for loud cry. The entire growing action may have to be avoided with a salt chain or two. See this movie only in the type environment of MSST 3, otherwise I can see some big brain damage.
