This movie was awesome !! (Not as good as the late garage masterpiece lengthy) but still awesome !! I thought Ashley was more scary than Mary-Kate in this film. I wonder why? Who would think that they could swim in those places and almost go away with it. Dad was a little messy and played very little kiss with Mom Helmet Head. I give it 4. Anyone like this movie shoudl check out Longshot.
