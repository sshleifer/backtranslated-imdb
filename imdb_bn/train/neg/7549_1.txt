If Edward Woodward sees this movie, he will cry out of fear. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry people but enough. We got Carter, Italian jobs, Alfie and now these What is the harmony No This is not the majority in the fact that the original three star Morris MiklavioviÄ‡ and other stars are another great British actor. The main element of the elements is British film. They were not made out of Hollywood. They had quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that just can not be replicated in the US. The better way to destroy a cunning film than to confiscate it with CULT and an anniversary or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Before cracking on the street, Wicker 06 was a tough task. Wikile 73 is more mysterious that other civilized movies say; It describes the genre, intelligent script, A-grade actors, music scores, set pieces, and denies all the stories surrounding the movie. <br /> <br /> So here comes a remix. Do not worry. There was no major damage to the reconciliation process. Some major aspects of the story need to be recycled for the modern United States - communication, paganism, virginity But that's just about the whole premises. So we hit the entire style with shock music flashbacks for cheap scares hit injury in a name style. Then there is no contact with a mobile phone on the island that actually communicates - but it will not happen in the real world. The police do not just go missing. Instead of the conflict of faith, give him blood link to motivate and rebuild. Although the wafer is thin, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Name changes are only about Hamy, almost conveyed, there was no sense of community on the island, no one in the city to catch your bearings There were no centers, only a few houses were marked with forest and it was. Will was not only annoying to provide any information and Cage was not allowed to get away with her. When he went well you just knew he would get locked up. The screenplay was finally signed - and you just wanted to quickly and finish. The theorem was absolutely hilarious and did not know when it would stop. <br /> <br /> This last is probably the best way to narrow the gap between the two. One of the most beautiful days after the most beautiful sunset ends in. The other final explanation with post-production - The-The-Beatie-Type Conclusion. <br /> <br /> I love the original but I went out in the film and got excited to see the movie. . I expressed this gratitude that the film will probably end up under the Highway, at this moment forgiveness has been forgotten forever.
