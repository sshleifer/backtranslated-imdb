I bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. I bought 2 out of 2 free and I needed one more, so I chose it. Terrible mistake It will really be a good movie to read the box like. Well, this is the start of this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that's it. The film is about a young Laila, who is trying to save her bee jac from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a dancer who fears a dancer. He thinks Jack Laila was killed because he was afraid of this bull and went in search of this to find him. That was the first 5 minutes good. What is followed is only 100 times worse. Anyone wrote the script, in my opinion, was in an acid trip or something else because nothing has ever been made of ideas. Jack is on the move and this trip, named Mary, finds radio DJ, who gave him a ride. I was supposed to be a virgin Mary type character in Mary. You know, Jesus' mother But, who knows, I can not head or tail. They are running ... we can see bad boys, magical views, geological face, flashbacks, etc. ... and these things have been done in such a way that your brain tries to understand what is happening. Not saying, I have returned the movie and have exchanged it for something else. It's horrible I said, horrible. And, there is absolutely no bull-fight in this movie. Until you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I will help other people to waste their time in this movie.
