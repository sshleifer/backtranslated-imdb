* WARNING * Much spinner! <br /> <br /> I say, I have a lot of respect for Gillyan Anderson's extraordinary talent and versatile actress - that is why I do not understand the reasons for agreeing to do this. Once viewed (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> In the context of this picture, I thought it was a great idea and there were some really thought-provoking themes, but it was a fallout souffl√©. It's example, I'm 99% British movie haters examples. It feels very long, in most cases it is tedious, and after the first twenty minutes, nothing happens. When you think it is possible to speed up, Radha Radcliffe's marathon is frustrating as it is running. With little fanciful guidance and a minimum plot, there is not much to keep visitors away from their popcorn. For scripts I can only guess that the author is trying to save some trees, the average view is "Alice: F *** off!" (Adam Strauss followed Adam.) Alice: Adam! Adam! "I doubt that the term for the term probably paid more than the Kate Mosaic for the actors of her virgin mobile advertising." Phrokah is not often used with some lines that make friends proud of Shahrukh Khan, who is a friend of Broadgate jones, a little of the main characters before the main source event. Not that the audience is automatically 'Oh that terrible' reaction without axis He feels a lot of sympathy for him. The court is sympathetic. He has a great job, he died with a expensive London apartment roofs space, yet the screen covers for him. As it comes, miserable and dissatisfied before it takes a turn for the worst of his life, explains that after the attack some tear is torn - why he can start this way; he is a solid-bud He grew up with a boot soldier, who thought he was the ultimate expression of learning how to shoot his gun, instead of following his footsteps, he ran to the big city to look for something. His life liked his life. Instead, he has found a group of stereotypical middle-class tofs who are taking a safe entertainment / entertainment system that is not rich enough for lacs and driving (i.e. becoming Mrs. Robinson, Wannie Wiede's son wants to be an electrician)) Someone passed me a tissue . As the only surviving character of this character, he played by Gillian Anderson. He was continuously one-dimensional in the hand of a low actress, but M Anderson actually moved some momentary moments of humanity to enter this otherwise weird person, especially when he sincerely apologized for the road in his vain attempts <br/> <br/> <br / > <br /> I did not say that Adam loves very well. Danny Dyer played him out of fish like a fish like Jack Ladd, but a good performance could not protect him from the lack of scripts and the absence of any character background. <br /> <br /> This picture was mostly dependent on shock value but time was down and it seemed too much engineer from start to finish. In the face of this threat, the most threatening thing about this movie is that it is astonishing how painful Anderson has become. It was unsettling to look almost as cruel attack scene. As well as in British films, only a gang of violent sexual assaults will give time to offer contraception to each other before their companions rejoice - ultra-high-lip fat fat talk! If the national film is made in such a way that the national lottery is giving money, I would not be surprised that few people prefer to spend their pounds each week. <br /> <br /> I said that I hate this picture saying it is giving too much credit, I do not care strongly about any letter that supports strong emotions. I want to return one-and-a-half hours of my life, please!
