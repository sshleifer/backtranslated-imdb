The acting itself was not so bad, since it did not come in the film, but what did that director think? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm worried but shit, my time is 2 hours ..
