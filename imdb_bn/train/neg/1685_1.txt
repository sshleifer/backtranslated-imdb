All 14-16 year olds want to see this movie (although you are only allowed to 18). They heard that this is a very scary movie and they feel very calm. I feel very sad kids do not see any good movies and no bad movie This was one of the worst movies I saw this month. The scene that you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And end? This is an open end ... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a suitable environment for such stupid stories. This movie is designed to make you scared, and if you know something smart and know about some music, you know exactly when you are afraid. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over and I went back to my friend and told him that it was a total waste, then some stupid boy was strange to me. On this day I can make an Oscar with my goldfish home video, if I use the right marketing.
