I received this movie because I worked on a movie store so I got free rent. It came, and the cover looked like this. Hot chick, carry a weapon, okay, I'll check it out. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad move. It was very awesome, I used to watch movies in a hurry to get half the nudity, which was less. I think partial nudity three scenes May <br /> <br /> Chess dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuse of letters. I think this movie is bad, because I know it was made in a cheap budget, but it was "Clark" and it became a classical classic and franchisee. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
