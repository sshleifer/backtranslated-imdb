This, apparently, a movie about multiple grief. For example, it should be done to remove viewers and sympathize with the main character's plight. However, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost understandable. The camera creates a sticky, disconnected effect from one perspective to another, from one personal crisis to the next. Most characters appear to live in unmanaged, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (It increases credibility as to how much the amount of death penalty a person has given to the person who has sex with him). The story (if there is a story) is hard to follow. In short, the overall effect is rather frustrating. Despite this, the performance is generally good and some of the scenes are strong.
