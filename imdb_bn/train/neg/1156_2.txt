I have had an interesting experience for the tenants to visit. This is the first movie I have ever seen, which I have shot in motion through (-) activities - and I can usually see anything from the Targate Action movie to Sever-Crowt Indie and find them attractive. <br /> <br /> The tenant is frustrating looser and overchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is a little realistic character dialogue, except the set pieces where the characters are taken in a very protected setting (to do this, the film was supposed to be more conceptual, which was not it). This realistic character leads to the lack of development; Everyone thinks the two-dimensional. Bad Bill Spy for the <br /> <br />, Uck Snoop Dogg. I found her characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic. At one stage, I even stopped the film because I was so disturbed because of the aggressive, violent and unborn delivery of character that the lack of any other personality level except the reactionary "on" switch (which would be expected sooner) and I had to strictly release him some of the released attributes Wanted to have However, one reason for this problem is that the movie can be time-scale scale (estimated 70s, it looks and shows more elementary noughties). If it was more securely reformed in the 70's, its character might seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> The light of the photo was also strange. Through the soundtrack, everything is trying to provide a certain radioactive, jazz-surrounded environment that has not just stopped, because the set was very well lit. <br /> <br /> I have tenants, an incredible film. It does not represent the real person or present an interesting way of thinking about the life, identity or life of a writer, whether they are white or black. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I came with the feeling that this project needs David Lynch; Her eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel both raised in actors and scripts in something remarkable.
