I saw some people involved in this disagreement wrote a review for sharing their share of the story and I think it was helpful to understand what they wrote. In fact, they originally came up with excuses - revision, budget constraints, production arrangements etc. - Only underline this movie is so bad. And it is not personally criticized in my panning, but only an alert that it does not cut. <br /> <br /> It can be seen, but rarely. Each corner has plots holes, lingering on the boundary of dialogue, and the end is wire a mile away. Gently and dazzling features of a hologram in conversation with a reconstituted team sink into silly conversations, such as creating food through an unknown enemy facing a deadly and deadly face. We have to kill some Hamburger Helper Sally, are we being killed by this automatic carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team is equipped with the latest gizzam and red plastic tubeless surprise armor, no access to MRS. Once they enter the last chamber, they have more space than four stars more than a deadly face. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Yet just before one scene, in that case the heroes of the king abandoned that job exactly. is not it? Vivian One was interesting and hands down the character of the best acting in the film. But that's not saying much.
