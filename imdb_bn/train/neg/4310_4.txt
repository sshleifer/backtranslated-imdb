This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star, who is employed for high school boys basketball team training. Like the Goldie Haun's Willcatcat, it plays Kathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and it also allows scripts as well. I think Raquel Welch is a good choice, but considering the movie's budget TV budget, perhaps they could not afford it. Every shot of Kathy Lee looks great, but we do not get to see her completely naked. The story is quite amazing, at least say, offer no surprise. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the role of male leadership. She is interested in the party star and love for Kathy Lee. As a rich elderly person who runs the athletic program, there are some interesting scenes from Qianan wine and it does not seem that a woman should be trained to train. This point is brought across throughout the film, and, saying, is the date. Wickedly, Kathy Lee does not keep any of her team in an illogical practice session; He does not do anything to a male coach. An interesting theorem involved in a tall and extraordinary player that passes his class and the prime basketball basketball player tolerates hypocrisy like playing Sidney Wicks. It seems like everyone has got a good time to create this film, but the only real reason to see this is Kathy Lee Crosby. She is not that great actress, but she has a pretty smile, beautiful hair, and a very tiny body.
