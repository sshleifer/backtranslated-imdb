From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It is full of clich√©s your entire NRA member will not even love this movie. Because of the acting of William Benton, I gave it 2 out of 10. I can not believe that people voted 6+ for this movie. It lean towards a 'specific perspective' (once every thief ...). People are not born bad. They are not born well They were born with a clean slate. It makes society, parents and education which they create them. And if they come in the wrong way, somewhere down the line, but of course there will be no American punishments that return them to the track! However, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have good things with your time than waste it on this piece of bits. <br /> <br />
