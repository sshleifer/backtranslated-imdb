There is enough star power in the spirit room to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite controversial. The film and its messages are very great, and I think most probably agree with them. (Liberal democracy is good, violent fascist rule is bad, open-minded is good, racism is bad, etc.). Unfortunately, we are battered from toe with head with this, and I've described them as many subtlety is used. Finally, we do not see very famous people, without any flaw, there is no benefit to the nasty slaves, who have no freedom fighters. It develops with all the mysteries of a badly decorated "pro" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy is a patron of Iran, people of many contrasts play. Morley Strip closed her gifted bride and glenn as her sister, as well. When the camera is with these people, the movie continues and it is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the room of the soul is connected only to many subpages, and the characters rise above the picture as shooting gallery targets. We can not know them, so we can not take care of them. The results are annoying. <br /> <br /> If the director and photographer (orchestral book of Allende) has prolonged the August or film, or has snatched some characters, the film has worked entirely. It stands, with excellent message, it was a great effort, and there was a bone smell. <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
