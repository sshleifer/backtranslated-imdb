I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring Hip Hop, but was very dazed. Above all, the story is so badly recycled as it is almost intolerable. Second, setting, acting and story is not very authentic or credible. Third, there are far better black actors to choose from these standard choices. How about some originality? Thirdly, if the entry of hip hop songs is very low - if any. Nobody really feels central. Overall, the film was frustrating, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the movie fair.
