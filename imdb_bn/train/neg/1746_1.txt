Perhaps I saw the worst Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> There are no plot lines. Very small letter development <br /> <br /> is full of silly and vain humor. The whole picture was less chaos and direction. There was no correct end to the story. The airport was imprinted in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The same story repeatedly shouted again until you said "Please, go with it!" Even songs and dances were vain and bad dancers. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in this movie that was hot around ... but still the majority of Bollywood movies are in any way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
