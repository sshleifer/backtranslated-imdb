Chillers start with cold, dark winds because the bus of three buses is station bus station, Messon (Jesse Emery), a young boy, college professor. Howard Conrow (David O'Hall) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington,). They discovered that they missed their connecting bus and stuck for the night. In the waiting area, they found two people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and Lindsay, a sleepy woman (Margari Fitsimmons) who is now suffering from nightmares ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The friend of Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay Bill sees the dive in the pool, and then it appears in thin air before patronizing. Lindsay said Lindsay died in a diving accident five years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He travels around a newsman called, he calls, Tom is not in front of him at any time, but he is going to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It turns out to be Ronnie's And how he discovered that he Rtake could bring, unfortunately the death of Nelson's killer kauldara (Bradford Bowl) <br /> <br /> finally said. Kono brought two of his students who were called the Expe, an ancient idiot war god. You come back to life <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Generally, this sub-section is preferred. Bild's scripts like chillers do not have the need for movies, you can see that the final turn is coming a mile away and every story is really hair. The first is totally vain and it does not seem to last, and the best thing about these myths is the brief graduate story in a clear mobile phone. The second story is predictable and, again, end without any payoff. So it continues to chiller that every story is unhappy to watch the clock and there is no reward for doing so. Characters and dialogues are poorly written, stories do not seem to have their own ideas and the film is completely distorted completely. At least every story does not last long and I like the idea behind the linking section. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd certainly works with a very low budget and it shows. I can say that you want to set a 15 minute short story entirely in a swimming pool, but for you, you can choose from. The stories are not tricky, alarming or creating any kind of tension or something. It seems to have some nice scenes and some wonderful skills shines through the occasion. There is not much happening in the violence and knowledgeable chillers, a lethargic heart, a decapitated head, and a bitten hand as it gets, and so poor. <br /> <br /> Technically scattered are poor elements which will not affect anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, special effect on cheap and down average production standard. Chillers sometimes feature the worst closing theme songs of the time. Acting is very low quality. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the Chillers were trying as little budget movie and at least the movie makers tried so I would give credit for him at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking of crap. Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terrers House of Horrors (1965), Kreppov (1982) and Tales from the Darksides: The Movie (1990) Chillers are far superior, so instead of those one watch.
