Dedley Wake is an ideal film for filmmakers ... learn how to make a movie! <br /> <br /> I see ... what did the crew awake on this Flickr? The worst music mix is ​​the worst edited Best of all times Best Directions Most Performed Worst Painting Worst Screenplay Worst Trend The worst set is the worst light etc. Let's face it, if this "film" is black-white-black, and silent ... it can still be awful. All scenes are dark (people called "black" in the light), often the music score submits confusing conversations, which was right because no one ever spoke two complete sentences without a long break. "Bad" robot was sunny ... what was that? Jazz dance Oh ... I suppose it was supposed to walk strategically or something. I'm afraid it's fear of fear of poor editors! And, how do you edit so much junk footage? Not possible Garbage trash, how you make it splice. Can anyone ever get it through Dellis ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line- I could not agree to see more than 15-minute part, it was very bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with a long gap) just to see if there is any good part of it. No! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
