The film is poor and lacking in the vicinity of the word, but then most people will struggle to show promise in a script as irrelevant. The dialogue is not really flowing and sometimes this case should be less (or should). It has been backed up by curious scenes (such as the Cametry Slow Walk), which you think might lead somewhere but can only waste more than a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> This plot was a good idea at the time of the strange gangster / situation comedy combination that I was sure, but in some cases it was necessary to ever be honest with the author of the script <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> She still seems to see a character, so she started thinking about whether she was given a script or just shooting and Babhabika responded. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This 'Python' (I think) Shakespeare reminds of his 'comedy' quote - If he thought it was ridiculous, he would joke at it. Well I do not see one. Do not waste your time - I did it because I saw it with a friend and hoped it was getting better. <br /> <br /> It's not.
