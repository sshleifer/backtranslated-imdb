I just liked having fun while watching it and having fun with it's film's total evil. I saw this film through the helpful mocking of Science Theater 3000 of mystery and I have the DVD.

Seriously, folks are these fried cheese. <br /> <br /> In general, acting, special effects, and the plot is very sugar and unreal. "He does not need lungs." Crowe said, "How can I talk if the head is not talking to the body, and Tom Sro just says loudly," He's got the juice in the neck! " Finishing is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-porn! I liked the "fight the cat" between two strippers. Whatever "Mao", after the war or scene, was classic. So, in some ways it was a fun movie. I think for the horror fans, you probably will enjoy it. For a better time, see the MSTK3 version, you will get a great smile. <br /> <br /> MST3K Version: 10/10 The brain will die: 1/10
