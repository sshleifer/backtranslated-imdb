The compilation course is worse than the week's usual "evil white male corporate capitalist" film. This movie is less blessed than a teeth dentist. J Leno can work. She is good at her underwater debut, The Silverbears, in which she gave a performance with her character's needs. This movie is so bad, Leno's character, a tender buffoon, less annoying than a Morita character, a sacred stupid fool.
