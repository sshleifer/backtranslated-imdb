In the recent life of Alex Guinnes, I did not find much about Paris with love. I'm sure Guinness has done this film for free travel in Paris. There is no other reason for the existence of the image. <br /> <br /> Certainly photographed with Guinness and his son's fantastic opening with Arc de Triomife in the background of Paris. Unfortunately it flies away from it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> According to the recent biography of Guinness of Pierre Paul Reid, Guinness positively dislike her, treats her behavior as abnormal. What is Odel Vernos thinking about his co-star, no record is available. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I will not wait for him through the film. <br /> <br /> At least Alec traveled to Paris without this agreement.
