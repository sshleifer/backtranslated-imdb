All right, I could not sit for a series of "Star Trek" series watching to see the cobbled spaces flying around. <br/> <br /> 1 has found a nebula or some lines in Armaan and wants to take a closer look but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> <br /> He has sent a shuttle in Nebula and the shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> All the problems that I have seen in the past are all the mistakes of Archer Due to Oh and did you see the preview of a episode which looks like archric and tipple kisses?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to see that episode but then I completely dropped out of the enterprise and turned into a TV. Come on !!!! Travel this star !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!! In one episode, Hosi had a banana slog but was stunned due to some stupid reasons. Well okay, a little stupid brings you a pet slug in space but whatever. All right until they thought they had gone to the desert planet !!!!! A Banana SLUG can not be in a designer !!!!!!!!!!! How foolish is this writer <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not see any other way, just enter the enterprise !!!!!
