(Spoilers are) Homesidal Niemfomannik hooker Mia, Curie Wuher, took the life and car of the 18 virgin, although she felt very embarrassed to accept it, Collage Freijman Trent Colbert, Crisfur Ryan. The movie does not just get destroyed after the end of Mia, but it teaches that how to identify the weak and stupid Trent as dangerous brown works and to keep so far for it, that it is going to be one after the other. <br /> <br /> Hanging Mia Roy around a trucker, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy steps, sitting on the back seat of her garden. Roy is too drunk or fool to understand that Mia is not one of her daughters! Mia was unwilling to get along with her that Ray was often beaten by her first death collage student Trent Colbert for being interrupted by her. <br /> <br /> Seeing his chance, Mia entered the Trent's car and both of them entered the movie of strange cars Chase. All in North East America ended, a truck truck was involved in the killing and was involved in the shootout with the state army, which resulted in hostage in Trent's parents' house. Insane Mia has another wild shootout with a full swat party, powered by local police and state fighters. <br /> <br /> It's not like a movie like "Hit and Run" you want to be deliberately or oddly funny. In fact, the film is very annoying in how Mia behaves with everyone in the film. He came in contact with his distorted and child abusive father Ray. Poor slabs become drunk while living with a matted room to run him across the northeast Mia of Trent, together with strap handcuffs and a light candle. Mia also gets it as part of some strange sex game to give her gun with Horny Mr. Foster with Matt owner. After foster up, he stopped with Trent, who was cold in his room, there was a wallet of about $ 400.00, but his car was not bothered to drive. <br /> <br /> For Thanksgiving Trent, her parents need money for money to return home, to choose her in a local diner to return to Mia from her mobile phone. Like Trent, Mia, who is now suffering from the law, and later her father took Ray to the open highway, because she tried to run both Trent and Mia on the street. <br /> <br /> She wandered on the body of this body and hit Ray Mia, she travels on a high mile road in High Hill, where you know where she explodes. Own shotgun Ray was so busy that she tried to stop her pants that she forgot that she kept the gun up. <br/> <br /> In addition to holdup and killing, both hits and runs are charged against them. The TNT is closed on the S & M / Tattoo Booth where Trent pierces his ears and nose and is clothed. Leather and chains by mom, together with her and her dog collar collar. To fill this straightforward dinner for his straight-minded and conservative parents. <br /> <br /> As a result of the ongoing shootout with state soldiers, one of them was seriously wounded, with Trent's parents, Mr and Mrs. Colbyet, David Keith and Allen Martyn's home-law enforcement agencies, The police forces are waiting for them. <br /> <br /> Overwhelming film with an unsatisfactory ultimate ending which makes you wonder how the film is actually trying, to tell the audience. You first felt a lot of sympathy for Mia but the film was reduced in collapse with the fall of the film, which became faster in the Death Valley ice trousers tray. Although the film was the first to be the most unlikely person in the film, Mia completely removed the film.
