This picture is so bad that I can not believe it was actually shot. Those who gave 10 or 9, 8 and even 7 votes, are they insane? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same sh ** i would say Everything is bad in this picture. The story (there is a story there?) Is not going anywhere, completely incoherent, acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), music score (which is ****?), Editing, and especially artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me of the oldest MacKiss movies ... to give you an example of the dynamism of production, the mermaid dress is a sleeping bag that blows on it. I'm not kidding, it's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the big mistakes we have found here is: You are an extra, in a scene, a thick woman of about 200 pounds, who is talking to her mobile phone. The next shot, which is completely different, you can see this same woman, still talking on her cellphone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, huge, waste of money Useless
