### Spiller! ### <br /> <br /> What is this movie? Control editing and cinematography that match a terrible plot. Denzel Washington's talent is sad to see such trashes broken in. We must, of course, indicate that Mexican must themselves, the forces needed to outwardly, possibly militaryist, Americans can save. And we know Dad is the character of a film, after all he is a Mexican, wife who praises Creasey because he is American. He killed all of them dead. And what did he do? Of course, he is not a small kid, and you are not hit the Hollywood fan's sensitivity. Scenes off trade was the only thing that prevented me from rating below "incredibly successful" (referred to as some critics). As the vomiting of the movie will take time. This is in the ratings of movies that we have to suspect for IMDB's credibility of 7.7 and 7.0 for my own personal idaho. Go figure! Mine will have a range of 3.5-4.0
