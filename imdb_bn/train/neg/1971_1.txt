These pictures are deeply frustrating. Only Wonders does not display only a very limited musical spectrum of blues, its personal and personal interest in musical parts that he's heard and sounds. The only highlight of the movie is the Swedish couple's interview, whom JB Lenoir was made friends and his personal video footage was shown and he had to tell stories. Vendors start playing the role of the film in a very interesting way - travels around the world (or, of course, American culture) the world's culture, but with its scale with the theme, it does not seem to limit the fun and completely impressive reproduction of 30 second stories. Movies as a mere sleeping aid. to yawn. I was more expected of him.
