This movie really made me mad because the main characters or all characters have a south access. I've lived in Iwate for 29 years and I know that people do not have an accent here. This movie is about a person who has meth and I do not know the actual plot or what the film seems like. It has some great graphic drug use and it's really insulting, so these people see sugar as sweet. I lost my brother to Meth and this film makes me sick in my stomach because it fades up the drug. It looks great for the use of the drug, but I was finally happy when the man made it almost on the street. I also know that most women who are victims of aggressive rape do not want to love their boyfriend or husband the next day. All aspects of the movie are just wrong. If I'm going to recommend a movie about drugs "basketball basketball dresses" will recommend.
