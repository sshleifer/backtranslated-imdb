David McKenzie's Brilliant Young Adam's follow up is a solitary story that is trying to deal with some deadly sexual problems with his dead mother. It wants to be paved, realistic, and mysterious. At the same time, he wants to be funny and wants to establish himself as an adult as illogical for his boring leadership. <br /> <br /> For this end, the film strives to be young. Its poster has a handwriting character like Junoon. His original soundtrack is made of fast rocky indie rock, which means that I'm fine; Just a little confused. But oddly the film is a young person. <br /> <br /> The central mystery of this film, like Young Adam, expresses concern for a drowning woman - in this case, Young Adam keeps his mystery quiet, thinks well enough to hurt with real truth. Hallam is not the opposite of the enemy. This makes the psychology of his character so clear and so early that he does nothing outside his expected parameters. The opening scene was made to fool his plants, his sister to his boyfriend. Hallam immediately intervened, his presence in the presence of the family. Here we will see everything that is done for all movies. <br /> <br /> My mother's drowning mystery is suicide or killing by her father's girlfriend. The audience can not really believe Halam because, apart from being obscure, we think his passion has led him to madness. This prevents mystery stuff for me, because hallam can be very consistent. Just when he found some details that would support his claim, he would run away from home, firstly it seems to be looking for the police. Then she gets highly seditaked by a girl similar to her mom, which led to the mystery story from the mystery story. <br /> <br /> Although Jamie Bell brought some very respectful features to her lost character, she was limited by the clarity of her emotional needs. This film is not mysterious in any way, yet it is not silent. It tries to be realistic in dealing with such problems, but it adds a very self-conscious spa that registers itself as a reverse. This is a soundtrack-heavy, transposing attitude that helps the audience's route to viewers who take away buildings, lanes, and camps for visitors. This urban peeping Tom Adventures is very difficult way for the involvement of an internally drawn country involving Hallam and they are not sexy, giddy, or blessed. They are more neutral than some; Not propelling the characters or stories. McKenzie helps you to understand Hallam, but he fails to build a common ground. <br /> <br /> She hopes that you will enjoy justice and suffering without much ideological reasoning. The film monitors its viewers' views and how they are involved in it. Obviously, most people will be hated by it. And you've got to understand it, but it does not show us the weight of Halam's decision morality. He went to the person from person, trying to fill his deep void. There is a special annoying line from Kate, who is keen to love Hello, who said, "I love vague boys," probably said to the audience. The line tries to predict his understanding about him (his motivation remains unclear throughout life) and he tries to move us from judging him. Choosing to love is not difficult, but it is very difficult to participate with his courage - even if it is even an adventure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was recently renamed to the US release and for what reason? This is not just unexpected, but the strict truth is that the character never gets the title 'Mr.'.
