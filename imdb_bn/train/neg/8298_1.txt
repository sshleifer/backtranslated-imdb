This movie was not very entertaining, certainly not as real or as good as a Christmas story. Try to imitate the previous actor (except the newest) characters, and they fail. Hillary hills do not come from anywhere because they were not part of the first movie. This really sucked, might have been good with the original cast, then the story probably could not be so weak because of it. leave it.
