What a terrible movie The acting was bad, pansing was bad, cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effect was bad. You expect a certain degree of a slashher, but the killings were even worse. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the past events that lasted for 15 or 20 minutes set the purpose for the murder. I will not end it. They can remove 80% of it and explain what has happened. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims were invited to "reunite" a abandoned school, which still had all utilities running. One of the victims thought it was a bit weird, but they rejected it and decided to break it anyway. Finally, the assassins were often so fake that they were unexpected. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie, unless you want to see some breasts and do not have very good breasts. This movie makes the showcases virtually blurred from Citizen's reason.
