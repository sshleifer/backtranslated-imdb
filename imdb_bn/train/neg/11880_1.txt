Especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mails, voice mails, snail mail and 'temps' office work offices are seasoned with kitty potentials, which were previously called clockworkers and 'office space,' and very successfully. This recent addition to the heat / laughter pool, however, 'Hiku Tanel', directed by Josh Cornbluth and Jacob Corbald, failed to live with his predecessors and laughs somewhere outside the house, waiting to wait for the wait. Unfortunately for the audience, that does not come to chance; So what you get is a great effort, but people once said, there is no cigar. <br /> <br /> Josh Cornblut (playing Josh Cornbluth) as the film's narrator / star, in the first frame (in a single language sent directly to a camera), this story is a true fictional, and in the fictional city of 'San Francisco'. It's an innovative, if not very well presented waiver, and all that's funny. However, the following is a hibigger, which is all - like the claim - it's not just funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> as a 'temp.' It is a work that makes him fit, and it gives time to slip into some novels in some novels. But when he went to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he did a very good job on the first day and sent Selby chief executive Marlin D'Amore (Helen Shumker) to Kennblut so that he could give him permission. . 'Though the idea of ​​working full time for the same company initially feared Cornblut's heart, he expressed the cave and signs for this position. He is nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they will never be with a temp), and if things get very rough, he has seventeen important characters - that will just now have to be mailed out - Reading back (they keep them behind because mailing is a simple part, and to 'reserve something' they need to be made, if it all gets too much for them Bid). These are the 'important' characters, however, and at the end of the week, Coronneboth is still preserved in their desk. And Sheleby finds out about it when it does not take a talent, Kornbluth's day as a fair hair boy is going to end. And fast <br /> <br /> Brothers Coronblut, who did not give the directive, but John Beluchi also wrote a screenplay for this picture, he definitely took a page from the Ben Stiller Book of Commedy, where it says' If you play it straight away, they will laugh. ' However, they do not, and will not be viewers. Because even in the comedy, it is as neutral as possible, when the main character (as well as in the case of support, supported characters, in this case) the funny 'place' - as he knows, he's funny - he never And that's exactly what Kornbluth has here; Instead of being "funny", he has become disreputable and provoked, in the part of Carnbluth's case, a serious flaw in the trial, because by allowing it, they snatch their own film. <br /> <br /> Trying to understand why this movie does not work, it comes down to two basic reasons: instruction, which - if not necessarily 'bad' - is at least helpless; And secondly, performance started with Josh Cornbluth. Quite simply, Kornbluth just seems to be here impressed with himself to be effective. Like Stellar or even Steve Martin, both use self-contradictory humor very effectively - Koranbluth has apparently a pride that does not allow her to put herself in that light; Her listeners should know that she is actually much more clever than Cornbluth, the character of Cornbull. And failing to get him past, as well as film him. Instead of seeing millions of official employees who can relate to this film or with whom they can identify, Cornwald influences such a great behavior that only helps to isolate people who are trying to reach them. So it comes down to everything, an illiterate instruction and an inconsistent act, and when you consider that scrappull itself was weak to start, an implicitly narrow focus (with the probability of a rich subject), it is <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Fairly ridiculous. Its functionality has diminished, but Keith will have to share his scenes with Kernbluth, which will automatically cancel his positive contribution to the project. <br /> <br /> Shumer and Sarah Overman (Julie Festino) manage to keep the water on their heads through their own performance, which is commendable, if not completely memorable; They can at least be able to see their scenes, and Overman even moves to make Cornwall's performance even better. But it's still not enough to save the day or movie. <br /> <br /> Assistant actor Emmy Resnik (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Loman (Doovon), Joe Ballan (hostage May Clarke), a strange character in Harry Scheer, as an elite leader - a role Asked to answer this question, what did he think when he agreed on this matter? In any work environment, there will always be such situations that one way or another will unknowingly become a cover for someone's playful artillery, and the images that describe this situation will always be with us; Good ones (see paragraph) can even be classic in their own right. 'Haiku tunnel', but suspiciously there will be a long time between them, because its fate is elsewhere - in a state known only as 'ambiguity'. I rate this 1/10. <br /> <br />
