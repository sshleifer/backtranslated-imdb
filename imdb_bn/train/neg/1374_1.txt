People, this was sunny. It will be under COMEDY. Or Stupid. It was understandable that a lid of this rib was much easier. Seriously? Anyone associated with this movie I want to be immediately effective, tired. For everyone thinking of watching this "movie", let's get rid of several plot points. Wait. There is no. There are literally no plans. I think Kasperse van Dyen was bored, and he decided to film with some random people, and miraculously, he got it on a videotape in some way. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me See it. This, man. I dare you But your eyes will be ready to gouge. If you can sit on the couch without running out of cattle then you are very strong and brave.
