I have 20 routes canal again than this film goes through. Prince of Anneong, Myls Barkovits, has been spoiled for almost two hours of my life with brutalized pseudo-cooled pieces. The only ridiculous thing in this world is the camera patter, Mind and ass of Mr. Samha. Berkowitz takes a great idea and grinds it into the dust. It is sticky and badly done, a clear effort to think it's obvious or fun. It is not. I rarely believe that a movie was a waste of a film (or tape), but it qualifies for that difference. Recommend to see a date if this image, run.
