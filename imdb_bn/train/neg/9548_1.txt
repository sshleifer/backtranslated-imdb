I can not believe I see more of this expectation. It's OK to start. This movie goes far beyond the realities of reality !! At least the first one was realistic. It rips off the first movie and even mentioned Joshua Project. Anyone who knows about computers will hate this movie. But it's a good message, watch out for the big brother !!! The film simply feels bigger than reality, just like Big Big Brother. That was very annoying. Even make-up on the actors was completely bad. Some of the performances are pretty good. Some really played really bad though. Some points on the script were just fine and completely messed up in other parts. This movie plays on the advantages of every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I'm even more hopeful. I think I'll pop the original to come back to Earth ... the question is
