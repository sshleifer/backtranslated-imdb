It comes close to me as a soap opera. I think any image of the phenotype can be considered as "social commentary". But in the final analysis, I do not care how you do not just play this movie. None of the characters are very liking or engaging. I did not feel any chemistry between Hodson and Bkal. If there is a love story here, it's lost in malaise. And despite the twist provided by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand a complete and immediate (and therefore, unavailable) reverse, the story kept my interest inadequate. It does not matter how much Fredan symbolism and psychology can be thrown, this story is lazy, gentle, and treacherous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspirational performance, but his character is fake, and his kind is fake. Robert Keith is the most sympathetic character of loving two-boyfriend adult child, out-of-touching father. But the most interesting fact is that Robert Wilk, who played a minor role repeatedly as the owner. He remembered as an extraordinary Henman in the countless west, but here he is an honest, favorite colleague. <br /> <br /> I take my social commentary, including an interesting, engaging story and some favorite characters, thank you.
