The good thing about it is at least fresh: often hit a movie about dance music and club scenes (even if created). And it also sells lots of power from the illustration of Ezzy. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it can not be determined what it wants to be. It clearly likes to be a maiden in the line of spinal tap, but the manufacturers also realized that they do not want to play copiteat. However, it fails fairly on jokes because it is not very well written and most characters are resorted. And there is no pressure on its script and it is ready to be ready for 90 minutes, so why not edit it up to 75? Production department and cinematography are still trying to save the day's storage (such as Paul's house). <br /> <br /> A strange way and unexpectedly all that ended, Pett Tang works much better as a general drama almost as famous. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batda provide some acting ability. Conclusion: This is a mess, it is a little fun for a basic level, but you spend your night at your favorite club well.
