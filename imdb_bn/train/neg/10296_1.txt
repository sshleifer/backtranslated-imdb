This is probably my DVD --- but I do not recommend anyone trying to view this image on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Turning the volume on my TV to the highest possible level. About 80 percent of the dialogue. Some things were still sub-audible. If you are from Scotland, you may have a chance. <br /> <br /> People's voices sank almost all the surroundings, including smashing on a package, footprint, even a cigarette. <br /> <br /> This volume has become the stage where the voice can be heard, I can guarantee that at least the neighbors call the police when the scene changes in a high ecosy environment. And to remove it for remote, it will hit itself with diving. <br /> <br /> There are also art and audio mixing industries. But during the war, this effort will meet international standards for classification as oppression. <br /> <br /> After about an hour and a half, I left, I did not see anything else in the picture.
