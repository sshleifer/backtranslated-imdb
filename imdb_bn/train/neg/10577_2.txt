Some filmmakers who made the series have made some great films, but the hack does not show much skill with this series. Especially written. Well, the first season was a bit better, but these new episodes are just making them. I'm a huge fan of the horror fans and in my opinion, a large part of this episode is a total junk. Nothing new or genuinely interesting. Some of them are apparently creative. It's just common fabric Hollywood crap, reluctant, childhood, poorly fictional and in some cases, flat out humorous. The only good thing from the crypt to the Tales that is proposed in this series is great nudity! Other then this series blows hard. I get the impression sometimes they are hiring a bunch of eighteen graders for writing episodes. Maybe they did.
