This movie was horrific and was an insult to the audience. Stupid scripts, bad casting, endless annoyance. <br /> <br /> In the general tradition of Hollywood, the US government is always shown as bad. Hollywood's communist-sympathetic knights, most of which love the only note by portraying a lot of stone boxes such as mobile phones, Eugene McCarthy and a huge mobility leader. The truth is, he was considered to be the character of a character who was exploiting a legitimate concern for the political gain of the Soviet communists. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and America brought it to the bad Nazis. Warner is like Vaughn, without which we have no space program. He actually loved American and became a great asset for the country. <br /> <br /> And yet the mockery is that Hollywood's fool, a vague person who maintains fantasy existence, still believes that the government should run everything and what we want to give us all. And yet, it is the same government which they portray as such an increasingly bad evil.
