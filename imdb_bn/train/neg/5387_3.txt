At one point when it was getting interesting, never got there. <br /> <br /> People are moving from one point to another, there really is no point (if it was too dust). There was no action, suspicion or horror, and the letters were quite stupid, so they did not care. <br /> <br /> In all, the movie was quite annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> I give it a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like it that it was not a sticky camera-work and music did not disturb me like some bad movies and the act was not terrible. .
