This movie is a noisy effort of thriller. On the way to Las Vegas, a tour bus was attacked by a group of White Trash hijackers driving a dive buggies by team. They carry them in the desert and then steal all of their precious. Continuous changes in plot One minute they want to kidnap the daughter of Richa Ranchor, later they are looking for a collectible stamp of $ 90,000. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
