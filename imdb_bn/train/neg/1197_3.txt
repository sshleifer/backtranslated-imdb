They can not get real stupidas compared to this movie, who deal with 3 people, who try to capture the spirit of college during the celebration of the annual spring break in our higher education schools. The problem is trying to defeat this college after 15 years when a woman senator's daughter is being groomed to be the next vice president. <br /> <br /> Her problem is that the girl is anything but popular, but she certainly comes out of it. Girls go through drunken anger, exotic dance and other perfect nonsense. <br /> <br /> This can not be much worse than this horror movie.
