What is an incomplete opportunity to actually create an interesting movie about a complex issue? There is very little research on what really looks like a straight (or gay) person working in gay sex. Dancers are talking about their art as it is not a erotic element. They may not all be prostituted for hiring, but they are actually playing fantasy and selling personal sessions where more than a dancing girl. One idea from the film is that they appeal to women mainly at gay clubs and apply for a personal session after the appointment of "dancers". Even club shots also show women in front of the stage and "dancers" play only with the audience of women. This is not just the reality of this club. It will be quite difficult to make living in a private dance for women and couples directly. So what do they really think about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get fillers. A gay activist who did not directly add to the dancers' research. A manager who told us to wear clothing for drag but did not give any insight into the life and attitude of the dancers. <br /> <br /> Pictures of Mexico City are generic. Falic Montage is ridiculous to show sausage roasting. <br /> <br /> This is a completely straightforward film that should only be of interest to those who want to see very nice boys dance pictures. The rest of the movie is an insult to men's men.
