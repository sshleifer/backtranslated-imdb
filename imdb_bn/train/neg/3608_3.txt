I have a nice collection going on in the movie, and this one has been added to it. Number 274 to be correct. <br /> <br /> I had to go to the head first. Splater University. I think this will be a great awful movie. I have ever mistaken. Do not make me wrong, I've never seen it to be the worst movie, but it might be better. I love all the movies, but there was a smile that this one was then a fear. <br /> <br /> Poor audio quality, poor performance, and poor shot system are some areas that have been improved. 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The movie is ideal for laughing. If you are looking for a movie to make fun of them, then this one!
