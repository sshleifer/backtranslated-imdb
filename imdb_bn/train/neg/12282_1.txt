This is one of the most annoying "horror" movies that I have ever seen. Nightmare epidemic involving roaming spirits in a college alkrzej alprazes Trying to mix a bad 80's "Nightmare on Elm Street" in the music video, and trying to mix the standard vampire rental, the film is jammed with bad acting and a completely moving story. Although, such a bad, and often humorous movie (excavating these mullets and terrible dialogues), but it would be a great thing for a episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Not to be fooled by the proud mention of the film, the 1987 Academy of Sciences Fiction, Fantasia, and Harar's Silver Scroll Award contributed, or contributed to Deo Soundtrack, or part of Tony Basil's film. This is a giant disaster, although following a small culture (see other IMDB comments for this movie).
