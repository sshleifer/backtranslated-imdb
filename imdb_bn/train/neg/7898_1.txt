I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. This sunny creature, where dustbin muppets with big tooth teeth, really meant to be awesome? Or where they designed a good smile (I sincerely hope). If you keep an eye out, you can even see their operating strings (well, drag them to the screen). It was rather fun than a terrible thing and was good at watching my movie because I was surprised to see the overall inability to be a good part. It's a big joke from the beginning to the end and I believe this movie is in a new section: so incredible unclear you laugh at the beginning from the end. (I will not try to comment on acting or all other things)
