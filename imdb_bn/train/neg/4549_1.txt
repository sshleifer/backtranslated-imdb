Amateurism best describes the adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Future", which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher working in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors print so-called characters by printing so-called expositions and spiritual expressions, when the film is driven very heavily by Armand Mauthriani. Although there are visible attempts by the ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code" to be a mistake in determining strong fares and interesting fans, filmmakers rarely do the job. This image revives the spiritual propaganda of the corrupted mass and results are so awful that this may spot a real point from the mess.
