This hitcouch movie carries a little similarity to its next mystery movies and it seems much like an old narrative story. A young couple enjoys a legacy that they believe will make them happy. They spend money on the journey of the world and maintain a very emotional existence. However, after a while the tension begins to end and the couple becomes overwhelmed and vain in their existence. However, where they are on a luxurious cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and ultimately they are very happy because they now appreciate life! What a weird, stupid and promotional film! Personally, I want to inherit all of these money and I want to make it sad! <br /> <br /> The production value is relatively poor - compared to the subsequent productions - poor quality and rather amateur acting.
