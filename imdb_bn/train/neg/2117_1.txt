The spouse is going to die on the altar, and their bodies are invisible. Everyone is concerned, but nobody understands why and how it is happening and they can not happen. Bear with me Lagosi is responsible for this, because he is able to remove spinal fluid from these young people and move his old wife and keep him alive. Continue to bear with me Finally, according to the authorities, some have to have death and disappearance engineering, but of course they do not understand the unlikely purpose. Let us ignore the impressive disguise and continue ... If you can go through the first twenty minutes of this disorder, Logosi will be treated to humiliate the lab assistant for the abduction, explaining that he is asleep.

Anyhoo - A female journalist criminal follows her nose (and uncommonly disabled police have never seen!), And then the fun is really starting. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are okay. This movie has many beautiful clothes, very good people. The guidelines are fair, and the scripts are a little better than the given material. Despite this, even though the film is the most industrious, the movie fan fails to maintain interest in everyone. The best thing about it .... It is finally finished, but not too soon.
