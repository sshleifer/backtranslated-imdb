When I went to see this movie, I had great hopes. But I was so wrong. This movie was just as the other competitive movie. It's a virus, zombies etc resident evil and many, many other movies. But this, and the differences in other movies, the story is very long. It's bad actor and annoying music. The picture is okay but the rest is fairly rough. Do not watch this "horror" movie, see Ring 2 or any other movie that is more about a story. I hope they create such a horrific film that has viruses and viruses spread and fool people. We have seen that enough. The only good thing in the film, when they stand on the roof and shoots famous, infected celebrities.
