I found this movie embarrassing to see. I felt like I was pushing the storyline down my throat that I could not take the subtleties, I needed a voice over all the spellings for me. <br /> <br /> A dad who is still alcoholic, I really did not have a film about such an alcoholic. Alcohol, in fact, in my opinion, very alone people inside. It is difficult to communicate with them, the main character is not really a problem, except in a problem he says that I love you at one moment - which was a weak attempt to establish his cold character. He was always surrounded with people !? <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that we were not really alone in character from any point of view that its internal loneliness and instability can be understood. I could not connect with the character and my father did not have any links in the mind. I feel nothing while finishing it, just was the end of relief. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is not a perfect actor but a solid guy does not lead the features! The orange things in the watch were fine as a brick. McKidd was too young, had to have three separate letters, or should be avoided for teenagers and teenagers, and should concentrate more on adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt that the little boy actor was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
