I went to this movie and it really expected God to be horrific. And it was there. I'm really sorry for star staided cast - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress - Vince Von and Paul Giamatt were frustrated as usual - before making this movie, but Miranda Richardson could not perform such a wonderful performance that I know and love for her. Fred's father, Trevor Pickick (played by Daily Fame, among others) had almost one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and humor was ... there was a lack. (However, Santa had entered a Jewish family where Santa had a part of the movie ... because his expressions were classic, so laughing me) Do not watch this movie until you have another title of title collision with a train (actually - maybe the train will be good ...)
