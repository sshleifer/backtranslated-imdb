It's pretty easy. Friends are a very funny comedy joke, which is aimed at young people and humorous feelings for young adults. It is also unfortunate that at the end they tried to create the last ten seasons, they might think they could lose the signfield's 9th season. The problem is that there were 9 extraordinary seasons of signfilling writing, most of the friends were in 5 or 6 good seasons, and then in 4 uncomfortable seasons (and here I am very generous). <br /> <br /> With reused humor and reused character features a soap opera that does not start well, then you have seen them for the 100th time. I find it so difficult to understand why it is so much rate. It's really awful.
