My nose shape is slightly bent as I write this. I sent a previous comment to this movie a few weeks ago, which has not yet appeared, so I think it was rejected, even though it met all the general guidelines. <br /> <br /> I played this picture for the first 30 minutes, especially Jordi Molla, an elderly actor who was present in such major productions as "Blow" and "Alamo". Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything eventually sank under the weight of really terrible, melodramatic scripts. An impressionistic nuance loan is what is an abundance of undesired nudity which is neither dramatic progress nor even a beautiful piece of art pieces. <br /> <br /> The beach at Valencia will be a real day trip, anytime, be somewhat less difficult than ever to face this imaginary character.
