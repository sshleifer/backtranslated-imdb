The seventh sign has a great opening hook as Israeli defense forces come across a terrorist base. This is a type of hook that must be required when writing scripts, it plays the role of the reader / audience and David Bannon because he hires in the house of Abbey and Russell Quinn Telegraph that he is not the person who said he is. But in the first major third opening episode, I was confused and confused with the rest of the film, and not different from other supernatural thrillers that I have not seen.
