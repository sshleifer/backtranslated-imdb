Do not let the name of this movie deceive you, in fact Jack's character is probably the most known action hero in the film. When joke is not protecting the virgin girls from bad guys, which she does not often have, she jumped heavily. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion, when an action hero gets a chance it does not seem "cool". In addition, like other bold heroes who usually keep an impressive list of the adornments, there is no one of this person, unless you can definitely sleep a genius. However, this movie is basically vain, writing a parallel par excellence and action, when there are some, too much hair. (Jeep's machine guns were not bad, but it's like that) So, if you want to see a movie for cure insomnia in the movie, this piece is suitable for you - this is not a hero who just sleeps himself, his audience too.
