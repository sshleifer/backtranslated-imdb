A frustrating movie. <br /> <br /> The story is established as our hero Christian, a young man, rather spontaneously distracted, does not do much. Actually he did very little work to move the story so he does not surprise me to see the focus shift on his relatives. Although it's a pity, Chrissy seems to be an attractive character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and occasionally felt quite formulated. So now the question is, in the annoying role of Campanians, Jackson and Tahahri, the cinematic stories that inspire two hours of toll rather than entertainment? <br /> <br />> Technically, a disgusting shot film.
