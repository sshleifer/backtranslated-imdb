Lindsay Anderson was a great European filmmaker, but David Lynn, Ridley Scott and Allen Parker's choices created spectacular films with visual opportunities. Andersson's film is much more about social commentary and subdivision, so that messages often end up should be the main event of the whole movie to be entertained by the audience. <br /> <br /> If you think of how the British filmmakers think of IF If so then I think the film should be a universal medium (the best Bright movie is what my opinion tries to imitate Hollywood), if you want to send a message, try Tony Express and I can find the movie, very friendly and set in the 1960s too. In the summer of 1968 and the year of student rebellion in France in love. You can imagine every single left leftist to enjoy this movie only. French new wave filmmakers will admire the abstract supernatural of some scenes, but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will dislike it severely.
