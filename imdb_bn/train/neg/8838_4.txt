Ray Lawrence's "Zindabane" and his last movie "Latana" are similar? His reaction to a dead body and already responsive life. But "Lantana" proposed some light in the hope that "Jindaban" has left everything in such a light way that has displeased most of the viewers, perhaps even cheating. The story is based on a short story of Raymond Carver - a floating corpse in a remote river after the discovery of fishermen. It became an element of Robert Altman's classic 1993 partnership "Shortstats". Lawrence uses this stem to investigate and expose relationships between a small Australian community under stress. Some moral questions have been raised in the movie "Will you destroy your dead weekend to discover the bodies of your dead week?" And for the Australians, if the dead person was an indigenous person, what would be the difference? " Acting, especially Gabriel Byron and Laura Linna, is commendable.
