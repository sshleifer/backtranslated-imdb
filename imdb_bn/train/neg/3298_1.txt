When I heard that Hazard's Dukes was going to be rebuilt with the current actor and strong script, I was fine, "OK, I'll give it a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happened." Well, I saw what Happened. I saw a great late 70/80 show which was classic, largely insulted by Hollywood. It is very sad to see that the authors of Hollywood are not coming today. They showed a great exhibition which was a great target audience, and tried to "remake" the classic show. Head UP Hollywood ... it does not work !!!! However, more about the show. I think they have employed better actors than Sun William Scott (Steefler from American Pie) to play Bow. I'm sure that John Scandra was frustrated with how his character was portrayed and benefited. Also, get it for real, Johnny Noxville as Louis Duke. How can you go less ?? Lovable Luke is a crappy Jacques actor in the game. This sick me Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her performance sucks. The original dais performer Katherine Bach is smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL 'southern daughter. She was growing up to roll models of every little girl! (I owned dolls and zips - thank you very much !!!) However, Jessica Simpson is a smart ass, 2-bit whore as David Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why they were thrown in him. Jessica Elba played a great daisy duck. He can speak with a great priest Agent, and he is superb, and has done a wonderful job. However, I want to say that this movie is a bit fatal. I got leaked by paying $ 8.50 for the ticket, and they would have to refund my money. If you like Dodge of Hajjard (original series) then you will not see this movie. It will just upset you. CMT (Native Music Television) raises ducks in the night at night. So, set your TIVO and go live with the original thing without imitating the big screen of Hollywood.
