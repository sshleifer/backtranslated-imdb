It was a disappointment to watch this DVD after many years. The main problem for me is unclear scripts. <br /> <br /> Although it is somewhat malicious and hip, mostly neutral, weird and lifeless Much mess is just sitting there, lack of sparks and energy. <br /> <br /> Cast Mae, Way West and Rachel Welch came well. Roger Shirley plays the role of shines (very bad she did not make more films). But for my money, John Huston has too much, and poor Rex Reid rarely gets the chance to fight. It is fascinating to revolve around this character, which seems to surprise his character, what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should be considered as a public opinion of this piece. Vidal's originality provided much chances that most of the disadvantages were too much. Even 'classic' film did a lot of clips. All rather rather sub-par effort, and it's probably not likely to get better with time.
