After seeing this picture, I felt compulsive to blow some of my frustration. Selma Blair was charming in a fabulous, currently underlying actress and Mac Beesley rather than "killing me later". Although the story is not original, it certainly has some promises. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, using a strange camera angle, annoying color filters, reversing footage, up to speed footage, using footage, using a bitter color filter, jumping behind in the timeline and blaring junk is an overwhelming "modern" Top off it with the soundtrack. I can not remember that I could not remember the last time I saw a jobless film management. Her arrogance and acting in the story are huge and must definitely point her to the front and center of the audience members to attract her attention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when things will start showing promise, Miss Lustig will quarrel in the film's school tricks in his bag and stuff up again. It's embarrassing because Blair and Bismuth were good chemistry and you can say that this film was really a good heart. 3/10
