I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most listeners, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but I did not do it. It's Lukasas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, Five Sevens, Hollywood) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). Director Matt Bissonnette, who married Molly Parker. These three actors have three friends in this movie, third in their marriage and fine for infringement. It all takes place in a lake house and it looks wonderful. The film first wants to behave as a comedy and then its subject as a play, and I thought it needed to be another way.
