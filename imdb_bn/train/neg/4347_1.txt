Wow ... What can I say ... IMDB closes first at the end of the 60s ... which means that Carlito was near prison, he came out at the age of 75 and said for five years. They use a bunch of no actors, and a story which even does not even have knowledge. They just brought one actor, Guzman, and Hesse back to a completely different game. Why did this Puerto Rican chick end with him? Wheres gone? He said that he had love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said that he knew him forever ... you think he wants to be one. And if this is made in this sense, where is the first one of the Roco and Black Dude? It was just stupid ... it was a humiliation of the casino and the first movie.
