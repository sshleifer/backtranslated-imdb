For yourself, it is best to ignore any positive reviews related to this movie. Stins this flush. Now, I like the low budget horror movie (at least in theory), but it makes the worst mistake of creating a low budget flickr: it takes itself very seriously. And, unfortunately, this is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Bian Dynasty, the murderer of British Hilsa transferred from modern time. An interesting premiere, but two things that immediately got worried about this movie, then you start to see it. <br /> <br /> # 1-Why is JD James CD's biggest box name? She is the average looking woman below who can not work, and she has a minor role. Answer: He is apparently a well-known porn star (you fall as no doubt in another review), so I guess this is a "camio" look for him. He thinks the name of the film "name recognition", many names. Although its top billing does not indicate any of its talents, an indication of how untalted it is to cast another. <br /> <br /> # 2- How can film makers be so stupid to think in Canada? Passed off as Ireland? It does not even look like Ireland far away. And those guests / hunters are those big North American wood frame Edwardian things. They dropped the entire Bienne theme and created a story in NA, but if you are going to make a movie in Ireland, it probably should have more than one character with the Irish accent. It was really a really bad Irish accent.) Now if the director did not try to create a living dead of night then it would not have been so bad, but it seems he was. very bad. She could have some fun with it. Actually, some of the scenes were not far from odd comedic. <br /> <br /> Like a notorious scene, the girl is bound to the table, empty naked, and then cut open and eviscerated. That's funny, you ask? Well, in the version of the deleted scene, the mutant killer reaches miles miles after the intestine mile. It's fun after a while later. And the self-respecting body eats the intestines, anyway? We eat cows and chicken intestines? Do not hack, we eat ham and ribs and drumsticks. Oh well <br /> <br /> Some other stories that were annoying: cute, unclear Howard Rossstein. I'm not sure, but I think he'll be caught as a stud. Indeed, as big as a harmful and pore force he would mention his name. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, just a few years after graduation, I can not determine whether it is funny or unfortunate to tell whether the honored student is watching a naked soft-core screen in the shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. It is surprising that his former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, hope they'll get the message: ignore this fate! Go to college !!! I could go on and on, but why? If you like Gore, you will find some liberation in this flick, but nothing more.
