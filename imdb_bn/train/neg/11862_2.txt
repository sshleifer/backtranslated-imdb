This movie was probably something potential for something; My folly is how this entirely chaotic themes make it in the theater, for example, the ideas are being recycled. Indeed, cheating behind most films is like dogs, they come back to vomit their own nostrum. Well, they are now worth $ 19 dollars for me. It was not all fantasy, no freedom fighter moment, some distant funny pictures were shown in the trailer (and there was no fun in the trailer), the performance decreased (especially molly, totally blurry). Theoretically some ridiculous relief was supposed to be a homeoproteur friend with a trend for Disney films; None of his parables were hit at home, his little sermons were flat, I literally waited to say something meaningful to him, only to accomplish this. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insignificant plastic animal (except for a horse-like face with astonishing smile); I found her friend Patty (known as Hamburger), and it feels so much better. But then again, the gentleman likes brunettes;) Well, however, the whole court socialism is social and if love is true it crosses all social facades; The way they show, the scratum and the million-times-explosion-and-beta-to-death-horse rotational rotation routine (with a clear expression for American pie and happiness - family dogs involved in a disgusting scene). I think the movie was like a funny joke with the overwhelmingly damned ball of raw pottery. Marketing can prevent anything that can be seen, that shines any object and calls it gold, people will come (work for me). Done with the title.
