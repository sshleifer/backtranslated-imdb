Do not make me wrong, I want to see Marijuana as valid as the next guy. I will now be digress. Writing, though, was unrealistic. A PTA is not able to deal with mother's narcotics but her intoxicants is not given to an indigenous person. Give me a break. Very cute Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence of character crunch. Characters were not all liked. Basically, the plot line went somewhere. I understand his only TV land The hypocrisy was unclear. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I was supposed to believe this .... why ???? I just got the feeling that I was being promoted by a show of seed. It seems to be okay to cheat your wife, but with legal age status to someone. Ok just the same thing, but I think you get people to get my points. Those kids think stuff is good for the campaign, I guess, but it does not hold water in a single seat only about a sub-caste mother as a local dish dealer.
