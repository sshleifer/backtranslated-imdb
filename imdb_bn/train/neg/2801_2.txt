After a Kosi-Gothic, All-Furty Music video, the film begins when the lead singer of the cassidy kills himself. That's a perfect world that will roll out and last credit. We do not live in that world. Members of the insipid band decided to go to some pairs to communicate his dead essence. When I say a joke, then I mean real shoes. He told them that they would all die through the ghost of Cassidy (the soul is near the supplication, one of the band-companions) we could not keep the letters down because the characters worked all boring, buzzing and extremely awesome. Adam Hackbuster wrote (if there was an incredibly optimistic designation), and Carbine Timbrook was directed (after the ministerial and blood towers, he knew he was making a flute for survival), the film needed to be in constant confrontation with the film's incompetence and the audience was awake. There is not enough blood in the cow's body, and not enough nudity to satisfy it. There is nothing to actually suggest this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Amara Carraw goes helpless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on demand
