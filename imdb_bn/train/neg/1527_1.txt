If you really want to really waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Watch through the TV list. 2) Find the movie 'White in White'. 3) When 'White in Man White' arrives, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After two hours of bad birds, naughty (and not funny) movies referencing and after experiencing something with the lowest minimum production value in recent history, you will lose two hours of life and wonder why exactly. <<br /> <br /> Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this image might actually be something good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Soap (who also has created power renders), to save production costs, is the favorite favorite toy across the film - older than the big franchise. Decided to sprinkle giant clothes. When I saw from my childhood, I saw several old monsters from the episode, so I think at least it can be said that it has some nostalgia values. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the real power of the Renaissance monsters, see the Power Rangers itself. It's much better than this piece of junk. (And that's saying something!)
