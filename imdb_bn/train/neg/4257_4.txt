"Dracula 2: Assessment" The story of a group of medical students who came across the body of Drackler. When a mysterious stranger appears and steals his body for 30 million dollars for the body harvest and steals his blood for auction, it is rarely denied that their proposal. Yet students follow Vatican's vampire killer continuously! "Dracula 2: Ascension" is a small entertainment film that is very defective. Characters are one-dimensional and the performance is roughly average. There are really good effects like the really nice Deal Dispatine scene but there is not enough violence for my favorites. The film is very annoying and forgotten and absolutely no doubt. So if you like the modern vampire flick, please give it a look. I like the atmosphere vampire chillers "Blood Lips", "Dracula's Deaf" or "Lemora: The Story of the Supernatural Baby" in the beginning of the 60s and early 70's, just a few of the 10.
