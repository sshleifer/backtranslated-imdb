The only sound I can think of describing this movie is: General. <br /> <br /> The character of Gary Siney's suicide plot line is a ridiculous evidence and driving a golf ball into a shack ocean of somewhat salientist Harmet or Riquelium because he can not handle the life of the profitable Pro / Golf community? Cry me a river. I wish this was my problem. I enjoyed Dylan Baker and Sinai, but for the movie this film was a bad choice or pay check. At the time of Twenty-Five team price tournament, the verbally abused by another club member in front of his father is so much that I'm afraid to see it
