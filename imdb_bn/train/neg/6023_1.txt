This reminds me when I was a born again believer who is going to be a minister. I never thought that I would be a minister or even graduate to high school because I was almost positive, that I could get to heaven before that would ever happen. Before that I discovered that there was a bunch of rubbish in Christianity. I am an atheist now, and it proves that "once saved, always saved" Doctrine Christians say that it is not more real than Elves. If it is true, then why did I go back as a believer after many years? Yes, I was really saved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> rapture "may be surprised to know where it is mentioned.
