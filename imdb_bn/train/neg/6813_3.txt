Artistic Fools for the Search of Jam Rollin Vampires, Alien and Immortality <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and photography is stunning. The dialog is unknown. It's a ridiculous mess. Great to see but totally horrible as a horror movie or any posture of the thriller. I think if we can be afraid or not Is it at the same time? An extraordinary mix of art images and horror, which is not always seen in candy and is nice to see it when it is not "average", and it is not terrible for any reason, even occasionally the shot or sequence creates a moment of friction, but it Well provoked twaddle For those like nude women leave something in the background as a living wall paper.
