Well, first of all, if you check the hairdo's rebellion, just remember the night of the living dead (1968) - forget it. This is a more psychological sense of "psychology", in which the word refers only to a person who is not in control of their will, but rather to follow the wishes of others. "Jumbo" here, as much as they are in the film, as well as the metaphor for the benefit of the state or authority in general during the war. It is quite broad to call a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The image was set during the First World War. The "French Cambodian" militants heard strange stories about jambiling - were supposedly built using waxed wax - and easily have the stories of zombie soldiers attacking on enemies. Armand Lock (Dean Jagger) brought a priest who knows the hidden secret of Jumme, but he will not speak. So the head of an International Military Department of Lock and Anchor Watt is based on an archaeological mission designed to discover the hidden information of the Joomla and there is a chance for Jabbids to "wipe out the white nation". The strange thing about the logo revolt seems to be that the writer / director Victor Halfarine script decided to change his game plan during the shooting. The film starts as it will explore the zombie / martial metaphor and maybe even the adventure stuff, but after about 15 minutes it changes the gears and becomes more of a love triangle story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> with a subtext about will and power (and a Nietzschean "will have the power"). The film is interesting at that level, but the script and editing are very sticky. It's still an old film, for which I would not be surprised if there is unseen footage, especially since some characters are cut while talking through characters or conversations. <br /> <br /> In the story of the transformed romance, Halleirpan tried to put the zombie thread reference, but zombie makes the material a lot of sense. Louque zombification secret invention, but it does not mean a lot of viewers. The mechanics of the jambi components are unclear and confusing ?? Hallelins even resorts to the 1932 film White Zumbo to utilize the superficial footage of Luigosi's Gugli-Eyes, but even the resorts do not reset what it has to do with anybody. With love stories, there are big gaps in the plot. Promise, interesting characters from the initial reels disappeared for long periods. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Playing is not bad at all, and if you have a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting description of your mind to fill all the gaps. But the second time I saw this movie, the first one was the first five years ago, and I could hardly remember anything about it - so it's not memorable.
