I'll give credit where credit is given, and Linda Fiorentino plays well as a hard acting actress that she wants to do. She brash, sassy, ​​hard-laid, and very sexy; She is much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's IT. This uninterrupted film is trying to become a separatist mess, once a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy lover thriller. <br /> <br /> <br /> For example, who is thinking of considering Thomas C Hall as the favorite leading man? She is not ugly, but crying aloud, it seems like the strong-hearted goddess of Purarium is getting it with a kindergarten teacher. There is no authority or screen presence to meet Holle's leading person role. <br /> <br /> This image is the worst aspect of the film. The character of Ferourintino is not available in the return phone, there is no mystery that there is no mystery about the crime in the film's focus, because there is no reason for the fact that Feratorino could lose his inability to despair. <br /> <br /> The really good sex scenes between Hamel and Fiorentino, look for interesting but poorly groomed crew by Adam Ant and Usher Hayes. In addition, my first inspiration should be to drop down this trash piece of trash and rent something else.
