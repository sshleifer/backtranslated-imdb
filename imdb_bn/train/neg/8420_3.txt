Despite the excellent cast, it is an inefficient film, especially from the point of view of the plane. It can be a bit better than the harmful "von Richthophen and Brown" but not much. "Blue Max" is in the best of the smallest market in the past 35 years, and "Darling Lily" is fun if not fun. It's interesting to guess what the ILM could do with a new, high quality WWW Arrow film with Zeppelins and Gothas.
