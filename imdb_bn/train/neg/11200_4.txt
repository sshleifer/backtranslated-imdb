Goodfoods in the WebSites dictionary define logophobia as a fear of sound. I could only be Logophobic. When a movie is more fearful than the beginning of a movie for a combination of words, the credits contain the words 'produced, written and directed': and after that one person's name is followed. Think about it. Carpenters, electric and plumbers, but a few jack-of-all-businesses Most directors, such as Spielberg and Scorsese, even rarely take control of their film. But I was, in order to see the order when I was leaning towards me as my muscles in the theater's seat, Popporn with hand and Nalan Ryan Fastball, there were the words 'produced, written and operated' by Brian Helgland. Oops! <br /> <br /> One film was buff, I knew about Brian Helgland. As a writer, in the last 10 years, his painting was captured in 1998, like the stock price of the Dotcom Company. Many dramatic displeasure (assassin, postman, conspiracy theory) was critical and rewarding success (LA Confidential, Mysterious) river. They seem to be an alternative ?? One is good, one is bad, so to know his last film, Bloodwork was the worst attempt at Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and had the best hope. On the opposite side, I was not exhaled. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Order Order Hath Ledger (A Knights Tail of the Netherlands), in an order known as Carrolling, as a priest Alex Bornier, who called in Rome when a fellow priest was killed under an architect, bishop? Playful ' Interview with Father Thomas (along with the order and starring Marcus Adams by Standings Marc), they began to piece together the deformed left side of the priest for impossible death. <br /> <br /> Mara Sinclair (played by Shannin Sosamamon) is a Gulf issue that escaped from an organization, which resulted in his efforts to kill Alex during a abolition. Alex has a sense of humor and for some reason unknown to the audience, they travel together in Rome. <br /> <br /> Nori sleeps a good night and Alex contends with William Eden (Beno-Furman), who claims to be a century old Sin Eater. A sinner, as we are told, are those who eat mortal people at the time of sin, when there is no church, thus allowing to enter heaven. William, as luck would have it, tired of cure life and he takes his role and shows him to be free from his earthly responsibilities. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love killer, Alex resorts to the style of Sin Eater to rescue him, and the transformation is complete. Then Alex sought answers to many of his questions, when Father Thomas uncovered the Vatican conspiracy behind his colleague's investigation officer's passport. <br /> <br /> The order is not a terrible movie, but it's very annoying. There was no connection with ridiculous special effects and any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - Alex's death is going to die - pale and soft and leave us without any emotional reaction to the distress of the couple. Everyone is silent and unreasonably speaking that the flat line of the film and the flavored salts can lead me to try to grab the blur faster in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgland, I do not try to try again Share your perspective with others and help those experiences to guide you that are very narrow and self-employed. Then there is nothing that shows that you are capable of doing more than a failed grade. Two stars <br /> <br />
