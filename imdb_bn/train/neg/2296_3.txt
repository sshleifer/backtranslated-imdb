Tom McGregor (Paul Marcureau), a shy guy named "Beyond of Bound", in a dive-diner / gas station in the desert of Australia, suddenly some visitors find themselves in a hurry when suddenly unexpectedly reaching. First of all, what we found is suddenly like a flashback that he and his sister (though well understood after their relationship with each other) are running fast on their motorcycle through the desert. Then, he was very calm, and sometimes, in the presence of the arrival appeared as Moody character. <br /> <br /> We are sure that one thing is certain and it's the psychological sense of McGregor, its foresight of danger and, as its story is only relevant to the story, none of which does not break any of the three diamond thieves, and those who have their way to Tom Help them find out without having to depend on them. Of course, Tom falls for one thief, a young girl named Charlie, and suddenly, it throws three unbelieving allies in front of each other. But in reality there is no way that really does not give the results of many mysteries or actions. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to create something important all the time, but it fails to do so. Even the end, which plays like a sharp campfire story (and which actually reveals a lot of error reports), it's almost ridiculous <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a mood for fearful slow motions, but at least, a little different than usual.
