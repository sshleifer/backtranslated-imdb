"Do not drink water" is an incredibly bad film. This is based on a 1966 Broadway game Woody Allen. It plays comic genius Jackie Gleason behind "honeymooners". Director Howard Morris has appeared in several mails, Brooks Comedy (Life Stinks, High Efficiency, Silent Movie) and has created a mark in animation (characters he has pronounced Gopher to "Puh", Jagahd (Archi) and Beetle Bailey) Wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is played very importantly for effective implementation. Allen's original game was in the tongue-in-cheek, it worked on Broadway and Alan's 1994 rebuilding. The romance of the RSS falls in love with Allen and Harvey Bullock, and many changes from the original game. An example of Gelson's wife making an airhead in this version is that when she was originally a boxer, why does not it work. <br /> <br /> The performance is not very good. He can do well with Gleason material, but he can not save this. Gleason is a ridiculous genius, but he was also a fine actor in "The Hastler" and "Solariere in the Rain". His hateful personality could work here, but the lounge scripts did not give him the chance. very bad. The airhead wife of Estelle Parsons will run you nuts after 20 minutes. See how soon you want to rush it to take it. It's also shameful because she's also a wonderful actress, "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel" has made two exceptional performances, and no other actor is particularly good. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this picture so much that he rebuilt the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Merge Simpson). They all manage to hit the proper notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. After a long fight on the rights it finally video. Go out and find that version. The 1969 issue is welcome to welcome unexpected guests to welcome them. <br /> <br /> between 1/2 * 4
