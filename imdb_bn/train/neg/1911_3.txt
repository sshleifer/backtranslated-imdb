Formula Flick of a girl who wants a girl, who is standing by the side of the guy, a man who helps a great friend (Comedes Relief, no?) Will help to cheat the girl etc. It has been for death, and it has been improved with the rare exception of some z-rated outings. <br /> <br /> Simple plot on one hand, lids interesting and a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech has been good, and his acting came here near the phone. Not a complete loss, but this tepid matter is nothing new here.
