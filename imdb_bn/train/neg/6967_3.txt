Oh God, what a stupid film! Fake special effect (animal is operated by a man in a lame dress) and fool plot. All the conversations are incredibly bad and this actor (HA! HA! HA!) ... is the only 'Ludicure' For example, I saw such annoying characters like this junk (pregnant woman with this stupid child or her husband) and more. Lastly, if you're drunk, it's a great entertainment. Exclude it like plague. I drunk I do not think so ...
