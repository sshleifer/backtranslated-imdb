This photo is a new effort by Stefani Bitton and his new production company. Although it suffers from some problems, it's a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her company as a production of every low budget. <br /> <br /> Playing this story as burning is not very new. And the 13th from each Friday part. However, the performance is impressive. It is always nice to act in such big budget movies, it's always nice to act in reality, its acting is really going through motion. <br /> <br /> The story relates to the murder (and possible return) of a planned classmate. Others are taking oath in secret, but each person sends them from different aspects of their lives. Ten years later, friends were killed each other by a horrific stack known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You will see. <br /> <br /> If you're a Roger Ebert or an arrogant critic, you probably should not be disturbed. But if your taste is more to Joe Joe Brabrij and you want to see a group that honors their cart, see "Bagman".
