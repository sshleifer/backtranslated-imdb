This is a version which even hated the writer, because it is very surprising. They gave it a 'happy ending' and made many changes in the dialogue, and this is just a big pill in the celebration 'Stage Manager' is quite good, I believe he has raised the role, but the rest fall in this acting style which is exactly right. A great feature- music. This is one of the best ever recorded scores, and it's a searchable store shop. Overall, I think the 1989 Scaling Gray / Eric Stalts / Penelope Miller version is much higher.
