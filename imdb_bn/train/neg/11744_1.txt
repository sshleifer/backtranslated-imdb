Finally after watching this film completely, I am totally mysterious by the same loyalty by critics and online users. Is it the worst western ever? No, I will not say that. But "the last great Western Western", the word I once saw is more than once? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of this story requires the credible conversation of a movie that seems to be a credible conversation, and I have read the dialogue in this movie as the most hackneyed and clipped. Movies can be measured in groaners per minute; For example, how often does an actor or actress force the script to say that no person will say in real life? There are many examples of it that are confusing. Chess lines come to you waves; Expected, irrational, and often. <br /> <br /> If bad conversation does not bother you, how about a bad gunfight? In the very western you can show that completely incredible gunfight while trying to take action seriously. There is a ridiculous edge like a gunfight, such as a gunfight, but it is fine, but the very first stage of Gonllex's very staged and very dense danceography is another reason for the film to be excluded from the list of Westerners. The final showdown suddenly revives the director of this score, but after that, I was so hesitant in the movie that it was out of reserve. <br /> <br /> Without these errors I can say that the scenes are stunning - all the great shots and settings of the movie look great. The acting is passable, especially considering the actors are offered to work with. However, if you are looking for Great Western Western last, please make a favor on your behalf - instead renting Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 3
