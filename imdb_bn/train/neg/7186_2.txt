I'm sorry for all fans, but it's a vague movie. Bad acting, even woody, it's hypnotic hypes on terrible-factor, and does not work right. I think I was finally supposed to be a wrapper, but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing. What a bad situation What was a victim who killed everybody? Please try again. <br /> <br /> This is rarely the original, and it is not particularly good as a straight slasher. And that's saying something. <br /> <br /> I think that someone has made a cake, anyone has written the script, and anyone should think of the idea being ruthlessly expelled and deported. <br /> <br /> This movie If someone puts it in a party, throw the disk to the window and place a good horror movie, such as Lambos or the Sailing.
