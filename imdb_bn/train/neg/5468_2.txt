I enjoy the absolutely 'toxic avengers' series, but Tromo did not give any idea of ​​this poor offering, and it made me always awake. <br /> <br /> A leaking nuclear plant (and rising volcano weeds) creates high sand nut young people in tromwell, which joins one of their gangs, is sexually, exploded, and whatever. There are also some monster breeding in high school ... My God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors have stopped their efforts and they should (Deliberate) overacting about 5 minutes to get started on my nerves ... <br /> <br /> Frustrating. 2/10.
