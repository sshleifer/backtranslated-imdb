After seeing this trunk, the first question to think of the springs gave the right to use the name of Oman in this film. This is a shambolic, embarrassing, cruel disregard for carrying the Women franchise. When the movie began listening to backing music, it was removed directly from a buggy cartoon and then the film got worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I understand that they have got one - for when they come back to bring their teacher back! It is difficult to know whether it is a comedy after a while because it is so funny and true that it is begging for real Oman. Acting ridiculous, especially from leading female Faye Grant. Does he hold a silent face or is it laughing hard to smile? It's hard to tell The worst series I ever witnessed was the misfortune. 10 out of 1
