Cover Art (which is a person who holds an awesome pellet gun) thinks it as a martial arts film. (Very few.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of this movie is Trojan Warrior. (A brand of trojan United States condoms) is loaded with homoorticism. If you like stuff, this picture is not really bad. However, consider these factors: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of actors 'Greens and Boots' (one scene even with each actor making an emission in his pants.) Lemon, pitch, and red-colored colors. From a painter's perspective, this picture is a drag queen! Most of the scenes are closed characters that are closed to each other, sometimes touching as they touch. Also, the hero's cousin likes women and the movie is trying to kill him. Filmmakers want to send a message here? <br /> <br /> Will I go to war scenes? (Yes, somebody's personal belongings are caught in a war.) The martial arts scene is short and unimaginable. There is no fancy stuff here, just your standard patches would you like to see an old Chuck Norris Flick. There is also a car charger that can be used for the first low-speed chase in the film.
