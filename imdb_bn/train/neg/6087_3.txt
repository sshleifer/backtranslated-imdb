This movie was often not often as I expected it. This has some seconds brightness in some wicked hardcore paranoia-fest of UFO conspiracies. Most of the acting is moderate, but the style of 1970 is full of normal, pregnant punctuation. A photographer and a model jungle witnessed some weird events and soon fell victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are shown, more people disappear - but is it the alien or cover-up boys' very secret group of our own government? Soon, a reporter and "Euphorologist" (based on author-directed character) dragged into this disgraceful Fiasco and became the target of countless secret agents that are impossible and intelligent. Then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> This movie probably gives much knowledge in terms of the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking it so seriously. The camera work is fine for low budget movies, the pacing is good, the script is stupid and stupid, and there are continuity issues that make it fun to find. I said that the brightness of a few seconds? Frankly, I can not say a lot to you without writing a spoiler. Not saying that at the end of the film at least, if you can not take the middle then you can be fast-forwarding.
