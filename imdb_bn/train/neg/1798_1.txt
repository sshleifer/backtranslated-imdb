How does a movie Ozzy Osbourne have and still can suck? I just do not get it. Trick or treat is managed to do it. This sucks and likes it. <br /> <br /> In that movie I have to warn people about trick or treat. It is a vomiting-persecutor cruel persecution that is only being begging so you can feel worse about yourself. There is no redemption factor for trick or treat. <br /> <br /> For a film about heavy metal, it is not sure which heavy metal is or which it represents. This film led to heavy metal appearance hair, and it was probably one of the most powerful hours in heavy metals in 1986. This is mostly credit, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad that you're angry yourself to see it. That easy balance will hopefully keep away from this intelligent and uninterrupted film.
