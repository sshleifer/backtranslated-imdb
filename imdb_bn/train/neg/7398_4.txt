I hired it because I got some tiredness of the NBC programming of the 80's and obviously I gave myself a lot of money. I have nothing against any of the actors and they do a good job for their achievements but this show is flawed by the evidence. <br /> <br /> We have a character that is unlikely. She is full of flaws, illuminated, and is full of an entire jolt in a good day. Yet no one should be cared for. A complete bellehead is revolutionary and potentially full while making Central American siticom near the Jacques, it is not seen here in this show. Most of the supporting characters do not completely deprive the characters, rather the tragic touches bag which seeks sympathy for the audience to sympathize with. Because in a sitcom, it becomes the most natural for the audience and in this way they deny the character of leadership in such a way that we are seeing Beatinga as ourselves and harming the people and they are there .... Why? There is no reason. No ordinary people will simply leave abuse. Keep them there for no reason - even a special 2-part miscarriage episode of Joan Cassidy, which has its own major problems - that's where it really looks. It is easy to believe that people keep this person with us because we have been told that their gold heart is not mixing with the reality of the situation. If anything, this is not even dramatic. It was a badly designed, conceptualized and executed which was in a few moments but it was fitting to fulfill the fate overall. To get out of someone and create a good idea, but the execution is so dangerous that it looks like a strange scripted version of the Jerry Spring Show where this abuser was abused by the persecutor because we wanted to root it for it. For such a show, there is a great touch here that the actors can easily provide here, but they are not capable of any means. And it's a deadly error that actually killed the program. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the show is a clock value. But when they tried to grow, it really got worse, and not what the whole enterprise could do.
