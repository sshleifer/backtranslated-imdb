This movie "Joshua" is very annoying, and vain vain. It actually imagines that there are people who will enjoy watching it. If it does not give the story, it's about the reaction of a little boy to his newborn baby, and this glimmering only tips The whole time of this movie is one of the spectacular child's behavior. Adding insult to injury, at the end of the film, there is no real result except by the departure of a bad recess to a child, who spur the whole group of fools. There is no release, no justice, and a group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Actually, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely uncertain. Even those who can enjoy horrible movies, this movie can be very high. Despite the film being played well, the story is so annoying that it looks like it is waiting for 90 minutes in hopes of a painful dental procedure.
