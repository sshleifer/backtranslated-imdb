I know slashes always seem bad, but let's do it. It saved a lunch of 10-year-old thumb and started it by the end of the week. However, six young people go to the same house to be killed on screen. Our brain has one, whore, another whore, black guy, killer, stereotype. Then one was eaten in a shaking boat, everyone else was sinking by a man, wearing a mask in a poor box. In the middle of the middle, a beautiful terrorist was killed somewhere, but then it is even more annoying and especially to return to more false fear. Sincerely, we know that a person can not be a killer when he attacks because the man definitely loves everything to take his sweet time. <br /> <br /> After each character you think of going to die, the emotional ugly blonde chick and his immediate-to-boyfriend are finally captured by the killer (they like, get pushed, and then fade) and the killer expresses myself. I think the authors of this film have just taken a black hole and pen and kept it in the list of characters. The purpose is not only to lunge and even let me start secretly in secret. A lot of time (and then more than ten minutes, in which he threw his hand for some reason) to explain everything, and finally a man was stabbed with a gun. Hey, no fair! <br /> <br /> One of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. I can enjoy myself more by watching Lindsay Lohan-cinema, I swear. I'm sure, more than 80 slashers have sucked well but at least they throw some at T & A. There is nothing for this.
