I'm now seeing this on this Sci-Fi channel. It's very awesome I can not stop watching it! I am a videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for someone associated with this movie. The camera work is some good. Most suspicious. There are few decent actors in the storm. Very bad they're surrounded by what the director's relatives would be. The only way to stay in the movie! The music was a little better than acting. Hope you find it because I had one other option if you were to get around watching this! Siegel (yes Siegel) is coming ... I think I'll miss it! Jason
