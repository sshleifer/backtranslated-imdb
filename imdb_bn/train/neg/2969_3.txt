The story is very credible and powerful. The technical aspect of the film is very good. Even its instructions. The main problem is with casting, which has almost other local and regular clich√©s influenced by the film, and even becomes a lack of impression. As well as the small role of the father, Rafael (played anecdote by AC Dan), all other actors are unfortunately not the best of them. Acting by Taly Sharon, the role of the big blind girl was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. So she became less lightweight and less proficient in acting. There were moments and episodes that saw more real movies like a rehearsal. But after all it's a good point to start from and make big progress in the future.
