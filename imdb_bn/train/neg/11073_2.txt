It is awesomely bad and awesomely embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow well wine. Our writers and poets are the best in the world. National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. But we are a bloody movie movie! This one is not particularly bad. This is especially common and usually bad, two-bit hotels and slim public parks, high school level performers and "Gee Wies ... ... lets see what this button does on the camera?" Photography. If Michael Moriery had such intentions for Jack Nicholson's disguise, but at least no good Jack Nicholson could disguise? And shooting the film in Vancouver is really one of the most beautiful cities in the world and a center of the Yacht Building ("plot" part). Why in the name of God, we indicate that the local Canadian inferiority complex is that it is the camouflage seattle ??? I'm just not crazy about this movie, I'm feeling embarrassed and a little embarrassed. Australian introduced some fantastic stuff. We produce pretentious second-rate piffle. God's indecent or unrestrained accent !!!!!
