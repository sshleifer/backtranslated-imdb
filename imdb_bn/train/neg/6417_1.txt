How did the girls in high school make their comments like this on the site, I have ever seen that this stupid movie was ridiculous, how could a dead person sit there and say that a movie can make you jump and it's a good movie , Which I have ever heard may be the most stupid thing, I can tear you back and go to the "bu" and it jumps to you, then you It means I am not able to write or direct. The film does not mention "they're absolutely tied together everything", not a good reason to take a movie well. If they do not bind everything together, it will be a movie, I guess it will create half a movie, not the whole movie. So basically this stupid girl is praising her for completing the movie, I love that today's young media and production companies keep such high standards. No wonder that the political system of this country can move away from what they want, if there is something stupid to come to our country, if this girl ever moves something forward, then what is terrible thinking? Get a life and see a real movie in a while, try Shawnank Redemption or Waterfront or something like this and do not comment on it after it was "boring", use only the little brain that you have given to analyze it.
