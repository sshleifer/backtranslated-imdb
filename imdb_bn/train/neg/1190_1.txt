The weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" fly and Mario Bottle brought it down. <br /> <br /> Being the worst. Definitely a joke, I think they might come to the table as an American Chef's Iron Chef. Both of these are really coming ... do not reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I do not think the basil went to school even in the chef. There are many chefs in America, I wonder why they do not appear in the food network. <br /> <br /> It can handle more regional content and possibly co-hosts who can handle. Pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a bit too flippant / funny for this role.
