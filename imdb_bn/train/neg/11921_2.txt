I can add this movie using 20 words or less. The way a story line with the possibility of being funny is very predictable but instead flatly flashes his face. See, 19 sounds, but instead of just panning this flicker with just one star, instead of providing enough eye candy to smoke Julie Bovene and protect me from the sidewalk, it decided to tighten it to two stars. Blow it with direct DVD and an M80 from the machine. My suggestion, you have received a $ 4.00 rental fee to see this movie and send it to me as an advance, thank you for saving your time and frustration, to sit through the debris of this train, or you can send my $ 50.00 replacement fee to you squatting training practice As to using this piece of trash you will be charged from taking the twelve Gage.
