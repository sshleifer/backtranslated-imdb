The film is based on a real novel in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McKinnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginner", "City of Spides" and "Mr. Love and Justice". I have read three. The first two are excellent. Last, is probably a test that does not stop. But McCain's work is highly appreciated; And just so This musical is the ultimate nightmare of the novelist - the results of his mind have become frustrating, poorly acting, the unexpected one-dimensional apology of a movie, which says that it contains the spirit of London in 1950 and does nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Thanks welfare Macinson was not alive to testify it.
