After reading positive reviews in the New York Times, I was waiting to see this movie. In addition, I also had more than a passing interest among the Shanghainese too. However, after seeing this, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The motion of the movie was slow and monotonous. The director lingered in the specific scene for very long. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was no dialogue at all. The dialog was strictly needed to meet the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you have no sympathy for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was in existence. The director tried to emulate certain silent film styles but unfortunately failed. A good movie that holds your attention, keeps it up and ends up successfully without you having to spend time. This movie seems like never ending. Do not waste your money in this movie.
