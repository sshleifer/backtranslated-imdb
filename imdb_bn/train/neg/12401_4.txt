I have a distinct difficulty here. I did not see the first two films of this series, although I saw many Larry Cohen photos. Fans of the series think this is a good movie. It judged itself, it was quite annoying. <br /> <br /> You never see the face of the gentleman (Robert Jader), but what I saw was quite bad. Death scenes eat most movies, no thrills can be given. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 director's cut, then I might be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The car is finished by riding along with Zer, Catalin Dulani and Robert Devi. The best part of the movie.
