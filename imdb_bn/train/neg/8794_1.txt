I am completely annoyed with why this image is being chosen, I am faced with such criticism alone, especially many critics who are otherwise intelligent, very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Here is a key word that describes the main part of the film - shining. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-use illustration is used by directors - or more accurately, abuse - music. In the first half, playing a really dull reggae tune nearly three times (when it's too much). But in the second half, The Momos and the Papas played "California Dreamin" at least seven times. Godsc, you do not like the song or not before, you'll eventually be completely ill. Just think, some people claim to have seen this image four or five times. This means that they have heard 28 or 35 times in the California Dreamline ..... <br /> <br /> This irrational hyper-repetition (this does not contribute anything to the story) Perhaps the remainder is left if the rest remains <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and still playing Invincible Asia at a raincoat and sunnies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, you have not seen any movie before, do not start with it. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs to see it in a movie if you are forced to watch it. Fast-forward and silent buttons are the tools needed to survive here. <br /> <br /> You've been warned!
