If this series is supposed to improve Batman - Animated series, I, for one, it seems to be terribly unsuccessful. Drawing the character is weird ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) but what really irritates me is that it looks like a kind wimp of batman who can not take care of themselves only in battle, without two help, even three sidekicks I mean, he is Batman, for God! I know comic books, I know that Nightwieg and Batgart Robin can also be Batman's associate, but still ... Batman tells him that he needs help from them ... Can he not manage some manuscripts? At BTSA, he can face a dozen opponents without any problems ... he is getting old? Another thing: I do not really think Batman will allow a child like Team Drake to go to war soon without strict training. First, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we are loyal to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - Animated Series has created history, with its animation, its stories and its characters ... that really was a legend of Batman. Another adventurous novel, New Adventures has become Flickr.
