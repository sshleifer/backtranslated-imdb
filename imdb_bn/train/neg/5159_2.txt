It is good to eat anything other than the boring of the mooring to see this movie. It looks great first but does not give any satisfaction to the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad with this basic plot and Robin Williams. How is this possible? Because the picture does not have all the appearance of a substance - Williams did it at the beginning of his film career just like a terrible popeye. The film could certainly cost a fortune, but there was not enough money left to recruit post graduate writers in grade school. <br /> <br /> This movie is in progress and continues and continues. I'm not really sure why this was made in the first place - it certainly did not offer any kind of entertainment.
