This is another bad movie which you should probably avoid observation. The plot can actually be a lot more "thick" and will be well-liked as a blockbuster type movie. <br /> <br /> The actress leaves something that is preferred, even though you can not keep your finger on it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See it however you want but do not expect too much from it.
