This movie was horrible in the Gods, from the idea to death. Will the US set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? Is that their basis? The way to gain access, the US conclusion, cross-country race won a barrier course, where the winning leader can ask something. And better than those who win this race known as a "game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that her father was an operator. Lucky, fortunate stains can be a twin tool for our hero, such as a crazy city like a rock pomel horse in the middle of the mad (for some reason). Perfect. <br /> <br /> But weird fumblings of romantic scenes on the horror, horror, and beyond are clearly extremely disappointing Ni√±a whose only profession of race seems like a flag of the roadmap, and the worst measure ever. After winning the race, our hero expresses the will of the US government. And see and see, all efforts were worth it, the United States gets its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! Is this your quarterly end?! Wow <br /> <br /> But still, having so much bad movies, it can be a lot of fun to watch. This cover was enough for me to rent this film, as the machine illustrated Nijjan with the gun. But if I ever meet Cart Thomas in the real-life (jazz star), then perhaps kicked her face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
