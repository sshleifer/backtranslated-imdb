This movie has to be the worst one I've ever seen in a DVD !!! The story line may cost more funding and writers to pay meaningful and sick scenes, which I warned on parents ... but the story line is like a loose bunny. If such a thing happens like a drive through a filmmaker, it would have been drawn from it. This reminds me of many clipping movies in the 1960s, writing poor script and filming. <br /> <br /> The only intelligent character of the whole movie was Bertender and Beaver. The rest of the picture can easily be made by middle school children. I give this rating 1 rating because it really left my whole family with feeling of being awkward and deceived. My suggestion - do not see it !!!
