I consider this picture a worst nightmare series. 20 minutes after the end of the movie, I did not remember anything, it was very annoying to me, it even tires to write a review on me. <br /> <br /> All right, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the Joker. # 5 series try to come back to the roots. It was dark and nightmare than nightmares 4, which is basically a good thing. They try to shoot a comedy instead of a horror film. Unfortunately they forgot to add to mysteries and scares. The reason for that nightmare 5: The dream child is not funny and it is not scary. What we have actually received is that with bad bad actors (probably without exception of Lisa Wilcox) <br /> <br /> <br> But it is not enough for 90 minutes. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (maybe there is no reason) and you can not be surprised at what the filmmakers are watching. There should be more holes in scrapple than scripts and therefore the film was very fatty (tell me that although I'm from Switzerland even though I do not like cheese). Even special effects were not as good as 4 parts. <br /> <br /> If this image is not complete / can not be bought, then it is a problem. <br /> <br />> My rating: 4/10 (Use it, # 6 is also a messy one ...)
