It was a disappointing film. People do not seem to have any substance, the main drama Martyn Kahl has zero quarterly values, in fact everyone, including John Voight, frozen it. I will not recommend anyone on this photo. Violence is weird, though artfully accomplished. Filming black, at least print I saw this category fit. A disappointment.
