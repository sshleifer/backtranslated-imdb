Oh my, this was the worst reunion movie I ever seen. (That's what many say.) I'm ashamed to see. <br /> <br /> What happened in the script meeting? "Ooooooh, I know! Two stud muffins have fallen in love with the most annoying-character-to-cousin-olyver." "Yes, that'll be cool!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Even for the Seitcum, Ron Poppell's spray painting is the most stimulating plot since the beginning of the dark men.
