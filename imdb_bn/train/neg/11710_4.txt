Actor Nicole Hilitz If you are not related to a star or producer, there is only one reason to watch this movie. He shows this slow moving and revenge vengeance impossible stories. Directed by Simon Gurney, the film calls Jose Hessar as the wife of cheating, who decided to take revenge on his young wife. Oh, but not by the conventional way. He planned a total guerrilla war and appointed bad girl Nicole Hilbert as a favorite weapon. She wants to embarrass her and annihilate her nicole (Tuesday) her ex-close (handsome but dull Stephen Jenkins, who wants to stop the music). David Delvis is good at some of his short moments, and former "crime story" star Antony Dennis was not allowed to do anything effectively, but Scolo On the other hand Hiltz is sexy and playful, then comes off at different times as evil and devious. He is very risky and "probably a bit psychotic" manages. He is very hot (though there is no nasty bit show) so you understand that he can look at any person how he is looking. But performance is the kind of waste in this movie, which is not recommended enough to suggest or interesting.
