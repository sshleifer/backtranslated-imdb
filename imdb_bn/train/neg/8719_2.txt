Well, I'm going to film another B-industry here. It is sad to see some badly produced movies but I am not worried even if I do not produce any film in the industry or C industry. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. This is not a question of (surprise) acting, but the plot is. How a tight-knit team could dutched their two soldier soldiers, and then nothing could go on as happened. What was my illness is that the joke about writers and even residual members was a scene where they were so much of a doctor's ass. Give me a break.
