I have a piece of advice for me to make this movie, if you want to make a movie like this, make sure you got f / x to bring it back. Also do not get a bunch of Z list actors to play it. Another thing, we all saw Jurassic Park, so do not duplicate it. All this suck all of the movie, sucked f / x, sucked acting, unoriginal in the story Let's talk about acting for just a second, when Carradine's man topped the top of the "Redneck of the Nationers" (which was a great comedy) in 1984, he was at the top. She does not just z list, she can work He should have just said this s-bag. What did he do after Mark Hamilton's return to "Zeri" and went quietly at night. He had made his mark as a "Nerd" and that should have been that. I realized he had to pay the bill, but it rarely excuses this stack bag. Am I still calling this movie? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I'm a little hostile, I apologize. I just lost my second hour of life, I could do some rewarding things by looking at the paint hole, and I feel cheated. I'll close that note Thanks for the time.
