Through almost half, I felt I did not care about these characters at least; Anyway, I've seen a little bit more. Sadly, I ended up the next day and ended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> will happen later - he will get the phone and call it about the man! Which was as bad as "snakes on a plane". (Another bad air crash storm). <br /> <br /> I understand this is an old film, and the acting style of that day was far more natural than today. But even by those standards, acting was embarrassing. These characters were not, they were stereotypes. I suspect this movie that, even more, Bate Davis is an attempt to help his husband (Gary Merrill) careers. However, no benefit was found - I have seen oak trees show more real emotions than that. <br /> <br /> Happy New Year's Eve (ie non-glamorous role) is probably a lively and brave career step. It was not. It was just boring. He was a small team in the film, Task (Merille's character) saw the truth about love and forgiveness (though he was less victorious than the small team), quietly without knowledge of his boyfriend husband in exchange for knowledge about life and relationships. /> <br /> <br /> The final scene, where Task is sending his wife back to reconciliation, so on both ends of the phone line Ai influenced and played too much, and I was almost krinda. I reminded myself that these people actually paid for what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw many people enjoy this movie. If you've found it to lift, that's great. But honestly, I found it bad. The old movies of the Soviet era are very well written and acted in Hollywood.
