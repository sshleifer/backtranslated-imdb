Anyone who was alive and still remembers those decades, if it was really fun and semi-normal in the mid-70's, they would have been more enjoyable. The real children of that era did not stop any work or behavior. These are bright eyes and normal as kids. The young man of this country is still under the influence of the Hippies and Drugs Culture, which was provoked by the '60's rebellion, which encouraged it, especially in the behavioral section, patulence, punching, self-illogicality, childlessness, their absurdity - no letters show any of these. <br /> <br /> Some people compare "happy days", and I can see why they were both sitcoms 20 years before the broadcast of the present times and they were only surface surfaces of both the real age, illustrated imagery, even its full scope. Not only near, but obvious things - fashion, toys, music, contractions etc. And that's it. Those who are very young to remember, or are not born, then believe me, I was not like 70, more than 'Happy day' was more than '50s', for example "M * A * S * H ​​*" correctly in the military base of the United States Did not represent life Korean War, etc.
