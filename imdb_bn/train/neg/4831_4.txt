After winning these Oscars, I rented the movie in Native Language, to see if it was really good <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The film will be directed by Will James, a helpless soldier who fixes his adrenaline to take risks and disarms the bomb, nearby nearby. <br /> <br /> This picture seems to be lacking in my opinion that the film's plot and direction This picture does not have any clear plot against other movies as Black Hawk Down. What the film tries to do, it gives more attention to the characters, and their different views of the war. Begello works fine to focus on characters, but the film has many points where the dialogue is dragging. The heart locker is 131 minutes long, but it seems like a 3 hour film. <br /> <br /> There was a scene in the movie that was particularly awkward and the movies had lost the perfect credibility, with half the snippet scene in the film. Both of them were irrational, and very long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is OK, but instead of 7 it was given 6 instead of 6, because it was a big lotdown to win the best picture. On the Oscars I think this picture may be so good that the private cultural scene seems to have lost the Best Picture, but it is much better than the movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk which won only 2 Oscars. I do not really know how won this best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an Action Packed War Flick, hire the Hawk Down. This photo will be forgotten in one or two years.
