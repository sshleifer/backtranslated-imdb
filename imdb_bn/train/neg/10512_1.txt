Tom Savini, I respect his work, but due to this real disappointment I hired this flicker, my horror was the picture, half the pictures were of nude women, so it is said that "fallen angels" are trying to do terrible things, hello and then in the middle Sometimes the "Blair Witch" black and white motion camera scene was sick. Tom's character was really awful, awesome scripts. And you love to use this line they are. "Whoever is there, it's not funny," but you did not. I hope I can give this Flickr 0! Oh character Jude, Molly, Alley, Emilio, but they left Anthony, the breakfast club reunited in the wildly starring role.
