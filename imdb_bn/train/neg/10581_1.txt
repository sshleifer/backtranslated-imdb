This story was not an original idea. The theme was drawn from various sources; There are several ninth gates, math of madness (other concert film), and ring. It's even using it as the great illuminated circle and movie name from The Ring. The soundtrack of the Cody Carpenter was removed from Ciceria. Optimists will not oppose this comment, often spying the word HOMAGE. Yes, I have seen that theater is playing Deep Red in Argentina. A tribute claim will be out of a bullshit police. This was the bottom-barrel. Tearing the holes and "boring" images into the pot is not a good awful film. The carpenter knew that. He should fade in obscurity or acquire a time machine.
