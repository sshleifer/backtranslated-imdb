I need to be short and dots. This movie was a shame to anyone with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberal, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They may also forget draft or war. Is not going to happen. You understand that it is difficult to understand or accept, men and women are physically separate. Despite the authenticity of 2007, the facts can not change things so people can get hurt in their feelings. Men can not be born or breastfeed (oh I forgot about San Fr√©preco). <br /> <br /> There is a lack of physical strength like men in the struggle of the women or in other physically challenging situations. How many women play in NFL or NHL? Finally, if I bother you about what I wrote, then I could not give a bloody hit to hell. Keep thinking about it - if it bothers you, it makes my heart stronger. I did not write a thing that was not true. This imbecilic movie is a comedy and that is nothing more than a lousy ones.
