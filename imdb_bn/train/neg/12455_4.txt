Remember this observer at the main time when I'm about 7 years old. I was a huge comic book reader at that time, and some of the superheroes were widely expected. The end result was inevitable. <br /> <br /> I was aware of the stories of "Emma Pill" Diana Prince, because they were recently over, and Diana came back to her Amazonian style. However, I did so much annoying work on most of the films. The final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than the superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my late two years. It was not much improved. Kathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to that incredible, but her performance was not good. This script was a good idea, like Amazon is a suitable villain of Amazon and Ricardo Montblanc, but it did not come together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think their stories should come back well, and created the show in an epic measurement. It was like a bland spy movie, crossed a superhero story, which never saw a comic book. Amazon elements were stimulating, but there was a need to elaborate. <br /> <br /> The film forced the producer to return to the drawing board and could come up with a few more credentials for less education and less budget. . The budget was very low here, and the superheroes did not come cheap. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Even Superman 4 is available and there is nothing in this movie (except Chris Riv and Gene Hackman). It's valuable for curiosity and for some inspiration and caution for future versions.
