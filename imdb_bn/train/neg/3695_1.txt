Not the best movie of actors. The director starred in the star's role instead of the good actors. May be a hero, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But for the neutral audience it is not worth it. The sequence of battles is a total comedy. Dancing in the songs of the songs is unfortunate. Music average This picture was the biggest flop for actors. The film failed miserably despite the film's propaganda campaign. Even if you want to kill the time, do not even think about seeing this step. You can see some cartoons instead. A good movie buff could not digest this strap for this 1/2 hour.
