How can I express my feelings about this movie: terrible? Headache? Lack of coherent writing? General stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And that's just for the direction. <br /> <br /> the story? Well guess I have a story. They look for a job in two foster blondes after a plane crash in a golf course. They are mistaken for a 'world abandoned killer' (sarcasm) and are 'rented' by two 'mobsters'. Someone thinks that "he carries him" means a date, and the other little actor he dreams of. And of course, the Turtle Reserve for Turtle Turtles, they made with the casino win. <br /> <br /> Do all this seem to be fun? Guess it again. They tried to make it fun, but it's not. The filming sequence is not working well. I saw good filming in the Hong Kong film. The average for the visible 80s film. But the problem is a 2007 film. <br /> <br /> It's not worth my time to see this time again. It still does not hit Danny Glover's "Out" movie as the worst movie of the early 80's, but then the film is in its own category. "F"
