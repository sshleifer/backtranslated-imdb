Why does the filmmaker always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, for the interest of the audience, things need to be narrow, but look at Annie in Green Gallery. They did a wonderful job of making important events fun together, which was just fun. I can not believe they have chosen to combine three novels together to bring Ebola. Look at all that they miss out that works. . . Paul Irving, Little Elizabeth, Widow, Wintery Poplars. . . And Ann's college year, for heaven! Do not be glad to see Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond Gang? Kevin Sullivan took things away at one time, instead of removing them all together and harmonizing with the characters and events. This movie was good, if you take out the novels from here !! But it came M. The great work of Montgomery is something that should not be denied. The film was rediscovered and successfully witnessed the official way of life of Green Gabbes.
