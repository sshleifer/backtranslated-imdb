Regardless of "cruel intentions" and "wild things" non-dependent, but it's not nearly as good as trash mini-classics. It is said to investigate a near lethal drug overdose in a posh high-class university about a fancy Sheriff, Art (Taye Diggs), but kept down low. As he digs deep he thinks much more than it seems at first glance. We followed Alicia, as well as overdosed girl with flashbacks. About 90 minutes, if this film is welcomed to start, it has left it. This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But this is the only film that made Miso Swain helpless, so the grade higher for him. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Dominic Swayne has become helpless (fixing the "Happy Campers"); <br /> <br /> Anti-Candy: Male ass more than girls are tight
