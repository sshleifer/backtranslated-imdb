Trying to get out of the Twilight Zone in this movie is a half-hour episode. Where there is frequent, disciplined, clustrophobic and mind-blowing, I am afraid the cipher is a leakage of several well-liked themes, tedious rehearsing does not add much, especially if you have seen almost anything else <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No characters sparkle each other, and the technology for a movie created in 2002 is really Chinese. This tired and uninspired movie connection is difficult to connect with carbon directors. This is not a bad movie, but it's certainly not quite good. <br /> <br /> Always watch this movie when you have seen grass growth and drawbacks and your stomach gets bored, but other activities will probably prove to be more provoking.
