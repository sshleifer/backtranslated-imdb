Any movie that starts with a beef does not make much promise with calf calf. 50 years ago for stereoiting of kibbutz, I was there and it was not right. Okay, there are a few small pieces shown in each Kibbus photo (like young people spreading in the kitchen at night) but you will not be able to show the entire Kibbutz like all of them - what do we say - naughty properties Each Kibbutz had its own problem, but none of them had any kibbutz. Israel's opinion was great. I still reminded my young Eden's guards. Yes, and the performance was very good, so you can see it was not all black - an incorrect illustration - was probably intended.
