At the sixth grade, I decided every teacher that it would be a great idea to send this film to the full semester. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We saw it in English and wrote in the journals so that we are one of the characters. Mathematics We talk about charts and other sea shit. In science we talked about whales (which was actually something interesting, so it was not 100% wasteful). Every day there were torture. Not only that, but they will scare us twice this week so that we can read it. I found it was a new series or something, but it was '93. I'm still trying to block this.
