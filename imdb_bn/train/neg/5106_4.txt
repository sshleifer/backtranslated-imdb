Love alone (as this movie is known in Britain) is a very weird movie. I do not mean that it is a private art house film in Peter Greenway or Derek Jarman's style, I mean it's an oath, gender, some really good T & A, a bad script and a TVM with a very different feeling. You can imagine a man like John Hughes who managed just ten years ago, although he definitely used to cut T & A. <br /> <br /> Returning to bad scripts, one of the problems is that there are some characters that have some kind of motivation, especially Amanda. Why does Kenyan pick up at that time? Just so he could fill an alien? What do you see about retro? ET, short circuits, and many other films in the mid-1980s were such a conspiracy, most of which are more defined and credible than those seen here. The storyline is following a ill defined, obscure and irrational path. <br /> <br /> I said that I have seen lonely love and not only in the T & A display. Compared to Fish Gordon and Earth Girls, it is much better as a science-fiction sex comedy
