East Palace, West Palace reminds me of the deputy, on the police front of Francis Sinatre, and William Windmey's son. It is a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also carries myths about gay man's feminism: many Chinese myths which play the role of men. The movie focuses on a man who stubbornly wants to get mastery over the junkies. He runs the park without fear - he hopes the officer will be taken into the stationhouse. And that would actually happen. Then he told the story of his entire life that the time of being subjected to light torture: time, handcuffs, slat for slapped. This gay man wants, and, undoubtedly, the gay man is challenging a self-image copper like a man. The story about the gay person's life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerant, but when he began to describe old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film became intolerable. It has become a cause of sadness for China's ocean, who wants to play a traditional role only in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not relate.
