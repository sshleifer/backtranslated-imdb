The spelling of SLRSHHS I'm happy when the main character flashed her boobs. That was pretty tough. Before and after that the movie is pretty quite hit. The acting is like e-catalog and it is shown well in the movie. Not that there is so much less budget that the preacher and Cainso Charlie played by the same person. It looks like the whole movie was shot with half a decent film instead of a Camcoder. Chess Charlie and Dr. Ripper were funny because I was the only reason I liked the movie. They said that many stupid things laugh at me. If you see this movie in Blockbuster, the other hides it behind the Lonmurman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie should be mentally evaluated.
