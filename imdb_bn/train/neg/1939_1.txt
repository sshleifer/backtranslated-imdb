Come on! Join the Pakistan batching son. Bollywood can not make only bright movies - but viewers can seriously affect a generation. <br /> <br /> I'm a big Bollywood fan- but anti-Pakistani films just laugh me a lot for enjoying screenplay, cinematography, action. Secrets- everything. <br /> <br /> I am happy to see that the campaigners are rejecting the campaign at both ends of the border, and there is no such movie as Mune Hoon, which is not just for qualification. Because of the quality of his Bollywood Masala - but why it also tries to do it: Give opportunity to peace and show that the people representing the people are not crazy.
