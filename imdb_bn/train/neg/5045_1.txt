The clusters of clustrophobic cameras that do not help the film: very long face only shots where you feel most of the time that the lower half of the film is absent (the screen is closed), because the important steps appear to be on, but you can not see them . There is already much confusion in the movie, so this viewing angle makes it worse and does not contribute to great scenes. <br /> <br /> I like the well-made movies and obsolete camera work. I can manage deep and slow movies. But this person is trying hard to work hard and failing my opinion. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to connect to a character because they do not work well enough. Characters are more needed, than just minutes of long face shots, with this set of scripts + directors + actors <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I will be away from both films written and directed by Lee in the future. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in that part of history and what a boring movie for anyone who has spent in Shanghai?
