The original movie version of 'The Hunting' is one of my top ten films, 'I have taken this adaptation to this horror. I'll be cautious because this film is a bad writing and badly loads of old weevil loadsadding loads. It should be shameful to get involved. The original reason was horrible for me as a child! You do not see anything Robert Wei used fantastic lighting for new innovative cameras and fears, and that's why it works. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever tricks and piratics to get A to B, but sadly the elements were there (Liam Nisson, Catherine Zeta Jones, actors) to do something else. This image should be seen as an example of studio waiter!
