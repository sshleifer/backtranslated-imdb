Danninski (Paul Nhe) of Waldema travels to Tibet and bites with a hei, which allows him to be groomed. He deceived after being attacked by his cheating wife and his boyfriend and later the female scientist. Ilona Siemann is resurrected, who uses them in mind control tests. Danninski later discovered an underground shelter coming from the bizarre population of the doctor's failed tests. <br /> <br /> When I heard about the death of Nachari from colleague John Catley, I kissed my collection for a suitable movie. In my fork, I found a copy of "Wolfman's Fowroy" copy of one but three (!) Copies! The film is questionable video quality, the term is dubbed as a medieval, and the film is sometimes slopstick style type. And the American version has removed two love scenes. Quite clearly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I was not really getting the right movie in all its glory. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I suspect it is true, but you can do this film I do not know from myself. The plot is sometimes confusing, and it is not actually a signal that it is a sigle. If you read the plot summary in Wikipedia and compare it with the printed print in the box, you will see that I am not alone. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the flaws of the film can be forgiven but it went through to understand the hell of production. Although floating for several years, it was released in 1973 due to problems related to distributor. And the snuff, in his autobiography, said that director Zabalja was an unfinished alcoholic and he hated working with him. Those who are not really light allegations, and I do not know what to say to him on his own. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < What really needs to be done is an American punk version, with a modest word and video mix, and thrown back to the love scene, so far as I know, this does not exist. Respect Jashir legacy and he takes his films to a wide audience at an appropriate level.
