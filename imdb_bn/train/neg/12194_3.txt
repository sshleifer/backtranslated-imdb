This image is not telling the audience where they are, and who characters. And at that moment I started dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities in the hands of any filmmaker, I find it a very easy and cheap solution to express a voice that I'm not really saying everything to. I actually believe betraying the idea of ​​making film over the voice. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear from a voice, where I say, what date we think, and especially what the characters think and think. I believe that the director has to find a visual way to send visitors' feelings and thoughts. <br /> <br /> After bad influences, a very serious movie starts and continues for a considerable amount of time. A middle-class family and individually all member's life is illustrated in a perfect realistic way. I think the director has a genius to capture in real life. For example, a father's call to a private cell may appear to be unusual, but life itself leads us to some situations that may seem unusual but very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about the real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the realism of the film began to offer stories and sacrifices. I really felt that I was having big headache due to the abusive characters. This issue was given to actors and actresses and allowed to modify the dialogues. It's actually realistic, but the characters are always "really, so" or "characters" are saying "no" or "you're listening to me", it's just enough headache to say ten times. <br /> <br /> I also think that they should be more in terms of sports practice and reading books. I understand that the drama and the book are very much related to the plot, but I think the director can stop showing this point.
