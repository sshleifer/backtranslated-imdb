I felt this movie started well. The acting was spot and I felt for all the character situations, although the true family unit was not fully disclosed. We did not have enough information for the father to feel really upset for his hatred with the father or to involve him in his entirety. I think in one scene you see her congratulating for intense and in another scene she just closed her head. Another problem with the movie was that it was simply unreliable and eventually lost all the focus, and I wanted to beg for it to end with it. Do not automatically get automatic ratings of 7 or above to play such a long drone out and end up with any movie. We are looking at all the quality of the movie experience. The end of this movie is so bad that I was thinking of walking outside of the theater. This movie pulled me then just spit me up.
