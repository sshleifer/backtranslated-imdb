Spider-Man Cartoon realized that why I could not get out and came out for the first time when I saw the eight-footed replay of several different 1994-1997 videos. <br /> <br /> I am in the old school, where the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon was the best and still good. (I'm not going to go cycling version which is terrible - please give me traditional villains.) <br /> <br /> Close a sheet without acting strange, without any feeling or feedback. Paul Souls, where are you now? This guy was the best voice acting for Spider-Man. No one came. Seeing the Secret Wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series makes me amazed. Dr. Doug Bella Lugosi sounds like a comedy version. In a scene with red school and doc oak, there is no German accent in the red school and he is heavy Russian! Since 1966, the old Marvel Comic Hero series had played many good voices. Iron Man said that he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded like a young teenager official. Things were never the best thing in the 60s as Paul Free. Old voice actors were pioneering and there would not be anyone like them. Do you ever hear Blank's son? In any way, he can not copy his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is scattered. All right, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted the background. Sometimes you can say more with low movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes when you take the computer on the movement, they become robotics. I really think these animators do not seem to be in any of that. <br /> <br /> The stories are badly written, and they are afraid of some of the heroes of the line. Why, for example, when the heroes got together for the first time, they started fighting each other? In Secret Wars, it was a long excuse that got their disagreement. I can not see the hero is dark, unknown and mysterious - like a cradle, but why the thigh and iron people can not keep their anger against each other, then the torch joins. This is one of the next comedy. The reason for every few seconds to get square heroes on each other is because 'everyone' wants to see that element. Give them a good reason to fight and maybe it can be dragged, but "what you are doing here" and "do not tell me what you tell me". Another badly written scene is that Harry Osborn unveils himself to loot Peter's wedding. This whole scene was terrible. <br /> <br /> The end, but at least, of course, what another critic Zwenile Hinsa says - there is no punishment. Secret Wars, warned the charge of leased thei. But Things Punches Bad Guys across a whole block of comics. By catching him in a cartoon, he has to easily pick up heavy items and defeat bad guys. Certainly, these cartoons are not strictly designed for adults but for children under 12 years of age. That is why they can not make a box because mother and father do not believe in such violence. But you can blow things up, this cartoon will include that. As a child before the political purity came to fashion I saw the cartoon touches each other. What's wrong with a punch to chop? Is there really less violence in the world today, because those silent and shiny new cartoons punch? I find it all the most insulting when it watches new stuff. They wrote "punch" because we could all hit ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the cartoons you like, kids, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 set
