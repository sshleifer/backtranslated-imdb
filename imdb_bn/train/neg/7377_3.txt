Although this plot was very well described and the line of the story realized that the voice of Steven Sigal was dubbed with somebody, most of the movies were frustrating because you were not sure whether you were talking or not. There were many areas where he began to speak in a deep melodious voice and then the voice of others was speaking for him. But if there is a problem with his voice during production of the movie, I do not know that they can fire again the events that do not contain their own voices during recovery. I've rated 3 out of 10 rating based on the quality of this image. When filming was not available in a movie or on a DVD, the film was not worth the value of the price. I am a longtime follower of Steven Sighal and all his films that have been completed in the last few years. To date, I think it's still the worst one.
