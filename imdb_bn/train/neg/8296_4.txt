Basically, a dentist is dealing with the husband's wife and the infidelity of their 3 daughters. Premiere is interesting, good acting, and music, though sometimes casual and without direction, quite calm. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot Before the husband shows a dentist, he leaves his wife behind his minors (he has a minor role) and then returns to give her something, but she meets other people. The rest of the film pretends to watch this episode, his visual hallucinations and the Macho Alter-Ego (Dennis Lauer, a former patient) and his wife fearing that they will "have to do something about it." "I will not tell you the end, but let me tell you that this film does not go anywhere and the last gets blurred." The motto of the letter is absent: Why is he cheating on him? He is a dentist, a suitable face, a good father. Who is doing this with him? I do not expect any answer, why he wants to continue the marriage despite all this? Who knows what all children do invert? Where is he going? Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and kamanika Dennis leyari as relief) by the good performance of these fake nonrasera completely broken by the film American Beauty or the family does not know whether it wants to be. A root canal is more interesting. It's to avoid.
