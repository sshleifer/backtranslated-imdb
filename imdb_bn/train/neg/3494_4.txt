Considering its popularity, I found a huge disappointment in this movie. Maybe I had too much expectations from this picture. Finally, it was one of the best known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I did not understand why. The story is reluctant. It's a very perpetual movie with the order of sporadic action. My biggest problem with the movie is that the story does not offer a character that I can, because the purpose is a fool, the hero. There is no sense of Director Chang style, and he can not hide the glaring imperfections found. I know this is not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this very favorite love. The condition of her maiden escapes me. I recommend you to exclude it.
