I will say a word about this picture: there is no lull. You can not be disturbed watching this. The problem is intense. There is too much action and it needs lulls! The risk that you take in modern action movies. You do not want it interesting but overdone. This way overdone. <br /> <br /> Although there are some "Names" of acting fines and Gary Busse and Ray Ryder, it still feels the "B" movie. The best part of this is Skyder's conversation: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but there are some standout views. One was a very innovative scene specifically featuring Land Mine. That was memorable. Other scenes were not enough for it to be a keeper long.
