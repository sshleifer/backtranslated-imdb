When I saw that the IMDB users rated this film below 250 cinemas, I thought it was very tough, but I hardly know that the lower rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Weian brothers. I loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoy the White Girl. Little Man, however, had very little smile and jokes were shit. <br /> <br /> Mozilla will evolve around Marlon Waines, who recently plays a big seed left in jail. He and his partner Tracy Morgan steal a diamond for a gangster. The events are horrific and Midway has to set up diamonds with unexpected couples managed by Shaw Weas and Kerry Washington. To get back to the diamond, the midget feels to be a abandoned child left behind by unexpected couples. Of course, he was taken away and the drama began to look for diamonds. <br /> <br /> There are some actresses and actresses in the movie, from Nightclub, like movie Shannon and Rob Schneider. These all-rounds, poor scripts and jokes, which are not simply fun, can not help. <br /> <br /> Special effects were right to see Marlon Weiens as leftist. I mean, it was not 100% trustworthy but it was just ... nothing was great. I just wanted to make more efforts to develop a script with better jokes, instead of trying to upload their poor script with their famous comedians and actresses from teenage brothers, just by the brothers of the brothers. <br /> <br /> Wait for it or television. It really is not worth the amount of money.
