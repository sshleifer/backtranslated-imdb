I thought the film was OK but was very disappointed that they did not capture the real picture of their life. I was so much expected to see his soil as true Jamaican, that it made me crazy. The beginning of the movie only saw me that the movie was not right. Within a few seconds of the movie I lost interest. I am very disappointed, like looking at a biographical story in Mark Anthony and sharing Arnold's part I do not know what the author thinks is a valuable piece of the movie, which I am sure his mother played a huge role in her life. I say that the movie was just right in addition to the flaw !!!!!!
