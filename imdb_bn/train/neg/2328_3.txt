I recently saw it and I must say, I was transferred based on the reality of the story. However, as a movie "Holi" does not quite work. But I'm looking forward to seeing the documentary which produces this project, I think it will be more compelling than this movie. <br /> <br /> International cast B-Class actors but their performances were appropriate, and those who played Holly would make special mention for the actress. This was the role of his first movie and he is a very nice job, considering his most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was quite happy but happy like Patrick, America's quest was "saved" to Holly, but Chris Pen was his finalist. Unfortunately, despite my most favorable views of Virginia Ladoin and Udo Kaye, these two actors forgot too much and did not do their best work in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and intention of the film, but let me be fair, so I based on his shortcomings as a movie "Holi" rated at 3 stars. But I think the subject matter should be taken seriously and I am happy that the people behind this movie have also created a documentary, which I hope will be his debut on the BBC and other TV networks.
