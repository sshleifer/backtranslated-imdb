This unpleasant film has a little to suggest it. Dolph Lundgren gave a better performance than this script or its other action films. And sometimes in the dialogue it has been said that the picture may have been able to provide some insight into a variety of sub-fields. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivation is either lazy or trite. Most of the acting is sub-par. The script creates cunning confusion. And the director's lazy charm is paying attention to Gore. <br /> <br /> This picture is difficult for the audience to imagine.
