I am 47 years old and I spent a lot of my life, as I can remember, a fan of horror and science fay movies. They can not be silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, very few of them I can not choose anything. That said, I would give credit for this film credits and animal effects but that's all. A case of impact on this story. Actually we live in a time where there is very little left that can not be seen in a horror movie. It must be a good, original story to really entertain for any kind of movie. A good story is a bad story with bad effects and bad acting but better performance and good effect is still a bad movie. This movie has good effect, not only has good effect. So if you can not just talk about Gore, this one pass.
