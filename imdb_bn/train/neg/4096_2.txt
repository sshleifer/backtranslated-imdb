This is a classic case that should never have been. Gloria was now the single mother, her husband left her because she did not live with her in some commune (she chose Reagan and wanted to return to society). Just then there was my problem with the series - let me tell myself, is this the same great Michael Stevech, who had seen the right birds of Archie bunker? The series went on, but it was not a Pizas. The speed that Sally Strythrs gained from all the families has long gone. Probably, if the series is given another name and is presented as completely distinct from the family, it can be useful. Ah well, that show business.
