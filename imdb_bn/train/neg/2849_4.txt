This movie and 'The Last Sprat' have been compared to some, but 'Texas' is more likely to be compared to the expansion of the interstate highway in Western Texas. And like the visible scene in the desert, there is nothing to differentiate it, even during this time a woman prisoner is being carried by two assorted naval assets. Someone in Caste comes off very well; Not surprising that with this hair scripts. Director Dennis Hooper, if he ever wrote a memoir, he would not give it a lot, I do not think so.
