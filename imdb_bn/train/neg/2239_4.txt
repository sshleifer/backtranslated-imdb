This plot has already been described by other critics, so I just want to add the argument that the film wants to see Gabriel Drake in all its doubtful pride. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake should be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of "posh taty" committed to celluloid. Its era and as such, only the equally fine Zen genre comes around. What was the actress with the musical brothers? Gabriel is admired for those who love me (Nick Drake and Peter Asher), his scenes in this movie will not be disappointed. She has a nice figure and nobody here is left out of imagination. <br /> <br /> Completely, the film is very poor and its time has been created very cheaply. The opening credit cover seems to go that song forever and is scary.
