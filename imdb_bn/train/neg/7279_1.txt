I saw this movie in the local TV station (TV's "Big Chuck and Little John") in Ohio, Ohio, I have never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know which thoras can even come near to help me to describe this movie really bad. The script is awful. Acting, except for two other exceptions, is also vain, because there is nothing in this material that can satisfy any real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a few ideas from a different writing session. Where thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is best. Some references are almost old (even at the time of release). I have never heard of any surprise, it's really bad, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV, Even worse than a day worse than in the living color. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV then how to make a movie is a great example.
