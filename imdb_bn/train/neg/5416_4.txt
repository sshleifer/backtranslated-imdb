It was fantastic in the third attempt by director Von Straheim - and it did not show any exception to the camera and editing skills, after several years, he would show up with his Masterworks, Grid and Wedding March. Originally we have a triangle, a witch like the two Russian prince who has rented a villain in Russian counting and mosquito carlo Their goal is to use fake money in gambling table and win a fortune. For the count of the plan (von Straheim) for the ambassador of the United States and his "stupid" wife, hoping to get some money to hide himself and play his weaknesses. He even mistyred the maid to save life, whom he promised to marry. When he sees them together, he sets fire to the house, (Van Stryham and his hunting room is in the balcony). Here at Von Strahey first established his personality as "love to hate you". He was thoroughly bad and his character errors brought him a very bad and ultimately end to him. The film is notorious for its cinematography and editing and it is not worth seeing until you are fascinated by the director. There is a tricky bit - when he first tried to meet the wife of the ambassador, he is reading a book - we can see the title - Finnish Wives by Irich von Straheim. It was originally visible as a 210-minute film, it was spent in the studio in 140 minutes and finally released in 70 minutes. The recovery of the Kino video restores the surviving footage (mostly damaged) for printing 107 minutes from our previous version.
