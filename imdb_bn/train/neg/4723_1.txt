Above all, I apologize for my english. <br /> <br /> All of the former Yugoslavia who are not sovereign sovereign fundamentalists will agree with me. This movie, the Serbian side, and only shows the side of the Serbian. No Serbia is represented in the crime. Thankfully, everyone can see that this is made by this movie, so there is no neutrality. All those "professionals" are not professionals who are interviewed. Some people read a book written only by some fundamentalist Serbian, genocide dinners etc. <br /> <br /> The slovens were also accused of this movie. And the whole battle in Slovenia lasted for several days, and only the lucky of Slovenia. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and the UN Slovenia did not reach Traf Croatia (Croatia - after the start of Serbia's war). Every Slovenian is offended by all the allegations in this movie. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable crotch will agree with one thing: freedom was very quick Probably all can avoid the main conflict. However, specifying WWII and some related things were significantly worthwhile in everything. Throw a nuclear bomb on the Japanese throw in Seattle and Washington and say it is fair by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence about the UN soldier and killed Serbian citizens near Bhukovar. But you can find the tape with the reporter that his claims about Serbian citizens near Bhukovar are false. All on the internet Director Dr. The VNA has forgotten to mention the full bombing of the Volvo by the UNA (now the Serbian and Montenegro Side-and 100% Serb and the full of Montenegrin) and do not start with the movement of the spirit. At the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director has forgotten to mention the cooperation with the Nazis in any way, in the fight against extremism, ethnic cleansing and again the Ugooslav Party. There are thousands of other things, but it can all be easily checked. There are many confusing things in this movie. All charges are just a few truths. Every Croatian is offended by this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not have to mention Srebrenica's denial of genocide, there is much evidence that genocide has. Imagine the movie about denial of the Holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to this movie the Bosnian Muslims of Sarajevo attacked themselves. Each Boson Muslim was offended by this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>> <br /> Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian and Macedonian did not enter the Serbian border. If you are not a Serbian and you actually start to believe some things in this film, then know that there is a campaign in the world that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and The Macedonian are actually making their history, so <br/> <br /> <br 50% Serbs will even say that this film is "very little" and extreme. <br /> <br /> and Serbian Radicals are very satisfied with this movie, (about 40% of the Serbs who vote for Radicals) <br /> <br /> /> I think everybody here can understand my point of view. This so-called documentary is very little true and everyone has my advice: Before you see this movie, know yourself. A complaint laugh. <br /> <br /> Death of Yugoslavia it more independent documentaries.
