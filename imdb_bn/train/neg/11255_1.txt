In a word, this film was boring. It lacks life and sparks. A big problem is with two leads. Jude law and Guindy Paltrow were not chemistry. She was boring, and she was boring. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting, but the scenes did not improve. If there is anything, the viewer keeps separating the audience from what's happening on the screen. No sequence of pictures feels real, and therefore, the film failed to create a real drama or dangerous feeling. The movie was potential, but it was a good script, good acting and a need. Good director I was thinking about the film, you know, this film will work if Harrison Ford Sky Captain, Karen Allen Polly, and Steven Spielberg were the directors. <br /> <br /> Ignore the reviews of this photo. Critics feel that the film is appreciated because they want to like it and want it to be successful but it fails at different levels.
