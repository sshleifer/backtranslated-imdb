While properly cautious I actually sat down to see this movie. Because I usually give each movie even a break, and because I thought that the single movie could not be bad. I am amended. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could even protect this turkey from sinking like a ton brick. Just once, during this humor, I laugh at giving a scoffing travesty. During Simon's time such scenes say. Other jokes are either poorly carried or simply curious. And some of them see you actually coming a mile away. This movie can not be just a parody like a plane! (I + 2), Necked Song (I + 2 + III), or Scary Movie. All of them were at Funny Gaga, b. Good conversation and most importantly C. Unforgettable Quotes White in White D got. Which of the above? This movie will be a fairly understatement to call bad. Avoid this movie anyway! Warn yourself!
