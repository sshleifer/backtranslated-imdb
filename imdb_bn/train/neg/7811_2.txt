How do you do here: Trust in God and repent for your sins. Then things should be turned around next day or so. <br /> <br /> For the last fifteen minutes, this movie only acts as a bad repetition of drunken painful life. His mother is dead. Her dad is a b_tch. Her father died and the father died. She drinks. She is married. She has kids. He got more. His wife gets mad. She frustrated her kids. The wife is threatening to leave He called on a civilized night B / C He wants to kill himself. Then when it is repeated, we can get a nice message like "left without". <br /> <br /> "She needs a check-up". I had to repeat this word repeatedly, so I did not lose my respect for Madison. <br /> <br /> Madison kneels down and asks for forgiveness of Christ. Once she did, she walked outside and actually said that she saw the world differently. He told his wife that he found God and it was enough for him. Four months' flip scene and wife tired of going to church. Finish the film as walking by Madison Bar and gives a soliloquy how happy she is with Christ and without alcohol. The final moment? He gives a slight dismissal wave at the bar (like the Pin House) and gives a Gay, Miami-Vice, by leaping school-special congratulations in the air as the fridge-frame of the cam. Why did I see the phrase repeat? "She needs a picnic" <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad man. The production value of B-grade 80 does not help a lot. The script can easily be an "an angel by the touches" episode. It could be 30 minutes plus commercials fell out. Activated wood and not reliable. Even Madison, in which I'm a big fan and I'm sitting through it, it makes it clear that it worked its first acting and she still does not know from $ $ her camera from her elbows. In 45 minutes I started feeling discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to keep it away and said okay, I saw half. That's good enough. But not If I sat through cheerleader ninjas, then I could sit across this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this thing to 1 point: 1) I love Madness. I do not know it's fair. However, this title of opening the title "The Michael Madison Introducer" is great. The case against me 2) The dialog is so bad that it's classic. I'll put some quotes at the end so that you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> About it. Wrap it up, these things should be flushed with a piece of shit that turds left. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See TILT, Executive Targets, My Boy's DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to recover Reservoir dogs and have to torture Madison to honor me. Look, kids. <br /> <br /> "This thing will blind me, but I will drink it" - Madison's cheap wine first taste <br /> <br /> "I do not understand"! Everything looks beautiful! "- Madsen walks outside after accepting God. <br /> <br />" I'm going to the city later and pick up a Bible and I will also cut hair "- after being converted into a Madison dinner table, because Satan lives In your hair
