An insane, coward film. Director Borman has shown that a ruthless house has been stolen, but the man's resident has been shown to have been unfaithful to Nani, okay. Kahli investigator forensic scientist has blown his car, but he faces the mouse, and he does not look like a nice man, so it's all right. Owners of the Rashbourg House, Beats, earned their money by excavating their diamond excavated diamonds, so they were looted and hidden in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The guards killed him and his murder involved. Moral compromise is frustrating, Borman searches for a hit movie, but is not afraid to stand against the crime of the General Gang, who became terrorists around the neighborhood and published another wave of Scamgb in Dublin. He also objected to the generals making it with the son. Annoying Shame on her for her ugliness.
