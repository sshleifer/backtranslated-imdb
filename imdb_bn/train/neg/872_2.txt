First of all, I look forward to a similar "caged hit" like "Ijla, The Weighted Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In any way, this image is the exploitation of 70, "chain in chain" or "women in prison". Sure, there is a bunch of women in prison in this plot, who wear street clothes (quite funny), but nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> There is no strong challenge, no one tries to persuade the warden. Try and run out of doctors, and no prisoner. There are 2 shower views, which I suspect is that it is only reusable footage, but no war takes place / there is no one deceiving - or for any reason! In addition to the lack of plots, unwanted, helpless, and flat characters, some prisoners who actually lead their escape to jail to free their colleagues? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie should have escaped from fleeing in the sun just by riding in the sunset ... This opposition to this mess! <br /> <br /> I'm feeling scared.
