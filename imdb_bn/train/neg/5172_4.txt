This last weekend I saw for Horrorfest was the second movie, Gravedancers being the first. Gravedancers were good. I can only assume from this observation that the production was quite limited. I admit the interesting to start the story but will really end up fizzled for me. We did not really understand or realize anyone who has a character that makes their every irrational feature even more annoying. I would like to mention that there was some wrong casting as well as acting with the 12-year-old son Sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what that secret mystery was, which does not seem to be all that interesting. Some backgrounds have helped the family but they do not really feel like a family at the beginning. <br /> <br /> To me this photo is so amateur that I did not even see it on DVD. Four ratings can be for possible possible stories. There was one to spare for this horrorfest.
