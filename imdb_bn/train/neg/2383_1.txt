This is the candidate for the single most frustrating movie experience in my life. Cool titles, excellent directors (I saw "To Die For For" and "Before Doctor of the Castaway"), and Hei - Uma Thurman Caste. How can you make a mistake? Well, this is a question that spreads to my temples after a few hours of seeing these temples. <br /> <br /> Trying to isolate, unconditional and uncomfortable, this is the dead zone of a movie which should be avoided at all cost. His critical lambasting was well deserved. You have a rare movie that does not contain single rental quality. Zero Out ****
