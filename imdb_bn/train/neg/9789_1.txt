They should have said in their movie: "Stewart Little, who was adopted by the Brotherhood Little, inspired little by his uncle's memorabilia, which was a little skimmed by the book, but most of them just thought to cover" If this is not so confusing then I want to give it This is a good review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, make a profit to your children and read their book. Instead of spoiling their minds by what we know as a Hollywood movie, we can learn something. <br /> <br /> Stewart is not about a little mouse, it's about a person who can be very small and a mouse-like. She is not accepted, her parents were born. The book is about his life and his last exit from him and he is about the journey journey. There is a cat named Snowball, who thinks he wants to eat and eat, but Snowball can not speak. <br /> <br /> They screwed everyone in the movie. The only thing I kept from the book was that boat race and name.
