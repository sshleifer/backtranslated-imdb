I got to know the great book 'Good Night Mr. Tom' for the whole age and it was only when I had the opportunity to see this adaptation. I've heard a lot of positive comments about this, so I had high hopes. Once this picture was over, I was scared. <br /> <br /> This picture is not a good movie. 'Good night Mr Tom' was very poor adaptation and about 4.5 / 10 books were missed. In particular, I found that there were not many characters in this book and some great scenes. There were not many conversations, it ran and was running very fast, but I did not see the relationship between William Beck and Tom in Tomorrow, which was true, which was true. Welding is not all that was good, it is. I thought it could be really good, but it was so different in the book! Very bad orientation, the worst I've seen. This is a worthy rebuild that is 1000 times better than the trash of the junk.
