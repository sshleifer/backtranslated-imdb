I grew up watching Inspector Gadget This is one of my favorite cartoons, and still, my absolute favorite. From the Field Trip to the Spin-Off Inspector Gadget, I learned a lot of geography and history. I slipped on a banana hole and wanted to become the greatest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the movie has destroyed the wonder cartoon's reputation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, there was definitely no role for Inspector Gadget. The first thing - in film, Inspector Gadget is smart. Cartoon is not so. In the film, gadgets mostly solve mystery by itself. It almost always pennies, brains and extraordinary books (I still want his book!) In cartoons. When the gadget mystery was resolved, it was by accident. The film's gadget appears to be a perfect detective, but the cartoon was on a mobile phone, where humor came. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it is very much in "Good Guy vs. Bad Guy". It is not meant to be a cartoon just a silly Saturday morning. Also, the gadget should not have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled inside idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the gadget on the gadget and especially the gadget car. It was a chic convertible in the movie. In the cartoon it was a sensation police car and could become a van. It was rarely a gadget and was originally there for him to move from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the terrible thing about the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly cartoon on Saturday morning. The film was very serious, was too overdone, a plot was too much and was not as far away as fun. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who have not seen it: do not see it. Never See the cartoon, it's a true classic.
