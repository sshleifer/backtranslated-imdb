Sure, I like small cartoons, but I did not like it. Naturally the kids will like it. But then again, I'm no longer a child (though I still feel young). <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the story, because there is no general story. How was this cartoon a cartoon nominated for an Oscar? Well ... I guess this because more than 30 people were not much happier anymore. Everything will happen quickly wherever we live. See today's movies, and you'll come to the same conclusion: We live in a society that does not let people slow down. That's really a shame. I lived in 30, because it seems so peaceful. But each time its ups and downs have got, I guess ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you like music (and frogs), you will see this cartoon. Otherwise, it does not spread your time.
