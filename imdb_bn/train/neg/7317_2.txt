After reading the other comments in this movie, I want to share my opinion that if you do not see the full Brooksfil, it's a tough movie to watch. I do not <br /> <br /> When looking at a completely objective observer, the film is a harmless story that provides more uninterrupted neuroses than being able to sit together. It's hard to see. Bruce's character (Robert Cole) is so disrespectful and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to him ---- for him alone, because he is frustrated by a faulty self-absorbed situation later. And she hopes that she should not take a stpless scene and will take it seriously in a romantic context. Anyone that could be supposed to turn a baby like the open hose and Catherine Harold ---- Of course, he could be Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks-controlled production. <br /> <br /> "The modern romance" has its funny moments ----- but they are fragmentary and unauthorized. Often, I felt that I was on a limited tour with a totally disliked person and that I would end up already. This ensures a problem that is placed in a person if too much control is placed in a film --- someone who lacks self-discipline and is able to get away from it and is able to clearly see what is happening. <br /> </ br> Most people probably know, director of the film James L. Brooks actually portrays he. Six years later, he starred Albert Brooks in a very successful "Broadcast News". James has shown us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance. Albert allows us to see James (usually not acting as an actor). This is a rare comic turn in an amazingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will now be in the next complimentary comment about it. I tell you ----- There is enough pain in the world without finding it in a movie called Entertainment.
