I saw this bomb when I hit the theater. I smiled full time. Why? Because its stupidity makes me mad. I look back at it and realize the whole movie was a fun thing. There is nothing deliberate at Leat. It is very interesting that a piece of lizard CN Nurplex is becoming a chiun and a giant, drunken demon ... Yet his little dress was completely intact, though he is now a hundred times bigger than that. Keep it Or a movie where a man can become frustrated with a defaulter and only gets disrespected, and patience comes back without any medical attention. And do not let me start from the ridiculous fate of "revolution" that they have decided that their "contradiction" must be created. Oh yes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Do we need to harass George Jeff Bridge complaining of having really weird video tape? If you are a Disney and you have not given up your ideas for appealing the movie of the Top 8 crowd without writing an intelligent script! I completely believe that movies can go away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings so the Disney Rating Board closes. <br /> <br /> What is the waste of DVD format?
