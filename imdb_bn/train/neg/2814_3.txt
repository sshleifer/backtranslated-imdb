The first shown is 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): A relative of MacKis de Sade does the same mischief and is awful to enjoy the title, yet it is tragic (which means). This Tub Hooper film is not much different from the same dual role (Marquis de Sade and its relative), similar to that of the same star (Freddy Hut-Robert's) in the style of Frederick Krueger. It seems as though it really wants to push towards Christianity but then loses that in my inconsolable end, but incompatible feelings in the film. Extra sexuality and violence may have been worse if taken, but they try to keep it at least after some annoying scenes. The reason for my final thought is why Hooper wants to make this movie. Perhaps it took some time for it to be distributed distantly, then to name its name and to make some money in its gore, Hooper's name should be notified with the title. It is clear that it does not work.
