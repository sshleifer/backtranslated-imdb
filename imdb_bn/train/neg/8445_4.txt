Every industry for me will be judged by this measurement: form, function and meaning. Garnassi looks like dedicated forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. Long close ups offer a function that the audience can fill by themselves. The story has become a quiz because of lack of texts. An intimate person seems to be in depth, but sometimes it speaks of facing it. This picture works like an introvert person. If you do not read the summary, then you can not see that it is suicide (and the unanswered question?) Which changes Anna's view of life and makes suspicious. Why are you not talking to me Sebastiaan asked. Anna does not answer, she only takes a long time to talk about it. What is the function of the shot? What does that mean? My question is Sebastianus: What does this picture say? What is meant by this movie? Answer to me: It shows us a small amount of people with a glass of water. The stories of their life are simple and annoying. The purpose behind their actions is not shown. The rest are: skins, lodging, landscapes. Excellent and artistic work, but 'instructions for use' are meaningless without settlement. In my opinion, this image is not for co-workers, but for ordinary viewers.
