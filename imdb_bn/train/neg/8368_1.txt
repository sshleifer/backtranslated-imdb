When small people see, you'll spend time trying to find out his many plot holes during his running time. And this is not a good sign because this image is supposed to be a comedy! Guessed to be laughing at you !! But what do you do? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with little people is his idea - it is too embarrassing (even as a cartoon comedy), so when it is loud enough to cry aloud loudly, it seems to be tenfold Looks like Stupidity. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy" Some of you may shout. The truth is, there is no excuse for such a fool plot. I mean, if you see a child with an old man's face, but you will not be least suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide Hirana so badly, why did not he keep a random lady around nearby instead of a hand bag? And a qualified doctor, how can not Calvin recognize an old man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about plotting, laughing out of it," you can scream. Seeing the good thing, the little people do not have much smile and they just made fool assplaces more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a comedian of a ghost brother, but it can stop the white girls because there are at least some decent smiles. Make a little clean of what you do.
