First of all, what is good in movies? Some beautiful actress? External background? Actor is not ridiculous at the time that acting (I would have been if I had them)? I do not know. The storyline is simple: A Catholic priest who is trying to find another artist who killed his younger brother, a male prostitute (young when he was raped by another priest ...). I have nothing to learn here or are not here to think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hooper is not very good here. It is the worst phase of the worst phase of "Profiler" (Syrian) with transistor actors and incredible events. (Uncle, the police member, who resides in another hunting house, can be a child with the priest, etc.).
