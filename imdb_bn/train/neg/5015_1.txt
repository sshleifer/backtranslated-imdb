As a movie critic for several Dutch websites, I have to watch a lot of movies, not all very good. Some movies are so bad, you would not be surprised that they were released straight on the video. With forbidden, I was surprised that all of the videos are released. This really poor budget bad quality bad written garbage. <br /> <br /> A group of young people are playing a game forbidden. They wrote their most ill-wishes or deeds, and later killed people for their bans. The question is, should we believe in what we see? <br /> <br /> This movie has a potentially interesting plot-twist, and I will not give it up here. But what can be interesting is stupid, bad acting and for no reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have played big titles before, so why have they signed up for this? If you see this somewhere, try it thieves. There is no argument in this movie, there is no concept of human quality.
