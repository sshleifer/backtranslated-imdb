At the WorldFirst I saw it is the worst movie and it has received at least a compliment! Based on the quantity of known actors, I get such recognition. J. Billy is very good to see, but he has been in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the authorized part. The rest of the acting is difficult because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is completely unsympathetic and so watch a watch. There is no real emotional depth in the story. A film revolving about an actor who does not roam does not seem very real to me. No police nor development. This is what I saw most like straight video videos in the 90's ... and not even good on those criteria. <br /> <br />
