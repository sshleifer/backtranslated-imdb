Joe Dawn Becker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a stupid murderer, in a stupid cowboy case, which smiles at Roy Rogers. Since he still has a badge, he probably lives in Texas and they will allow him to do something as law enforcement. <br /> <br /> <br /> This sunny man is deputy sheriff near the Texas border. Surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger, but kicked him because it seemed that the law had its own personal bowling force based on his consideration. This included suspected suspects crossing the international border in Mexico, cheating in the gunfight, cheating in a gunfight, women's threat, starting a surgical operation and suspect suspects managed to get life in a child facing the process. Promised that he would die and be saved so that he could come out of jail etc. This guy lets look like a gentleman than the LA police. <br /> <br /> When <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then he took another to Italy in the direction of Mr. Wilson, who correctly thinks Joe Dawn would waste a great time. At the time of the record, he gets lost in Italy and flies in between a multi-cabby process. It's behind the tide of searching for Perreo (Italian assassin) to be behind him, the first of many deaths and main ruins. <br /> <br /> Thus the strip section of the mobile starts. The movie, which is arrested by our hero, comes out in speeches by the Chief Police of Maltese and gets more trouble, arrests, lectures by the police chief ... and more. Unless you want your brain to pierce the john's elephant's elephant pistol and get it done horribly. <br /> <br /> Joe Dawn proves his futility not only for the first time Palermo escapes, but in the next boat which he goes down a punch. Then he was taken by Palermo after threatening a woman with a coat hangar. You expect Pelermo to actually torture him on the base builder, but he threatens that he comes frustrated and lets him out because he promises to protect her. His throat gets cut immediately (big surprise) and Joe Don flew away at night. <br /> <br /> And here you expect that he might be drowning (some other) in the boat. But the sea does not want him, and throws him on a bank where he took care of a poor Maltese family (they were eligible for that?) He returned to the city, where he was arrested by the police, in the speech of the police chief ... Odd! The woman police officer was taking her around so that she could go to Palermo. Why would he do something in the brain dead as he destroys his career for this great slab? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Joe Don impressive cheats, and killed Palermo. He then released the wonderful and striking last line of the movie: "The big one is my badge. Can you get it for me?" Thank you for the immortal line, Mr. Baker. In the history of film history it is the most educated, amazing, wonderful end line of all time by a character in a movie. It certainly falls into line with everything else about the character.
