Since this image has been classified as a "pure entertainment" job and it already has a lot of comments, so I want to fix something relevant to the use of humor abuse. We can see that Marlon Weine is playing the role of Joker in this movie. As long as he was involved in casting, he is always acting as a little man - an actor can change his traditional dress, but his physical appearance can very rarely change-and the latter can be an advantage after the need. However, far away from what I expected, I saw a picture, very disguised, a 40 year old criminal mistakenly pretended to reveal different aspects of the child's life. And with a ridiculous happy ending So what's the point? Many elements are mixed, some of the main issues are violence, sex, and criminal activity, in which the story is badly compiled and lacks in a general sense: Where is Veneca violating the peace of his home and following his husband's life? The diamond is bigger than the world's number kulinan! But the most ill-conditioned aspect is his constant efforts to create a little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it ridiculous. A diamond is valuable, solid and fragile; It can not be cut by any other ingredient, but only a male goat can be won by the hot blood. So it's no longer a diamond but fragmented piece.
