Actually, I'm doing everything for Goian's romantic comedies and easily mix in Miss Connelli like GoodFellas ... but this movie? It does not make any sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about suspension of eloquent desires, kind of knowledge do not. Why does his family live in England? Or, at least, why does he have a British access? He is definitely comfortable with his dad and he is surprisingly seeking apology for the last two years. (Regarding that, someone is making a lot of an agreement for being so far away for so long). And what was with the group group of deviations? I'm not going to get the escort that I have given him to fall in love with - which can be crossed by making good movies. I'm just saying that characters, setting, and plot are not fleshed enough amounts to create even somewhat solidarity stories. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, consistent use of the most obsolete corners of the filmmaker Deborah Messing's nose - if I were him, I have sued the filmmakers! I mean, honestly, all of those who are for women, but why, in the seven faithful years of the Will and Grace, have I ever seen his nose incredibly strange? Oh! Because the producer is kind to him! This movie is like one of my favorite movies, Armageddon, not the fault of filmmakers, not the actors. I can see Messing and McDermott both in these roles with a good writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily gets my vote as one of my worst movies. I'm very happy that a friend lends me his DVD, so I was wasted all the time. If there is a way to do this review, Zero stars, I would like to do it.
