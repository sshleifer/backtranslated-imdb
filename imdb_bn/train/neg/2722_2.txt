For the big thinkers among us, "The Interspreter" is a tragic inconsistent film in France, which gives a bad name for the so-called "Art Films". The story is about a nasty old quilt, Louis Trabar (Michel Subor), who is searching for Tahitian for heart transplantation, but still, I have no idea that any person living in the movie or why they are doing is doing it. As the coherent story is not noticeable, the film rarely loses to us, but I am quite willing that there may be something that actually gets some deep message from this movie. <br /> <br /> This sleeveless, snell-paced drama runs for a full two hours and five minutes - though I doubt any kind of life but still hanging by closed credits.
