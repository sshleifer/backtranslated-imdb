I will admit that I did not give this film a lot of opportunities. I decided very quickly that it was not like my movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the cases have a nice look in terms of cinematography. The Manhattan scenes of the 70s look very good, as the actress. It is a very crisp black and white, which can almost feel the movie felt fresh and fresh. However, the filmmakers have other strategies that use shoots that are hoping for hell. The controversial edit is very late -60, somewhere between spirituality and new wave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As he meets another strange character, he reveals his quirks and they reveal them. The film is off-the-wall, meant as an overwhelming comedy, but adds an ant-guard's feeling. I hope if you like Andy Warhol, you will be very excited to discover the telephone book. <br /> <br /> I had some problems: at the end of the film, a character tells the story of an abominable 12 minutes ?? - Sit through fools. Also, there is a very clear animation sequence that I found as the scope of film gross and the adolescents. I smile laugh four or five loudly, and I like the last (horrible animation of the flat out). And when the film turns into a color for the final phone-boot-to-night sequence, I actually prefer the way to feel better. It has become one of the experiences where I felt I could really like it if it was a bit different. But these filmmakers gave us. It remains unclear, art and dial, but none of these is the reason for its recommendation. I found it to be unique or creative as compulsory and pretentious.
