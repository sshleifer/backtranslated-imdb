Michael Keaton is not really good actor; In the movie Tim Burton Batman, he always falls in the shadow of his great villain. Here, he plays as a widowed husband who likes radio frequencies, which seems like the dead try to contact the living ... <br /> <br /> It might be an amazing thriller, but it's really you Miss every spot facing the threat. Because there are so many things that are unclear, exploration and unintentional up-ends in the way. So suddenly the excited excitement that creates so bad movies in the first place that White Knows fools himself? Truly bad acting and scary edited, there is nothing to see in this movie. Michael Keatan tried to return to a thriller but ultimately lost the target.
