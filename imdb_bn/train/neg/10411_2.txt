It's funny I've seen a bunch of fasciinders films and I think something is very creative and interesting, others like this annoying and spontaneous message - like this movie. For me, it rangs from great to consternation - without much of the middle. I know that there are many fans in her "Sophisticated", but I can not help but think that her many applications are pure campaign. From my perspective (and I know I'll get a lot of negative ratings for it), he has made many films very fast and very spontaneous His gay or sex-sample films (such as) seem really bad - sloppily done, sometimes quite annoying (e.g., Quirrell and Petra von Kant's Bitter Tears) and sometimes only fairly (like this movie). His message about recognition of a person's gender-delusion can be better directed than to show him silently or to kill a cow cruel? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more human and sympathetic - then, perhaps, I'll take care of movies. <br /> <br /> I'm really telling this picture that I would not be disturbed with a fascinating movie - it seems bad - good weight.
