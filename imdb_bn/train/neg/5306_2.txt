All right, I'm blessing. I saw two very strong stage productions, along with the original cast of New York and the San Diego rap (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffani, you rock!). None of these movies are almost unexpected. I have been plodding through the DVD in the last two evenings and have not finished yet. The way is very exotic dialogue, and many more views and people waaay. Yes, four main performance is quite good, esp. Mrs. Strip's But comparisons with the film are obviously "less than" examples. The thickness of the game is a poor choice to meet the diverse diversity and precision demand of filmmakers. Please, find out a stage production for you anywhere.
