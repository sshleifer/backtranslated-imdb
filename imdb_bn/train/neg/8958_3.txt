I did not really mourn the first "hourly" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying act and the characters always kept me from the very choice. I did not really need to see his signals but when I heard they are making a third movie that will work as the original preview. I was curious, thinking that maybe they would solve some of the main problems and give a memorable cast of letters. Well I think wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cubic Zero" started quite well by identifying with two characters and maintaining a snare trap. The filmmakers succeeded in giving the feeling of mystery to the establishment of two men's daily routine. From here, various questions are made, why people are sent there and their true nature to run the entire operation. Which is completely left to all viewers. The acting was a little weak, but the first half of all the pictures went relatively well. <br /> <br /> As the story goes on, "observer" began to make serious doubts about what one of the two is doing. And after that helps a group of people leaked. Everything here starts to dissolve quickly with dust cheese. <br /> <br /> Those who run the sleeping program are sent to our "Jacks" character. Because of this film failure, play a major reason with her two underlings. To get started with "Jackson" and James Bond's direct "third-party" villain taken entirely with the "popular" glass eyes, it can be destroyed by a relatively beautiful motion of the first half. What starts more like a comedy rather than a serious movie begins. With some incredibly corny lines, probably do not bother the screenplay and care. The performance of the "observer" cube becomes less redundant when filling the group. The whole conversation is painful to see, it follows everything else. Failing to do something again, weak characters, conversation and acting "Dense Zero" will be a waste of time for a better search.
