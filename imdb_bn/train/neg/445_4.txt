One of the surprising things about this film (and not well) is that Nathan Stoltzafass, who is proud of himself as the chief historian of Rosenthal, is acting in this movie, a real historian is changed or ignored. Another critic said that Von Trott had said that he did not mean to give Lena to Guebels' sleep, but in that case, why did he impress on what he did? Why not show possible reasons for Mal's release, as Stalinadrade or the Nazis feared that Berlin-based international news will be known to protest. <br /> <br /> Why is the whole story played for the second time in a poor family bonding story that has been over again? Certainly something extraordinary as it can carry its own history! In the places, the picture seemed to be a story line, which was really low. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed to achieve its goal, which had to draw attention to a little known law. Resistance, which is a shame, because the good work, it can have a big effect.
