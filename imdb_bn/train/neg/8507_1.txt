I agree with the previous comment, one disappointment. It's where it seems to be a good movie from Mira and Olivier. I was surprised by their performance, they are more expected from better actors. <br /> <br /> This was a slow start, but it got worse. I even smiled at some bad stunt !! When it is supposed to be a mystery movie. You can even guess who is the killer before !!! <br /> <br /> Why? Sorry to say <br /> <br /> Do not bother you, but you will waste time and money. <br /> <br /> Boring !!!
