This image will be the worst I ever seen. The film's title might betray the audiences in the light of hope. The storyline of the movie is the best ridiculous, acting so poor you just have to cringe. The title 'z zombie nashan' actually refers to a rope of six zooms. It can not be classified as a horror movie due to the introduction of the Chasey 80 music during the kiss. Zombies actually look out of some of the La Roux videos which speak and act with the only difference in the behavior of people like the film. If you ever get the opportunity to buy this movie then do so, then burn the copy.
