What was this mess of boy? But it only lasted for one hour and I only paid a penny for that, so I will live .......... Against the whole cast of 1933 which is now dust. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in a small village the body started to turn out to be a body which came out of their blood. The local yawans must start talking about vampires and each body starts to loudly loudly. Sheriff or constable in the city or whatever he did, acting actor Melvin Douglas tried to tell them otherwise. When he mentions that there is a big hole in every neck of the dead, instead of two holes, locals only say that a giant vampire bat. Constable says that the vampires do not exist and it must be a human criminal for the assassination. <br /> <br /> But Melvin does not feel annoyed in any way. She is trying her most of time to enter her sweet pantaloon, played by Faye Ray. Also, this film has played in the city, Simplon, Diet Fry, who seems to have played the same role in the movies Al-ways. He has made the city more afraid of holding a bat and drinking his own blood. Lionel Atwill congratulated the doctor of the city who thinks that Constable is trying to help solve the crimes. He has ever drowned as an actor. In this role he can get as much as possible near the cardboard. And Lionel Barrymore is in this item ... a bigger name like Guano. <br /> <br> Without the terrible wrong title of this movie, the alternative name "The Blood Soccer" is much better, this film is very neutral and ploding and simply silly. <br /> <br /> Seeing the high movie point free for me, she is making strange city strange, but other than this, the movie did not offer much. And then when you find out the reason for the strange death and see the special effect that you require of this blood <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, This movie as really bad Lugosi clunker without logosi and you will get a feeling for how bad this mess is. <br /> <br /> If you can not make a horror film well in the 1930's at least keep it in Lugosi.
