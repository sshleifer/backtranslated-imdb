"Gedijila v King Ghidora:" is a perfect example which can be destroyed by a repugnant-like repugnant like a great idea. Here, future travelers try to destroy Japan, replace local hero Godzilla with his puppy monster, three golden dragon kings, Ghidora. Although they failed, Ultimate Godzilla beat Gidora. The fight between two beams is very quiet, but the film's plot is full of holes and "everything about Japan" is really stupid. The makers of this movie were not even afraid to show respect to the enemies of Japan, because they easily disconnected the foolish Japanese. The good thing is that in the end, both Ghadzila and King Ghidora both were destroyed by Japan and one (actually two) spectacular combinations, almost ridiculous enemies. But until this war, the film was really neutral and kind.
