Just email this to a friend who is in school school about this flick. Some avoiding filmmaking - Characters are painful, overly consumed, psychoanalytic psychology on the screen of extreme and disrespectful screen. If the film is a social reality attempt, then these oral barreas are so prominent that they actually draw attention to the film that is made in film and effectively impose that objective neutral. What is it acting, or bad script, or both? <br /> <br /> The drama is incredibly incredible for the social reality - lazily English literature and when the Bible is high or predatory and able to produce such deeply sophomoric soliloquies when drunk? And how can such an unreasonable, obsolete and verbally harmful character be able to sleep most within a few minutes of their fulfillment? (Despite my screaming and self-destructive banner, one chick had to congratulate her when she was out on the street street). <br /> <br /> The auditor faced the fearsome references of ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the publication book. . In the form of bar codes printed on our foreheads or in biblical fashion printed in the form of bar codes, the upcoming relics of mankind are presented to a character who plays the role of guardian of the space. <br /> <br /> This flare is over-scripts and at the top - a melodrama passes narrowly with pedestrians "philosophy" about humanity, life, etc. It is quarterly, excessive and tiring. <br /> <br /> There are some great English movies, including content like this movie. "Neal By Moth" is a nice, very interesting travel in the life of a similar social milieu. Ditto for "In Warzone" And although comparisons are not compared, check out some of Peter Greenway's, who manages to have more intelligent dialogue, intelligence and fools and situations.
