This is a movie that I could only sit once. Charlotte Henry fined - In fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was scripts, dialogs, directions, edits, sets and special effects. Guessed, this was 1933, but it really creaked. The problem is Richard Arlen, actors like Gary Cooper, and more. The field and the Kary Grant are not recognized (there was a cry of recognition for the recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie clumped along with just no adjustment. Lewis carols mostly lack self, humor and continuity. What a sadness! It's such a great book. I'll recommend Disney's 1951 version.
