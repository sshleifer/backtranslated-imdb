This movie was not terrible but it was not very good. I'm a big fan of Tony Colette, I think he's a very nice and talented actress. The film has written about Robin Williams, who is a writer and a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is great and he does not believe that a child wrote it. Tony Colette plays the guardian of the kids, if you do not know whether this child really exists or created them all. I'm not going to destroy the movie but I would say this movie is not awesome. Acting is good and Toni Colette's performance is remarkable and Robin Williams was also excellent. <br /> <br /> According to me, this movie was frustrating, I would wait for the DVD to come.
