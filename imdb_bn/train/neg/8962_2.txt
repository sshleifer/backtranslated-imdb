I think this one sucked on the ice, because it left the density, and gave us as much information as to who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. This shit festival gives you all, however. And I did not like it ... though the role was strong, I thought it was a downgrade because it was done by other people without the original filmmakers, if they were Vinceenjo Nataly, this prickle or even Siegel, I think it would be better and the source Has been more true than So I recommend you stay far away, far away from this, and on the other side, I do not even want to talk about another movie ... (I only gave it 2 for acting)
