It's strange - I have not been able to help those who have reviewed this flicker from fellow Australian, but can remember that everyone who has reviewed so far has been involved in the production of alkatera, considering how much they appreciated. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not a fan of comic-book-to-movie adaptations, so I did not take much expectations, yet still I was incredibly frustrated with Alcrata. The thing that disturbed me most was that there were so many things in this film that became obscure, which you thought was "Hah, what is the relevance of the plot?" Or "So how does that aspect of the character come?" I can only hope that these things which are probably explained somewhat in DERDEVEL, which I have no desire to see. <br /> <br /> In addition to dealing with the character of this film, it can be seen in random moments, and even not even fully start with the point of romantic sub-plot. I (still) poured my head over the fate of my career-herooei toga, which seems to have become obscure. <br /> <br /> If I could give anything for this movie, it would be a fantastic place where it was shot, but otherwise I got a little enjoyment from Elektra. I know that our unbelief should be postponed for fantasy / action films, but almost all of this movie was unforgivable or even confusing (even on the level of action film) which made me easily frustrated. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks very good.
