Some people think it's the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they're coming from, but I've seen it worse. It is said that I can remember (I did not block that) which was worse than it was so bad that they were physically afflicted in every sense involved in watching movies. Bad movies are worse than War Games 2, which is to keep you away from eyeballs or to put intense objects in your ears. Another part of your soul has to be kept away from you. <Br /> <br /> War Games: Dead code is not bad, but it comes very close. Yes I was a real fan, but I was not expecting such a miracle. Let's face it, basically it is not the first place in a movie, it was originally just a small romance flick of the Campi 80. It was some gaik-appeal. <br /> <br /> I'm hoping for something bad, but that might be tugged at my geek-strings. Was that too asking for? Is it not directly direct than actual war games, even for direct video publication? Well there was a lot to ask for that seemingly. Stay away from this movie. First of all, it's bad, just like "Oh yeah, it's bad, but I'm enjoying it, maybe the last is just as real." And then it gets worse and worse, and ultimately, believe me, you do not want to see this movie.
