A somewhat shady security monitoring company starts almost as a fairly tricky driver, almost in an immediate and completely insane murder mystery. David Arquette and Great Stanley Tuchi tried to train this train to ruin, but some things are not possible only humanly. <br /> <br /> For example, Gale suddenly turned around from a sweet mother tongue suddenly. Tommy's parents drunk at home? Why did Henrych accept that he wants to destroy his life by looting slogiebag, his business, and perhaps killing his clients? Why is the seemingly intelligent Tommy believing that Henric can be a murderer (almost entirely based on a dream), even if it was credible, why did not he go to police? And when Cheek came home, did not activate the alarm, especially after disturbing Howe? Of course, this event is necessary for the plot (and I use the very word) to be released very quickly. And even if it's even the smallest comedy it can be forgiving. But Heine's description of the rape of her date, the mistake of doing things, and the final "rage" about the death of the ghoul and the death of Hawah, which is more vain and kinder than anything else. <br /> <br /> The box has been checked that there are "spoilers" in my comments, but I can not loot anyone else who has already leaned towards high heaven.
