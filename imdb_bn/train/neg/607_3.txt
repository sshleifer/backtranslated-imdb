It is a bit strange about the London underground, with the help of a long long tunnel, the escalators make you deep and deep underground, and of course the fat is rotating the track. This is an unrealistic source that is not often used in horror movies. It was used in seventeen horror deadlines Ur Raya, a canblic tribe living in an unused tunnel, and a coordinated cross sequence of American Werewolf in London. So I'm glad to see that someone else tried to rely on the tube's atmosphere at night with the production cripple in the UK. <br /> <br /> I think the film has started well in very effective effective order. That was truly ineligible, followed by some scenes hidden in the streets of London which is a scene of sewers. However, the creep goes from here, and I'm happy to see that I stopped it after the first scene, which gave me the impression of the film. All letters felt disrespectful and impossible, even becoming Potente, and the manager felt the need to hit the head with social commentary about homelessness. He also made mistakes in showing the "monster" in full light, where he became distantly distraught and expressed his name as Craig. How do you have a demon called Craig? It turns out to be an X-file type thing, and reminds one of the mountain graves. Actually, I greeted Muller and the schoolie looked at me and arranged for me all. <br /> <br /> This is a very graphic, annoying and totally unnecessary for infamous sexual abuse. It just seems to shock the audience instead of just an underlying plot. The problem is the top and the horror that it actually submits you to the horror of the horror, it is wrong because it is only half the film. <br /> <br /> so you go there. The only release feature of this movie for me was why Camberbell's favorite actor was Why Campbell? You do not see him very often, but when he is on screen he keeps another in the corner. Throwing him as a sewer inspector was a gifted talent, unfortunately the only scene in the film.
