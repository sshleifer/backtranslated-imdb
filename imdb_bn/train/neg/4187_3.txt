A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Grenન્ડel" is a little more than a 87 minute music video set for a docsan or song writer's work. Instead of conversations, the film relies exclusively on Young's songs, which are very funny, with "social stories", actors act in the scene. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although a "story" is going on through the film, how do we really thank you, thanks to the lack of face of the film, the lack of conversation and amateur attitude of acting? What we found for anti-seven minutes is that a group of older Hippies remains silent through an uninterrupted story, although young songs play soundtrack continuously. The whole thing turns into self-engagement in a tiring exercise. "Greendale" off of Hollywood, making a low budget movie is a bad name.
