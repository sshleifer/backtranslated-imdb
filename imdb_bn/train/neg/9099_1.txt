The first movie in this review is an explosive - so if you do not see a movie and want it, it does not want spoilers, but please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> The movie was originally supposed to be about Christian and Catherine's meeting, a poor copy of the film's first cruel motto. Actors who portrayed Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Geller's Catherine is actually a very bad option. The original actor can not pull that smarmy, deceitful attitude towards the wealthy kids. It is quite uncomfortable that some conversations were executing - not so much between Christians and Catherine, but if you hear enough you can recognize it. There is an inconsistency in the plot - if it was indeed the first meeting of Christian and Catherine, then why does a girl love a girl at the end of the movie? He was originally supposed to love for the first time (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Also, with the photography, the tie-in / "you can be a model" comment was last completely hair and everything was not added. Overall, this movie was waste during the movie. I can not believe they have created a cruel purpose 3
