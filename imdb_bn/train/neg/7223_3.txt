This was the first attempt I saw in 8 minutes, almost after the TV report scene, which I could not manage. It almost went like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, we have a pyramid in the sky. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * Strange silence * Reporter 1: Other news ... <br /> <br /> After a few days I finally saw it, and I imagined it was not terrible, but there were serious problems with it. Almost half of the plots can be easily withdrawn. And the other half should be expanded to explain the story or some of the background. <br /> <br /> How are detective, eugenic people and monsters passing by Horse? The more fun was the exclusive scene. "We have all the powerful" Gods ", who lived for epic, and exclusively for the various games we happen to play exclusive." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Irich von Danichen has also seen comparatively. <br /> <br /> The other half is very low. Does our hero get krio-frozen? Why was there no big event when he was finally released? Was he a painful follower, remember? What is the normal person? What is the deal with the masked people? How did blue-haired girl appear? What is his eyesight? Etcetera, etc. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's OK, less or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods looking like walking treads with the heads of the gods.
