Live a short, love one of the little elves is one of the weird movies. Part slapstick, part fluff, part surreal and part is weird. Elvis met with a very off-beat girl with a boring voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. In most ALVIS prisli movies, the event is not very meaningful, and there is a bunch of strange characters. It does not have much music, but I like it, though no one is memorable. Strange continuation. Elvis and Michelle Carey entered his beach home on the night, but after a few minutes a delivery boy came and it's the light of today's day! What ?? That's about the essence of that movie. What ?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog stole the show.
