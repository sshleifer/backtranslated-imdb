I wanted to finish this painting less than 10 minutes in the picture. All these "horror" films were stupid, rebellious, crying and screaming for some 90 minutes. Positive reviews do not fool you because it's really a terrible movie and you certainly do not see it. <br /> <br /> Some of the plot of the film might be great, but it does not happen. A group of five "teenage girls" are running home one night while they consider themselves to be following the crazy female female driver. Two minutes in the movie, and the characters are already debating and it will not stop. We whining a bunch of all the girls for 90 minutes, crying, screaming, "acting" and debating. No conversations are too remote to be very interesting, so you do not really know these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and I am surprised to understand these characters being thirteen. None of these women were under 20 years of age, and one of them easily saw that she was about 30 years old. Get to see who is at least age. None of them even gave the remote performances well, and it seems that they were picked on the street or were friends with the director without any acting ability. The "actress" who killed the killer, but at least she showed something that other girls did not - there was some talent. <br /> <br /> Characters do not help things because these girls have a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. All that I can really tell them about, and it does not help all they survive. If I had to go in detail, at one point girls backtracked against the murderer and their car would be reduced. A girl is beating herself and crying with it ... they are not wearing four seat belts ... What do you expect? One of your friends is being ruthlessly attacking the killer ... and will you help everyone to be "very hurt" easily? Anyway <br /> <br /> <br /> The filming of the film is terrible. I'm not worried about whether this movie had a budget size budget, the film was terrible and it was a bad idea to watch a movie version. Cameraman was clearly clear in the car with the girls, somewhere in front of a window, and the camera gradually slowly slammed slowly and slowly. It was great, and sometimes you did not hear any characters saying (it was not something good to hear). <br /> <br /> Killers in the movie had conveyed the car, though we heard the accident) Actually the directors in real life. No wonder they did not hit the car! This movie is so cheap, they can not even show a car to get a little scratches. Oh, you have to mention the soundtrack ... if that is the case. It was awesome ... one second sad, then the next hard rock. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, in the middle of the night in the middle of the night, it looks like a terrible home-movie, a group of idiocious girls shout and argue for 90 minutes. It is not scary of scripts, scary / tension / suspicion and (a pregnancy created for it), the performance is terrible and the quality of the film and the filming is horrible. br /> It was a terrific low budget movie. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
