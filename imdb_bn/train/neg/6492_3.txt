I was not completely sure what to expect from comedy, drama, fantasy, sai-fi style, but congratulate the actors I think I want to give it a spin. The film sounds strange, the style of each style crosses the patch but never gets balanced, so finally I tried and concentrated on cinematography and individual performance, which I thought was all good, considering each character, there was a deep depth due to the nature of the story. (Do not have to pay anything here). I felt it more than 96 minutes of runtime, and not good. Finally I was looking for some amusement to stop, but it is I hope that can not be a tricky or captivating piece. I think Tony is wrongly thinking that he gave us what he did at the end of the movie ... but it was a sad mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with unfortunate decisions. Finally I feel cheated. IMO was good to let it stand without "end" as piece of art ... just fine. Or ... I could completely miss the point :)
