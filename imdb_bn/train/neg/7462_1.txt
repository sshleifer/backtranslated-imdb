The direction will be the problem here. I recently heard John Clays about working on a skit for the Fowlie Tower. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was not very flimsy and fun. The second branch was very hard to be fun. The third was just enough flimsy to be funny. The attention to detail is missing from this sort of "Corky Romano". There was no humorous comic bit, it was not fixed, and the cutting was not left on the floor of the house. The value I can find in this movie is that a very defective film, which in some way escaped delivery without repair. <br /> <br /> I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews appreciated during this absolute dissolution is my doubt that some people are paying for promoting the title. I can not imagine that anyone 9 years old could make this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come, average 5. I can not imagine anyone, even those who are closing them, even by rating it as average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst films ever. And, hey, I really like three stoges and can even bear Ed Wood!
