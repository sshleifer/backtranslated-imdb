In most cases, some fantastic horror movies are distributed on Demand and only show other horror movies which have already been viewed and already have an opinion. It was this, or an invincible (I like Mark Wahlberg's movies), which I did not see, and I was actually watching a mood in a movie, which will not happen most often because I've already seen all my movies a million times, and it's a lot of movies, and I'm not interested in new movies, boy, this movie has hurt me. I'm not going into any spoilers, I'll just tell you that this movie is just half decent, very few actors. I think the main girl, who kills everybody dead, is very annoying, but convincing; I'll take him to psychological anxiety nowadays, so he fits his roll well, even though it's hair. Blood is not too big, only a few killings, or I can say "wounds" are okay, but you do not look too much and there is no part of the film that makes the injury feel more strong. At the end of the movie I requested to break my girlfriend, and because of being a band member, the 'recording' part was not very fun, although what happened during the recording actually happened. I want to do this, done, suits yourself
