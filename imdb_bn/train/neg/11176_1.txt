I've seen an early preview of this movie, and I'm not able to put enough pressure on how bad I thought this movie was. From the very beginning, the visitors insisted on the horrific southward expression of passino. The poor al really really see, and I can not decide whether it is deliberately part of his role as a drug addict, or perhaps he could not sleep before it came to the set. But worse than the closest passinas of Passino, but it's a tragedy for a plot. At the beginning of the film we were instructed that the passino character was gay, and I suspect that the script was essentially its purpose. Later, we postpone our incredibility and believe that both of these keys Lenny and Kim Basing (for sleeping through the role of lambs), both are looking forward to this elderly, half-dead, cheerful person with ridiculous pronunciation. Overall, the worst part was the original plot thread, which deals with corporate espionage, which is never fully explained, and we sometimes do not care about the least thing. Because it was a preview because I'll preserve my final verdict about the final decision and the possibility of editing, but you can bet I can not give a cents to visit it in the theater.
