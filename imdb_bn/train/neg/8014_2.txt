"Wild Tiger I Known." To be sure, it will be shown only in big cities. This is a film that is SO Artsy, it does not understand in any sense, except the director! I hate them! And people who are all options / articles clearly try to find "metaphor" in Evident Horoscope. <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no stories, no moral, no chronology, and nothing was fun. Or even touching. To me, it was a bunch of thrown together scenes that had nothing to do with each other and they were "shows" to show how they could get "show" and "visible". It was still ATTEMPT in any other teenage movie, but missed out on every level of humanity potentially possible. Then the credit roll! I was waiting for the senses! I was waiting for the "good part". There are about 60 independent DVDs in my DVD collection, most of which can be called controversial "Art House". This will not be in them. You will be very angry with yourself to pay for watching this movie, it will buy very rarely on DVD.
