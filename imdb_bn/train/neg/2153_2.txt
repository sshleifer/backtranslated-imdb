3-DT "The Man Who Was Not There" includes DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inactive comedy features the Laui 3-D effect that makes it better by comparing 3-D effects in "Jude 3", "MTV 3" and "Friday 13th Part 3". The movie is not to mention asinine to the extreme. It is one of 1983's few movies to combine pop-of-the-screen effects. Steve Gutenberg and Jeffrey Tabo were trapped in this world, but at least this did not kill their carrier. Tabour will star in HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's box office "How the Green Stroll Christmas", when Gutenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". Here instead of those projects in their "There was no person there". If you do, you regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (four out)
