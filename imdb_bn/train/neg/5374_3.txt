The Crimson River is the most operated, most, ultimate mess that I've ever seen outside of France. There is nothing worse than a French production that is trying to out-out Hollywood movies, and CR is the perfect example of a Wannabe horror / action / friend Flick. I blocked almost half the way because I knew it was not trying to do any program in the French. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And none of it. It is so clearer that at one stage I think the whole thing was a comedy. In just the exposing moments of painful dialogue and those silent breaks, fades outs and fades exactly, disturb me. I thought Hollywood films used this hackneyed technique. <br /> <br /> The Chills scene, running after the killer with Vincent Castle, is so much operated and overwhelmed that it's almost a matter of beauty. On the mountain with the final satellite, Castell and Reno, with the absurd expression of murderers, 48 ​​HRS Nolt and Murphy "friends" playing, then how much credible it was that the movie was completely deleted. <br /> <br> It is difficult to believe that Crimson Rivers director Gothika was also pointed out, although it was part of their problems, even the horrors of this excessive, confusing film did not come near.
