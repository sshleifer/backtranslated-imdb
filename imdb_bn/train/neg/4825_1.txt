Hype, and judging by other reviews on this site, I was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies. What I was focusing on junk ies was completely chic. I wonder what these people have in other movies named "dogs" that they review? There are only 3 main characters and none of them have written or performed well. Basically I just shake my head in the whole movie and was surprised with the stupidity of these drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Please be kind to yourself. Do not hire this movie. Rent "cabin fever" or some other modest horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are screwers and more credible from anything in "dogs".
