Two days before the official opening I saw this kiss, and I would say I was very disappointed. And I have to make this majority majority of the decision to cast the main role Clara Danes. Depending on what you think about Dance, she was terribly unfortunate, or on her head so far that she should be the favorite of 2007's worst actress Razi. I think we are supposed to be sympathetic to him. Instead, he unlike the whole. The other "great" actress does a good job, but of course the screen is not light. Among all the "great" actors in this movie, I used to say that one of the best works was by Natasha Richardson. Strip is rarely in the photo, and is displayed near the very end. <br /> <br /> The terrible screenplay as well. It's more like reading lines than being "true".
