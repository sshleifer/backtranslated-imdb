Those of us lived in the city and weekdays of filming around the city - so that we do not forget the ties of the road and the tiring days of "making movies". As a reminder for the residents here - locals include Boulder Creek, Bani Doan, Davenport, Big Basin. Bank was the BC Firehouse; Chase scenes include Hugh 236, Empire Grade Rod and Hawaii 1st Moon Drive. Production: Jeffrey Jones was most accessible, Matt Broadrick was above us - even beyond that. As far as the film goes away - a joke of script and a big smile on acting and plot - but caring at this level. A nice time capsule to enjoy the views of our coast and valley. <br /> <br /> Additional note; Joe's Bar (Jude Twain in the film), Welcome to Buzzaa, the real name of the film - Old Arar's parking lot was closed in the city square, behind the Grove Street house of Boulder Creek; Think off the caps and see the few actors on their first day.
