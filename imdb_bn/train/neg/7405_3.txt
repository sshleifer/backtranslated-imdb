I think they really let DVD quality get them from production quality. I rented this DVD from the 2 DVD Store and the second time I tried to play in the 3rd DVD player. <br /> <br /> Has anyone else got this problem? After releasing the film from such a problem, it is really difficult to provide a fair review. After all, I have never seen a horror film in Finnish, so I completed the movie in English. Since it's never been clear that what went wrong with Sarah, she just got annoyed and so I really hope someone will face her and face all the terrible events.
