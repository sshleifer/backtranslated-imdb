I like the street fighter's cheeses, and I mean, how foolish this movie will be, I'll at least see him asshole, is not he? Wrong This is a neutral, hateful mess of uninterrupted speech, half-based script writing and meaningless skimming. Some of the action scenes, even shorter shots of martial arts and some shots and edits are so bad that you can not even find out what is happening in the world. Dub is also harmful, and perhaps this movie is illustrated by that statue's best Italian mafia ... They are all without Japanese! Avoid like plugs - you will see more good martial arts for five minutes to see your local pre-school carat class window.
