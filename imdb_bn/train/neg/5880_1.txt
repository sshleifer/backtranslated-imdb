The film started slowly, when we went to the film, we thought it looked good but after about 5 minutes we all got annoyed with our mind and wondered what kind of movie I came to see, I do not like this picture and recommend to anyone Will not be the best part of the night, when the alarm and the light came back because the project was broken because we thought we were Bye can go home. This should be one of my worst movies, we were discouraged from all or the other and most of the movie actually came out of the door because it was so rubbish. I was surprised that someone went outside than before. If you go and see it makes sure to keep you busy but do not go any better.
