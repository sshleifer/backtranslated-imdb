Wow, this was a very bad movie ... Like any other comments, there is no plot in this movie, no character development, perhaps they had any kind of script but it is difficult to say based on actual results. The edit of this movie did not actually exist, it helps in determining what is actually happening to the viewer, without any connection to the visual scene or to help viewers. <br /> <br /> All this is just a low budget junky flick which is not well thought out, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything. <br /> <br /> The only thing that stores this movie from 1 or 2 is the Gore Factor, I think it should be remembered that they wanted to spend any money to create them. <br /> <br /> If you can not find (like me) and find out all zombie flicks and see to see, do not see this.
