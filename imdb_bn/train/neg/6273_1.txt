This was ultimately an intelligent movie. Ending was the only cruel attempt to empower women to harass male. She refused to listen to arguments and arguments and used her passive / aggressive nature and applied her wishes to her wishes, who finally controlled her power and her relationship with him. The driver of the driver's car does not seem to be sitting behind, because he was going to the end after requesting him and requested him to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think that all of them should be in charge and keep their relationships with them. It was a disgusting movie for that reason.
