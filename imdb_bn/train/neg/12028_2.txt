I agree with everyone above the top said that this is a brief moment of watching this amusing amateur amateur movie even some that will satisfy you for waste waste. Extremely poor performance, offhand production standards, fully pedestrian aspects, and a script should not be written so inexperienced and unconscious, it should be written alone. Even Hollywood "professionals" obviously go to work for a picnic, although no one should have paid for this bad thing. Careers should instead end up on this inevitable drivel. Oath, some jaw-droppingly bad observers are some interesting to look at. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.
