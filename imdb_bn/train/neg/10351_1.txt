This movie is just following the storyline of the movie. The fascinating aspects of the book also did not exist in the film. They have become the story of a Chasey "Twin" Disney movie "Crush" between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hilary Duff could play the part, or one of the choices. This movie was not much more than the book's intelligence and insults of mysticism. I can not believe that Disney can even turn away from such a cheaper, basic change. If you ever read the book, I think that you can easily become a movie of the "ring of link" equation. This movie was never able to use the Times A ring title. Badly done
