This movie was worse than belief. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before the start the theater owner stood up and told us that half of the viewers left the theater in the theater of the night, which became his "world premiere". I do not think anyone in the theater understands how bad the movie might be at this moment. We all finally understood. <br /> <br /> It was not a documentary though it was sold as one. The Dark Angel is a bad biography and confusingly respectable to Betty Paz, which is half the movie re-establishment of old Betty Puzzles. The film is just 90 minutes long and the total content of the 90 minute content is at least A scene will begin to start, someone will say, "Wow, you are such a big betty, why do not we do other movies." This will follow the 5 minutes of a Betty Paige remake, which was almost ridiculous (even more annoying) as the normal part of the movie. At the end of the movie people were enjoying the other time Betty Paige came to the movie Remik. It was ridiculous that it was I heard a lot of smiles in the theater, but people could not laugh with the movie maker, they started laughing with the movie and its poor content and structure. It was easy to say these parts that most of the smiles are considered to be serious or stimulating. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I saw a very cheaply independent film, but the way the cinematography and the quality of this movie are different from what I have seen. Movies like it is made for $ 12 The lack of cuts, grains and a passionate plot made this memorable experience. This movie is "Dude, Where's My Car?" Citizens look like Cain. <br /> <br /> My friends and I gave up the feeling of the theater, as we paid just 8 dollars for torture. The only release part of the experience is that we actually created this movie and we laughed as we thought it was good. Apparently, last night, the "world premiere" night director / writer / producer was an audience at night and people saw laughing and walking in his movies. The movie of Betty Paige was destroyed. They should destroy this movie too.
