I bought this DVD for Walmart at $ 1. After seeing it, I could just come back to the shop and try to get my money back! The only reason I do not have the movie is 2 and 1 no, this story contains some novel story elements, although it never gets raised at the level of really interesting. The movie has all the films made for the Drive-Theater market - very low budget, amateur acting and a generous dose of sex (in the early 60's). Actually, I'm thinking that maybe the only reason to make the film was to make the seeds faster and some of them might know some strippers because they could use it extra. This film is about a Waco doctor who wants to replace a scattered head of a girlfriend with a scavenger in her body. Most likely donors are skunky strippers or models - the only real motive for their movie title to remove most of their clothes. However, they make the movie more valuable to be obscene for naughty bits, and the film is not horrific to watch bad movie buffs.
