STAR RATING: ***** Causes **** Just missed the mark *** Little bit of it ** sticking backwards <br /> <br /> This first attempt for Nick Park's favorite person and dog, When Old Wallace came out of the cheese, they were forced to fly on the moon. <br /> <br /> As well as the lowest feature in 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is very quick and it looks kinda. Plastic animation is a little funny and funny, about the little man in the Box, the animated memoir of the animated genre. Although its telegraphy is commendable, I'm not really very respected Wallace and Gromit (maybe a little too clean and traditional for one of my generation.) I really enjoyed the wrong trousers (and when I was young and We were less aware, then we would say that the heroic joy of life.) Very successful, due to recent film adaptation, This initial effort jibanera actively searching for the reason why I was driven. <br /> <br /> Consider the things as technically impressive as the first two!) The lack of emotional angle that this heir suffered. That's being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and sure to return to something bigger. Two stars, but a good two stars. **
