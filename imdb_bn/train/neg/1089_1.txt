What "ghost" Altman with Robert? Did he save the light? Everything in this boring movie was so dark that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you seen a lawyer office where everyone works by candles? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Actually, do not waste your time with Alton doing anything: it's an ugly waste of all the movies.
