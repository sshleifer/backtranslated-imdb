Interested in reading opinions about the Omega Code ... Most positive positive comments have taken the word almost from the word TBN broadcast ... The movie has been asked to go directly to the video, in addition to three, it will be stocked in the 70's by some other religious groups - part rapture series .. do not remember? Do not miss this one in one or two years. This is the first movie I have ever seen, where it was meant to buy as much money as possible to save your religious duty and spirit ... It is very shameful ... it just shows that if you are a televangelist, you will also be selling high roller Hollywood Producer can play ...
