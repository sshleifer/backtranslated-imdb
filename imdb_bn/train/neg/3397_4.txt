The trailer of this movie is interested in me enough to rent DVDs. However, the result is absolutely terrible! This movie is not the worst movie, or this year's worst movie, but it's closed! <br /> <br /> The main thing is to know what it wants to be: Comedy, adult play, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting, because it relates to the order of the mail order brides, but the film is a mess. Start as a gently interesting "comedy" (a word that I use in very less potential terms), then completely reverses, and degenerates into a very dark and unexpected misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is lost! Such as Matthew Kacowits and Vincent Castle, whom I can only do this for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in a single perspective. It's not funny, it's almost sexist that you could often forgive for everything Beni Hill did, and the levels of the dramatic material were cruel. A movie should be avoided, unless you have to see Kidman or Chaplin in their movies completely!
