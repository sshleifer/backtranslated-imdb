This is a good story, but not very well said. I liked the theme and original story lines, which it was not as clear as it could be. There was a lot going on and there was a lack of power to rule them. Acting was right for sugar, some were stronger than others, and even strong actors played low quality. It took me a few months to get the whole movie because it did not hold my attention and the flow was just bad. I've just finished watching it and I'm glad the movie continues to last and there is some continuity in the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. Story line and probably recommend it for a little eye candy, and I mean a little.
