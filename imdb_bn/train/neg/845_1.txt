It is a pity that you can not vote for zero stars in IMDb, because I will not be hesitant! Actually I would have to go far to say that this image was negatively big. <br /> <br /> I like many people, bought this image because it has Michael Madison, it can be good ... there is no chance! This photo is a sudden! Imagine a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful', well, the premier institute did not even come near that well and I thought earlier that the length of the film would be nothing worse than 'bold and the beautiful'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Madenen, how can you do it with us? The worst part is, I was not going to move a little faster, I hope that at the end they will publish that it was all sorts of ill joke, they thought that we should see such a horrible movie <br /> <br /> Where I Will you start? Zero Stars, Make Up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Zero Stars, Half A Star, Graphic Design - Half Star, DVD Menu - Half Star. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important to see bad movies, so you know what a bad movie is, so I'm happy that I saw this movie, so that there is a bad movie under my list.
