I grew up to look at the original Disney Cinderella, and it's always loved so much that the tape is a little bit wearable. According to that, I was excited to see that Cinderell 2 is coming on TV and I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture joins the movie club, which should be left alone . It holds the original super charm absolutely NONE! It seems, sing to me roughly rough, and almost cruel, do not (properly) the character. <br /> <br /> Although I think the character is telling a story through a song, the soundtrack of this film was laid on top, and does not seem to fit. Zac's transformation into a man is a prime example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few small clips here and there, he used to dance almost and how big it was to be tall! And in Balou, there is old burner dance type country music. Although the author forgot where and when this story was set. <br /> <br /> Artwork and animation can not even scratch with Cinderella 2. These artworks seem quite raw and less detail. And we can see the part of Cindereller Hoop Scarper, which does not look right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it was right. I do not hate it, but I believe that there were so many errors in it. It seems to be a significant downgrade from the origin of the favorite sinderellar.
