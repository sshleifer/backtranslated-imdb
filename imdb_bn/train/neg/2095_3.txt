Battalester Galactica was so great because his paintings were written, a great look, nice actors and interesting stories ... and yes, hot men and women were uniform and running outside. <br /> <br /> <br /> Maple is just lazy. Wrong writing. Actors smoke up a storm of their "character." Outdoor scenes that spoil the feeling of being elsewhere (yes, it is Ford Focus in the background). Lots of many and teenager angst. Numerous women gyrating a lot (but in the background which I'm sure will be cut for a series) and some men have a token view. None of the actors without Poly Walker accepted my attention. After half an hour, I was still wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> Do you have to bring me back like this? Science fiction? It's light on that widely. Actors? Without Polly Walker's fine turn, here's not going to be very interesting. There is no "hottie", even without coming, even after coming, he has been more than 22 years old for a small set. <br /> <br /> I like BSG. I was skeptical when I listened to the mapic, and unfortunately, I think I'm fine. I do not predict a very short run for it as a series, unless they really sharpen their pencils on cipher and work to do more than the OC on another planet.
