Debbie Reynolds T-Tapes, Tango and Yes, Tap-Dance lays its way through this common thriller, which is a clearly made 30 'atmosphere. When two boys kill their sons, they gather together, trying to start their life by running a top-dance school for Hollywood tights. The problem is, one of them is plagued by neuros. Can you imagine this thing with Robert Aldrich, 10 years ago, directing Bate Davis and Joan Crowford? Nah, Boat never allowed Joan to do a screen-time to strut his stuff, and I can not imagine Bate Davis tap-dancing his heart in another role. It is a completely bogass piece of MacBrabber, written by a glamorous Hummer's Fell (a good "Shock" concept that follows the genocide of Rabbit group!). There is an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package. * **** to 1/2
