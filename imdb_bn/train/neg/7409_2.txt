There are some elements that protect this movie from complete disasters, but are influenced by bad acting, holes of deception, deus ex-instrument throwing insides, stupid dialogue, poor scripts, and expected clich√©s. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror movie with a story that does not go anywhere most of the time. A group of obscure heroes in which there is a black guy who gets it first (yes, even in Finland, which still seems very alive), seems to be trying to get out of a mysteriously empty hospital. Cryptic Glam-rock band with giant make-up, crying (very fantastic), zombies (zombies (at one moment I did not use the zombies at least, but they came), and getting their way. There are some time-counter doodles, but it adds nothing to the story. The autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deep understanding of the situation, but they do not spell visitors, or to their confused friends. Their lines only contain thoughts like deep lifelong: "what will happen ..." or "the light can not live in the dark ..." or the evil "I need a red crying ... red creine." So all these characters (including parents and sweet doctors worried in the sad thought) are finally running the dark floors around them, and from mistakes or from demons. Occasionally shows a group of ghosts or dead bodies and if it seems that a giant keyboardist can not spot a group of six people coming to it, a flashlight and conversation is stirring, it only pretends. And apparently this monster can break the walls without much trouble, but the elevator door exceeds its power. <br /> <br /> Finally we could even get a series of "It was a dream" series. Or maybe it was not. Oh, the boy I had in this movie, and that kind of time makes it seem fast, so it's all 10 minutes or so ...
