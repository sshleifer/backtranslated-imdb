A still famous but mad actor (Morgan Freeman) has not been shooting for four years. When he was invited to participate in a new project, he instructed the manager of a small supermarket manager to leave him in a Latin neighborhood in Karlsen. She looks at the fantastic Spanish Cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and she is attracted with her ability. His driver never comes back to catch him and the scarlet actor gives a ride. But firstly he interviewed a job interviewer for the position of a construction company and the actor helped him to be ready; Then they spend a good time with noon. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Wager. However, the pointless "10 items or less" absolutely frustrating. This low-budget movie does not seem to be a storyline, and it is supported by the development of chemistry and Morgan Freeman and Paz Vigo, and in fact nothing happens in 82 minutes. The unclear open conclusion is simply ridiculous, Morgan Freeman's character is coming back to the world of his silver spoon and telling the simple worker that they will not see each other again. Does he fear to maintain love relations with him and destroy his perfect world with his family? Or was the clash of class, and he realized that his fancy area would not be enough for a general employee of the lower class? My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro M Mina Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
