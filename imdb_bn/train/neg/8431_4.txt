Actors do a strong job to the injured players due to the defeat throughout the screen, even though it is impossible to identify these characters, I have shown my clock in film only 20 minutes (and after that one more time). The development of the plot is disconnected and gradually, oral diarrhea is the only friend of the main character, it is really impossible, the basic quality of most of his character work and the way he treats are frustrating. <br /> <br /> This is a feature of Ventura Pons that carries psychological characters. However, this wrong sociology analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where characters maltreat and play during the film that are well-liked for each other because of the well-established reasons. In Amor's Idea we are forced to maintain a truly unusual intellect because she is a seriously depressed and disconnected woman. I think it is not due to its own depression but the script supports it. If I do not have any other ammokist, then what will the rest of the story be? Did he heal through his emotion or through his steadfast attention, the woman was confined to her depression? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ?? The camera-performance was pretty good and it seems to be something inspired by the Digigma Group. Makeup also seems to have the goal of showing these players in the light and radioactive light, because I saw Quitino Gilen Kuorvo in some of his movies (though he is really interesting). I think if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower level of our society, we can be grateful that we are not part of it, then Pons has achieved its purpose. The almost identical sexual scenes barrage was the proper waste of film (if the actors were filmed, once the blue green dress could turn them back into a special effect of a patence on the studio). The truth is that I heard a lot of men squirm on their seats this time squirm but seeing an objective proof that those scenes were not the actual goals. <br /> <br /> Protect yourself and see something else.
