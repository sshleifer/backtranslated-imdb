This is the first non-zombie subgenre review done ive but worth doing a review for this movie. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it's still a clearly B-movie. Dinkokok looks great on himself but I think the film needs a little more weight as the action and violence because whenever the angle is shown or in the battlefield, the crack is not shown without showing the crack and the crook dies or a repetition process runs off. Jane Longiker was hot, which was a plus and the performance was better than the average and the most surprising thing is that the crocodile looked like a cartoon catheter * Comodo * Cursing curse. I enjoyed enough to enjoy this movie so that a Sindhu is going to be something that I can usually say about some movies. Overall 3/6 stars and a clock price.
