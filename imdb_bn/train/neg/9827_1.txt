After all, this movie reminds me of ancient films used in classical clocks in school. That's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a promotional and dirty part of the dirty part, just like the terrible "left-free" series. I am not offended by religious cinema ... but when these religious films are very frightful I am annoyed. I just want to be able to say something wonderful about a Christian movie but it does not seem to happen anytime soon. I bet if they gave the Bible thumpers a decent budget, they would still not be able to come up with something good. Just avoid this one. Also, the "American Family Association" (essentially, the lack of Rev.Vilson) on their website is a bim for this movie which is another reason for me to hate me. Actually, after seeing this I saw my copy of David Cranebourg's NC-17 rating "Crash". Forgive me Dad I have sinned. Haha ha ha ha
