Theodo Rex's poor Hypie was established as a solid police cop in Goldberg, who can work with a dinosaur who is suffering from a case. The movie tries to be fun, and tries to make a story about abduction but it does not work. The movie is far from funny, and the story is ridiculous. I got 1/10 votes
