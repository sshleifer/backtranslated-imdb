I have seen bad films before, but this is the "non-life time worst movie" award! Anthony Hopkins should be mentally ill to associate this name with him - anywhere! I will never see any other movie with him, I command, etc., etc. I like other actors and actresses, I can not believe (in this photo), that can be part of this disaster! There are some great medicines there! Does anyone feel embarrassed to be such a film, out of me! Save your money in this one! Big Flow from the beginning to the end! Mr. Hopkins, shame on you! Also, shame on Christian Slater! I can not believe that you keep your honor in line for this!
