Because this is the only way you do not think this film is a total waste of time and money. A poor excuse for the romantic comedy, "Remix of Heaven Can Wright" (which was least viewable). This is another way to make the film a weak stand-up comedy which is not good at most of the screen. Especially because his trick is generally supposed to be the body of an old, greasy, rich, dead man, but the rock is shown to himself. Cheating is all wrong if Blacks and White are insulted. The film is not funny, it is poorly played in the worst. Go on rent "Heaven Can Wet" and a live rock video and you'll go on the way to the game ahead.
