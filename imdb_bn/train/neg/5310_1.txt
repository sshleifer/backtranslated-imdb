I am not talking about that other review. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, actually, I do not think it was a decent looking girl. No, it's just Chess, poorly done, Ed Wood style science fiction verse. And it's bad. I can not even start to say you say it bad. I saw it late at night, and I was shocked. The movie that has never been released is an insult to all of us. Actors are producers or mentally disturbed friends, a joke on special effects, and speed is extremely slow. Although to me, the music is above all. A monkey could write a good theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, see it. You would be surprised at how bad a movie might be.
