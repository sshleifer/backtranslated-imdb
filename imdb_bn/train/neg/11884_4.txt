The biggest world in joke. The world's largest, most exclusive inner joke. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the office space and 'universal' humor, making the film appeal appeal to the ground, as it is only appreciated by the legal secretary of writing the book correctly. The audience is asked to guess the stranger role of a legal secretary, and then ruthlessly empathize with the protagonist of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The whole time the legal secretary is free to find time, listen to music and are centered to write a novel while working. This is his goal. When you see that the audience has faced him (about half way) they see that his job is suitable for three criteria, but then the UP gives! Directors and screenwriters (Jacob Coronbluth and Josh Cornblut) have completely removed the inspiration from the audience to inspire the audience or even find the actor in a role that he has complained about lacking before he left. <br /> <br /> The main stamming blocks, legal secretaries, internal humor fail, because each time they have to explain the audience clearly. Without this Asides, the audience will not notice something particularly curious. If the comedians are only effective, then the audience will not have to explain how funny it is to speak.
