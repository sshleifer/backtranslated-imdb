After his liberation war in 1983, "Non Christmas Story", John Shepherd - his changed arrogance, the story described in Ralphi became a real classic. "My Summer Story", but Shepherd is still the narrator, but it does not have any character and the characters are not near the original film capability. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a middle and a very interesting story, which includes mountainous neighborhood neighborhoods and topping battles. Charles Grodin, I usually prefer, the role of the father (originally directed more precisely by Darren McGavin), and his character seems to think but is extremely unlikely. Kiernan Culkin is a poor option for Ralphi, and the younger brother has forgotten all but here. It seems that there is no value to the mother, and perhaps that is why she takes a movie manager to a gravitational boat when she keeps her fate far away with a bored housewife "Free Dish Night". <br /> <br /> The story of most unnecessary and expanded paper is thin. Very appealing to the inhuman, but as a continuation of "non-Christmas story", it is not very poor and for the most people's time. 10 out of 2
