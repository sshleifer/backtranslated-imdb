This film may have poor production prices, but it also makes it good. Special effects are gross-out and well-done. My favorite part of the film was played by Jerele Brady. She has super hot and a nice nude view. Robert Prichard is ridiculous as the gang leader, as the other members. This film is actually trying to create a point, it says that nuclear waste trees are bad. 4/10 Fair Comedy, Gross Out Film.
