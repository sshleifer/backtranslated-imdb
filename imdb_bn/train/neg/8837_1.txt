This picture is terrible. I was really looking forward to it, as I thought "lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * in the review below * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good thing: it looks great, some performance is okay There are. The bad thing is everything else about it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you probably know, is to find fish and find out the body that finds it on Friday, but continues fishing and eventually reports it on Sunday. Mobile (cell phone) range. But the movie took the time (this time the boy takes time) to come to this central event. <br /> <br /> Approximate (nearly a dozen) letters, the other does not look different (which is, I guess, consistent, because they are all unlikely). I was extremely disappointed because of the failure to explain enough of how the letters were related, and by the end of the film I could not make the family tree vaguely. <br /> <br /> Our image is helplessly difficult to think about, which is a failure of the story structure, because the life of the character seems bad before fishing. Once you set the bar so much, it will be difficult - it is short for everyone to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> There are logical fools laptops. The killer hurts the body into the lake, and then it flows in the middle of the mountain mile. Fishermen walk on Sunday morning, but due to some reasons Bayern left the house after returning home. Then the next morning, the police stopped the door to come down to the police station. Um, did they hear about the telephone? Below the station, the media told the body, less than 24 hours after receiving the body news? <br /> <br /> The complete absence of the story is that after the search of the body, This is a mystery - everyone asks them "How can you do it?" And the audience is asked the same question. (Debate about what to do with the body "distribution" heading view). I know exactly what I do in their position. Someone has to walk in the car, drive on the mobile, call the police, wait and be sent back to their location. Others wait for camps and fish, who care? <br /> <br /> All of these seem to be false. The only fact was that the girl was black, local tribesmen seized fishermen as racist - "If it is a white girl, it would not have been done." <br /> <br /> A strange indifference (I think it has been mentioned once) that can kill a girl throughout her life, and there is no mystery, because the spectators see the murderer in the first scene. <br /> <br /> So I am sitting there together and confused together, when there is a turn - not in the plot, the theme is Suddenly, the indigenous people of the mourning turned to a quiet status, which led to a ridiculous completion of some incompatible elements about black-white adjustment. Hugh? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
