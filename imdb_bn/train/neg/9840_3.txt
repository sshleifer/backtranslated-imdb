Quirky, Independent, Dramatic, Christian Slater - All these teasers are looking forward to spending a hour or so in a movie "Discover" for me. Boy, I was frustrated. Julian Poe does not get on herself. Film breaking self-aware. I could not stop my suspicions for a moment. Overdone, probably the theater set, overdone, obviously dramatic, overdone, obviously dramatic direction - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The accused did not need to distribute the slaughtered Hammer style. And Julian Poe is hard to feel for some reason because we do not know much about him. Laughable girlfriend, annoying dude, stupid clergy, bratish kids - why anyone decides to stay in a neutral place, especially for living on the coast of the sea (the character of Slater)?
