Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel joined the University of SÃ£o Paulo, the thirteen-year-old upper middle class and on the eve of the opening class, they went to a team with medicines and torches. The next day, after their class, Cristiano's date comes to his house the previous night and three friends raped her. The girl died, they were afraid and decided to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother came, stabbed Gabriel and crossed the stairs and broke her neck. Three of the deadly landfill have decided to break the dead body and take the dead body, but there are other tragedies at night. <br /> <br /> The verb and shameful "Kam De Gato" is a humiliating provocative shit about the separation of youth, and of course I have seen for many years the worst Brazilian movie. The shallow, sad and dark stories are actually a bad comedy of humorous comedies. Scrapple is not funny, stupid lines and dialogues, and annoying, manipulic and fooly footage, with interviews with the thirteen years of die and death at the beginning and the end. Acting is terrible with some terrible, apparently no talent, and I was frustrated with the presence of Caio Blat committed in this trash. Cameras, framing, cinematography and version amateur and very low quality. The word is terrible and it is impossible to understand what many actors and actresses are saying (probably this is a plus, since this flick sucks). Gang Bang is very realistic and sex-absorption is a very bad marketing used to promote this middle movie. My vote is one (horror). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Kam De Gato" ("Cat bed")
