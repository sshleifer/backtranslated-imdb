Robin Williams has played one of the night actors. However, the film has spread and leaves many loose edges to think of "must be seen." I think the problem is happening because there is no strong relation between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to spell it, because IMDB wants to correct the correct spelling "any" character). The film runs a little more at 01:30 and in the first 15 minutes, or it seems, Nun started searching for his son, Kalur's Pete Logamand. <br /> <br /> It's about 3 or 4 times after talking to this mysterious caller. The conversations are not very deep about how you are ... I am in the hospital ... why did you go out of the boyfriend ... etc, in the book, the baby almost shrunk about nun. And the reader understands why he went in search of this boy, once he wanted to know that the child has disappeared and he thinks he might be hoops. <br /> <br /> In this movie, no one is afraid to find Loganada, but why is the audience surprised? Since there is no strong enough tie between Nun and the convener, why bother? If the caller does not exist then who is the care? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those who call and that relationship were important for screening, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the film. As it is not, the film is separated. <br /> <br /> It is surprising because of Mopin's other work, Tales of the City. It was made a small series, it works beautifully.
