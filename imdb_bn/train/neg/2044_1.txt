This movie is bad. I just do not mean 'bad'; "Oh scripts were bad", or; "The scene was bad." ..... I mean the worst, that someone might be guilty of blaming the unauthorized pills of deceit to the unexpected public. I can not even mention (plot ??) as if I could mention it. I can think of another event in a 40-year-old film that I want to find out that a movie is about my spin. I mean, after all, no one is going to deliberately make a bad movie, they? Yes right Apparently they are ... and the guilty person is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But it is the worst that Blockbuster is actually paying to their customers! To advise. Leave this steam where it belongs. Bulk gather, stuck on the shelf.
