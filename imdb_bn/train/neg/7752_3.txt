This movie is about a lost substratum in a museum, where Terira is hunting a scavenger. Since there is no rule, they break into a building and start off killing. Death is hungry and stupid. But at least it was good effect then sabretooth. I gave it a three because Stasi was in it and I like Saberoth cinema. I thought it was ok but there was some death-off screen. There was a cell phone scene where two teenagers kissed and Saberoth's head came out, and the boy left his girlfriend behind leaving his girlfriend to find her completely nets. Then sabretooth gets in the vents and the kids bite off the head. The last death with the owner was completely fake looking graphics. Even the death was stupid because the statue went through its mouth and lost it there and a scene would come when a Goth girl lost her identity, she could not find it, and it seems she did not need him. The film is stupid and waste time.
