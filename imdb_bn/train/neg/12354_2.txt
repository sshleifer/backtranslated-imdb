Naturally I do not like 'GI Zen'. I was less or less obliged to see this movie around my ex-girlfriend house. <br /> <br /> JIAN tries to convince its viewer that it is a possible real-scene, which is certainly not it. As a result, the story is automatically confined to restrictions, limiting the sarcasm (which is not) or restrictive scenery scenarios, and soon becomes very serious. This picture has become very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails where other action films are successful, mainly because of James Bond, Darthy Harry and many other films, rather than being released, otherwise it may be otherwise. They escapism, and hence recreational. 'GI Jane' fails to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> It's a very disappointing movie from Ridley Scott, very incredible story, unfavorable acting, and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 for some of the technical work.
