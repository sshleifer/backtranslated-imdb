Finding the way to get around 90 minutes, the film imitates its long title. Beautiful sets make the product of Hammer with the value of the trademark, but a sign of lazy negligence in the fog in Paris is a sign. The story is clear and can be summed up in a dozen words so nothing unexpected happens and there is more than 5% of your attention expected. <br /> <br /> The heavy-duty play as direct transfers from direct to direct, most of the actors are strong as wax amount (well it's a Hummer feature, it's only featured in the entire package). My conclusion: This movie trash, I do not value the time spent that evening. Eternal life is a boring affair and I hope that the guys who are in charge of programming from Cinemath will be well known.
