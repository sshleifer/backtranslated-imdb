My wife and I just finished this movie and I came to IMDB to get the film done with satisfying and less critical ones. However, among the 10 pages of the review, only a boxer negative. I think this movie is a great idea, and I want to warn those who are looking for the future to watch the film. <br /> <br /> I agree, when I'm inspired to write reviews I do not like the movie more than I do, so my mobile reviews are all negative. Still, this does not mean that I do not favor the idea of ​​enjoying a movie, but I look for more rude reviews of movies I've enjoyed most of the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen it for years. Using a "intelligent" concept and connecting a few great talents to the way of many short stories, the film is the worst ending of all the world. It is an art for artwork, but something that can meet and achieve 2 year old dreams. Providing free governance to the 5-minute screen director proves why the labor department also has entertainment. The director can not write, the author can not direct directions. (I want to make Clint Eastwood high, but that is why he is an actor turn director [which rarely works}} <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Without a sense, the romance of short stories is not completed within 5 minutes and at least loses Paris. Why is it a Jesse'aime call in Paris when more apropos are titles cluster f * cc? There are only a few stories that can be seen, especially Alfonso Quoron Gate The pieces, but all else will disappear. Coen brothers are briefly passable, but you can not have a scene with a peak guitar named a movie? It is true that all the directors decide what they want to do and Paris is the place to do this. We all love Paris, in the present company, we have squeezed this movie blindly   । প্রকৃতপক্ষে, আমি মনে করি তারা পরিচালকদের প্রতিটি শর্টসের নাম রাখে কারণ পরিচালকরা দেখেছেন যে এটি কোনও চলচ্চিত্রের দরিদ্র এবং এটি নিশ্চিত করার সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছে যে তারা কেবল 5 মিনিটের জন্যই দায়ী। সিরিয়াসলি। Fatal <br /> <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not good actress. She is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be you. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why ?! Are you acting people or just regurgitating performance from other movies? I'm looking at you with Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elias Wood (Sina City) and Catalina Sannino Moreno (Maria Flower of Grace). <br /> <br /> One final comment about acting: I'm going to play Nick Nicalt's codos for double and you are looking for ages or perhaps sometimes human. Find her short in YouTube as her 5 minutes quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only got a handful of author rights. I'm thinking of Arnest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Chevier. It is much harder than writing a complete novel and only truly talented can achieve it. It can be said about the same small movie. It seems that there is only one manager in history's history. <br /> <br /> If you capture Paris with your own lenses and reflect on Paris as a gem, do not expect it to enjoy all this movie. The managers were not cared or lazy. In both cases, you rent it when you read it. Please appreciate that you can not give a $ 10 head to the theater.
