I received Tremor 4: The Legend started, dull and boring. All action scenes were stupid. The so-called "gravidis" is reduced in size to a modern day cottage, although not small size. The performance was horrific and the film was merely an unnecessary film in Trema Saga, because it tells the story of how the grobins were formed, the story is so stupid and vain Also, if you want to tell the story for a while, make sure you use the same actor (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past, when he is currently in any of the other Tremour films. Giz ... if you have not seen this movie then do not waste your time. Tremors, 1, 2, and 3 for a better time, this picture, but make sure that you are sitting on the right side of your remote, working with this stop button to quickly move away from this retreat.
