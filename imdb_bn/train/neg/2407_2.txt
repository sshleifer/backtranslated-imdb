I saw it today, partly attracted to All Star Cast and partly I enjoyed many other such films. However, avoid one. For example, in the beginning, the continuation of the Billiards challenge decreases where the continuity decreases. Watch scenes with natives, it's good to remember you in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you can see a spear through the air and the camera where a dead native on the floor is still stabilized. His thighs. Is that instant death? There are some unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plots, such as the little girl being recovered during flowering. Really watch the animated clay toy really badly is very painful. If you can see this movie, the highlight that goes in at about 5kph is the highlights. Somehow a David managed to jump over McCulam and give him breath. As was the time to go out of the way, as the Olivisk falls in the city, he has to go down twice to the earth all the time, but he does not shout, and it falls down. I only give it a 2 due to Ekland. And why is the development of the motion picture movie?
