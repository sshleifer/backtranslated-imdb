Can I give it a minus rating? Any? Well, tell me that it's sometimes the most extreme movie to watch. It was very painful. Boris Maximus The plot (?) Is well hidden in sub-levels of nebulosity. I hired this picture with a friend and hopefully it will be better after about thirty minutes, we decided to be "fast forward" to look a bit better. It does not get better. This movie about some dude kidnapped by these two girls, seems interesting, but, in reality, it's just a bore. Nothing will ever happen even remotely interesting. If you ever have an opportunity to see it, please make a favor on your behalf, instead try "Plan Not Additional Space".
