This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen some nominated candidates and recipients of this award for the last 30 years and I really believe this movie can be the worst among them - but it is not just nominated but it won !! I think that 1989 must be an awesome year for this genre. <br /> <br /> This image shows a group of characters that looks a bit like super-skin Uncle Fester. The Stage Speed ​​Animation shows the simple statistical statistics that are moved using it. All identical - with the same face, body and clothes. The only difference is that each of them has a different number drawn on their backs. They are suspended that a large platform is enduring, such as by magic, space. Each has a pole and a box of their platform. The platform starts slightly tilting and the response men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and for the longest time and on. This is only relief from tedium when one of them is rather nasty at the end, but it is not enough to make this fun to see at least. Along with passive stop motion animation, this brief gives me no interest ... nothing. <br /> <br /> However, in 1989, a small conic cone came and I have no idea why the nominees were not among them. This is a great short and it was much better than the nominees of the year or year before. Perhaps preceded by Pixar's success in previous years, they were biased, but Conics Kaneck is so shiny and so funny that almost the culprit seems to have ignored it. Pixar could not access? This seems impossible.
