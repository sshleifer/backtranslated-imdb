Okay, just by reading the title you think this will be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well but after the first half an hour it became so annoying. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This is a story about a mother who feels so desperate to have her daughter cheerleader that she wants to go for any length she wants. The only problem is that the girl's friend is on her way. He has always won the contest, so push the soil to further "eradicate". After talking with a "hitman", the mother decided that the girl needed to be roughed up a little. So actions are taken, but eventually they are caught. <br /> <br /> Cast is horror and the movie does not get too long that is not happening. Do not waste your time during this time. <br /> <br />
