I usually do not take the time to comment that some people will read, they can see something about the movie. However, in this case, I think all of them should be warned who can waste time on it. I finished just finishing it five minutes ago. This, quite simply, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Acting is horrible, a plot is incomplete, and production quality is the best poverty level. I know that even a low budget movie might be great, but this is not one. There is one thing that can save this movie for some awesome fan motives - more on-screen graphics and slashing! This is the grand total off-screen thrice. When it comes to being effective and reasonably, it's annoying - especially the last scene - it's not just enough. The film is very long for its brief content, very dialogue is heavy, and this is often impossible to see. What happened? More than 20 girls have been abducted and murdered because all three teen girls were illegally and separately driving across an isolated area to give a brief description of the room. Their car, of course, broke down, and they were taken to an old annoying house with three crazy people - one of whom is psychological killer. All three eventually, are boring, off-screen, one-one, are killed, after slowly feeling like an eternity of nonsense. As I said, once I see valuable things killings. Please do not buy it or rent it for it, and I'm not fooled by misleading box art and film descriptions. Save your money and your time.
