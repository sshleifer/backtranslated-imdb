Although it is a manufactured television production, the last product has absolutely no excuse for the results below the rock. In this movie, DID has a budget and it was a casting department, so if you are going to create a movie about real life story and actually put a "true story" in the title, then some efforts should not be made. Try and capture some realism? Above all, this movie is thrown silently. These actors do not have television soap during the day, or those lively Lifetime Channel movies, gangster / criminal narratives in real life. Everything about them from their appearance, according to their custom, the 90s-shopping mall-all-rock-shouting generation shouting. What about the script? The two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again it sounded very sound at 90. I do not think Clyde Barro ever said, "I'm here." It seems that a bunch of "Block on New Kids" came together and decided to really "take a walk" about Bonny and Clyde, you know that it will be completely rock and rockin. Well, this sticker does not even rank on the red and rockin scale. Any kind of movie can be wrong with castings and performances and mistakes in music. Every single thing is fairly wrong ... and the team responsible for this angry Turkey was nervous to keep the "true story" in the headline. This is not true story, even worse, it is not a distant entertainment as a neutral pop star, which is adopted in its own position. Like I stated in my title, it's simply horrible beyond the word, on each level fantastic. Trust this, or watch at your own risk.
