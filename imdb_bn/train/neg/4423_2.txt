One of the most often forgotten movies by the ranks of poverty in the 1930s, revived by the DVD's magic. <br /> <br /> Starring Star Universal Player Lionel Atoll (often supporting superman actor Frankenstein) is a murderer involved in a rocket. One person killed (involved in the scam of Stockbrokers) and at the right time asking the witness, another deaf and proved "innocent" because he could not speak to the witness. <br /> <br /> Obviously, where it goes apart if it was a congenital deafness, would not they be deaf? Oh, well, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, someone else here can really value a rock.
