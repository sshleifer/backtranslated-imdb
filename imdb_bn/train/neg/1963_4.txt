This film is like the Darkness Fruit, and like The Bugman (2005), it is much more graphic than both and not better than both. This is also slow and fairly predictable. It also got the shadow of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus. We can smell some new blends mixed up and some of their scenes become transmissive / inspirational speeches. Actually, this film is almost a cyclone. Although it is serious, makeup effects are not very realistic. Actually they look very cheap. There are also some really awful clipped conversations. And when I will not say, there is a point where the actions of a character are not authentic or believable. Someone did not work in the right way. You see this movie, you will know what you understand. There are some unnoticed nudity for nudity. It was not really necessary. The good news is that acting was actually quite good. Better to be better than this movie, after the evidence carefully, ID was saying this movie was passable, but not good. My verdict for tooth fairy: 4/10
