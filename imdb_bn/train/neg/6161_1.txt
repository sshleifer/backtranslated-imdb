This is probably the worst fence, sword fighting, never made in the movie. It is not only that the so-called sports fencing is poor but due to plot, the characters are so weak that they were cast in a semi-naked sex scene and later, the supposed group danced around a scrambling scene, trying to maintain interest in the audience. F. What is the talent of Murray Ibrahim? You are served with Sasabakuling films much better than Zoro, Scaramo, which has something like the Basil Rothbone villain. As a fencer I can recognize the inability to visit movies often to keep me as a sport, but if it ever happens, it will get a new, better pictured letter and a plot with more depth.
