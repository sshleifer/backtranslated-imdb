When I was watching this movie, I was thinking, okay it would be good at some moment ... I was wrong. When the real end of the movie is finished A complete 92-minute waste. The good part was all seriousness aside when Wendigo finally showed up and showed that you could not even see him that good. And the end of the tail was really stupid as well. There were many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen, but it was frustrating. The bad part was Wendigo's more talks then there was Wendigo. To be so bad animals, you could definitely not tell it by this movie.
