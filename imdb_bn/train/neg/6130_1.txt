In the early 1980's, Kurt Thomas had some of the heroes of the United States. Of course, people in his position provide the role of the film that only exists as its capital. I did not get any ideas for Thomas to make this film, but to make myself a national fool in a motion picture, I have to pay a big hip of money. The film has been received from "Enter the Dragon", as is most of the martial art figures. Instead of just a real martial arts, they form an irrational new martial arts, which is described by a critically correct "cross between Kung Fu and dance breaks". A gymnast (of course, Thomas) is hired to rescue some lady from an overwhelming castle, even though it is OK to kick assistant assistants in each house. Of course, he fought with his way towards the lead villain, and of course he has a fancy-dance fight, which would only surprise him not to watch martial arts. Nostalgic choices can be touched, especially Thomas' mulled hairstyles and male co-stars are mostly. But the only reason to watch this movie is that if you are annoyed with Kurt Thomas, who now wants that he never stepped into the film set.
