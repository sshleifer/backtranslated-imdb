David Lin's worst film Even 'what we serve' was not as bad. Generally a movie with such a true fame, at least some of the redemption qualities, indicates that it can be considered a classic. But after seeing this, I could not understand why this piece was liked in 1945 too! I played, harsh upper lips on the British approach, stories, scripts (which can be quite funny at times but can be completely unfunny) and the soundtrack dislike. The character of Elvira is meant to be alluring and attractive, but the true truth was ugly and there was a strange and annoying voice. Another film that believes not just believes in a movie fame Another very overrated 'British classic'.
