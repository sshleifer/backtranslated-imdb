I've all come to come to book love softly. Movies can not use all aspects of the book to fully understand it, but usually they use at least the main points of the book. I was extremely disappointed in this movie. Their only thing in this book is that they have come to visit Missy's father (though both parents come in the book). All that The story line was so much rolled and brought from a distance and yes, sad, from the book, I could not enjoy it. Even if I read the book I was very sorry. I know that Pioneer's life was rough, but the whole film was frustrating. Ratings are for the adaptation of the same family which makes them great.
