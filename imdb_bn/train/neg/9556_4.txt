This movie is mostly followed by scenes and special effects. This plot is very weak. Most of the computers were just mango-jumbo. I've seen it because I was a big fan of original fighting game movies, which was mostly based on computer's true and practical computer terminology. This movie was anyway. Most of the views of the computer are simply impossible and non-communal with real computers and networks, only lam. It was written by someone who had no idea about the actual computer. <br /> <br /> The replay game was hair and it was just an arcade game. Any real hacking, so what was the point? The movie was boring. Lam Siegel
