As the first in the Plot Tagline, I think it could be a decent film. Could I ever be wrong? At the beginning of the film, it got together as a bunch of phikks and decided to create low-budget films. For the first 10 minutes, you do not see chassis, horrific sounds and God-awful special effects, but it gets worse. In just 20 minutes I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I can only ask this question when I could not laugh at the neutrality of this movie. The main actor has a setting for passion and he was supposed to go into everything between love, hatred and everything, although he sticks it across the entire film. The flashback scene almost vomits me because it gave me an additional minute of footage from the previous movie. Now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rob Morphias from the "matrix", even though he is just doing a terrible job. The actor's words about "star Wars" and fate cookie phrases are almost intolerable. Now at the end of the movie you will not realize that this is the end of the movie because you think the plot is finally developing. The character of "Morpheus" dies, only good things about the movie. He utters a couple words and credit rolls. what is this? Any plot, bad acting, Chess everything, it can not get any worse. Please, if you value human manners, do not watch this movie!
