I saw this movie at Rotterdam Festival, probably as all other voters. The director was present and he worked very hard and is very committed to the project, which I think explains the above average reception and identifies it. It's like a child's favorite "Round the Twist" feature, but it also takes itself very seriously for that release. If you want to go to a different world of the world, you will see the movie itself, because I can not think of any other Fiji film, but overall it is generic, bad acting (though by an amateur cast) and subaltern mentality victims. The morality of the story seems to be that the native islands will try and screw each other, but until all the problems can be resolved (beyond the island) until an important white governor departs.
