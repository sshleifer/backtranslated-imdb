Here's a terrific version of PRISCILLA: Melinda / Mindy (3 dead returning dead) starring Clariner of the Desert (they wish!) Clarke, like Clark, is a desert who brings out a bank with a lover Johnny (Jason Dur). He was driven by extremist chief screws (played by a hat Robert Eingland) in the South-of-the-Prison prison. Until he and his beloved pet poodles were hiding in a new station convent, they were transformed by a young fallen meteor. Dogs hate the queen to become "bichchusses" and the candy is too long, she can not control talking, killing an empty tongue. Thieves looking for stolen robbery and other mixed numbskulls add extra complexity. <br /> <br /> First off, Clark makes pretty and what makes this movie what it does. You see him and see someone very funny in the slopstick scene, very convincing in the horrific scene and with various jaws and disguises, very sexy, eye-popping, skin tight Latex bodyweight ... and wonder how does this actress come from a huge star. It is very bad that the civilization effort is not in line with its commitment. <br /> <br /> Accusation director / scriptor Cymma, who is thinking alone in this miraculous love, laughing ..., does not have the option for a real sense of annoying support characters and stupid dialogue humor. Another nail of the coffin; The movie looks pretty, lots of gray colors and sets are weirdly muted by strange photography and dust desert people. Thankfully, Clark is for Syamama in his film because he sees you alone.
