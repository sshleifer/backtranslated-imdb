When the first 4 minutes of the movie started like a California tour, I was wondering if the tapes were mixed. Then I saw Paul Thomas in a scene with Johanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This being spied by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron) Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about her behavior, so she recruits him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could work without animal, role of robot, or without ruthlessness. There is a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it is not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
