This is a good movie, but there is no real depth or emotional or lack of talk about the story. <br /> <br /> This story is based on real events and it is not limited to virtually any activity, even with no real mystery. <br /> <br /> Washington's leadership is credible, but he is sleeping in sleep, for which there is no chance of a muscle flexing for muscle or its supporter cast. <br /> <br /> The story has not easily heard a little flat, even the title of the title, but it does not have any emotional effect against the other film, in the end, you are not really worried about it and those motions beyond the outside seem to be more academic. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
