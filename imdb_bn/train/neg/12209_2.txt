Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, both of my best friend and my brother had a policy that the person who chose the film must be given. And, when I did not ever see anything bad to me, I could not travel to movies for free! The way I came to see a second cinematic shit and sometimes I did not say! Now, despite being a rogue movie, it is in recreational places to see - the type of death in the brain of the brain. And, technically stunts and cameras work well, so it boosts my ratings to 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, there is almost no plot, Rambo itself has only 3 words (excluding grants and eels), there is an unreasonable and completely irrelevant and unused "romance" and the film is a giant (and stupid) special effect. And what nicely strong special effects. 12383499143743701 In Rambo bullet and rocket firing have no effect, and almost every bullet or arrow rumba shoots hit his mark! And, bad guys are using a -47, helicopter and rocket, in some scenes, the Rambo was a bow and arrow like sample-driven tips! The scene where a bad guy is shooting him, slowly and quietly launching one of these explosive arrows, it has been specially created for foolhardy viewers! It was surprisingly parodied in Wird al-acting UHF. Plus, Hot Shots, Part Duke is not just this funny scene - not just in this stupid view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
