I must admit that I do not hold New Age mambo jambo When people "exchange energy" I will always wonder how many people are actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving global warming problems. When the power is "applied" I am always wondering how the Entropy managed to breach the law and still without the Nobel Prize. When people think that how good engagement enables them to navigate through the complexity of their lives, I wonder how they fail to do simple things like train stations. <br /> <br /> But again, it is not the first movie in the plot hole and with most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this was the case with "Celestine Prediction", I did not burn down this movie, but unfortunately it does not. Every actor gets annoyed with his head and is unable to convey what he is in. This results in many "Ah -S" and "Oh-S", as I talk to someone while talking about Quantum Physics, he really knows what he is saying and pretending to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired as well. You might expect some people who "dream can come", but hey, I think he got a good salary for the job and took the attitude of New York taxi driver: "It's your money, friends .." Being one of the only bad guys at all is JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does she have a job, she is one of the few actors in this movie who can have some cracks in this eternal and terrible annoying New Age Chatter. <br /> <br /> This movie is like one of the dates of this dinner when you find that your date is actually a terrific archway which seems unable to shut down. At one moment it seems that these words turn into small ping pong balls that quickly emerge until your head is drained. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
