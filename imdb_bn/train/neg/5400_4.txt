This is a complete leakage festival based on the story of Stephen King. Two Tabloid journalists, one mother tongue (Miguel Ferrar) and one not complete (Julie Antiquel) believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Ms) might actually be a vampire. Strange and Strange Newborn In this modern day, the nervousness of naturally does not end in its way, but through a black session, he seeks his victims. The gore actually gets terrible as the film is near its stupid end. Remember that Mr. King did nothing to do with this film. I admit it's a bit bigger in the night hours.
