Leslie Sands 'Stylized' game "Dadlock" has become a poor favorite car for Bate Davies and Gary Merrill, after the joint success of "Eve Over Ever". After killing his wife, a scam woman meets her husband's best friend, who, after roaming in another's house, surrenders herself as her husband. One of the top managers of the Beat, Evving Roper, sadly is unable to raise this ridiculous element, which Davids oddly disobeys and humiliates to the end (where he has all the stops out). Production and support strictly throwing second rate; Just for Bat Davis completists. * **** to 1/2
