One of the worst movies I've seen is one. Painful action scenes and really did not help to perform badly. The only good aspect of Gary Bus is that it does not lift the film too much. It lives up to its B film ranking and passes the test with flying colors. Although my money is a waste, I get entertaining to start with a few watches that get annoying after. I do not offer this movie until you see it free or its gift. (A gift that you may want to receive and return for full refund). <br /> <br /> Honestly BA. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
