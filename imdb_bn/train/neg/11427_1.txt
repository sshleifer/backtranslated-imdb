I do not know the director of this movie Su Su Cromar, but I am quite convinced that he is a lesbian and b) he embarrassed everyone involved in this project to prove that he is not a hemophobic. <<br /> I think everyone thinks, "My God, it's horrible, not funny, pedestrian, completely hair." But they will be labeled as closed homosexuals for closing their mouths or they will not get the same sex life style. (For this reason, probably the Kramer did not go to play gay people.) However, it is worth noting. All of the actors are directed solely to play each scene so they have some sincerity or credibility. It's full of clich√©s and there is nothing about this movie which is at least bit fun - much less interesting. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Cruel to make money for this bomb was very bad for cruel people, and not fair to them.
