Carlito Way, The Origin is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who expects to leave his criminal past and therefore he deals with a club and the issues that come with him. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and knew that it was going to be bad ... but after dismissing the movie in the past and they found that they were cool (Lucky number Sleeveen, Tokyo Drift). I gave it a shot and it failed in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> The script comes with a teenager, if it is given five minutes to prepare ... it was weak weak dialogue It seems an immediate need for a gangster movie romance. So Brigeng decided to kill her for the girl ... and she says, yes! And if you want to do bad things, just throw racism ... as we can learn from 'Italian mobsters' ... <br /> <br /> Actually it was terrible to say ... I found 'Hollywood Nicky' , Sunny <br /> <br /> <br /> I hate these musicians in front of the movie. Come on p. D. This film was the only reason for the DD, so he could play a gangster ... Actress playing lectusia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak but we saw him ... that was right ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that Karito was finished in prison and how the love of his life was! And ultimately the killers have been added to the horror movie ... <br /> <br /> Carlisle Path: Get out of power ..
