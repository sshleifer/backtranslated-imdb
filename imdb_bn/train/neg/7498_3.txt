Spike Lee has had a fall since his initial success and there is nothing to help this mess. I look at my watch that the movie will end or reach the point. Lee's first movie with all the white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? Italians are curious and curious, but not with their wives? I wanted to see Scorsese, I would like to go to the Scorsese movie. Incredibly, the character of the hair godfather just adds stereotype. <br /> <br /> I appreciated some of Lee's films, especially "The Right Thing". This is a waste of time during the movie.
