Why is this show so popular? This is why people like it out of me. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I tried it once to see it and I can not make it through the whole episode. <br /> <br /> Acting for one is horrible. Everyone is overacting to the point where everyone is annoying to visit. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural sounds, and have unnatural body language. I saw good acting in a kindergarten school. <br /> <br /> Another thing, it's not fun. Plot lazy. They are not creative, intelligent, or drunk. Will not be a sitcom funny ?? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what is seventy about this? It was almost half as nearly as seventeen year-old "Happy Day". <br /> <br /> What is there with OH and Ashton Kutcher? Who throw this untalented dweeb? And now she's making movies ?? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is a quality television, it worries me.
