This movie is pure song. Mom always said if you can not say anything good ... but mother will say that I have to do my part to warn others of this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that Geoffrey Rush will just go away. I hope Greg Kinnar will take his agent out of a cannon to give the screen. This Ben Stiller is probably praying to kill someone "There's still something about Mary." I've always been a supporter of Wase Studi, thank you for any holiness that he wore a mask through film so that people did not recognize the movie with him. <br /> <br /> It starts with Stylistically explosion of Batman films cinematography and then just a few goes missing ... a coherent plot and half like decent effect <br /> <br /> <br / > The insects telegraph a few hours before the arrival of the insects and even they are flat. If you want to make an impact on the world of comic book, see "Chamming Amy". <br /> <br /> run! Do not run away from the "mysterious man"!
