I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 gems. That's a towel every 5 minutes. Seriously though, living proof that this film is alive evidence. If it is not broken, it does not require fixin. The serial killer, including a weak heroine, a hearty former police super gold heart and 'problem' from a street side. Pure magic
