I liked the book, "Jane Eyre" and saw many versions of it. All have their strong points and their faults. Anyway, I saw the worst one. I do not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsberg (Jane) was almost tolerant and certainly saw plain part, but he had no emotion in any of his lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in him. <br /> <br /> It brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hart had less emotions than Jane, if possible. How two wicked people who may fall in love are mysteries, but certainly could not hold my attention. Probably fell asleep while producing the director (Jeffrelli). <br/> <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (Very nice for Rochester!) Version is much more reliable than the book, but Sieron Hendes is perfect in Mr. Rochester 1997 / E (which is not true for the book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain's role was perfect.
