Dancing was probably only spectacular for this film - and even it was frustrating than some other films. My guaud! <br /> <br /> <br /> To me, this is the worst kind of movie - anyone who thinks this is a work of art because it has all kinds of film industry artwork. Yes, it has been nicely photographed, but eventually there is a lack of dancing and tension that surrounds the film itself. Tango is a lively, it's hot, it plays drama, it's disturbed - it's not exactly what the film is about.
