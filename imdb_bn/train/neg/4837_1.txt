I found this movie about what was the campaign, and how frustrating I was that 6 (?) Oscars and IDDB received 7.9 ratings on this day. [6] <br /> <br /> Bigelow really be the lucky director to win the best pictures and best direction and best direction for this kind of photo and why am I surprised? The totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb blast - did anyone understand the story that I failed? Why I got this emotional painting that this film was a remake of some of the old poor western movies about a cowboy by 'daring' wild wildlife infected by the 'bad' Red Indians; But this time it is set in a different background? Oskar was given to director James Cameron as the former director, and in the light of day, did it create a wonderful Underdog (GCP) story for TV shows? Or was it something like the emperor's cloison's syndrome - where most people realized that it was junk but just could not say because others did not say it aloud? <br /> <br /> And finally what is the sniper scene where they show shell casing drop in high-resolution-super-slow-mo such as a 'deep message' or something to publish? 'Some of the people of EOD suddenly create beautiful sniper and they will always get dirty terrorists'? Was I just what I felt that there are so many bits and fragments in the movie and have been released for some apparent reason? And can you get it for editing and managing Oscars? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not see it yet, do not waste your money on the ticket. Wait until they run it on TV for several years. You will not miss a lot.
