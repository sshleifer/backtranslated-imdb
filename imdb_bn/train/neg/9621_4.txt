I saw the ridiculous Matlabs poster and it should be the best ridiculous of all time, I was dying to see it once. What a brilliant idea for a mockery - the style is rife. Unfortunately, the finished product (I think that all probably seems involved) is a list of missed opportunities, not-most of the performance and (extremely grateful!) Some extremely ridiculous, inspired bits. Jenna Garafolo, who is very attractive, looks really bad here, perhaps she is struggling to make her flat role vulnerable. David Haid Pierce is just sad looking, trying hard to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon just became funny, her smile lets you laugh, but somehow her segment fails to snoop on anything violent. Paul Rud was the best teen method and was sexy as hell, the other guys are really funny (nerdier ones). I think the problem is that the director is not moving at the same speed as well. He started very deadpan, and set that monotone. But when they make things disrespectful (the drug series is, I'm the second funny moment in the film all year round, the first one is coming in a haircut: Andy and Martin complain about the film in and out), it's just fun. I wanted this movie to work so bad, but it's not right. Fabrics and Style 99.9% Perfect for 1981, and some songs used are also perfect. It has ended like a mid-bad MAD TV episode, which frustrates sketches beyond.
