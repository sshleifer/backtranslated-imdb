Raymond Boar has acted as an attorney for the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) because of his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). Before the start of Perry Mason, there was a whole year, so the film could be a reason for its fans if it was the inspiration for her casting. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else here, though interesting. Lansbury is always good, but here its character is very diminutive and the mystery of the mystery is completely obvious. Lamont Johnson is in love with "femme fatale" who has an attractive performance as a painter, but the Burr character is pretty straightforward. It is impossible to see an actor acting in this romantic scene with Lansbury, and his halling delivery does not match well with his character here, as I have seen him in most movies. This is not really a mystery and the mystery surrounding the title of the film is characterized by the character of the old and the lensby character of the old man (the double hindrance prevents him from trying again for real murder). She does so with a large tape recorder that she does not notice when she comes in the house. <br /> <br /> Some of them are probably funny moments and basically could do the rest. Television.
