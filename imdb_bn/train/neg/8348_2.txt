I just finished watching "El Otro". I've always picked up my hat in Julio Chavez's performance, because he's a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. Guess it's been worse if I was not for Julio. However, this is definitely a movie that you do not understand from Argentina but if you are, I would like to tell you not to rent this movie to spend a great time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and not much knowledge of the plot. Perhaps the director wanted to show the flexibility of human life, but what he does is influenced by the audience and the viewer with a view that gives you a little shock. It lets you think of something, but not well. Overall, I definitely did not like this movie.
