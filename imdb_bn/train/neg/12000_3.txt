The only possible way to enjoy this flicker is by pushing your head against the wall, giving some internal blood pressure, letting a bunch of your brain cells, and maybe you can enjoy this movie if you are mentally disturbed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of Rupu and Stefania was the only one. The role of Govinda cab driver was excellent and so was Brit girl. Perhaps if they had made a whole movie of their escape in India and how they finally fell in love, it would make more enjoyable films. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 3 rating is because Govida and her acting as actor when it comes to the comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor are vainly lost. The view in Plaster's Heathrow was too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the world of 9/11, Anil Kapoor himself shot himself before reaching the sky bridge for his true love :) But then again throw an egg from the point of view of film, logic, gravity, physics and * general * audience. <br /> <br /> See it in your own danger. At least I know I'm mad at life :(
