Author / Director Peter Greenway combines his title as High Lord of the House of Representation with his latest practice among his illogical selfishness, 8 ½ women. This movie follows the mutual search of rich English and her son on sexual satisfaction, as they can join the private collection of black women (estimating how many) concubines. Think of any possible way this compound can be objectionable, and the probability is that it is done in Greenway. Fetishes for the participation of two female leaders of the female character is a little more than a catalog. Kabuki-obsessed Mio, pregnant giaconda and berl, who got a thing for the animals in the farm. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she "half woman", get it? Greenway denies all accusations of catastrophic misogyny, but what if it is not? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -British (but less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillo Book. But The Pillow Book was loving and compelling, 8 ½ women just got horny and exploitative. Greenway's work is ineffective and arrogant in its idolatry, and the only person has the potential to enjoy it.
