The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially inspired by Hollywood) need to know - does not just sell 'styles'. During translation, I guess Tasane. Secondly, if you are cruel to selling styles, it will not prevent you from a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it is not slick. For example, three - Saif, Kareena and Akshya - narratives of various aspects of the story. But this setup is not used properly. Their narrations may have been a good mix and match. The order of the order is from seventeen. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of the film is awful. I think Lavivi Merchant is sleeping through this picture. There is a good score in the big show, but it does not belong to this picture. Why is the Sufi song (Dahanara) in Tashan? Shil Hinglish song why (the Dutch Murray in the heart) is not close to Anil Kapoor when he is mad in English? <br /> <br /> Please save this photo of Akshay Kumar. But he is his stereotyped self. You do not feel like missing this film.
