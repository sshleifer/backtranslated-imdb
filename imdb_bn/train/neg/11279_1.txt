Words can not really describe how bad this film is. I thought the janaldi was bad, but at least some nice shots and sometimes the good cold lips prevented them from pushing here. This is just ridiculous! Horror scripts, poor direction, horror acting and what do you know? I can not think of a single thing without it except that it is not too long about it. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, book yourself with a dentist and do some canary canals - a lot more enjoyable and better value for money (guess you need it!). Eventually, I need to type 10 lines to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. It's terrible!
