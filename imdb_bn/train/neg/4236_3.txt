Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and modern psycho delivery, the only thing to look for live performance is to watch it. Trauma, with half-hearted role as Lloyd Kaufman and the film's most silly death scenes, has a ton of tones and ton bands. Sound like it might be good, right? Well, death is coming, and repeatedly to the fans of the warp tour and fans of the event. Some start stylish stylish, but then they are repeated from the repeat point completely. Almost everyone dies in their head piece, or the intestines are pulled from their stomach. It sounds like Gore to be "Zombie 90: Extreme Fatality" by Andr√©s Sannas; This is a "water-drawn-type type blood", but now that movie is really worth it, and this humor is a subject that lacks this film. Sure, this movie has been made by Doug Saakman from Timo, it is very likely to budget, and it tries ... but it is very difficult. Everything is meant to be funny in this movie, and what brings it down. Deliberately bad acting, an excessive use of useless death, and doing the same thing ... using everything over and over is very ridiculous and trying to be stupid. It's basically "Mulva: Jabber's Ass-kicker", "Board Chairman", or any movie made with your friends: It's fun for those who made it, and it's about it. Possible, great idea, massive use of effects - but the same thing ... Over over: playing a band, killing the band, killing fans. Everyone died, the blood spread everywhere, the process was repeated. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
