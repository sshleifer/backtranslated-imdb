Well its official They just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely weird, but this one and the other became horrific. I mean that this story is about the brotherhood of two colleges who fight each other for his house, that is, I talk about a weak plot, the first three are becoming big, change and marriage, which are the appropriate aspects of the development of human society. <br /> <br /> The biggest stunt of the new Stefler, I try to compare myself with Steven Stefler but there is no cigar. I give this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best character of this movie is Jim's father, I do not know why he is doing this bad work.
