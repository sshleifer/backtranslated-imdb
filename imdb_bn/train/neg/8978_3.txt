If John Waters wrote "1000 Homes" after pointing to a heavy object repeatedly and then pointed it out, it would probably be something like "blood shed". It is gently entertaining for the first half-hour, but then it slides into a featureless glove of constant screaming and people do electric carnival knives, cutting and accessories to other people with jintalas. Susan Adriansen (Snow Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Lewis Bullion) is almost bad in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Most people do not take too much time to forget about this "blood shed".
