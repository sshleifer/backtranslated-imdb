I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess, I did not do it before watching TLB, and I want to say that I was surprised to see the average rating in IMDB. I have not found it in total lack of stories. You just fall in it (and sadly, Savings Private Ryan did not drop us in the movie), and it suddenly ended, which was very unhappy for me. <br /> <br /> To accept me, the injured soldiers looked quite real to me, especially in low budget. But prepare yourself to laugh ... Some people are dragged into the air after the explosion as if they were Olympic zodiac. A moderate corkscrew or somersault in the middle of the WWW is very much for me, especially when it takes a lot of time in the movie ... <br /> <br /> I was almost laughing at the parts that laugh at me, I was almost laughing Was there. The voice is shouting the German voice ... incredible fun. It seems that they seem to be spoken by singer actors / voice performers because they all hear the same word and it seems to be a 'general' German voice. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this film to anyone, except for those who want to laugh because of just sad and pure values.
