I was released at the age of about 7 years. It was broadcast in the UK for a few weeks in the UK in the summer of 1977, as it was some incredible blockbuster movie. This is the first movie I actually saw in a movie, and I was going for a few years. The following week I was invited to see and invite new movie "Star Wars". I have not seen this so far in protest of showing the Saskatche! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could say I saw garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost incredible. The annoying nonsense that it does not have to be a movie. I was glad to read this many years later that the director never again guessed, just as I am concerned. Avoid All Costs !!!
