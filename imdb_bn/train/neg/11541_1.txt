This movie is the worst in the past 5 years. It is astonishing that bright actors like the two main characters of this movie have taken the trash to work with this priceless silence. The film is about rape / assault and revenge type. The couple left the party and on the way they hit a deer and came to a zip full of bad guys when he went to finish it. He did not go to the car, instead he was beaten to death and he was trying to drive and gang raped him. Still he is in his father's house and is a neighbor among the bad guys so he took the shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario! Hollywood cousin! He was against the vengeance but "he is raped" "They smile at him" so he can kill them all ... But once inside the house he was pleased with pushing Raffel's top leaders to the top of the ass and went mad and execute bad guys. Personally I think the director has finished financing before finishing it because the reason behind the gang-rape and death of anyone involved in the rebellion is due to the end of the film, which the sponsors apparently saw it and wanted to refund their money. LoL This movie is not only for people who enjoy the scene of rape, because they can not see what they are looking for ... this director should be banned ... This peace of crossing has been created by British cinematography. I personally liked and because of that I saw it. Do not make yourself the best thing that you're watching it in a movie that's a messy scenario ...
