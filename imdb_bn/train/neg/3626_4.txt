I do not know what Oscar voters saw in this movie, but to get the award for Oscar's best picture, there are some tough stuff to show in it. I know that fortunately Gin Kelly can play at it or I believe it was twice bad. After all, I do not think Leslie could actually have played such a role. He is not that talented, he is not a great dancer and he is not good looking at all. It is embarrassing that an actor or actress can destroy a movie like this because Leslie does not have it if it does not make it a great movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying these things about Leslie Cause, just to criticize him, I'm just saying this because I think the movie is bad. He is probably a good actress but I can not say because I did not see him at all but I think he was quite bad in "an American in Paris" So if you want to see it, but go ahead but I'm telling you, good way to stop watching "Singin" in the rain.
