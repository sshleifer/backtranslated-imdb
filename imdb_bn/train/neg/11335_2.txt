I recently seen Bell Appococcus, it might look great because it won Oscars for the best foreign language film. I was somewhat disappointed by the film's prediction and simplicity. Maybe there was a contradiction in my film that since the filming of today, the plot of the fallen man for a beautiful woman and finally the good girl has fallen. In addition to the plot forecasts, some scenes from the movie really feel from the place with a story (where a particular event for a wedding). Sometimes the film was somewhat promotional in its ideas and the film was established with the French era and the church was set up. The film was only going for it, cutesy moments, visibility, and Violeta's character was a powerful, independent woman's time when women were not really associated with those features.
