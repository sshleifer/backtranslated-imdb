Here is one of these educational small films made to learn unknown people about life events. This time the target audience is the old girls, the true menstruation of life is. This animated movie, created by Walt Disney Pictures, is clearly sponsored by Kotak. <br /> <br /> It starts by explaining how hormones increase and develop. With the help of an animation and a female narrator, it shows us how the body works, especially the ovaries, the uterus and cells, and why it turns into all seasons. It's almost amazing, it's becoming a comic note, how to avoid sex issues. Even though the term is not mentioned, "furtilized" will pass once. I do not really know why I saw it, but it's a rare small film that you can try it out of a film that can give you an impression of time.
