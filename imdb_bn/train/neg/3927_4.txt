A common horror story about a luxurious building in Brooklyn that hides the doors of Hell. It is a memorable memoir of Polanski's "The Tenant" ("Sentinel" released a year earlier), but it is far from possible in any direction from the filmmaker's movie. The "mercenary" was so annoying, where "no saninn". What is more amazing than this picture is: It is a great name for American movies (Burgess, Gardner), Wallach), experienced actors acting for food (I guess). <br /> <br />: Very rarely amusement <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
