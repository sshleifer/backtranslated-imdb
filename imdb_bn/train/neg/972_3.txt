This was a frustrating horror movie about a graduate young girl and her nightmare. For a scary or "thriller" movie and campaign, this is a very shameful way. There are only a few moments of time, as far as this film should not be as close to. Even those "black" scenes were not so much. The music made them even more dramatic. They were really. <br /> <br /> There are many symbols here, so elitist critics label this "Awesome movie of thinking people". Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion - the waste of money in video rental stores. <br /> <br /> Overview: A young man who gives lead letters unlike and usually plays poor. Extremely overrated and of course it is not advertised.
