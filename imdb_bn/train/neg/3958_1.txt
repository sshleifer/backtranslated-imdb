I will not waste this whole time because I'm worried about it, it does not really start with a film, the striking fashions of the footage and shamefully amateur new footage has been created for the whole mess and it is a "Boogeyman" seagull call. Literally 80% of this movie has been stolen from his best predecessor "The Bugmanman", a film that is not annoyed by this junk writers apparently because they are so well known to actress Susanna Love's original character (Lacey). And insulting to kill the killer, invisible scenes of the actual footage and visible in new footage, apparently they think their audiences are as stupid as possible. 0 out of 10 and I hope the IMDB ratings system is low, the most ruthless and intelligent effort to stop the people I saw even have been warned!
