When I saw the preview of this movie, I did not want to start anything - a second-rate teen is nearing a horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely terrible. And that's being generous. <br /> <br /> First, the cast for the movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy for the characters (or for any ill feeling). The acting was so horrible that I was just waiting and hoped to finish the horror of God. <br /> <br /> In the movie there are some points that were not fully related to a plot. Can anyone please explain to me why the girls' son started screaming "Pancakes !!!" When I went to Jackie Chan, I never saw him on top of his lungs, even more that the virus is getting bitter? Why is the child's father angry with the infected person, and goes to a Redcoach hunting screen to find him? I gave the feeling of such confusion and complete disbelief that I literally lamented, "Where did the hell come from?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I saw. I thought I saw some bad movies, but I have to say that the cabin faware puts them all on top. This movie wants to mute me and then puke again. Then blow up my brain. <br /> <br /> Please save yourself one and a half hours and make some more fruitful. Grass growth is likely, a correct option.
