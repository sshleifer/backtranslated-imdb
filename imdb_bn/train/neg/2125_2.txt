If I was not forced to watch it for work, I could never have done it 10 minutes earlier. Even then I admit I fast forward through the part. The '63 film version was very high in all cases. Yes, I was more faithful to this original play, but it was so intelligent to change the author to '63 '! It overlong, it drags, this version and that movie's version of the song is not annoying and unimaginative. The "kids" version in '63 'version is a really cool and funny genre of classical maternal humor. Kim is very old in this version, Conrad * absolutely awesome * (I hate when someone shuts off his shirt ... the director of this version does not know what's sexy.) This conrad can not dance, can not sing (it can not be in harmony) and it is simply boring. If Elvis Presley really ended up before the start of his career, that was. For other actors, well I waited for Alexander's hat to dance and Dali was acting like a mommy completely. See Stapleton's performance in the film version that shows the same ruthlessly brutally, who understands comic timing. There is total waste of this TV version but somebody else's time.
