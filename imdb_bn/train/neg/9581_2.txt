The only thing that can be positive for me to say about this movie. Cleveland star, I was there and did not see the city well. Beautiful river and city-like. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving so fast that they hope that you will not notice the lack of real world relevance. Gun shooting without running and any result of the people. For example, there is a shot out in Rob Loyer's house - two cars have been stolen, and so far the police are not seen in the movie for a long time. Murder for rent never seems impossible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote this movie must have an acceptable end of the legacy bulky bullets. Many actors in this movie are much better than this. To check that the author did not write during the strike, I checked the date of this movie, but in this case it was not. This movie is currently rolling out to the Universal HD channel - unless you want to load more than that, there is no reason to see it.
