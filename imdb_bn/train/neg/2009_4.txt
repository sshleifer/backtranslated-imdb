This is not a completely bad movie. The plot (the new room created after the next door seems frustrating) is not bad, the mood is quite vague and it's okay. My biggest problem was that Lara was familiar with Flin Boil (from twin pix and other shows), how I look differently with her new, big lip. I kept looking at them. Look so they find the place in her face! They make her look quite different (and not good). <br /> <br /> Actor Mark-Paul Goselle, who played the role of Keam and entered his heart and soul into the house, did a good job. And Lara (as Corn) is also pretty good as a home owner (but that lip!). Her husband, Waikar (Colin Ferguson) is well-wooded. Different characters living in the house were also fine. I especially like (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Body (Stephen Amel), the first man entered the house. The attempts to involve us in the surrounding Vibes failed, unfortunately, other neighbors are not particularly interested. <br /> <br /> For some reasons the director was not particularly unhappy about the "hateful" room. Other movies (like Amityville Horror, Hill House of the Legend) manage to achieve this wonderful feeling, but it does not happen here. When colon draws an image of a house, <br /> <br /> Another thing that does not work for me is that the plot twist with architect Kumar Initially, he was a victim of another house (it has dried up his inspiration), but afterwards he seems to have joined forces with him. <br /> <br /> Overall bad movie for awesome fans if you can take your eyes off those big beaks!
