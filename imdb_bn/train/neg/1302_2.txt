This movie is like all other Dutch movies, so if you enjoyed the movie as Turkey Fruit and De Klein Blonde Dood. Then you may agree with it (although they have two good stories and actors) Jomeri started strong enough, but even a good scene has nothing to do with the story. There are many nudity (but my and others simply did not seem to be attractive to the girl), the dialog is ridiculous (as we've done a lot for the frustration of other movie observers), and some scenes are so completely random that it is more of an unexpected comedy than any other (e.g. A random scene in which an owl looks at someone ... there is nothing to do with it But only in one sentence it is said, "You heard what you heard ... I was there"). The only reason I gave it a 2 because some places they look pretty ... that's it. And because I saw it because we went sneak past (here we have strange systems related to our surveillance preview, you pay less for regular movies and you never know which movie you will be watching. You know that this is a new movie which is not yet in the theater. ). My suggestion is to stay far away from this movie, if you really want to see a good Dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek
