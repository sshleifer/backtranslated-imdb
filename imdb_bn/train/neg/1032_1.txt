Although I was not a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (ever because of its terrible production value), it is similar to Shakespeare compared to the shield that comes to us by Hacker-Barber! Without any doubt, about the most annoying and awful character (and includes Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm) for scrapbook-do children. Which brilliant idea is able to create some sort of mutant dog and talk with it, and cut the scuba-Doo character with it? Anyone who wants to die or die (I think death is comparable). The bottom line is that the little dog holes only on helpless, annoying and nervous - and it is only in the best episode !! After many years, it would have been better to finish the franchise than to create this mess! I can see why they created villain scrapbooks in the live-action skubo-du movie - since everyone really hates him!
