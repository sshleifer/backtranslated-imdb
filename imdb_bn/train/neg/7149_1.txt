Anyone who wrote a car called "Car Redline" should definitely pay from Daniel Sadek, this supernatural fire arson, to increase the vapor of amateur hair. Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. These shows let people look like citizens. <br /> <br /> Take an 80-second action TV series with each chassis clich√©, keep some really vague special effects and haircuts without any relevance, and you have live proof that Daniel Saddake should not write screenplays and make movies Should be in real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is a long march movie such as long plots and sometimes the sequence of the most transformed steps. My objection is that the makers of this film are not stupid, but they consider this film to be enough silly for this shit to the public.
