<br /> <br /> Jimmy is a call center and one day he invites Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Laxman Singh, English. . Two fellows fall in love and decide to flee, but worship tells Jimmy that he lends to Lakhan Singh, because he is also known as Bhaiyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and find Jimmy that Guy / Lekhi Singh is a don. In the meantime, a man, kidnapped by Pandya, for tracking the hostage and worship. <br /> <br /> Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar are the first directors of the film, produced by Va Krishna Acharya and both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Tasan" should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yes! The scene is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her many publicized weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely slim on the story and sometimes does not feel any other concept from one scene - so at the beginning I said that I was more than expected from this movie because it was a success in production. In reference to the song, unfortunately, there is no single song that I can remember now. <br /> <br /> At the moment where anyone can laugh and thanks mainly to Akshay Kumar and Saif, Kareena did well when Kapoor performed well. But it can not be said for Anil Kapoor - it was not on his side like a villain. Finally, Aditya Chopra never thought that, in the past, "Mohabbatin" has created and directed good movies, what is Yash Chopra doing to create a trash movie? Conclusion: Bad movie does not waste your time, and this is my first and last impression.
