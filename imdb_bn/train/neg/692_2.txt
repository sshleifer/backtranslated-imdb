One of the first slashers to appear in the early eighteenth century, the fame is notable for its primary functionality only in Daphne JÃºniga (The sure thing, the fly2); His character died roughly quicker, and the rest of the film was completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteered to clean a decorated college building in his furniture. A crazy killer, however, threw a Spanish into the work by combining young young people in different ways. <br /> <br /> Exploring each stock 'n' slash clicht, the director Jeffrey O'Broro had an impressive and unexpected horror that was praying for me to pray for letters, so that I looked a little better. Most of the deaths (which are to be confronted, why we usually see such films) are not short; The only real horror image comes when the victim's body is discovered by the rest of the survivors (there is a significantly bloody dead body ?? this film can do more). <br /> <br /> At the last moment, the film protects me from the humiliation of getting the lowest possible score from me, unexpectedly until the end, but it is only one of slash fulfillments.
