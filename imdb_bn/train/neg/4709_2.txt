Cartoon Network looks frustrating for the rating. With the abolition of Samurai Jack, the networks were reduced by the popular programs, such as PowerPop Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragon Z. etc. When ratings start to diminish, CN has some nice medium shows Although there is a total drama island / action and chowder standing in response to their dramatic writing and audience-delighting gimmicks, many shows show that the awesome remix (George George) or the other show off of the show, such as The Marvelous Mississaugurus Flapjack, where the title character works like Spongbb , And then Johnny Test, which is something to replace Dexter's laboratory, This chip is more than a mere raison d'than io. <br /> <br /> The characters of the show evidently originate from Dexter's lab, only this time there is a focus on the june, the character of a blond (or flaming hair) that makes her eldest sister Susan and Mary painful, who are like orange, only Looks like orange. Glasses, impossible technology Bling Bling Boy or Eugene has a competitor talent, who seems to be sitting for Mandar. Then Ducci, Johnny's best friend and talking dog, one of the drawers ... I mean, Susan and Mary's primary examination. <br /> <br /> Dexter's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television, its simple, but effective art style, lovable main character, and episode that does not seem to be a long drag. Johnny Test is very different. The art style here is not nearly as interesting as it is. Actually, it looks absolutely terrible. The characters have motivation to make them really annoying or repulsive. Like most of the series, Zuni and the neighboring daughter of Dookie, like CC, who likes Johnny secretly, or force the boy's next son. These two men looked at the appearance of jeans that Johnny is looking at someone who you do not want to ever add, there is no real connection between visitors and characters. <br /> <br /> One series is heavily exploited in her name that Susan and Mary's Guine Pig, for their exams, This range from Johnny's fat, ugly, monster, and even turning into a woman. Then Junior helps Johnny in any project in the plan to return for its services. Whenever such a part of the "Joy / Joy" contract involves it generally seems to come in the east and those who are not completely closed never end up satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Writing is awesome, however. The 'fat' episode continually repeats "It's fat with pH. There is a difference, you know." Which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when this episode seems to provoke obesity, Johnny is becoming a famous star with money and video cameras. <br /> <br /> Let's discuss how the program is going on. Do not completely close the Dexter's Lab. This exhibition has won many characters, from two men-in-black to Mr. Black and Mr. White, a military general, who seemed to solve all his problems with Johnny and his sister and many solutions to Super Bridges, even though here again Steals ideas for other sources, such as Mr. Freeze teenage clone, a Cat Cat with Beatler, who rule over cats Wants to (such as the bad paoyarapapha Girls talking like a cat), is a fool intelligent mastermind, a trio of evil skyatarera 'dyudasa and even a Mole Man, which is probably the most klica villains in the media. In addition to the ugly animations and unlike characters of the <br /> <br />, voice acting is either a passable (like voice for Mr. Black and Mr. White) only general angle-split (Johnny, Ducci and only on the show) Each villain). The theme song seems to be the only compelling thing of this show, but it was repeated with only a few episodes of the band, which simply ruined it. <br /> <br /> So in the end, Johnny Test is not good cartoon Its horrific reference to teen culture, and the jokes show will reduce the interest of little children, while pulling its bright colors, leakage letters, and episodes to break thirteen experience. Cartoon Network is one of the most unexpected shows to run its campaign to cheat people (like on MPV rap) to see it. If you need a ceremony that will satisfy your children half-hour, you will be well on Spongebob, because the test of the test is more than the "test" of another kind of patience.
