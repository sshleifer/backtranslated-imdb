Harry Harrison, a young scientist, is pursuing his late father's scientific research in the resurrection of posturing with flying colors, but mother and his doctor lover are influenced by her intervention, wanting to sell Semam. When he finds out, Harry has an accident involving losing a hand. So, he tries to do the symmetry and the genetically weak arm which has its own mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it before OH long, but this camp took away and the performance of quite a shonky junk movie Icon Elke Sommer and Oliver Reid on Sunday. Actually it is not a bad flash by fengroon movies; There are better ones just there, which is similar to vein. The "maximum relationship" simply lacks its own distinct style. Similar to the strange nature and unexpected splatter "re-animator" and even a touch of slapstick stuck like something from even "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The story of the trick is really pumped out with black humor, but it can get a bit of melodramatic and dry in fun factor. The surprise is not the final result of cropped up, especially the flick. Which was well accepted, I thought it could make something more accessible. FX makeup can look rugged and very stupid for low budget production, but some great moments that will enable you to laugh at crunching. Even streamlined a brush story of sex tension, thanks to L. K. Sommer's strictly mother's opinion. Oliver Reid is a humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off pretty well. They were extremely aloof both as loved as the couple you loved. Billy Morrisette as Harry is delighted with an uncertain performance. Director Damon Santostifano grabs the film with astonishingly and archives it in secret and pompous horror some stylish scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes it's a teenager and basically stupid, but you have given it a handful for some unusual amusement.
