I am a big fan of Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe that he made this movie. I was really upset <br /> <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma does not come anywhere in the original Shola. It does not leave a lasting impression on a visitor. Ram Gopal failed to make chemistry between Verma characters. There is no cameroon between Hero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). The frame together has no view with two people at the same time. Outside the court with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal, the trend is extraordinary. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this film. Ajay and Sushmita Sen were the best efforts but there was no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - is ineffective and rather meaningless. Mohanlal completed the trial and again proved that acting is the facial expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. In this film, the comedy situation from the original Sholay is flat. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal could work in Verma script, but he became mad because of controversial controversy around the movie that he created this AAG. But there is no fire.
