While some performances were good-Victoria Royale, Adrian Barbou, and two Italian friends think-the story was long and derivative, the emphasis on girlfriend's ethnic background was very good, and most of the relatives were portrayed as stereotype, not as real people. I got uncomfortable wincing on many moments that were supposed to be fun. I rarely understand why this local paper was a good film, and was surprised that the WMO posted an enlightened review in IMDB. This film is very frustrating, and crazy I actually went to a theater to see it, based on the faulty connection of the Garden State, which is much more fun than it, more inventive and sensitive movies. I especially should mention the psychological measurements of the church, which is very structured and almost the number I was left with, and some viewers actually did DID That cemetery was followed by a stupid measure, which I saw it happened 10 minutes coming. I really do not like being misled to spend my money in vain.
