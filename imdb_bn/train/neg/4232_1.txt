Carl Jr. and his father are now running an army on a remote island. Capture a Trio Trio of the boys who stumble on the island. After a while who fought. (Survival well) This blood, gore, and killings can not be stopped, if any of it looks at a distant position, or if the product does not seem to have been made, it was made with a more reserved luncheon week. Money (I might be overexxagerating. It was probably just a few days worth). The terrible dubbing did not bother me so much and I suspect when I really get drunk, some may have been a little ridiculous .... maybe maybe. But, like the 78th minute, the film still feels a long way. Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Epidemic"; And other Shank-o-Rama trailers are released
