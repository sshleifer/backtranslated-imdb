I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. I have heard and hope that my expectations for the film are being made. Some days I want to see some sights and I'll be frustrated for some time. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the kind, I was hoping for this movie but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movies of Richard Donner, sometimes I did not like the nature of the Campi nature or the character of Superman and its power changes. <br /> <br /> Although singers keep the worst elements of Donner's movies and their version <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is no longer intelligent. Kevin Spacy has done his best to play Luther well, but eventually he is caught in ornamental writing and strangers conversations. <br /> <br /> Her trick is twice as much than comic book. Most of them have no conversations in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Spinner Ahead **** KI KULSKEKA is about the same character, Mrs. Tesemmer. He feels like Lex Luther's evil and cold, but he is proven to be just an excitant who suffers from a problem and suprically believes in Luther. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for the movie is Frank Lange Perey White. I'm not a great fan of Perry White at the top of Donner's film, but at least he had his soul. She said after all and done, an experienced reporter who cared for the truth and a good story. Langley's Perry White is nothing but a corporate studio. All of them want to concentrate on Superman related stories because they are doing the same thing on all other papers even though they sell papers. He is not really concerned about the real story, the mystery of the black mystery, and now he is out of lex Luther's prison. <br /> <br /> Some actors may be calm and confident and still have an undercurrent that tells you that the deep still Run the water. Frank lagla crazy. <br /> <br /> Brandon Roth is not bad actor. She's OK but again there's a memorable line in the whole movie. Not the actor's fault. His movement is clearly meant to be orderly appearance, even with the slightest movement of his fingers as he flies. But it still shows choreography and artificial. <br /> <br /> While Lewis Lane was badly written, Wonderfully played by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again as the Poliszer Award winning journalist and writer, he has been spoken as a teenager of Dawson Creek. <br /> <br /> James Merceden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, because in most cases he could see even Superman than Routh. Without a director general, he managed to find out the message of Lois Lane, an airplane flew for the position, took the looter's yacht and rescued Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The only ongoing moment when the movie is flooding and ships sinking with all empty pantry water. You see them slowly being submerged in water. You know that at the last moment, Superman will come for their rescue but you still can not help them, but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> I said the plot was very dangerous. As opposed to the singer, it is not a movie about a superhero return and trying to find its place in the world. As soon as he returns to the world he welcomes him back with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him. Even Luther was pleased to bring Superman back because it gives him the opportunity to make a score with a steel guy. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the most cruel heroes of the universe. A large green piece, which came out of Light Luther Jail, has been stolen from the museum, now he has knowledge of Superman's strengths and weaknesses, and he can still not attach enough points that he can learn using the cryptite against the lotter. According to the movie, the only thing for Superman is really good, really heavy stuff. The sequence of actions is all incredibly predictable.
