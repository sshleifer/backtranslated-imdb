I have seen this movie getting so much trouble downloading fast. And I would say, it was not worth it. <br /> <br /> Purda was so excited that I was really looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another good Indian filmmaker failed to meet the set standards It was more unfortunate that the story was not original, it was rarely based on the classic "On Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was getting boring, especially when he came from America. In the direction of the direction, the quality of the side was very low. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I'm not saying Purda was bad. It was not good enough.
