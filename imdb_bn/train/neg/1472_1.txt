I am completely surprised to show the movie's rating of 5.2 / 10 which has affected me, it is definitely one of my worst films and I am still wondering why I finally saw it. Firstly, the plot is completely hopeless, and the acting is really awful. I think Susan Lukey and the role of a completely unknown actress was good. Regarding the race for Mr. Camer Dell, I think it was a good choice for him to be in the "Valley of Dolls". Collectively, the total waste of time (and I'm trying to be modest ...) to avoid any costs. My rating is 1 and I still think of paying good, but we can not give it to him.
