You only see this movie cover but it's cool. No The movie itself lets me sleep. It was slowly, a poor use of short violence and suspicion. The acting was below feeder material and plot, it can be cool for a different movie, here is shown badly. They even kill the only funny character in the whole picture! I gave it 2 out of 10 because the only good thing was the plot at the end. Otherwise, you can save yourself from this movie trash.
