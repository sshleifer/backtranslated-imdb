I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to this. I was excited by the technology of pre-promotional enterprise, its rough-ended submarine styling and rough technology technology compared to tracks. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything that is interesting pilot. <br/> <br /> I will admit that I liked something like the development of character - that people were portrayed as a 'teen' species ready to enhance their adult age. And <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ li> <br /> </ br> 3/10
