The war scene was great. Love the old and new ceylon and how they paint beside them. It's the end that I hated. I was disappointed that the world was 150 million years ago. But just to start the journey? Are you kidding me 38k people who fought for their very existence and once they reached Paradise, they abandoned technology? No way. Of course they were eating paper and rationing food, but that ended. They can reside like humans again. They only have a good doctor. Nobody thinks his birthday does not hurt the toothache ... yes okay. Nobody likes that.
