Where to start? Special effects should be marked as special errors, when the director shouted "actions" I guess they acted to perform the worst action they performed. Perhaps he is annoyed with the producers and is sure that they will not recover more than a percentage of their investment and this work will be a case study case for not making the film. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not give him up. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br />
