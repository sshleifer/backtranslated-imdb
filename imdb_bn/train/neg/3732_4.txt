Perhaps when I was young, innocent and intelligent when I saw it, this movie had a lot of sleeping night for me. I did not see this as I was in seventh class at Presbyterian School, so I'm not sure I have any effect now. Anyway, I would say it has an impression on me ... and most of my friends. It served our purpose, at least until we were mature enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly afraid that the stranger-post-fascinating Christians had to endure when they did not accept the mark. I do not want to hide the movie for those who did not see this scene, so do not describe the details of the scene, but I can still take pictures on their heads ... and it's been 19 years.
