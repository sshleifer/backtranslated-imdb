Yes, this is a direct quote from the film and I think it is quite right. I was bored dead with this vain attempt. After the first 20 minutes, there is no sensation of all the flash-bad movies, etc. If you are harmful, then you have died at least five times. Of course, fans of David Lynch will pick up a flag for Turkey like this "the best movie ever made" because it does not make sense and when it does not make any sense it can be art and art film is always good. Right? I'm wrong. The art of artificial art is just a repressive way to try to show you artificial filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins should act as a wonderful actor.
