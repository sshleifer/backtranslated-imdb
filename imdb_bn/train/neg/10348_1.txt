I found that they made movies from my favorite book. I did not understand it was too late until it was Disney. I was frightened by many of the important parts of the story. This is a novel by which the movie is made from the fourth grade book report. Mega was good at school and her or her father did not wear glasses. Mrs. Murray (Mega Mama) was not depicted as a scientist; They left his kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the Internet. And that's just starting. Through half of the movie I shouted myself on the screen, that the disappointment of others who were frustrated could not be read in this book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who did not read the book, this film is OK.
