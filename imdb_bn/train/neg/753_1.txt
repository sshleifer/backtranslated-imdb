Wow ... <br /> <br /> I saved it after reading it online at the local Wal-Mart that it was released. I followed this online for a while, and only had to buy the picture. <br /> <br /> Wow! <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that really hurt me that was editing, or its lack. Time and again, the characters are shown walking (usually the narrator and he with anyone) ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know that you can cut at a point point to reach the point. There is no need to show the whole journey! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I'm feeling really sorry for the actors involved. It seemed that no directive was made about what should be done in other scenes without a terrific appearance or a happy look, depending on what steps were added next. <br /> <br /> Wow! <br/> Why it is my decision to use almost all the effects of using CGI Even ILM still recruited miniatures sometimes. The most confusing use of the green screen of this movie is the constant movement of the same group (according to the last credits) representing the citizenship of various cities and cities, including London. Occasionally these people are coming and without any relation of distance from the shot or camera or camera. At one shot in London, at least two men have six feet long walk behind the story's brother (star Anthony Piano played without his busy mosquito). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is a turkey, plain And easy. On the plus side (at least for me) it has supplied some truly humorous bizarre bits which I have seen several times.
