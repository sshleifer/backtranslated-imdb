This was my first, and probably last Angelopoulos movie. I was interested in it, because it was my favorite actor Mastriani, and a movie called Theo, of which I heard a lot. The promise was open, a long shot on a zip of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! But that was all that was. Nothing left The movie had big holes and I did not know first to mention. The original plot of the story has revealed to old women journalists. A long walk time. This old lady is telling a story, it's not going to happen on screen for 15 minutes, like killing a worker, and patient's patience, 15 or even 20 minutes. All that is shown through the action is supposed, the camera by the old lady is simply called. At one moment, the television radio was moving to the bar. They turned to the corner and immediately started in the winter! Probably, the shots on different days, continuation leaks. There are many problems with the storytelling, it does not stack with an unreasonable style of unreasonable, asking viewers with questions that have never been answered. Poor Mastroianni, given a role which lacks honesty or charm. On the other hand, many Greek or Albanians or young people agree, movies have shown only historically, ethnic, or politically incorrect mistakes in making a movie about "humanity" as red in another review. There is a lot to say, but there is no time to lose in a poor movie, which was not a movie, but money was provided by the lover and state money influenced by the film's influence.
