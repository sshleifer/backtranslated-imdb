Prior to the celebration, Mrs. Dresler returned the bank's kingdom to her son in her small town, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank ties, and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster is able to stay alive, because of Mother Dresler's intelligent planning. However, Miss Meran is worried about his fate, and with a loud claim to a complete withdrawal. Other "Warren Bank" customers hear hear the rant of dead and start questioning their own transparency. Soon, in the family financial crisis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dresler's 1931 hits, "Decrease" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; And, Douglas became the # 1 box office star of 1932, according to the industry standard catalog collected by Quigley Publishing.
