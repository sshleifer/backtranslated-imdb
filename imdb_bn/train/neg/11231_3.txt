I love low budget independent films and I had high hopes for that. But this image is static. Never think of the value of production, which is very advanced for its budget, but pacing is deadly. Of course these people have achieved a lot, but the film fails on the most basic level. It's annoying. Glaciers and pacing stalls It will be 65 minutes. Dr. The best thing about Jakeel is Mr. Hyde who has not seen enough. He had the most dramatic possibilities. Instead we will have to suffer through dithering Baltimorean-Bright Stammer through endless and tedious expositions. It's like playing a backwaters staged in the video. <br /> <br /> Every effort is made by everyone, but a tired story that needs a stick in the pants and the new budget technology should be renewed. Instead it's just a cripple retread.
