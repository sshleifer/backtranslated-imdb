As a horror fan we all know that blind cones are a cone shoot. Sometimes we find a real jewel, but many times we find that the money we have acquired is nothing more than spending our hard working money, which is far worse than the unreasonable revival reviews and film festival awards listed in the box. Eyes of the Eyes of the Eyes (This title I am sure is a dual entrepreneur talking about a movie budget and anyone who is obliged to see it, can use all five fingers in the eye of their eyes). <br /> <br /> Story, or at least, * Ahmme * A writer thinks that the center of a young girls, who passed the game for a while, who decided to go out in the night with joy and arrogance after delaying the football game. A crazy woman who punishes them with punishment as punishment for a cat and mouse after a fender-bender at the gas station parking lot in the car with them. <br /> <br /> Justify, it's a fun idea. Some of the best scares are very simple story lines. This idea is flat that it is executed five across the eyes. The film strives to make a cross between Blair Witch Project and a cross between the Chanso massacre of Texas, which does not reach the object in its minimal bone, but it does not. Instead of what we get crazy, torture, and unexpected scenes of release; Continuous chatter, moaning, and retreating gambling, for the continuous continuation of the Liberation War, for 94 minutes, works like a lot of padding in cross-sequence. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is incredibly grain and dark, which can improve a well-made film and improve realism. Here it is just boring. Characters have been adopted and viewers are under a lot of pressure to find something sympathetic to them. One character prevents the primary medical kit and has some scraps on his face, when a gun is heard in the background that his friends may be killed. Another girl ridiculed the girls with a ridiculous silly line, "Do not get out of there, she will catch you, if she finds you, she will kill you, and if she kills you, then you will die." <br /> <br /> Fangoria magazine and a testimonial from Dreadcentral.com were listed in the box which forced me to check this out. Talk about a fake orgasm! Perhaps this was in my comedy section that my expectations were met. I'm all for a low budget indie harrow but this one takes whip-cake. Give five eyes (or fate; it?) A pass <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
