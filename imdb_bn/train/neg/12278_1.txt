If you watch this show you are not sure whether it is story or acting which is more annoying. Above all, the story of each episode is very predictable, the authors must be able to use every horoscope, you can not just guess the general plot, but you can arrange the layout of the scenes and the lines of each character somewhat. There's a collage of each police series. At the top of it all the "message" of the show comes, which is good and bad is bad and that will win the good at the end of the day and we love each other, be good people and good citizens, done in the most spectacular manner. The actor will use a limited set of vehicles, and not a few of these messages, the limited set of performance skills: "I'm a good carrier" smile, the corresponding look and "gesture of victory" are the body's gestures. Bad boys "I have a bad" and "You catch me" look, "I'm going to society for nothing better and I should move to society" Head Banding (Such sums up also general development of each show). True story or not, show garbage, another proof that the producer ** does not ** give ** about the audience, we all think stupid. Well this series makes every possible effort towards living brain stupidity outside of you.
