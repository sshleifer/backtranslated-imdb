See the scene where a group of script writers will sit around a table and someone will say, "A black woman in the street allows a public (even black) to come to a vague member and ask him if he is black, then go away." Other writers do not smile laughably until they repeat it in each episode. More smiles. Now if you think the premiere is fun, and there are so many situations in the show, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your blur and look for something more enjoyable to see the paint dry. Those who wrote the thrilling report of this show should be really happy to get more or watch television comedies. Another example of laughter in the sounds, a girl tries to pay cash at the checkout at the checkout, trying to make cash. It's fun for the first time in the margin, but why repeat over different programs with different cashiers? I could give other examples but this can only be regarded as spoiler, why this comedy is not just funny.
