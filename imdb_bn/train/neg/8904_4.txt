I personally liked 1995's many "predictions". Christopher Waken was always great and even though the film was not shameless, it was a vague and extremely original horror / fantasy film that was very entertaining. This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. According to Wacken, one of the greatest actors around, and he is again outstanding in the role of the Fallen General Secretary Gabriel, whom he played second time. Again, the war between fallen and devoted Angels was brought to the world. Gabriel returned for the intervention of the angel Daniel (Russell Wang) and the birth of the child of the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Bels). This child can once be the determinant factor of the heavenly war ... As I said, Christopher Wachen is again as nice as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, "Prophecy 2" included a bunch of sadly boring characters. Valerie's character was annoying enough, and Danayel even bothered me. The biggest pain in the ass, but the character of Izzi (played by Britishers Murphy), a suicidal girl who did not remain silent. Yet, Walken's performance is not the only release quality of the movie. The whole film is a good shot in a very slow and dark color, which contributes to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurgence scene at the beginning is quite impressive and one of the best moments for "prediction" movies. "Predicting second" is still the weakest of three "prediction" movies with Wayne. Certainly a Christopher is a one-show, entertainer, but nothing else.
