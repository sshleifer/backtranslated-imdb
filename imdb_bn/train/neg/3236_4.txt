I recently saw the first guinea pig movie, The Devils Experiment, and I must admit to being disappointed. <br /> <br /> This photo was always included on any list of "Nashest" movies, and I was probably more likely because the campaign. Actually though, I do not rate it. <br /> <br /> If I believe the open text is true ("I have found this tape ..."), I might have thought it was a bit troubled by it, thinking it was real. Even though it does not seem to be real, apart from the convenience, I think that it was not really. <br /> <br /> Is the girl's reaction to her throughout the film? Just what they should not do. She should scream like a banshee in pain. That does not really mean that it's real. I did not want to see it if it was real, but he would be more convinced to act, but the film would be even more annoying. <br /> <br /> and then notorious scenes: nothing has affected me at all until the scalpel in hand. Hot oil, maggots and innards just do not bother me. I'm not saying "hard"; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not want to look away and I did not feel boring too. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this image is 22 years old, or perhaps I'm a wizard. The truth is, I could not avoid all this trouble from the movie. <br /> <br /> This is one thing you can expect as a practice to play a loop on modern industrial installations and seal away characters. Story, etc. And just leave the persecution, it works at some level. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pig with my wife, "It's just a movie" and she thinks all about hate. Why we see these movies and many of my reasons are discussed, but include the desire to be influenced by a movie. He said that he thinks that a film can not be so convincing to disturb him and he challenges me to do that. I played a bustling fire extinguisher scene and he was really upset. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that I have a point, except that we both were more disturbed by the scene in horror. So far the film is set to disturb the film from any film.
