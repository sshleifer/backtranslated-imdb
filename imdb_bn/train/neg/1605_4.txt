Recently, I saw the documentary "Do not Be The Biplob Television", also known as "Chavez: Inside the Coup". At first I thought it was an actual inner scene of events during the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. Although my statement was frustrating that there was an introductory aspect of narrative voice and companion music, and at any time no criticism was published about Hugo Chavez. This is great because if a documentary is giving an impartial account of what happened, something should have happened. After all, Chavez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, after the documentary is several years old, many additional information is available on the Internet, and for example, "an emergency inquiry about Chavez-a coup by five European TV corporations that funded the film, blatant false representations about Venezuela." It has many errors and intentions in the documentary Or the list of obsolete falsifications. (Use the title as Google's search string only, you will find it). Another interesting document was that the video registration of the presentation of "Errata of X-ray" error in this document was documented. It seems to me to be a good competitor in "Chavez: inside the coup", "It is available in video.google. I strongly recommend you" Chavez: Look for "X-ray of lies" in lieu and then make your opinion. Is that Kim Bartley and Donacha O'Brien were (intelligent or not) part of Chavez-propaganda.
