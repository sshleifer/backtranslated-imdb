My complaint here is the pacing of the movie and hand components concern. The film uses a fresh and interesting perspective by using archives, movies and letters, often the highlighting element is not very interesting (such as Goebbels complains about this or his illness, or TC, or advertised boring footage), small German cities). Also, the movie crawls along the covered c. 1920-1939 and then steams through years of war. In short, the film is a little better than the documentary of the history channel, your average history of the filmmaker has slightly more sensitivity than the documentary editor of the channel and can thus provide a more detailed description of the life of the proud. Yet, I found it missing.
