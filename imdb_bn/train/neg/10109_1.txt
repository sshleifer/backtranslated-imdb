BT killer, green river killer, Russian killer; <br /> <br /> I have never seen a woolly film, but I was so terrible that everyone was so amazed at how everyone was thinking. At the beginning I said that the films can be added together but together! After reading the comment, I was interested in seeing how bad this guy was. He's the worst there. <br /> <br /> As soon as the artificial film begins, the credits will not end and I quickly noticed that the audio was dubbed incredibly badly. The acting was incredibly awful and the camera shots were the same. Editing is the worst ever. This movie did not make any sense and I could not finish it incredibly because it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the film. I could not take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> Do not see this tremor!
