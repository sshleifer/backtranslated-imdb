:: Possible Speaker :: <br /> <br /> People, this movie was awful. A Catholic / prejudice / mysterious thriller has already gone to the well-operated soil from earlier movies. <br /> <br /> Suspended priests Gender and priesthood. Politics and religion Church hypocrisy. Conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic woodoo fight in good and evil <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two concepts: turmoil, sickness, debut, Sacrament Known - When a person can ask for cleansing his sins at the end of death; And excommunication, the law to cut off a person from the church. Basically, an expelled person will not get condemned. This is how Sina comes to Eatre and I'll leave it. I throw in all the fake items already listed and you have "order". <br /> <br /> I found sex scenes with trousers Virgin Mary Interlaced with a photo shot rather than Catholic humiliation. It ended up with the hit laser (I'm explaining) "I am the survivor of the sinners and the enemy, I live without love." He / she has a long tunnel with long Trench Coat Al "The Matrix". <Br /> <br /> I am not shocked by this movie 1, because it led to insult the whole faith in the process. If you want to look good, then I recommend "prediction" to Christopher Walken.
