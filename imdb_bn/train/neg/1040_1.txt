I can not believe that this movie has received a relatively high rating of 6! It is rarely visible and incredibly annoying, of course, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> On a budget path, it reminds me of the Star Wars Episode I and II. The perfect impression that you are seeing is a completely creative train debris. <br /> <br /> This image should avoid all costs. This is one of the "festival movies" which only pseudo-intellectuals please, because they make so much worse that they think that it is "different", so good. <br /> <br /> Bad film making is not "different", it just made a bad film.
