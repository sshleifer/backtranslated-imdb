There is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "film". Originally said it all and still holds up. Do some research work on reading or about the book, and you can understand this remake as ridiculous. Eric Roberts like Perik Smith? Her sister could do a good job! Holcomb & Edgerton has been, where the story takes place, sets and looks like something like Kansas. Original participants, actual participants, are riveting from the position of filming for use in weapons and hunting articles. Unforgettable performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. The soundtrack of Queen's Jones and Cinematography by Cndad Hall ... is now available in Widescreen on widescreen. Let this die a quick death in turkey.
