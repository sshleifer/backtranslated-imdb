Matt Sanders (Luke Lynn Wilson) thinks that he has found a perfect woman in Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman), who feels calm but beautiful woman, although she soon learns that she is needed and spontaneous, and she is also superhero g-girl Although he did not know what Matt was doing and after getting annoyed with him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was destroyed by dhyasthatakari. My super-ex-girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy but it relies heavily on cheap sexual jokes and it ends up being a forgotten experience. What was wrong Cast and Director could not overcome the script's weaknesses and I did not like how I played it. I was hoping to quarrel and it might be a female fantasy revenge film. However, they made the person a favorite and they made superheroes psycho. It was not very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film was welcomed. Sure, there were some interesting lines, but the middle and the terrible end of the weak really broke it. <br /> <br /> Director Ian Retman has lost his touch. After successfully succeeding in the early eighties and early nineties, he started shaving like evilusion and father's day. I would not say my super-ex-girlfriend is a complete boost but I do not give him credit for any quality, which is not too much. Don Payne did a terrible job with the plaque. Most jokes were hair and most supporting letters were just a note. He also recycled a few jokes at the same time, which actually became a bit tiring. <br /> <br /> Some actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was as good as G-Girl and had a lot of fun lines. Louis Wilson was a little pale and very interesting. I do not think he has made it for an attractive leading person and he is even better in supporting family roles like this. Anna Faris is just doing her "horror movie" routine and she is getting young. She needs a challenge or at least some good script. Wanda Sykes is either hurt or missed for me. He was cool in slow-in-the-line and he was bad at the Clarke 2. Here, she's just boring and does not bring anything in the movie. Eddie Ezard was not right, there was nothing special. Rainn Wilson was not just boring and funny. Overall, I was frustrated with the movie. It was not terrible, but it was so much probable and the final result was simply average. Rating 5/10
