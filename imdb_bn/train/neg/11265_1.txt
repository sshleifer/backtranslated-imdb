I had a few moments in my life, when I was embarrassed and depressed. One of these was one of the ransid aluminum seams. <br /> <br /> There were warning signs. No premiere (even they do not want to be present) and no reviews of magazines. The only reason I sit through this picture is that I can get some sleep. There is nothing explained by <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The description was stupid. I was delighted at one stage when the film's leadership seemed to be shot, in my growing frustration, it was revealed that it did not really ruin my joy. I sincerely hope all those involved in this movie will be hanged for this torture. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mainly the moments of strange moments. For example, for some unknown reasons, the main character apparently feels the need to free himself from the toilet cube, the time to tell the person to put fingers in his ear in the next posture. <br /> <br /> I can not explain the anger that I feel, so I conclude that. <br /> <br /> Ransid Aluminum: For those who are suffering, fornicators and retributors, who want to torture themselves.
