This picture looked interesting; I used to read this book many years ago and it told me that the plat-tracking feature outlined strongly. <br /> <br /> It starts showing up and from the very beginning it fails to live in expectations. Actually, I was not bothered to see the whole thing ... The whole curiosity - bad performance, bad acting and immediate dislike characters - it was the point of the film, I guess. <br /> <br /> Seeing this picture left a bad taste in the mouth and put on a downer for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
