Here are some comments that it's the best ever made in the best movie ever. Well, they are only partially correct. For me, this is the greatest film of all time ever! Like this movie, I have never seen anything so open, humiliating, humiliating and against human nature. A real embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, it's not too bad, it's good. There are no other bad films like Alvees like Campeak trash, such as Clamkake. This one is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure garbage. Local Americans should succumb to their poor clich√©d and stereotypical treatments here. In fact, it should probably be blamed for the crimes of all mankind, and this movie takes the film seriously as a total of 0 stars. Grade: F.
