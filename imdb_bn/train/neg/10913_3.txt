The components of Marvin (Rob Schneider) element are not his living dreams. But his fate changed when his car crashed (very bad) and was found by the doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild him. At this point, he began to behave wildly on the unconscious and sometimes could become a best cop. At that time, he realized the changes and his lively instincts started to fall down on his human body. In the mean time, she finds a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means controlling herself and behaving civilly. I do not have a big fun with Rob Schneider. Actually, I saw his first movie. However, I can easily say that he is the best player of frustration. (See his part in Ally MacBell, actually quite funny). The film has some good parts like its flirting with goats. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems less intelligent to the viewer. I'm sure that this movie is taken care of until it is taken seriously. But it is very sad to see a lot of good pictures at the box office. The creature is not the worst movie ever seen, but * failed to get more than this.
