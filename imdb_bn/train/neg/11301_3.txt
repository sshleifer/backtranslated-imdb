A poor script and poor direction to adjust as much as a movie will be destroyed. This event with "Mummy's Tomb" is the oldest, better world wide awake on Flickr like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is trite and brutal. Acting medium Even Chanir Khariss is weaker than Tom Taylor's "Mummy's Hand", and the producers point out enough stupidity and their own film's weaknesses to add footage from Christie Cabanne's wildly well prequel! <br /> <br /> <br /> Universal realizes how bad this movie was, and after two years it was rebuilt from scratch with better script as "Mummy's Ghost" and good director. This was probably the best picture of the four films "Mummy" chakra, although it was not as close as Carl Froyd's 1932 origin. <br /> <br /> The cabane footage shows the picture 3. The best of "new" stuff is 2 a. Dick Foren and Wallace Ford were probably pleased to see their characters shut so that they could not express such frustration!
