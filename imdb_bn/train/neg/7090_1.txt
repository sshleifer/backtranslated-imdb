Last night at 7:35 am I was sleeping on my gold, watching Larry Sanders (I usually do DirecTivo, but last night). 3am (exploration banker on the west coast) woke up and was fascinated to see it at HBO2. I was amazed at how poor the movie was. Seriously Surprised. So I was shocked that I had to write a comment on IMDB. It's really really bad. The writing is annoying, but the director and editor are just below a young person in a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, this video has been shot. You think that the video is shot, not the digital video. It looks like a soap opera. Clippings from skateboard video have made this horrible experience for them more 'film'. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe poor directions but I can not really remember anything. Shot and blocking stupid Yes, I chose the word 'fool'. Not incomplete, not brave, not brave, not boring, just stupid I would say that people reviewing this review "would give an example better". I cant It was 3 o'clock. But believe me, I know that you will see it, you will be drawn by terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
