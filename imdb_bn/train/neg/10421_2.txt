I saw this movie as a very young girl (now I am 27 years old) and it frightened me for a few years. I had a nightmare about every aspect of this movie, as the music (probably) was taken towards violence. My parents still allow me to see it and both of them say they will not let me see such a movie. I think they are just saying that I have such strong feelings; 0) I'm currently reading the book (Majeed Curiosity and it's a classic that's actually) and it's really a great story. But I do not think it should have been made in a cartoon. Ever. Well, nowadays kids may make it vague but have given me nightmares for weeks and weeks and still have a hard time trying to hold the rabbit in the same way. Each time I give a little heart width. Yahoo is a mess, but I strongly recommend that a parent is trying to show this film to their kids, instead of reading their book or to confirm it, check it first so that they allow content. Like everyone else, I do not think it's annoying but we are there; 0)
