I can not honestly believe what is now passed for entertainment. Stereotypical jokes about death (and fun), violence, sexual abuse, adult threats, drugs by minors, drug theft, sick parents, convicted of hell, African Americans, police and fattened people, and children are smiling at the middle of the night - yes, Surely my kids seem like movies - no !!! Add dark and frightening elements to this - There is a dead woman and a house, and she has kept her loving husband in prison for more than 20 years, and terrorizing the whole neighborhood - how sweet for the kids. Parents - Do you really want to see your kids? - Do you want to teach them about their lives? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is very scary for young kids, and I can see that teens today live some of the scenes in the movie - then why rub it in their mouth? For an adult audience - you will not find it scary or fun - just annoying, transformed and anticipated. And the letters are just wrong - unknown parents, unrecognized police, fools and annoying friends, nasty and captivating kids, and beer drinks / women-friendly boyfriends What a great element for kids - is it really a word like a child's movie? Even computer animation and good voice work is not enough to recover this terrible flick. Save your money, save your time and protect your child's mind - go to Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shake, A Bags Life - none of them are better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Gemeckis - both disgrace both for this type of disaster, and then it bills children / children as movies!
