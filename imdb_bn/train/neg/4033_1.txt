It hurts me to write such a terrible review, but instead I encourage these people. First off, not only a small budget is made in a film because it does not automatically make good or respectful. Indeed, in this case, the small budget is probably the only achievement of films, which could prevent huge amounts due to being isolated from an odd racing horse. Did you see the theater in the theater? People ever heard people smile and thought "what a dick you over"? Well even these twats did not smile. My cat got so bad by taking its first ever bath by mid-way. It's not a movie, it's a child .... No monkey is making pictures that you feel like going to France. I have to go, there is a shoe on my door ...
