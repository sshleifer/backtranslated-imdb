In the past few years, someone who has seen almost comedy Central has probably seen this movie ad. I first saw advertisements for this movie in 2001. It seems to be fun, but I did not want to order it on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I'll wait for the movie to rent to Blockbuster. About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and was on the "DVDs for less than $ 20" page. A copy of this movie. I agreed to buy the DVD, which was only $ 6.99. I went home and placed a disc in the DVD player, and I was waiting to start laughing ... and I waited a bit longer. Laugh never came. <br /> <br /> I want to agree with almost all other comments on this page when I say this film is awesome. Sick, desperately transparent, and badly written and directed, underground comedy movie is a torture piece of garbage and in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No star
