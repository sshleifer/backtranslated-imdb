Probably a very tiny speaker <br /> <br /> This movie was first billed as the Russian horror movie. Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, "The Witch" (Russian title of) will take disgraceful place in the horror Russian film gallery. It is based on the story "Vie" of Nikolai Gogol, a Russian classic. "Based" here is the main word because there is no need to contact with the story. Instead, you know less about Gogol, well. <br /> <br /> This is a unique production because most of the managers use most of the time to accept the stories of other cultures and accept them in their own culture. The source of American remakes of foreign films is a major example, but again, Sturges converts the seven Samurai of Kursova into Magnificent Seven with great results, and Kurusawa moved Shakespeare's Macbeth to Japan to become an incredibly powerful throne in Japan and became King Liar. A riveting run. However, with "The Witch", our Russians are relocating Russian classical stories to American soil. The film was shot in Astana in English, with the use of American actors to sink in English and reasonably synchronous lip movement. <br /> <br /> As a natural consequence, the colorful Ukrainian background is lost for the story, it has come to a big American small town, which is raised from some old horror book manuals. Gwen is the senior seminary, Khoma Brutus, instead of one of the bully journalists who won the Pulitzer Prize, and at the same time wrote about events like X-Files and wrote frequently in Miss Bobe's competition. (I never thought that the Pulitzer Prize was given for such writing, now I'm humbly amending.) In Russia's strangest voice, journalist Ian Barkhoff is known. The name of John Smith should be named because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, cleaned and generic than this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Berkef is going to a city in Cascasville, roaming around a dirty street, until he finds a terrible house and becomes obsolete by the old chron. All of them are in line with a radio announcement about evil forces in their most powerful times, and people can stay well and avoid water. I really need to mention that really rain? The scene of some horrific scenes that saw me laughing, the story considered our journalist dressed as a priest, misunderstood a priest, and the local Sheriff told her daughter that after the brutal attack, the new priest wanted to pray for him. Three nights At this stage, the work begins with inferiority. Those who have time to kill are welcome. <br /> <br /> Is this photo wrong? Everything is going on in dialogue and under the phenomenon section. The conversation that I heard in Russian language was clearly written in English and it was only collected from the American films, selected clichés and platitudes. Actors fought clearly with the English because the lemurs were irrelevant during their speeches and followed Russian Dubbing. The acting is mostly violent, and the actors do not seem to be difficult to speak often because there is no point in the face of the face in their mouth. In most cases, they were just blank or they were you want. Sheriff's only exception was Lennyt Wolfgang, who played a great Estonian actor, and Arnie's LeGetis, who plays the wheelchair resident of Cascosville. Oh, and of course a dog camera that is absolutely normal! I know actors complain of being excited by dogs and cats but when Nicolov is excited by a cock, it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film. <br /> <br /> There was not a single scary moments in the whole film, and there was not a single moment in the film. Remember, this comment is coming from someone who is notoriously inexperienced. From the beginning of this film, the standard patch used in the horror film is filled. At a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly kerosene lamp. The lamp goes out immediately. It will be seen in a few horror movies. An example of the highest statue comes at another moment, a character runs out of a bathtub and runs at the camera. He saw something like Lincoth! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I'm not thrilled either. It was a run of the match to start from the beginning. I especially enjoyed the entire population of the small town as they knew that they lived in horror movies, but they were not sure whether they were any jumpy or not. Therefore, in their case only zombie-like acting in some cases. <br /> <br /> The film's creator says, it is a search for faith. Wicked actions are not worthy of such stupid actions, stupidly concreved moments, and, yes, clichés, such as finding good survey collections. The film is very thoroughly and completely fake, it only deserves an exhibition of a wax figure museum.
