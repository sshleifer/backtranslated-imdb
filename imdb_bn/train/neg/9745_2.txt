This movie has spread to an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MTS 3 was the best time to empty this movie. <br /> <br /> The terrible acting, bad makeup, poor effects, in-the-skin skimpy (1960's) underwear. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> Makeup is difficult to understand due to villain. The assistant says, 'Naso' is something like that of NACHOO! (Think sneak). It's just poor conversation. The long eyebrows are a delight to the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know how 'projected man' means in terms of plot. Although I miss something start. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum with this 10 lines of posting ??
