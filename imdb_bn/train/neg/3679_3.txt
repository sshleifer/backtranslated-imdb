This is a Japanese movie but there are several English words here. This is a fantastic movie, featuring excellent visuals, featuring beautiful scenes of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this is the only release quality for me. The stories were generally annoying. For a 90 percent film, a young girl wants to see Salk because her "picture" husband is more old than her husband? Please, it could be a bummer ...... but get it over! <br /> <br /> In just the last 10 minutes she encounters one and her boyfriend. Then, for most viewers, it's very little - it's too late. We used to fall asleep.
