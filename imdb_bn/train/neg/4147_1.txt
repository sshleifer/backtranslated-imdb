I'm a torrid fan of terrible movies, some cheesy and humorous game down to the bottom. So imagine my soul I went to the local rented shop, and Vampires vs. Zombies are available. The name is very entertaining, you know that no one in the world can pull something like this, it can only be bad. <br /> <br /> Boy, it's bad. After watching this scary-movie, I was literally silent. Me and my Paul sit out outside of saying a word for several minutes, we both think about the future of our life after watching this movie. I break the depression silence with the words, "... dude .... what?" Yes, I am an enthralling person. <br /> <br /> She is a quick 'street review' plot; Always, always, there is no one in "WTF" mode. The character; No development, forgettable Music; Worse than porn Vampires; Their vampire? Zoom their hair? <br /> <br /> to the end; Everyone will have to see this movie, honestly, it is so bad that I want to see it again. So please make yourself a favor, see it and get depressed.
