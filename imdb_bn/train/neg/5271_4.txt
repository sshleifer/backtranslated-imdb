The West is vacationing in the west, American families discover a strange city in the middle of the desert. They do not know that this Scrut City was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence suppressed them. I usually love mystery-awful films like this. The "cube", the best example of Spielberg's "Dual" and "The Birds" movies, which does not give any answers, yet curiosity and wants more. Apparently, "invisibility" writer / director Walter Clairenard is trying to produce such a movie and whether he has succeeded it to the audience. I personally think that he got almost halfway, then the film has only shrunk. <br /> <br /> All types of actors are "Who-Hoom". They are not particularly bad, but we do not feel afraid of them as visitors and they respond in unrealistic ways. Anyone else is absolutely curious to stop learning the strange words of walking letters?!?!? At least for them to justify them a little! <br />? <br /> <br /> <br /> Movies made for as much as possible are definitely an average match on it. Everything that was given to Director Klenhard should be really appreciated for feeding the desert environment and some setting was attractive. A really cool scene where two letters found an old nuclear test site, as long as the eye could see the eye, the sand was completely melted in the glass. I wonder what surprised me ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do we say, or the animals? Do we ever give them a real formula (mutant, aliens, ghost or ancient Indian spirits?)? Oh, it really down for us!) Or where to come from. <br /> <br /> There are many clich√©s here. Why are cities like this kind of films always really, really stupid? Why is an old guy always think everyone is crazy that turns to be right? Why? Why? Why? How to bout a new scenario, folks! <br /> <br /> "invisibility" is different and trying to be intelligent, but in the end it fails in such a way that it is very well known to our video horrible goats fans. Hey, I've seen many bad movies, and the disappearance is not bad, is it? average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
