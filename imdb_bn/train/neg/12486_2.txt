Rich Diet Joan Weinfeld (a sadly erroneous Bate Davis) is stupid to marry stupid arrogant Allen Brice (Jack Carcassen is being lost). Her father (Eugene Pallet) is determined to stop the marriage and she was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (severely James Cagni). They destroy the land in the desert and hate each other (Love) starts to fall in love. <br /> <br /> It just seems to get high ratings from tourists because it only has Cagney and Davies. They both had brilliant performers but they were not known for the drama Comedy and this movie shows why! The script is very awesome - there is not a real smile in the whole movie. The rumors continue to blurring Cagney and Davis first cactus (this is done three times!). Only save them from their notable talent completely offensive. As they work well with both lousy components. Cagney tries her best with her line and Davies screeches every line in the full line but it does not work. Curson saw his face "hell" across this movie (probably his character's passion changed in seconds). With its unique voice and only the above readings, palettes have some fun to laugh. But, above all, it was dull and laughing - to sit in a real place somewhere. It has got only two stars for Cagney and Davis' acting and some fine cinematography but in reality - it is not worth seeing. In the following years, Cognizant and Davis hated this image and you can see why.
