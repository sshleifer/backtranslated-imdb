I just hired (yes! I have paid to see!) This image. God It's one of the worst movies I've seen. Another critic has kept it, Mrs. Colagunde, come out of the film, please! Please do not show any other film! The lady has a cantaloupe's charisma. No, it's not right for CantLoup, maybe there's more to it. He did not know how to work; She influenced a disgusting look all the time (reminding me of my always-disgusting young sisters from Europe). He is not charming; She is not beautiful There are no real stories. And edit! There was no one, I could see! It's too bad when you're watching a movie and by simply pressing "Forward Forward" on your remote, and nothing will happen! I mean ... I shouted unintentionally, "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and pay to love on the screen! Very good deal for them; Fair contract for the audience! I think I'm going to throw ....
