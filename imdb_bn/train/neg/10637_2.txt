I'm sorry that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more purpose pictures and more consistency. It's only a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it's just annoying. I find acting as well as the weak act as well. O'Donnell Robin (with Batman) may appear as impressive, but he lacks any common in this film. Probably growing up, she is throwing kisses on her kids, but growing up does not get any charm. It is no wonder that it was not shown in many countries and 40% of the proposed price in the UK was being sold and it was not released in the Netherlands.
