I used to think Harry Keitel, a new pistol from John Lidon, then as a bonus, Mikeron music of Nano. I hope an old school, lively, Italian police thriller created in America. Eustad, I've got a perfect story that never makes sense and a movie that told me: WTF !!! Many unauthorized questions, and not enough action. Result: A potential religious classic got flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reconcile these guys with good scripts. Oh, and Maricon score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, do not waste time, but a "must not be seen", unless you're not a hardcore Keitel fan.
