Paul Snuck has created many horror films. According to the standard, they tend to tend to range from fairly well-tricked to trash; And unfortunately, the horrific rise to the grave is near to the next. This plot is merely a witch, a wizard, or (as it is here) your average story of the battlefield, which is sentenced to death - but those who did it before they took an oath .... Etc. Then we lead a SÃ©ance and one thing goes the other way, and the pretty soon executed fraud is no better up again. The plot is slowly, annoying annoying and the film seems constantly vain. The character diatribe reams out the string and it does not serve the film in any way. Paul Snuck wrote this article, and if you ask me, he should be acting because the dialogue is extremely intense and it already makes the film even more annoying. Carlos Oud, who has directed Nashey and director of the Curse of Satan at Broken Du Blue, here are the following directions, which does nothing to help dialogue help the film. Sometimes shit films like these have a certain charm about them; But there are even horses encouraged from the tomb. It's a painful annoying movie that is not less or nothing in the way of interest.
