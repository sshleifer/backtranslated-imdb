The idea of ​​creating a small baggage about Berlin Airport makes me think of a more interesting German (post) war film. This is a theme that has not been searched yet. However, the manufacturers of this series stuffed it with clichés. It already starts with the movie DVD cover, which is a direct copy of 'Pearl Harbor' cover. <br /> <br />, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war, he is struggling to survive. He has found employment at the American base, the city can work for the coldest and highest ranking officer (Hero Farch), 'M, falls in love, gets pregnant and wanders again with her husband.' Come on !!! We've seen this once very often. Heno Farch and Ulrich Knighten play their role quite well; Bettina Zimmermann does not seem really satisfied however. For some reason it seems too late to always give the right mental response to the scene. It just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Action scene with aircraft and aviation lift, we are sometimes exciting, often not. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan of WWII movies then I suggest you spend your money in something else: Chocolate ice cream brings great satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4/4!
