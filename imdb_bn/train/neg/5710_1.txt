Well, it looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Bachheimer collaborated again, this time the mix of the Houston Movie, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is the speed of Indiana Jones speed 2. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Kettle) battles a scripted script and loses it badly. This film is a little more than an extended advertisement for Fremans. But these fries are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, the natural descendant of the Freemason Knights Templar (and does not refer to a 'Hell's' or Jack) ripper.) I do not think I have published a plot spoiler Because there is no one. There is virtually no mystery, no surprise and no measurement - it just stops. The purpose of the National Treasure is for Dan Brown, but strikes the same intellectual level as one episode humor of Scua Du.
