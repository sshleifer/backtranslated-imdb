There are several problems with this movie, but the lower line has tried very little with very little. The original story is quite good, but the trial of money was not just for the story. The existence budget really kills this movie Stuart Gordon (author / director) wrote 'honey, I discharge the kids', which was a box office ruin. However, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Frankly, this is not a good movie when a good example. He waited several more years, making the technology cheaper to influence many. (He did not mention a company with the money was found.)
