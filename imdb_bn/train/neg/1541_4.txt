I strongly dislike this movie and during that scene the British shot dead the leftist gang. The film effectively blames NI's people for their own problems. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of frustration and not to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and its history, as it was in 1912, regardless of the will of the rest of Britain in Britain. <br /> <br /> Characters are portrayed as arrogant fools, although I hate the faithful paramilitary I was fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privilege on the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt that Catholics could keep in the Gulf region and destroy Republicans. <br /> <br /> Ninety-nine values ​​of 'machismo', strangers etc. were transferred to the 1970s as part of Belfast and the supposed unique Irish 'mental' which leads to violence. Stupid songs from the ladies of the club - Green field of old Ireland ..blah..blah .. - is given a symbolic level, such a poor young fool is fighting for an impossible cause. Tired, historic, cheap, and nasty trash. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement of a conflict which requires serious political analysis.
