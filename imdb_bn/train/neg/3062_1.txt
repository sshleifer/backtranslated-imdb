Some might say something like his giant robot child or "dumbo", like "baby geniuses", his cycling drug-adeled nightmare will win the award for the most annoying film for children. You might say that too, but you'd be wrong. Lo and behold, I come to you: Santa Claus, the most helplessly despicable family movie ... well, sometimes. At the beginning, children from various parts of the world sing their inspiration theme (seriously, this segment is about 20 February minutes long and there is nothing to do with the plot!) Concluding, Marlon never goes out of the house (Does not remember him from Barcelona), this is the childhood of his greatness. And how much effort do I try, I do not visit any therapist, I can not even get ... ... who ... Reindeer ... smile ... out ... of it. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this mind-plush piece of trash if you want to avoid sex-hungry whales in the drunken season. Still, flooding a serious case with the forced spine of the gay ghosts is something for you, I guess you have to try it. But really, this movie is not worth your time and emotional health.
