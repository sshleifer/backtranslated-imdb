Apart from warnings of potential visitors, it does not achieve a review qualification. It is a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress in a studio hunting during filming of a WWII time drama. There is no fear involved, no doubt, no surprise. A shocking moment that looks too stupid to be frustrated. The visual style is very flat and dull, although some time really has some nice editing. The story does not come together, and the film is really a total boost. 4/10.
