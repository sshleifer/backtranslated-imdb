When you are making a thriller about magic, I believe you have to do what you can do to suspend the audience's unbelief for the viewer's work. Some pictures (for example, "Rosemary's Baby") have performed it; Others (such as "Naturemansy") do not exist, and potentially scary elements come across as crooked and stupid. This movie has some atmospheric moments, but it is difficult to create almost half of the conversations (sometimes it is poorly recorded, only accessible to others) and Osson Wells, who gets top billing, has the role that you have with him, he is frustrated for the work There were estimates. Or maybe she was just funny ... (* 1/2)
