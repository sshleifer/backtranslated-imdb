Warning Spiller . . I agree with you, it was almost. This is such a bad movie about such stories and interesting facts It was such a promise, but the acting was the best ridiculous. Some set was beautiful and realistic. Something else outside of a theme park. I laughed at myself, which I saw, in a serious scene. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was "King" was the fight between friends that ended with death. I like the sentence of queens. And, although the final shot is a beautiful picture, There are many good movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
