This series was the answer to the BB Valley success, CBS Network It was 90 minutes Western, just like the ABC program. It was an answer, it had stuff to make last season 2. <br /> <br /> This show is actually really lost in reality. For example - in one episode, the man gave out his stick with a stick. Surprisingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. Along with this, these stories were not as strong as the big cats. <br /> <br /> This is a show I do not want a DVD, and of course I hope they will never be released. Imagine CBS being running a lot, they reuse many familiar settings. This was the Western series in the western part of the West, which was not popular in the 1970s.
