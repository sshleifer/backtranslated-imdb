Case is the best part of the movie but it is not just the price of the purchase price. I hope the film is based on "the real story" to find a shot on the hazard-posed home video of the weak shot clips that combine only with cruel acting and non-related Butcher house scenes. Most of the video footage was a rebound situation that was probably used to extend the length of the feature instead of the effects. I started this review halfway through the movie and it was waiting to wait until the end, but it was less and I saw it got worse. If I can lessen it, it can be a negative ten. Learn from my mistakes and save with your money and time this one.
