After Twin Brother's birth (due to the death of their parents) twenty-five years later they were reunited to take revenge on their parents and to bring back their million dollar tunnels. Double impact runs more than two hours and basically does not add any real method to the Corsican Brothers Plot and the Jane-Cloud Van Dam, although as good as a bad young brother is enough embarrassing like Twin Brothers. Action sequences are not exciting at this time, and Jane-Cloud relies more on the gunfight on its martial arts. Also the supporter has lost the cast and within two hours the movie simply took plain. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
