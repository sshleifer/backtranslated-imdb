Hello, <br /> <br /> <br /> This is my first post on IMDB, although I use it for reference quite a bit. I want to salute you. I'm Greek that inevitably will affect my judgment. I hope you do not bother. <br /> <br /> I've spent 2 years of my life (all of us were really greets), omeres eps (and you see everywhere as homers), rhythm by rhythm. If I feel good, then in the 8th grade Iliad (Eliad) and 9th grade Audisia (ODC) were. There was great disappointment for my colleague Greeks around Troy, Warner and around the campus of Warner. (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad Ipsas is one of the best literary works ever produced. It was written by Greek poet Omris, after 400 years of actual war. Historians started the Trojan War in 1200 BC and the real cause of the war was the strategic importance of Troy rather than Helen's beauty. Someone said that Omirus Ipsus is not presenting real facts (as historically correct) but this was not intended to be done. <br /> <br /> If you read this huge poem, someone may think of yourself respect, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty etc. This was lasting discussion between the best part and the most educational as well as fighters before the war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, spending millions of dollars in such a bad situation is shameful. The perfect storm is a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics works perfectly), and it's still Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that you want to see something else instead. I want to give trojas at 10 o'clock. This is really expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> <br /> Alex
