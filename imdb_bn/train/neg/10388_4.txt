From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie looks a lot worse, but I do not think it was bad. I actually saw a lot worse. <br /> <br /> "The House Where Evil Dawells" is a husband and his wife Ted and Laura Flachter and their daughter, Amy, who is an old house in Japan. They know very little, a Japanese ninja brutally killed his wife and his lover and then killed him 100 years ago with a samurai sword. When strange things happen to the house, the ghosts of the former inhabitants begin to possess the body of living and plan to rebuild bloodshed 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw it in movies and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was corny, but I saw my days bad. Ghosts are working a bit more, we see transparent blue figures randomly watching pop ups around the family and taking their bodies. To be honest, the ghost of this movie reminds me of ghosts on the spectacular Mansion of Disneyland. I can be wrong, but after watching this, I think that Japanese horror film "Junk-on: The Grudge" and the American remix of that movie was a little off. Old Japanese homes where a brutal killer took place, geological activities, curse houses, etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> To add it, it's a fantastic ghost story. Do not get out of your way to see it, but if you like these things and it comes to TV, you can give it a shot. 4/10.
