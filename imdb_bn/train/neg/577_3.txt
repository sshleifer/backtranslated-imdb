Above all, John Bon Jovi does not seem to be a vampire movie. With so much interesting character and poor story with each other, the whole movie has become predictable. If you remember and you are a total vampire movie fan, you can have some fun with some scenes. Do not expect any tantnino-style section here and the story of an anne Rice. (I hope to forget the whole movie by tomorrow;)
