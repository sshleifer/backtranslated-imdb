I'm not sure if this video is labeled nasty or the director is not sure ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a horrible 'horror' movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chocolate is abducted by 'jungle' tribal '. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. Like a group of tribal Hippies, the tribal dress party wanders in the city-style Halloween costume presentation. And the savages range from white to Asian to black from the race range in Hispanic. I think Franco has just picked someone who looks a little ethnic for this ramp. <br /> <br /> To make matters even worse, this film is very small, there is no real fear and there are many unnecessary penis. Not fun I could find something just like a lazy Italian or Euro-trash film; This just fell short of a WAY. <br /> <br /> 10, 2 kids.
