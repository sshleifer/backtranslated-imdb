Because of the budget, Ethyl Genoski (again played by Priscilla Allenen) was released from an emotional institution (though he killed six) and Hop Bartholomai reached home by half way. Once there, he immediately reapses his criminal's insane means and murders anyone who gets into her and her food. <br /> <br /> Holly MOLY! Do not suck this movie! When you start open credits, you get into trouble, and this is only the first movie credit, apparently a TV screen is turned off. Ten years after Nick Millard (under his nickname Nick Phillips), Crazy Fat Atlet decided to come back around the world, and at the end of the week probably took a budget for the cost of a blank tape and video camera rental. Let's just say Millard's unique style does not translate well into the video. Seriously, I've made home movies with more production values ​​than this. And Millard tried to drag the night, deep night 2 through an evening padding, with half-running footage from the first picture (which seems like it was closed by a servant VHS copy). Alan is good at the same time as Atel, but the film is so perfect that you started to feel sorry for her acting in this trash. I mean, at least try the first film. We do not have any music here, we have poor impact (if it is always possible), unclear camera work, awesome audio and editing that seems to connect two VCRs. Avoid at all costs!
