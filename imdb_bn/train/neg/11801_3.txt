As a big fan of the original film, this show is hard to see. Garish set decorations and strictly light sets to hide any style from this remake. The mood is not there. Instead, it has the look and feel of many television films of the seventh century. Karenka Walter is not a bad choice like Naffe, but her graduation costume and "folding" apartment does not fit the mood of the original, or make her an attractive character. He tried his best to work it out but Samanta Igar is really a bad choice. Vertical voice and a candle can not be kept for sexual appeal in English accent and Barber Stanwick of California. Lee J. Cabarte Barton tries to try to fashion what fashion, but its performance is not only the style. [<br /> <br /> It feels like TV TV and reminds me again that what a wonderful movie is still there.
