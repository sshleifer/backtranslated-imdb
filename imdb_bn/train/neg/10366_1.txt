This semi-unexpected annoyance was more than 80 minutes. First, I was wondering how to make something like that possible. Then, to reach the 70th minute, I was convinced myself that it was just a few minutes, and I was lasting till the end which I was very proud because I saw this movie as a great test for the patience and whip tolerance of man. Was it worth watching all? Well, I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you are firmly convinced, then you can end up ... the film is not incompatible, and there is no general concept in the characters. All the facts in the film, you are sure that you have seen somewhere earlier and they seem to just fill the movie rail in this movie.
