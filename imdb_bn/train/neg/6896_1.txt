Sadly, IMDb does not allow me to rate judges less than 1. No shame This terrible movie is so bad that I actually turned the thing completely closed before it ended. The script was a few shining moments, but the direction, editing, acting, audio quality, and especially the line distribution time were so disgusting that the judges were absolutely helpless. <br /> <br /> Judges are notified as modern day comic book style western, but in reality there was nothing like this. It's what most of the dog dogs do at the bottom of your shoes. You can try to claim that it is okay, but it just continues to stincking. <br /> <br /> Why does the video store think that the high performance of the audio in the high school plays a bad role beyond the class? We hire movies to see what is good on television. But the judge is the most merciful SciFi channel worse than the original. I seek my money back from Hollywood videos.
