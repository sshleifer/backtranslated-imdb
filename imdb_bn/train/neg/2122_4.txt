Although seven pounds on some sides are difficult and attractive in its descriptive style, Gabriel Mukino's project is rather intermediate. The film becomes even more unfortunate and impressive when it goes to the end: the human heart and the mental, the physical and the metaphors of the eyes. Seven pounds are Amoros Pereos from Alejandro Gonzalez Innerrita and a 21-gram amateur title with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem story is very easy to guess by film. This is very bad, because if Ben and Emily are in the right hand, then seven pounds can prove to be "good".
