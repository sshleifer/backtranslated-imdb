"The plant is the most fascinating and harmful of all the living beings", a dope will tell that "The Sedipopol", "Bedicon attack", "Day of the Triphid", and about a thousand moovies. And why the seed is dangerous than plants, could one ask? Because, according to the same dalt, "the seeds can chase us". Yes, I can remember a horrific incident when the Macuo was just a calf, all the fierce dandylion seeds coming out of the school ... Yes, all right.

There will be no terrorists or even the smallest position of suspicion. The reasons are unknown, seed monsters are split by 50-volt ultra-violet lamp, although they can travel around the daylight, which is about 1,000,000,000,000,000 times the strength of the UV. As you can see, this cow is not much thought in flop. MooCow says here break your photo synthesis instead of yer garden weeds. : = 8P
