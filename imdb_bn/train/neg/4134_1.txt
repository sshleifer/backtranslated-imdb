I really want to say that I can not stop watching this movie from the beginning. Just how bad it was !!! It's a lot confusing just dry, like paint drying. I mean, you sit there and wait for something to happen, in fact something, especially something that makes the whole movie sense! At the end of the film, I was really amazed that if there was any chance that I could always explain the first hour to miss the first time, or I would pass in the film without knowing and miss the portions (if there was one together) together! Basically the main thing to confuse me about this movie is that the original girl (if she was actually a main girl) was in some other kind of reality, then what is happening at this moment? Suddenly, he woke up and was at the mental institute, lying on the bed by a doctor or anything else, then he returned sooner than tearing my wrist and ate some of the random vampires. It made no sodding knowledge! I am tempting to email creators and claim back my time, I mean that I saw this trash for 2 hours of my life! I know that filmmakers really knew what it was! It seems that someone has performed all the bits that could make it cute even though I think this image should be 4 hours long! I was completely sidelined with another person who wrote another review, I was loyal to this movie through this title, and that's the only one. I'm really grateful that I actually bought this movie, how many times it has been seen in the local pound shop. If you think that the film was the perfect crown of trash, I would want to be honest, but it seemed that there was a lot more Â£ 1 to spend in this film! Sodding time and a sodding of a good razor blade, I mean I odd, less painful than watching this film !!!!
