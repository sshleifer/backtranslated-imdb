In fact, if it was not in the standard of budget for most heavy duty cast lists, it was basically satirical and was not compatible with some sympathy for the imagination and original satirical intent. Instead we strongly believe that bad songs and dance sequences show the characteristics of a beautiful beggar and zoror, and with final separation, it is seen that the music-level stage action has been performed, compared to Brecht properly enough for the production of Lionel's 'Oliver' Blair. Acting talent abuses shamefully: Migenges and Walter are good but not very hard to try: Mighenes has at least one great voice and feels for some elements. Julia Mac looks perfect as, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plume accent. Harish's pitch is humiliated man and polly is violent. Songs, scripts, and music adaptations are often painful: It was a bad step to maintain the foundation of the film in the boldly published Broadway version of Marquette Blitzstein, but at least his words were together, more than the unanimous gestures of trust. And the attempt to attack low budget through filming of clusterropic angle on low budget is plummeted to the girls' blues and oranges, such as some basement bases, Straw also fails completely - the film is simply cheap, lazy and incredibly produced. Disgusting
