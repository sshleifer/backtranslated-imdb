I enjoy a good, slow moving drama. In August, Christmas, Chunking Express, Virgin Stripped Bare Here Bachelors, The Way Home, Springtime In A Small Town, Hana Di, Brick Drop Man Oman, Dallas, In Measure For For Love, And Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring All Enjoyable Movies? Just few names <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a subset of films in the theater genre that tries to travel to the quotes of good movies and does not offer any interest. Do I say that IAN movie? "Unconscious Artistic Nonsense." Tasei Ming-liang is the king of this tribe, and Viv L'Amour is his "best composition". In fact, it is in the form of "art", in the form of a trick-bound garbage de la crape People roam in their apartments, drink water, walk backwards, leave behind, posters, gather staple papers, go to the bathroom, eat, toss, sex, jump in mosquitoes, etc. When I say that I am not surprised about the exact number of the whole film, which is extremely poster-skild for uninterrupted art-house trash. No plot, no stories, no interesting or significant events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most important ?? No drama <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is weird that it is completely vain and gratuitous. The character relation on the bed is actually non-existent. Obviously, they do not feel like communicating with the audience about the obvious truth that they prefer "lips". The person below the bed is just one dimensional and uncertain. He got water, made with the garden, and stroke himself. Tsai's idea of ​​this "character development" Genuinely misled "entertainer" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is the first actor to see that he is walking from one end of the park to another 285 seconds on the other side, and then only show his tears in vain? For absolutely no reason ?? For another 356 series seconds. The film then suddenly ends. There is no point. There is no entertainment. Just pure, concentrated visitors torture torture. <br /> <br /> Try to beat a dead horse. The underlying theme of the loneliness is so disrespectful that the only true feeling of this movie is that of Urdu. In fact, Kiosi Kuosawa shows his horror film better on loneliness in Cairo. And guess what? It's really interested! In January, the film was gradually moved like melted neck, but there is a better way to deal with the idea of ​​loneliness than the ruthless waste known as Viv L'Amour. Thanks to Cine Ming-Liang, the film's supporters can thank this image because he has provided unreasonable evidence that the art-house movie is made for B-grade, television horror flicks. Art-house snobs are now officially lost their pedestal of self-righteousness. The quality of your precious genre levels now overlap films like the army of darkness? Eat! ?? Showgirls. How do you like their apples?
