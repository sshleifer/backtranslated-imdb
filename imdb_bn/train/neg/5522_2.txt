I have searched the exact word to describe this image. At first I just wanted to avoid more important things, because the film can not comment adequately. However, I stopped, as the challenge presented by the question, describing stuff and curious about the question: "What can anyone say about such a movie?" Garbage? No, it's not junk, some of the garbage can be reused in useful. Green house gas? No, it is not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help the plants grow larger and better. Finally, I used the word "bad" to repeat the word "never mistake", sometimes theoretical physics describes a theory that is frustrating and even not suitable for correction. Still Georgia rule: not even worse.
