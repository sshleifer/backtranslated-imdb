I absolutely despise this movie No doubt Jos√© Laraz has denied it "agreed" and refused to discuss it. I appreciate Larry's work, especially his more obscure slashers like Sex Leave or Scrum and DAA / Sex Panic Thriller. As part of his second career as a painting and cartoonist, his work has its infinitely childhood, which he can not switch. It is very bad that he never made Western, his vision could have been perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its notoriety revolves around a scene where Satanic cavity breeding a goat Creates a wicked conspiracy involving the liquid - symbolizes the monastery - for example, to make sister a sister for murder, a bit annoying left is used to make vomiting her role as the devil's bride. The question is handled in such a way that the goat seems rather convinced only by not displaying any plumbing equipment, it depends on the actress's animosity to perform the role of the performer in the genre and hear a half-dozen films that account for the much reinforced musical score of the coconut film Jackinto Molina. The opposite nature of the scene is more applicable than graphic detail, which was slightly increased, which said that the supplier is actually a teenage adult teenager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Directed by Eurohora's Sensation Helgie Line, these satans belong to doctors, lawyers, landowners, and other top-crust masters who actually give their professional success in their worship of Satan. All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, just look for someone who can sell you for a small personal conflict or you can meet swords. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to combine this titled devil trip with chat or graphic sex, and correctly. Spanish thriller traditions, which became popular in part of Molina and Miss Line, should be regarded as a theorem or final form, and until 1976, the Spanish-controlled dictator who made the generiscium franco unbelievably shine with insulting eyes. He was at his command that the Spanish film was free from the graphic imagery of sex scenes on the screen. Spanish directors have often made two versions of their movies, one for secret for their own screens, and one with the display of adultery show. As much as the filmmakers had as difficult to express themselves, the result was a striking tension that usually flirts with artists' bans: In the 1970s there is a special taste of Spanish horror, a taste obtained. This is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> At the end of 1970, when Spain was having a very dry dry spell in the midst of dominant culture of Franco, their Gothic fortress and giant strangers suddenly passed away. Compared to new sensations like JAWS and Star Wars. Apart from Franco's limitations, there was a sudden flood of graphic thrillers that came out of the pipe in the late 80s / early 80's, in which the black candles are probably best known for their emphasis on sexual orientation with the wildcat creature. Larrez's main horror films have always circulated around the sex table (Vampire's homosexuality, Scrum and Dea and the persecution of rebellions), but the overwhelming influence here is influenced by the rest of the production. Nobody is worried about a traditional censored trip throughout Burner, and almost obscure exercise showing a cut version without a barn scene. The penis is not enough graphic to lose as obsessive and not enough cold to lose as cold. So black candles must be a code of conduct - how big a community of British socialist societies can behave in the West Midlands or whatever their monolithic palace. Actors / actresses sit around in sex scene and discuss a lot. The best thing to do for the film is that ClusterAbobia's arbitrary torture environment, most of its steps are being taken inside the most limited internal interior of Mrs. Line's Palace. Almost every method of supernatural adultery has been indicated that fans of soft-core sex romp will be entertained with supernatural trauma hunting, and of course, sex offenders among us will scream their chicken goat in a wild forest scene. But the final conclusions of the movie are fools, provocative, insulting, and possibly otherwise perfect for forgotten practices in forgotten sled. <br /> <br /> 2/10; This movie is not the same without burning goat, and with the view it is probably a little more for most visitors. Larraz was right to deny it.
