America needs the best people in America to win "games" so that they hire it? A gymnast (Oh brother!), Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the necessary skills to win a game, including Nija, a madman village and Richard Norton, who asked Kurt Thomas to keep his hardware in his pants. (Its correct word) I missed it in the theater and this is a good reason because I was probably kicked because of frustration due to breaks in regular intervals. What happened through my mind is that a gymnast can kick his ass, but how much is this ninja, Curt Thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he has rarely acted as a "best person for the job", as well as acting talent of Kurt Thomas, if you can not say anything good ... but everyone should have the comfort of how much a fool to think Using cocaine. As a scientist, they are just stupid to decide to throw Reed here. For 18 years though it was the title of the most cruel movie I saw in my eyes. Saying I found this unwatchable, I had so much laughing about I suppressed death almost. Twice Only 80 of them can be made a movie that creates a bad idea. Although it seems to be the only scary film to be so scary for the record, yet he can not pull a painful sword from the ground. This is the wimpiest action movie ever made, and one of the most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * 4 out (bad)
