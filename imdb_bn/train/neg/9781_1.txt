I do not think I have been saying so far that perhaps it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm working on a list of my favorite films: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Koi" (all black and white) with all the good plots, rich characters and great acting. I saw good conversations and played a work drama in student-written high school. The plot, however, is not a bad compound - only poorly implemented. It's like a traffic accident, though I could not stop it! The movie does not require big money or big sets, such as "twelve engage man" and "lifeboat" can be good ... so the budget is not an excuse. What did they think?
