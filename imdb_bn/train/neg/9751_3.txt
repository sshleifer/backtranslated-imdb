The only reason I do not give this movie less than 3 stars is because it does not equal a movie like Manaus: The Hands of Feet. The greatest crime in this movie is that it is head-boringly annoying and terrible, uncertainly British. The potential of this movie is probably potentially committed, complete teleporting concept, but the direction that they went with was completely uncertain. It was a movie about research funds and bowties than the laser project. Actors were wood, neutral, and different. As was the love affair between two scientists - which was nothing but a joke. I was not able to say what the attraction was among them as chemistry had existed. I do not really understand why the floor-facing chief man decided to kill all those who met? At least now I know that before I spend their research grants, I can always give a fair hearing to others, otherwise they are unknowingly killed with stupid elephant gestures.
