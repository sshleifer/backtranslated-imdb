I read Rice's novel with interest, and became very excited with its characters and heartwarming stories based on historical truth. <br /> <br /> However, I have applied easily to this devastating adaptation. Welding is not only based on physical appearance, and played talent (with Peter Gallagher's explicit exception, who was neither blonde-haired, or able to work on his way to a wet paper bag). In influencing French pronunciation, Cast was ridiculous in the shameful and inconsistent efforts, but not in a recreational way. I saw myself winning with this mixed and melodramatic tripe, and I was amazed at the end. <br /> <br /> An alert to the novel fans - stay away from this.
