After an extraordinary ankhen (2002), a remix of a Gujarati game came with the WHT that looks like a platform <br /> <br /> On the stage plays, we shouted shouting and screaming. /> <br /> The first half makes fun with Amitav 40+ character Kumar, who works very interesting like small children <br /> <br /> This picture does not ruin your son but sadly how to get a good message . Amitav wants to blame Akki, absolutely forgery <br /> <br /> To hide his illness, his Raninaine and Akki musician conversations in the hospital <br /> <br /> <br /> Some emotions <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh rubbishes more than half of the first half of the actresses, but Akshay Kumar plays very well in his mental scene. Some thought was uncomfortable Bay. His chemistry with children is remarkable, Rajpal is a brightness, he laughs you without being ineffective and his appearance and his folly and humor of death is a riot. The bombs are good in some comic sections but there is nothing to do with Priyanka's heroine too much, yet his last film with Akki is amazing, although he is very young for the child
