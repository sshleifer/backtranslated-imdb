Sorry, you've created amazing movies in the past that are neutral in politics and for good reason, the backbone is your weak point and they have weakened the film in a beautiful, amazing movie with these ruthless characters, conversations and intrigues. Good luck to your next brush. Another thing that worn my crank was that it was not enough to eat these people, due to hunger, the absolutist point of LA homeless section.

Yes those people are hungry and if they need it then it is available. Low in the hunger center in America, I would say it's the center of alcohol, drug addiction, mental distress, and financially devastating centers.
