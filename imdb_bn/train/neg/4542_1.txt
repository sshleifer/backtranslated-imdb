I went to see this movie with a crowd of "spiritual" New Age, which was fantastic like me, enjoyed this movie a lot --- although those who knew the book (apparently there is a book there also this nonsense), movies Not quite good. So, if you think of yourself as "spiritual" then believe or at least tolerate elements like "aurora" and "bone body" and can not use the word "energy" repeatedly out of context. Physics or technology, you can actually love the movie, and perhaps it can enjoy more based on any book. <br /> <br /> However, if you interact with most of the physical universe, your ability to suspend disbelief is easily based on the secret and new plates of the new era, as well as less to the effects of Chesky light effects to reflect on your spiritualism. There is tolerance and may even expect to play an unreasonable wooden conversation, but you have to My recommendation: Stay! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, this film has transferred Dangiz and Dragons as the worst movie I've seen personally in the movie theater (I do not count films that I'm going to get them to be bad I have planned to look forward to expectations, such as plan 9 etc.) At the same time, it raises rough movies which I went to about two (D & D is the other). I do not even play in movies, even this, but for the first time when I saw an outer visual plot, I should have done it because New Age BST is getting thicker and thicker than that point. <br /> <br /> This plan is about a group that seeks spiritual insights and helps mankind to take the next stage of evolution, involving themselves in some old predictions. Or something like that. They are talking about the next phase of evolution of human beings on this spiritual component, which can create a person whose human evolution is the smallest concept. Full shock with whoppers like that movie. Sometimes people describe "another dimension" or perhaps "another plane", which may disappear from those who do not acquire the miracle around them. love. At the end of the day, the director publishes the "Insight" publication, the audience slows down slowly, so that we can remember them and leave the movie as a better, more enlightened person. <br /> <br /> Good thing about the movie? Some very nice nature shots and some modest supporting acts by Elizando and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that it strongly affects my ability to take a person seriously by treating the movie as attractive or acceptable. It's really the most na√Øve kind of elastico spirituality, and unless it's your thing, you have something better with your time and money.
