Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, unknowingly operated, scripted, acting etc. This film is based on Isabel Alende's novel novel. I hate Merrill Strip and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish movies), and my favorite actress and other actors, including Jeremy Iran, try hard to get such scary scripts. With lots of mistakes (for example, how many days in Chile?) And very cruel, with the badness of "magic reality", it has stood as the worst movie of all time. It sucks completely !!!
