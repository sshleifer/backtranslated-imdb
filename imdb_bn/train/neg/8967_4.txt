Follows the same path as maximum sequels. The first one was great. The second was average and it was one, bad acting and with some stupid dialogue, like many suspensions of unbelief, the film was poor. <br /> <br /> It is very predictable and I could have Henry Rankler sitting like that stupid eyes, they could do more with it. I liked one of the first one. I want them to go down more than those lines, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> A lot of explanations need to be explained, what was this time and why why old fashion phones in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another one in the works. <br /> <br /> <br />
