I often do not go out of my way to write comments, but for that I just had to warn someone, they might see that they could see a comedy by watching it. Do not stop this. Although the actual transformation of prizeies ​​(color / sex / change) is fairly bad (and long ago, well done, long ago), actual transformation of two black girls is actually one of the least reliable conversions placed on the screen. If the script is needed then it will be bad enough for white change. However, Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. You will now be guessed by, they fail completely. I have seen drag quenches without makeup, they can make women more trustworthy than special effects and Hollywood suppliers makeup people. Her fearsome. Mix a basketball player like a building, a terrible dialogue, and more plot holes than the golf course, and this movie hits a new personal hit. And I like bad movies! Avoid like plague.
