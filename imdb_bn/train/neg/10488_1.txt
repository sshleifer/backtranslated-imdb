Elvis has left the building and he is lucky because he will not see this unfunny stinker. Scenario director Joel Jike later finds out the ways to make an unfunny script even less fun. Filled with illogical death, reducing gay characters and hacking jokes, this movie is even more awesome than being fun. This is a kind of movie that one hopes that Kim Basinger follows Doris in retirement. Let us think about him (gifted) and he has not done that. David retired, delicious Dennis Richards and all the rest have lost talent here. Djuuk finds ways to reduce his talent towards every turn. The person playing Elvis sounds more like a king than Gomar. The only good bit of casting is that little girl who plays as a binge demon. She really looks like her and is actually quite good. The only reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hendes Camio. Kaymo is not funny at all, but at least it's not painful. Jacqui has seen pictures of Hanks or some movies that make him the film.
