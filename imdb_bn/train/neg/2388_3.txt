No one will try to get Tom Robins from the screen for the screen. Although the film is great and performance is good, the conversation works well, it is shocking during the conversation. Or, it would not be possible to recommend any other way that someone else's name would be written in radium. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks like a badly adapted cliff. Book notes - Most of the book is hacked in the fifth part of the book size, in terms of backstory and current stories, and the last is different (and unexpectedly) from the book. Most of the plot in the book is lost, in which everything eventually makes sense, and there are multiple references that tell viewers that "Hu?" Unfortunately, not a worthy effort, the book has been burnt, burnt, and all the actors have been sent to do something good. I highly appreciate Gass Van Sant, but none of his capabilities could create a suitable film for this complex book, without even creating minniris.
