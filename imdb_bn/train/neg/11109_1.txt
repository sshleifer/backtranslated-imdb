I really get this amazing movie a ranking! I have not seen such a bad movie for years. It was a really bad movie. Splatter, unnecessary (almost funny) blood is not enough to describe the scene. If you do not like Hostel 2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), it's 10 times bad. The story reminds me of RL Stine's Husband! <br /> <br /> I can not say about this act because the script was so terrible. (Why should I write 10 lines? I never realized) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> This story is about killing people everywhere in Metro. We are talking about thousands of murders and no one has received notice. Indeed those people are just missing. And there are good people trying to solve the mystery (there is no secret to us because we know the bad guy from the beginning) and naturally nobody believes in him! What a surprise! In the end, he beat the slaughterhouse and the killers of the Butcher!
