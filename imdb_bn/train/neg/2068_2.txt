Lou's Gospel was a big disappointment for me. I received an e-mail from the theater that it was a great and inspirational film. It was not great nor inspirational. Cinematography was beautiful with the whole movie. Many scenes were flashbacks that they could never say. Voice is often distorted for no reason. Most of the film's collections have so far been collected. His relationship with his former son was never clear. Also the whole movie has one way to him, and then suddenly BAM, he is cured and inspirational people. The whole movie shows that boxing is one of the worst things in her life, she lives her way of living her life, but when she changes, she does not leave boxing, how she teaches others the box. Frustration
