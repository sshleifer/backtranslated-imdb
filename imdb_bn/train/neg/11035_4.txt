This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through. In the afternoon, the perfect movie for a lazy housewife, in the afternoon, to roam around the house and the eighth hole, high-hedged mule sitting in the afternoon to live in the afternoon. Actually, forests play a prominent role in the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> In most of her movies, she moved very quickly to get a better look. The only quick action of this exhibition is that Giancarlo Giayanni is getting hands on Latin emotion - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialog is as solid as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect mannered and lightweight. The warm, bloody old-world family of warm-blooded old world is like the mountains. What happens to Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Before the end of the title I knew that I do not expect this movie. The bright grapes looked like Paragon of All Food Advertising on Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his name list, but the art director was certainly Thomas Kincad, who snugged Fillion in the Irish Cottons for millions of dollars on canvas. This film is literally seen through pink colored glasses. If you like the dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (Bonbons looked really good, too!)
