Someone will tell me waist ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Shane) Very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) is so weak (with him!), and the whole matter is so thick! <br /> <br /> * They tried to create a live comic book which became a super bloody comic nightmare and was not funny? Like planning scenes in the bathroom; It was so good with his cinematic imagination but there is nothing else to do! <br /> <br /> * Donald Switterland ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Being so deluded by so little artwork and entertainment has been looted from us so there was no entertainment entertaining! <br /> <br /> * Well, if it is a big product and plays Brando, then the golden year with a real star <br /> * Shane's family here. <br /> <br /> * Anyone who loves to thank or thank God for this movie! Then you can go straight to the therapy before becoming more dangerous! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius but not a movie! And he was definitely not willing to be one here after reading this !! But the main problem is that anyone who tries this thing, or wishes, can be smart or even better !!! (Sorry i'm crying now! The film torture is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) strikes his shoes (Mira Sorvino)! Was that so realistic? Maybe she saw herself in her, so she punished herself so painful! <br /> <br /> * For millions of times: it might be a good (or less bad!). The script was excellent for the train's head, and I just imagined that they could have left behind some other things (smoky and bandit) but as a sheriff (brando). Actually, the chimis I saw were much more compassionate than that! <br /> <br /> * Why is this Masterpiece not a Razzie Award? Do you want me to believe that there were fewer films than this? I do not think so! This is a situation where Razzi supervisor must win himself for his negligence !! <br /> <br /> Martyn Shane is here as a guest star to support his guest boy, but surprisingly the father failed as his son! And why? Well! Because I hate Martin Shane because I hate comic movies as well as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy movie, no .. This is a horror !, and I just hate scary movies, especially those who have been promoted as comic! <br /> <br /> * Is it good? Hmmm! Well, it is comparatively comparable to the other Marlon Brando's giant movie (Casablanca) - (Island of Dr. Moro). <br /> <br /> If you still want to know which bad thing is bad or who is right, ugly and very ugly. Just pray for your last prayer and see it. You!
