The movie itself is not too bad; Many comments point to the script's obvious error, but it is watchable. Actually gives me the cripps, though people like Justin Timberlake throw it for the movie and on top of it for the movie. I must admit that I have never heard of this number before the number, but at the moment he appeared, I was just generally annoyed. Voice strap, face is a horrible, posture off a bad holes in the legholas, and he can not even combine three correctly. I said, when he left the disco, I was happy, because I was expecting that it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Too bad I was wrong. These two and the LL CoolJe perform very well, and I can give it 4 reasons. <br /> <br /> I watch Timberlake with many upcoming movies with Cast ... and can not believe me.
