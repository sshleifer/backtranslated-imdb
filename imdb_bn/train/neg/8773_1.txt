If you see very few movies then it can be big for you. You watched many movies, it's a joke. The acting of real heroes is very poorly portrayed. Not to mention, there are songs, lots of flashbacks and most importantly, war scenes are performed foolishly. The new character, the good direction, has done a good job, but it contains all the Bowievideo Heroes / heroine, you can predict what's going to happen next. If something happens, you do not feel sad, the emotions that get started are terrible because we saw this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. It estimates to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show. Many times you think, there are thousands of soldiers who have joined the army and the Pakistanis are bombing them and none of them bombs them. Are the ripe watched really or the director look their stupid? There was only a few characters acting very well, but as far as it is concerned with the plot, action, it is indicated poorly. This movie may be short when they take out the movie, flashback, point stick.
