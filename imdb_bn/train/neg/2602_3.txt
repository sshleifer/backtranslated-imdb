Drew Barrymore looks like his arrogance throughout the city and it's really going to be a butt pound. <br /> <br /> After getting a flat from Hei Hack writer, face her 'other Drew'. More frequent Authors-young people think that it is his duty to rob him of 'real drew' from Stupour, so he can help him as soon as he can spend some time with him. Not too interesting, even less terrible, but the drake is as sexy as normal, especially when he gives fingers to a group of rude construction workers ... yeah, that's the heat! <br /> <br /> The best view may be that where Dru is his realistic mother, Jade, with a big kitchen knife ... Hmm ... and how was your day?
