Sincerely, I love old movies and their simplicity altogether but last night I saw it for the first time and it easily slogans me into my lowest five. This love was supposed about stories or zombies ??? This movie was so bad that how sad I was after the end of the way I was finely finished. Thankfully, I do not think it's too serious to shut the movie without seeing the whole thing, or I do not see sitting sitting together! I want to say something positive about something in life, so by adhering to this theory I will accept the most positive property of this film, it was too short for full-length movies.
