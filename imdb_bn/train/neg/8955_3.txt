As far as the movie is running, it's a fine science fiction movie. It contains lots of cool stuff and has some quality visuals. That said, it's not good, and some things are brought away quite a bit ... <br /> <br /> This is another carbon-movie and not a whole bullshit! It's a great definition of milking a great and innovative original movie ... Its full feeling can be translated into the original part, but the role of humans / Android as part of the "team" behind the density extends somewhat ... <br /> <br /> I gave it a 3 because of the real baiting. It should have been sterilized in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Visible to those who have not seen dense and hyper-ube, but not recommended for fans of the series ...
