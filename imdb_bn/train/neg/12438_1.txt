Beating the bad boy ... Again the tag line for this movie, reveals so much truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home Alone One and Two, Movie Classic. Three of the house and four, one good film if you three! It's hard to try to be fun, like Sharkaboy and Lavin, but it's hard to try. Culkin is replaced by Alex de Linz or anything else. He is very happy actor with soft performances, but it is not entirely his fault, the word of writing is said to be the sound word and flexible expressions. The first two of the curiosity are copied with different crocodiles and you want to be blind to these chicken poxes. If you are an estimation teacher, this film is a good choice which shows this film on a rainy day. And to make things worse, if you do not trust me, you will be sorry for it.
