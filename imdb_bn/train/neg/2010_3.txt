Oh, this is the film - I thought I waited too much to find the dog ... I can not believe I saw the whole thing. I hope I was optimistic that it would be better. Horribly hesitant dialogue, kind acts, and completely unstable facts. Like the mother of Tobias, hanging himself, the colonel was able to walk in the house to walk 24 'ceiling, a chair, a counter or its continuously suspended body around a little bit. The daughter of the last family was the best actor of the whole movie and the first couple's dog was close. Basic storylines can be potentially and with a good scripts and a severe vague flick of the director, but this version is not sadly it is either. I am more afraid when I open my electric bill every month.
