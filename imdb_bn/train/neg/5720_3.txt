Some Gourhound-friends have suggested "Live Feeds" to me, and basically I can not really complain that this film certainly provides a lot of smoother and bucket-full buckets, but of course this is not a very good movie. More than explicitly monetized in the latest trends in the horror movie, so-called torture, Ryan Nicholson tries to overcome all other therapies in this theorem (and "hostel" and "sh") and twisted make-up effects and nude co-eds thoroughly with his illness. Trying up the depraved shots, enjoying and begging for their life. There is no real plot to describe. Five roughly intelligent twenty-some friends travel to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but I do not know why they liked to travel instead of Cancun. They are not particularly interested in the continent's culture and a cute puppy in the market creates a violent scene in the dog's local public interview. Quantet later entered the life of a brutal night and one of them accidentally insulted a leader of a criminal group. A simple apology is definitely not enough, because gangsters follow their adult theater and gradually they are victims of severe torture. A girl has torn her chest and another poor bird has a poisonous snake under her neck. Father "Live Feed" Despite all the bloodshed, it is very difficult to ignore the surprisingly annoying and amateur industry standards, even if you use it to watch an independent fan-boy trash movie like this. The covered fat block of the covered S & M Executioner is perfectly calm and he is the most gifted of the whole group, because at least his mouth is kept full. I certainly would not recommend this pile of holes, but hey, if you like loud and harmful metal music, the pictures of annoying torture and gradually get damaged, go ahead and watch!
