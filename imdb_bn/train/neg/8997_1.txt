I have sometimes seen that it is the worst movie and the "worst ever they saved Hitler's brain" in addition to the exception is the worst movie. When this movie came out I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and so I thought it could be a fun movie that could be produced, since it did not have restrictions related to TV Improv Shows. <br /> <br /> The authors must think that we have some inferiority, some fatigue jokes, some cheaper sex and hey, a risky side-split funny comedy. Let's make a deal with the game show skits stupid grossness is nothing more than taking away the unimaginable cheap. The City Complex was close to single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor. Stun gun advertising was a comedy suited for Seasame Street. El Sabeway Skit was delighted humor to use bloodlessness. The French chef is moving around in the dark, "there is no difference" with French accent, you get my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny chit was on Chavie Chase that went full-time. This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I've read the comments of stone throwing the whole country in the 1970s and if you are high then you would love this movie. Most of the 70 countries have not been robbed. If the inactive author is thrown stones then it will be on drowsy sinus medication. In addition to the 4 different people in the theater I did when I saw this movie. Of course, the word was not bad yet.
