All right, I bought this movie from Wahlyorth for a joke on my friend on his birthday, because the front cover was sexual orientation in him. <br /> <br /> But we decided to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it must be, one of the worst movies in history <br /> <br /> <br /> It just started, and we thought "OK. Actually okay ". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken. <br /> <br /> It started when the most obvious character of the "mysterious paint baller", Scaucer / Australian (I said because of its pronunciation which was not recognized), I can not act, I just could say, Was frustrated. <br /> <br /> then it was over, and at that time, we all lost the desire to live. Paint ball final <br /> <br /> What I like about this plot is that they did not win, but they won by default. <br /> <br /> I know there is nothing to do with it, but the name given to the group was only terrible. Serious damage I mean that they can pick out more awesome names, such as "the destroyer of anti-Christ" or something. Or whatever the film should say whatever.
