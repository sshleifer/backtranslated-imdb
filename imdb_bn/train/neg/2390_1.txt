I absolutely love the books of Tom Robins, so I was very excited and interested in watching a movie made after a book. I knew that the movie would not capture more than half of Robins' Magic, but after watching the film it did not let me read the book again. The movie Even Ever Cowgirls Get The Blues does not include eight things in the book, and it focuses more on love connections between Bonjana Jellybin and CC. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the film, I think the good actor must definitely pick up the characters. The only actor in the film which I think was his role in the book of Robinson, Julian's friends, at the beginning of the film, their five-minute clip. Those who can not read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a huge fan of Tom Robins, this movie was nothing but disappointment.
