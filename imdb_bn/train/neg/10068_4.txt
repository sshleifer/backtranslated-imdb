A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of the nearby Indian tribe has been wrongly accused of rape and murder of the main daughter, which leads to many hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is impossible to defend on any artistic level. The terrible dress and all the Indians are obviously white, it shows more like a live action cartoon than a serious production that claims to be its press articles. <br /> <br /> In short, the inadequacy (the real reason to see this) is good. Everything else is not there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps for this killer it was already hit the Pussycat Theater Soda-Stained Screen!
