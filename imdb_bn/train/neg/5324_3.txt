Vovochka your daily secret vs. authority movie. The main character Vwokaka is initially branded as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the knowledge of some elderly people he met on the path, he was able to strictly change his rogue ways, but it is worth doing. Personally, I was an actor who played very disgusting for Vwococo being sympathetic, but the vowel change in the film can mostly express feelings of emotional struggle, when Vwokaka wants to be her good but bad. This struggle makes the film a little different than other movies in the same genre, which I used to give a little taste. Above all, although I did not really care for this film, it was probably the target of a young audience.
