You want to see the Dead Gentlemen Productions movie "The Gammers". This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's time to waste <br /> <br /> All the best comments here seem to be written by false third parties (bad camouflage). People who have made this movie seem to try to synthesize the fake interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good job. Compared to "Spinal Tap" or Christopher's guests, insulting. <br /> <br /> This movie is so meaningful that I can not imagine the issue that is funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are Lampuna in this way, you have to hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Because of this, the film is not objectionable. The prohibited subject is grand satirical but for its constant pain.
