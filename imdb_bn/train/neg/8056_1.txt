The obscure, annoying, and inconsistent supernatural "thriller", which is the case of college student Casey (Melissa Sajmiller), is the victim of the accident and the continuous victim of nightmares, the life of his boyfriend Shan (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not start to tell you how bad it is ... nothing happens to anything important and sometimes there is no real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this special film - they all are sadly uncomfortable (again, their role is not good). This is a joke to promote this as a scary film. Where are the fears? There is no sense or mystery - there are some good songs but it's about him. <br /> <br /> How did the project get green in the world? Writer-director Steve Turner does not have any spectacular vision or talent that I can understand. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the entire movie dull. <br /> <br /> The "killer cut" I saw is 86 minutes pure tidium. <br /> <br /> 1/10
