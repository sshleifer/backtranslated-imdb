Okay, this stupid, they do not make their nightmare films, it's "last" one ... and what do they do? They went to create another one, not the next one (part7) was bad, but why they play us. However, this movie was not created in any sense in any sense, it was extremely extreme, the letters were very diminutive, Freddy was another joker, which is too stupid for the good series. The plot is very bad, and it's even worse than Part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a stupid story 3-D, pointless! Say ID. I hated this picture so much that I remember all the parts like the whole movie. It is much different than before, tries and tries it, but it tries to make it harder, and face face. There were many death scenes there, although they were different, they sucked big time. How have they gone so far? Did they see that they made the biggest mistake between 2 and 5? Yet they make it? It raises all the money, do not use this enemy for the Nightmark series. <br /> <br /> I woke up at night on 3 nights of 10 in LM Street Six (6). <br /> <br /> Good point of film: The plot was possible. The bad aspects of the film: Very funny to be classified as terrible acting / lack of death / horror / very confusing.
