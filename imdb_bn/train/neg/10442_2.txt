Apart from all the Internet buzz, this movie was horrible to God. I hope to be more of a farce than the movie. Instead, filmmakers tried to create a serious thriller / horror film, and they missed out completely. There were some good parts of Samuel Jackson and some good lines. Furthermore, it was a bunch of gore and some lazy animated snakes. Internet poker was better than mile than all the actual movies. Now the movie has really come out, hopefully this trick will die. This piece of hyped trash does not waste your time or money. If you're looking for something that is fun and entertaining, then just go to a blog post.
