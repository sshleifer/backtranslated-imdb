I was thrilled to see this movie that it can be a continuation of classic classic "private lessons" which portrays the dream of a teenage teenager. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything to do with the title "Personal Lesson II." It's just a regular soft-core synonym flick that will not change anything in your life. There's just a hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. I have seen this long ago but believe that this is just a regular boring soft core flick. <br /> <br /> Women are hot but not enough to hire or buy movies. My suggestion is to watch it only if the air on the cable is on it.
