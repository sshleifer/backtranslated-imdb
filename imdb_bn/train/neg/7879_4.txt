First off, I want to say that I liked the farm farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was fantastic. We decided that the film would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. Cut some characters in the movie, and miss a lot of the main points of the book. It skips a lot, and does not explain anything more detail. If anyone sees this book before reading the first book, they will be confused. This movie was the last of my most frustrating thing. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was dry in a coalition and was considered "molten" with men and together, but instead, the film seems to suggest that animals were going to rebel against pigs. Collectively, I do not think that the film has taken the real meaning that Orwell is portrayed in his book.
