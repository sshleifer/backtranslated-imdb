I was sitting around one episode of this series and could not take anything anymore. It seemed as if I had already seen dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ... there is nothing new here! I heard the trick in Seinfeld, I saw that some of them read like friends, an episode of Happy Days was almost the same story, ect. None of the actors are attractive here! Some people were better (not here) in other shows and others were new to a profession that they could never enter. Avoid this stinker!
