I hope this film is awaited, that it will be insightful and upbeat. Of course, more than the cheap promotion for the "band", we got many moping instead, and we were very surprised about the "process", and a very few band members' screenplay was made by Lead singer / The song writer, who had received intimate confessions from a friend of a fallen member - for 18 years - "friendship was driving his way" and who was such a strange story They labeled them "hurt their feelings" by dumping them, so that the band could get more than 50 offers from other labels (oh, pull ... not!) They tried their best to look like a strain like this, but I did not have it That all doubts that there was a tragedy was smoke and mirrors. It's not even a long stretch, where we introduce our newest songs completely in a story, insight or even a movie without a decent work to us. Annoying attitudes from emotional sincerity or a reasonable perspective on life make me sick. <br /> <br /> From this film, this band sounds like little kids, who find voices that they can not find any words and they remember some kind of guardian for the music industry, which they are most definitely not . And I thought, the music was slim, and I could not understand the song due to the casual style of singing. <br /> <br /> I can give it 2/10.
