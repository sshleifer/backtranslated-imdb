Yet another film from Alfred Hittak seems to have come out of the contract's obligation. As Juno and Pacak, you can say Hitako was not very interested in this movie. It has almost no style or craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple who brings some money and go to a cruise that proves to be their marriage test. Emily has a new heart, a good heartfelt, rich person who has fallen in love with her, but she likes to take high roads and stay with her husband. If Fred can not be completely insensitive, it may seem more believable, a fanatic who has jumped into the first opportunity of leaving his wife for another woman. The couple end up having a stay together, but the lack of any real coordination in the movie. The third law goes from a completely different direction, the couple is trapped in a abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian liner. Joan Barry gives a very stirring performance as a faithful woman faithful woman. That's all you can say for this one.
