This is probably the worst I've ever seen in a movie ... Never And what to do with casting One of Lady Nike's incarnations in this movie is incomplete and almost impossible to watch at any time during her stomach. You can go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoon and easily find more than 50 eligible, better prospective women. I made an unfortunate mistake in renting this movie because it was a "cool" DVD case. It seems that this movie is just a few categories of projects for a group of multimedia students of local tech college. I could not spend this hour so that the film shows public access television ... at least special effects are good and people who are more attractive than anyone else can see in this film.
