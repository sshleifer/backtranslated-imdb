I got this movie at Walmart at $ 5. I would not recommend watching this step. If I am angry with them and want to disturb them for 2 hours, then I can give it to my friends. <br /> <br /> I looked around in life and kissed with a summary and thought that it was a movie of war. I'd like to tell how annoying this film is going to be before launching it. There was something wrong with something going on in this movie. It's just going from one group of one group to one other chest camp. Drill sergents behave very badly with soldiers and try to help the main character out of war in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> My gems about this movie: To me, this movie is slow and difficult to see. It's just one of the movies you've kept and stuck because you want to stop it, but it's a string of hopes for your hanging that it can get to the end. It's not After the film ended I was through my TV behind it because I was angry that I had seen my life for about two hours, and writing for 10 minutes to write a warning to people.
