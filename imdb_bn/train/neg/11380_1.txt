When I first saw Robotbi, I found it fresh and interesting, but I noticed that with each episode this show is trying to learn how to behave, which is good / bad. The episode was predicted. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a very high intelligent son, his elder brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: Girl and lean boy beat Also this show has no logic. A super-modern robot who works in two AA-size batteries and can use a lot of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between active and super-active modes. We see two different robots, and reduce the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn how to behave in human society"
