Okay, there's a Hit-Man (Scott Glenn) in Mexico who hit a trip after hitting the American writer and his Mexican friend. He let them take them to the border ?? But things come out of hand. <br /> <br /> It starts well enough, but struggles fast and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The last relationship Twist is set up badly and hard to believe. There is no reason to leave the emotions, and essentially leaving one for another, it makes it ridiculous - and the last was expected and lazy. <br /> <br /> ** The last spinner ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Kettel is the US agent of the Hit-Man Trail, but how annoying the script is and slowly he feels a little distraught ...
