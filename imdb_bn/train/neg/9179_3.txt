It's cheese. If you want to be a video game, then the movie was very cheap to make special effects for it, how to do things like direct-to-computer-castaway sequences for action. My friend and I actually had a great time to see it, because the theater was mostly empty and we could have hit a bit. This movie really needs hacking. <br /> <br /> Plot? Had a Plot? Okay, some stupid colleges are invited to the next year's "Rev" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If they only live in Seattle, they would have survived." - Direct quote, or almost.) They arrive there and everyone has gone, and the site is somewhat destroyed (but hey, the velocity is still full!). With the help of a miserable old captain and a coastal guard lady (who had a little less difficult than Santos Rothrakk - and performed a little less good), they fight many zombies (some acid spit), get the ears of strange legends, and most of them die. It's about it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not like a BD like democoncus, but not much, and still better than that. (They are my own personal alpha and the kind of omega for bad films - the past is bad but fun to make fun, and the latter is too bad freaking to see it more often). On the other hand, if you are looking forward to a fantastic video game movie like Resident Evil, but run away !!! Escape now !!! <br /> <br /> Some real big questions (without too much spoilers): When the 18th century Spanish ships ran in the Pacific Ocean ????? Why is someone from the Pacific Runner Gun, and who - Canada, cry aloud ??? Why an anonymous An Rave (Oh, excuse me, it is "Isla del Murto", Shi'a, right) San Juan Island - and outside, still remember this Pacific Ocean. And about 30 were present in the Reva - "Rain of the year," My Pot <br /> <br /> Lucky thing has a lot of hitchhit around. Many of them. Everyone has them. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the movie starts playing with a little "parody" (I know what you did and knew the house), it did not carry through it. OK. <br /> <br /> Finally, - when the initial comment (in a voice-over, not a low) unexpectedly refers to one of the characters that "gave up his boyfriend to focus on his travels" Be sure to stay Not good fencing, but a group of people hacking on each other with a sword, however.
