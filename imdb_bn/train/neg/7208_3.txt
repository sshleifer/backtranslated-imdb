I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget Cartoon as a kid. It was like to get smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not be solved in any case and all the work is done by the dog and his nephew Penny talking about walking. I had heard live action movie so I checked it out in the library. I rent this movie for free and felt I should have let it look. <br /> <br /> Broader Don Adams' performance skills do not come anywhere near. Her voice was all wrong. Nothing looked like Penny playing girl cartoon Penny. The cartoon version was golden with the help of piglet. But he did a decent job given to work with her. Daben Coleman Chief Kambi gave a good performance as well. Sally was not hiding in any strange place or by accidentally spreading explosions to him in Gesze. <br /> <br /> The gadget was a mobile mistake. This has never spoken and it has been fixed in the series. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> The gadget in this photo was very intelligent. He was completely stupid in the show. Here he had half the modest intelligence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Wowser". It should always be and "Wowsers". It sounds out of hair with it. When they showed the previews, I got annoyed and did not have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The credit time was the only decent gags. In front of a support group for Clovis for the recovery of halloween / sidekicks Mr. sitting in the audience T, Richard Kyle, the famous face of Will Jaw, Herve Villachage, the same look, Audub, Kato and more. This is the only part I laughed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Don Adams says to the dog that "the brain is not right Please leave your name on the hoof. " Of course this is not funny funny, just a nice part of Nostalgia to hear Adams of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
