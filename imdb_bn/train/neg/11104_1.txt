I'm not a man who goes online after watching movies and it decides to call the worst movie ever made. If you suspect me, look at my other reviews. However, for the first time, I saw a movie so awesome that I wanted to write about how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. To me, Ed Wood was a genius, I thought bloody killings, Zippy Cripps and the most horrific horror films were good. However, there is not a good thing I can not say about this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But they can verify what they can do for themselves, but I advise that a nickel would be more valuable than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hide a movie for, but I invite someone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion before destroying any comments in this movie. I'll tell you something <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, and I love horror and I like new innovative movies. I like horror pornographic content (some critics have claimed that it was, but perhaps they thought Roger Bart was at this and Hostel 2). But it might be the number 1 number is most vain and fools and Dubma movies. <br /> <br /> And before you ignore this review, it's coming from someone who is not just sitting in the full premiere of the House of Dead. , But actually bought it a copy.
