Based on the personal experiences of Southern California University director John Schnalton, higher education comes. A central film about ethnic politics, described in modern day colleges. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters that laid the foundation of the film's foundation: Malik Williams, a free sportsman under African American men. Kristin Conner, a shelter soft white girl, and Remy, an essential unconnected white male. All three have suddenly been overcome by reality that college life is not as good as it is that the three have to go through frustration because of being unpleasant (helpless), helpless (Christian), and unwanted (Remy). > <br /> One good thing about this movie is that it shows that modern American colleges have only grown up the higher secondary schools. Colleges are not a place to create character, potential development or personal progress, but they are organized to combine all kinds of collective environments. This is an experience that is usually made for the failure of most students. It would have been better if the film wrote the story of this barbar instead of ethnic politics. <br /> <br /> But it was not there and the films there separated. Schnelton, it seems, was a very bad experience in Southern California. Through this photo he hangs out all. There is no need to beat near Bush here. Siglton allowed the hero and villains of this piece to be easily seen. <br /> <br /> The black characters of the film are seen as heroes here, when all white people in the film are seen as villains, for Kristin Save, a fellow student is raped by students. <br /> <br /> Who can understand this photo inconsistency? The black gang members who came to help the white girls, she ordered them who raped her? What is the comfort of the Black Gang members, and the head of the skin meets the dark little terracotta planning violence? <br /> <br /> The performance of Omar Aus (owner) and Christian Swanson (Christian) is frustrating. They feel like the third role played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Christian, but they were unavailable). Oissea Jackson Uk Ice Icecube, Boute Ramis and Regina King are annoyed in their respective roles. And as Lawrence Fisherman's history professor was unfortunately miscast here. Only Michael Rappappart played the role in this film and he considered the character of the three main character characters. The most changed in the picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < American college life with this photo. And he did so badly It was sorted like a fly shoot with a shotgun. Looks more complex than life and people are very similar and he should know it. Higher education proves that he does not understand all this. When watching the film, now and now only he will confuse the same public, be frustrated and angry, he wants to talk. It's not the least to mention their entertainment.
