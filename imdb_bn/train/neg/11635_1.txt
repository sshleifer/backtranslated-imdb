Okay, this is a small and sweet review ... Which of the films must have taken a lesson than the smaller and sweet life? <br /> <br /> This movie is worth $ ^ @%. It was a good reason to have a petition with more than 40,000+ signatures, all the freelancers of U Bow Bowl were asked to film from the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you have never heard them before thousands of times. These are acting descent but you can really blame the script for that only. They even wonder for a few seconds if they even use a script. <br /> <br /> There is no connection to the movie with the original games. Hello, if you're playing the game, you know that there is no real motivation for the main character. There are so many stories in the way for such a stupid movie. As I said. I do not even have to steal this movie. To talk about AND, keep an eye around 'The Most Interesting Movie of 2007' .........., the news is even better.
