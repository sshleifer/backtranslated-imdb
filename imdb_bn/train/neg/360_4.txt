I read the book and really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. However, when I saw the movie I was very frustrated. First, Deborah was not disrespectful to Rafin, but he was very mature to play 24/25 women. The late Christopher River also had the same mistake. According to the book, was about 30 years old. I would like to see more of his military life, his friend Red, Eli's travels, because it was an important part of the development of the stories. Ms. Bessie had a misconception that the book was her plus size lady. I know that the film was not budget for the "Madison County Bridges" budget, which I believe was released almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> But to me it is very bad, low budget, wrong movie. As someone mentioned, I want Miss Spencer to come out of retirement and write a screenplay for his books so that they have to be. He knows his letters better than anyone, I hope he will consider casting too. Let me down in the movie!
