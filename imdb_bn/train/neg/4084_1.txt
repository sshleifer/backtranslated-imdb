Audiences listen to the radio DJ inviting the audience to nominate the movie in such a way that the audience can not stand or watch at all. I think this movie ... after some time <br /> <br /> There is something to do with a game of Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I've made a balance of 20 minutes in this movie ... It seems that my tenelles will not clip themselves and they were looking sincerely to spend me. <br /> <br /> This movie is just boring and provocative to me. <br /> <br /> Although this is the first movie I've given so little a score (which I actually tried to see), I do not want English director Peter Greenway to stop other films. It seems to me that "cooking, thief, his wife and his boyfriend" were truly great British films, though sometimes occasionally stomach-a bright movie, but I understand why people see it. <br /> <br /> Another good picture was Greenway, "AZ and Two Nuts". Again, there were some things that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but they were curious. <br /> <br /> Another picture I usually delayed for such radio show is "Brazil". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Prosero's book is clean.
