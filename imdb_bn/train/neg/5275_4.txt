The invisibility of a couple who took away their family by spending time in New Mexico, and smuggled from the main highway to find out the city that had been abandoned for unknown reasons in 1948 and found himself in deep trouble. Beaver city seems to be the first ruthless and has a tourist appeal until the family is trapped overnight and they suspect that others have good reason to suspect that they face similar situations with their deadly consequences. Henles has left a Blair-Witch-project-esquire video diary left by the city's last victim, which is one of the best performances in this movie. Although Hamlin and Day's performances are much better than supporting casts, their emotional impact seems to be "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies have objection to invisible because there are many mysteries and good aspects. However, the conspiracy seems to be seemingly unpredictable and incredibly active in almost any sense. Even worse, there is no way to understand what is going on in the movie, which makes less tolerable at the end of the odd end. It appeared to me that the filmmakers were so focused on creating visible streams of scenes that they threw away all the elements of good storytelling: plot development, increasing interpretations of themes and symbols that lead to integrated solutions / results. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the movie for me is that the first three-fourths of the plot was spent on creating excitement and curiosity about some of the plots, which suddenly gave us an explanation as we did: <br /> <br /> What was the importance of Indian symbols on the wall? What is the real people of Weaver? What was the relationship with the people in the dinner? What does sheriff know? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, I invested several brain power to assume some possible explanation for this plot turn and strange phenomena, only filmmakers could end this without answering only these things. This is a nice cliffhanger for the end of a miniseries which is going to pick up again next week, but it's a complete disappointing and inappropriate finish for a stand-alone movie.
