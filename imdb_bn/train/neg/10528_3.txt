I chose this one because the music was completed by Hans Gimmer, a customer of MetasNox modular synths (made by someone dear to me). Jacket Art "2003 version" <br /> <br /> I think it's a powerful woman, a point for the CHG dialog and a last dot for the light blue eyes of MEG Foster, which has plenty of shots. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see David McClumen swim unexpectedly (the pool is a Plexix watch window!), while his lady love is being followed by Cyco in Greece. <br /> <br /> The set was slightly impressive - that is, the houses of LA and Mendasos (SP?) rich people, where the castle was. I wondered how I was able to clean up with all the dust blowing around myself. The wind was not terrible enough to be my credible. I used to think that animal pants should be nasty in the furniture ... etc. And unfolding the supposed plot when I am surprised these things that the film must understand quite annoying course. I started to burn in the fire, blown up the match, then why did I put the match in the fire? Stupid stuff like that. It was the best clunky. Well good Robert Moreli has enjoyed some fun with his Kiki Giza character and a nice vacation.
