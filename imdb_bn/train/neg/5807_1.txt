Do not get bored with this movie, it's bad to judge on its own merits, but it's just terrible when compared to the original (which is a classic) of 1972. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 film is worse than the book. It is not stupid, movies should never be prosecuted with books taken from them. They form 2 completely different art forms (this needs to be directed but apparently it will do). If you use this parameter for all movies, "2001" will suck and act as "forest gump" and "sheepskin silence".
