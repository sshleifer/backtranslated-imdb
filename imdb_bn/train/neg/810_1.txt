If you are a person who has found a great television comedy "by Jim", it will push your world. And I can add, to prove good talent, good writing and a charismatic star, I can add you to any network other than ABC, which really likes Jim Ballucci's year-round wind whip for years. <br /> <br /> "K-911" "Thank you" for all the talented people who love a big, steamy, brown, German Shepherd-like first movie. It's just that fans of the film and less deserve Belushi. Jim's comedic chops and projects are not far away from the ability to slaughter a blues standard. Try to reflect on different tendencies towards him so that he reduces every public project like Zoo Chippanzi. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your award.
