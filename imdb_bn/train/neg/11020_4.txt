First off ... with the names of Fred Aulen Ray, Brink Stevens and John-Michael Vincent, in the video box with distributors like "Reno" and "Tromas", you know how you're going to it. B movie Mania! If you're really looking forward to seeing a thriller based on "Adger Allan Poe", then forget it and manage headers directly for the excellent series of Roger Croon 60 films. It is pure, completely balanced with a pedestrian effort in a plot like a loose bed ("Prireme bariel"), with lots of rated, complete video sex and nudity. However, it is certainly fun in a manner of recreational and fun ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same fate that stems from his father (Hawk Howell). His helpless husband Terry (J Richardson) had some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster run by Robert Quair) and his strange, blonde, European-accessed sex-ship secretary Lisa (Delia Shepard) brinke for his money to stay away from the plots. Name-pricing actress Karen Black abandons a blonde wig as an hypnotist (she is very gifted to play such an important role), 50s sci-fi / horror star Robert Clark plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman plays an honest play For the continuation of nightmares that still perform an autopsy in the living wiki. January-Michael Vincent sits outside his house in most of the cars, entering the bino and leaving the house. <br /> <br /> - The plotter-for-murder-spouse has been plotted. Millions of times before, the finishing needs a bit of a strange smile on the riot (TERROR's direct rip off of the Zuni Factal Dell Segment) and anyone who needs to make a terrible holes and decapitated head FX for this release should be sharp on it. Brinke does an impressive job of her character a bit sympathetic, but how well her best is her role in all the biggest gorgeous ex-Penthouse pet Delia Sheppard. He gave every scene he stole and standout performance here easily.
