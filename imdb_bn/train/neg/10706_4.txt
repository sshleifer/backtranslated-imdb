Wow and I thought that Steven Seagull movie was bad. Every time I thought that the movie could not be bad, it proved me wrong. The story was good but the actors could not afford it. Also, they made many mistakes how accurate archaeological digs are done. For example, you are handwriting handwriting unless you are tech and accounting. The biggest crime of the cast was the archivologist girl. She was a weak actress and I made her acting really less realistic in the movie then it was already there. Over the years, the underground concept of Knight Templar was quite foolish for me. I liked the idea of ​​how invisible and stuff they were, so that almost looked depressed. I do not explain that letters well enough. You can not find many backgrounds and it has made it difficult to relate to them.
