For the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that perhaps it's probably the worst movie of Jackie Chan (except for her pre-1978 work, which I do not know). The sequence of final warfare has changed: it is long and good and intense - in fact, one of the highlights of Chan Carrier's highlights. But to get it, you have to sit across a lot of "comedy" which can be five years old (oh, see someone throw tomato out of his mouth) and enjoy the "football" scenes of endless. Dubbing is not mentioned (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - see what it means). "Dragon Lord" is only worth renting for the final war, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie collectors and even for those who have already seen at least 15 other films. (**)
