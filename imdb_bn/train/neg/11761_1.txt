Full drivel Deception, a miserable expression of toxic culture a decade ago. In this film, pedestrians have expressed regret for slavery with colonial titles (feeding red-handed rice?). Forget the historical reality. West Africa's most western slaves did not come? Is an American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a box of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not be an insult. Anyone can think, how will he fared in miniseries? (Immediately impaled maximum). Miniseries was fantastic, and it is unfortunate that DH should acquire a unique something to do with its hands, and make it shaky. (I tend to think it was hand to create this fiasco).
