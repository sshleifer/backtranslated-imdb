Millie is a SAP. He married a rich man named Maitland and had a child. Cheat and then he divorces her ... but her love for him is to keep him that the child was. Then in the early 1930's, he will be entitled to child support very spaujala and makes it easy to surprise him ... but ... no curse, without any support! Later, when he seems to be a lover and life is very good, he becomes deceitful too! Wow, is he enjoying a tough time? <br /> <br /> The mills change due to this bad relationship. Now she's a wild party girl - she does everything she can to confuse herself to her fate. Suddenly, many years passed. The daughter of the film from the very beginning has gone 17 years and has not changed one bit surprising fashion. Millie's an old friend (yes, it's another evil man!) To pretend to be the daughter of the girl, but her lecherous design. Millie promises to him that he touches the girl, he'll kill him. What will be next to take a wild guess! Overall <br /> <br />, the film is a confusing and often wicked mess - a little "Madame X" was like a lot of attention. So often seems to make Millie's motivation and little sense of action. And, like the film, which seems to throw little things - the idea that all men, as long as it is dry. Unusual but not particularly good.
