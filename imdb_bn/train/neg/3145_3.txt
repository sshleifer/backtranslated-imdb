I'm not sure how much they relate, but I'm pretty sure that the Lost and Dilereaus is remaking the film (or story based on it). Very similar platinum, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very similar. Missing and confusing are really good movies, so watch this instead. <br /> <br /> It comes very slowly, but by the end of the 60's, the French film, which is expected in the style. The school reconsidered to say in a retreat from the perspective of the girls. The editing of Flashbacks with the current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially audio from overlaps (i.e. listening to Flashbacks in current and so on). Also, "girls" are a bit older to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, you do not even develop many characters to connect to the film.
