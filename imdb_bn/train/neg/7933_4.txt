I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, but this film is a ugly. The whole thing really feels a canad, fake, soundstage with a horrible rear-screen projection. This is a good plot idea that the script has been successfully buried in a knighthood script, which makes the audience immersed in the work and really cherishes a unique character. Direction pedestrians, and instead of helping to improve it, the script is so bad that it accesses. I've thoroughly enjoyed the "Soundstage Productions" long ago, but it's not one of them. All of this praise you for the more scared Scott / Botic movie. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is ticking, triming and smiling millions of dollars across. She is always a pleasure in her worst movie. Along with Scott, I wanted to see the film, because of the other reason I had Miss Wyomer in Ariel Flynn's film "Rocky Mountain". In "Man Behind the Song", he is just as beautiful, and you can say that he is a good actress, but he was forced to say some nice fools, and was blocked by the director, that was really awful. I only saw Furbury in "Operation Pacific", and he played exactly the same character here ... A proudly-in-the-knot you want to beat unconscious. I guess he's a good actor ... he hates me. Comic Relief has some lumen attempts, in my opinion, only frustrating from the movie. Although there are many elements of the knockout, of course, I would say that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs in musical numbers ... but why do not we go to see Randolph Scott? <br /> <br />> Clearly, Scott is out of the movie, and this is certainly not helpless, but it certainly does not cross the medieval.
