Lorenzo Thomas Star Jack 'Solider' Kelly is a former vietnam vet and a fraud police who went on a quest to rescue his sister from Bakeds REDNICS and destroyed the mission. The torture film is so cheap and so bad that Ron Pilo has a third bill, and still has a 3-minute screen time and it's not even good. Overall, a horror film, but the scenes of Lorenzo Lama and Josie Belle hanging and hanging from a tree are a few (unknown) hilarious scenes Followed by an advanced sequel.
