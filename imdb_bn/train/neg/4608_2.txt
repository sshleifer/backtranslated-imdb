I bought this DVD because it has curry and got an MPA rating; "Strong violence and sexuality, Rated for nudity and language." <br /> <br /> which is correct, IMO, should state; "Rated for strong violence, sex, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sex" should come after the word "comma", or not "and" because of its huge difference. I think many people will agree with me that the sex and nudity sections are not existent. My first impression was when I saw an MPA rating, I would look like a "breathtaking" movie. So I felt cheated. According to the story, it was so much that after those who care about the real story, if they are in excellent curiosity. I do not know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
