It seems that this was the only movie that John Saxon had ever conducted, and after that it was a good idea to stay close and in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from the beginning to the end, and it is stupid and wood which is not very much for it. The hero of the Vietnam War has been working for a public, became very friendly with the wife, and even after the bomb explosion, the wife was killed and the hero of the war was created and sent to the death penalty. Now, the prisoners in this special prison are being examined and examining some of the sources that will make the machine a killer machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are those infected people in prison, some of whom do not want to stay there only. It only continues and does not show much, or does not say for itself, and I stopped it before I finished, which seems to be coming a few times, but it's apparently set to stop. Different and equally dull way. If one looks at the end, they can become a zombie themselves, so it is not risky. 10 out of 2
