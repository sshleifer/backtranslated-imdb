It was a horror movie! Not for the subject, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend (when the movie came out) at that time, hoping to see a movie about the soul's soul victory over torture. What we saw was two hours of rogue police torture, there was no improvement till the end. There is no mention of preview and advertised! Plus, they are supposed to act in Hooper Sonargarh, I remember that he was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the preview is nothing about this! (You would not expect that, but it's more problematic). If I knew how disappointing the movie would be, I never saw it. Or at least, I have been ready for it. It was a bite and switched advertising campaign, and I did not see this movie again!
