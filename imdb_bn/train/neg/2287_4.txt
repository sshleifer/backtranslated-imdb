I've only seen Garechen Mole in the two films (Girl 6, Donny Brasko), and do not really remember him, but he's portrayed the girl as a savage girl because it makes people happy. <br /> <br /> She does not really think that what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The pictures that she made were certainly adhering to today's criteria, and it gets to all the excitement of watching men's fun with cameras, and pontificating on the evil of politicians pornography. David Straithnn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a nice part here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) has written and operated the famous Pinup girl's outstanding biopic.
