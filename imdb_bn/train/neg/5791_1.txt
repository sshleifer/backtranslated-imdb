As a native film professor, I can honestly say that perhaps it is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would rather get a original canal rather than see this film again. The use of stereotyping, the traditions of traditional quotes and unwanted attempts to use parts of the poor camera only become worse by the unreliable storytelling and bad scripts. Authors and directors show the worst parts of the colonial system to illustrate local communities and communities. If this person is native, then they will have to go to their homes and they will have to apologize for the sake of apples and for internal national racism and foolishness. If this person is non-resident, they must review their white privilege again and ask yourself if they are showing undetermined, unfamiliar racism or they are deliberately unknown My only hope was that local actors of this film had a good time and at least they were paid for their efforts. If you want to watch a good Native movie then check out: Christmas in the clouds, dance by outside, medicine river, poweway highway, smoke signal ... few fewer.
