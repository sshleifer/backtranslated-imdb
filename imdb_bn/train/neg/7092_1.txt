<br /> <br /> This movie (not a film - clearly recorded in a cheaper camcorder) may be the greatest cinematic sting-bomb in history. Beware: Packaging Sexual Addiction As a Sex Exploration Flick Advertising The film is not for a search, and it is no more lover than looking at her own. The script is pointless and insane, with all the plot elements served as segways in the supposed sex scene. However, even sex scenes are lame lame. Except for the first, they were about three seconds long (then again, my version was cut off) and interestingly overcuts. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you do not want it. If you are looking for a titillating sex flick, you do not want this. Whatever your life's goals, wishes or views, you do not want to see this movie. Puzzling in how extreme they got Ed Shelley to work in Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and this stink bomb.
