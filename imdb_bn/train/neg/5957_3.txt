There are a few dozen thirteen horrors of disrespectful and less intelligent (hah!) 80, but it may seem funny if you have seen the right mind. Special effects are strong, acting extremist and screenplay necessarily seem to miss a couple of paragraphs! "The brain" is located in a common calm-American city, where every teenager works on the same diner and where the cherry bombs under high school toilet. Here is a TV-guru who said. Blake and his petted pet named the brain, he started searching for country-wide mind control. Under the label of "Independent Thinkers", a giant Chess brain sends waves through the television set and forces innocent people to kill! How cool is that? Now, Tin-rebel in the Medaval to save the world! The most interesting thing about the plot is, Dr. Black and its giant brain does not actually explain exactly where it comes from. There are obvious references to external life but that's about it. Meh, this kind of movie requires a background, actually? Unfortunately that is not bloodshed and "evil" brain does not look like an extra sock-puppet size. The only less or more interesting material for horror buffs is to take this look into cast and crew who make this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same person who created "bloody birthday" (my conviction) and "plague". Both are better films and they wisely decided to step down in the film industry. Undoubtedly the most well known face is David Galle, whose horror fans will worship the role of the re-animator forever. A girl named Christine Kosac offers nudity-factor and she probably gives a great talent? There are just 3 movies in her profile, in which it is her "Best Writing" In his debut, he was presented as a 'runway model' and was credited as "3 male and a baby", his character was referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'. How am I acting about her career as an actress?
