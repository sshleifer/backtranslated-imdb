Well, what can you say about Barbara Cartel's adaptation? Here are some amazing actors (Oliver Reid, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they are obviously pulling money. <br /> <br /> Leicester Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two cartilin epics - Anthony (who feels apologetic) with Hugh Grant and Gilbert Helena with Bonham Carter <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> If you are really "Adaptive" Adoption of Cartel, go for Bonahmer Carter ("A Hazard of Dangers" - no title !!). Gilbert is a weak link, but Bonaham Carter is appropriately beautiful and can actually work really well and with the rest of the Cast Cheeks (Edward Fox and Diana Rig)
