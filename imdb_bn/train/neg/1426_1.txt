One question: why? First off, the evidence is not funny or all is compelling. They use the tape interviews, and accept the audio to animate it with the animals to tell the parts. First of all, interviews are not fun or entertaining, and even if they are, I'm sure that they will be more entertaining than it is actually seen in the cartoons. How does it add to any joy? I started the sitcom line-up on CBS Monday night (which has become my regular means of pressing on Monday's working days) and it was found. Of course, the sitcom line-up will be renewed in the summer, however, again it was more entertaining to see those episodes again. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I was impressed, well, maybe it would be fun. No And then keep it going. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No, it was just a one-line clip, quick cut and paste quickly. This is a terrific horror version of the cartoon network's "Robot Chicken". I'm not a supporter of CBS's canceled cancellation "The Class" now. That was, that line was up half an hour I would be struggling through. But if it comes to me, let's calculate the whole episode of "Vital power". Let's just say I'll take the "class". It seems a few hours after it's been broadcast, and I'm here to comment that I'm going to make the first comment ... I guess it's a good sign that no one sees it and it will not stay for a long time. Cartoon roadkill.
