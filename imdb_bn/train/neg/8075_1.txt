Final score: 1.8 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> After seeing the 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back', I kicked big Elijah Dushkoo while renting this movie. 'Sol Survivors' is a junk "psychological thriller" arranged like a trashy tin slashy flick - even masked killer Dushoku, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), KC Affleck (Drawing Mona) and favorite star Melissa Segmiller Luke Wilson is also there, laughingly miscast as a pastor. Movie, writer / director Stephen Carpenter's brain, 'Open Year Eyes' or 'Vanilla Sky' and a movie where a character (and audience) is an accident / death. The film silences confusing images and eventually leaves us at a stage of confusion until it resolves to the ongoing reality. I do not think these movies are entertaining - by their nature - to get started, but 'SS' rock-down is a cheap trash movie that you can erase it anyway. The visual, script, acting and any attempt for any fundamentality spread to such movies. Please, it is PG-13, so it does not even provide Gor or T & T to keep it safe as a guilty or unique pleasure. I have heard that some "hot" shower scenes between Mushkil Dushku and Sejmillar The movie is different in front of me and all other entertainment seem to be lost, I look forward to seeing myself for a shower - at least I'll find something out of it. Then it comes: Two girls get paint on their shirts, they climb to the shower and clog them completely. That's it. Did people think this was hot? 'Sol Survivoris' is one of those drop-dead boring movies, which is so weak and it is difficult to have a feeling for it. It keeps nothing and the cost of writing about is low. Finally it leaves us empty. The carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing and sound crushing and it's probably the most vivid part. Due to low cost and PG-13 rating, the rounds will create rounds in the United States or the Saifai Channel as the main round - and this is probably the best for it.
