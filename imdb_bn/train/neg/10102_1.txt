If there ever was a film deserving of a big fat grading rating it was this punk nod. I love zombie films and even worse ones are usually going for them but this is not atrocity. I actually began to feel angry at seeing this movie because it is so insulting poor, I can not believe that those responsible for it actually think that it was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and non-plots have been cut with sadism and gorgeous scenes. People do not react, work or resemble people in some way. The whole movie is also decorated in two rooms, which they see unexplained places vaguely. The whole thing is a pointless mess, it does not go anywhere, and when the zoom ends at last, they show garbage and do not do too much. <br /> <br /> I can take a better picture of it, so you could and could never have seen a movie before. It's kinda and the worst movie of all time without doubt. <br /> <br /> Truly, the worst movie of all time. You only pay a 10/10 of positive reviews and watch it as you request for the DVD. I can not imagine that someone is neutically thinking that this is a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 And it's generous.
