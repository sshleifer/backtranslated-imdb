I sat at the zencon because it was quiet and I could sleep. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Cat? WTF? What was the woman who was busy with Flour and Abe Vigoda or playing some? <br /> <br /> Truly, a piece of garbage suddenly. The letters were meaningless (I think ...) and wood, most of them seemed like they were atoppilot. The so-called "ridiculous" situation in so-called so-called reviews was so hackneyed, I started crying for writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused about how I can spend time, seriously. I only give 3 out of 10 because if it's 2 or 1, it'll be 5 hours or more Kelly LeBock.
