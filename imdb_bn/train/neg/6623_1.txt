First of all, sorry for the first rating of this movie (there is nothing less than this perception). In each section of the film it fails screen, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To get started, the movie name is actually C Class (though the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tried his best to live with Bachchan's character, but he ended up coping with the weak script in his sympathetic way. 3) Shoaib Gabbar Singh received 50,000 prizes (which was credible) to him. Here the previous picture was Rs 100 crores for Baban (Amitabh Bachchan but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had to ride a few motorcycles) (Mumbai type was set up in a Sholay mobile phone in Mumbai) 4) Nisha Kothari will tell someone that he Does not know acting. Ram Gopal Varma is throwing him repeatedly? 5) Mohanlal was good but did not have anything to do. 6) The great actors Sushanta Singh and Rajpal Yadav have been lost in the film. 7) The legendary role played by Lila Mishra (Mausi of the spring) in Sholay is somewhat replaced by Ganguly Mami cheaply in this movie. Ra'amu grow up and understand that you have some wit in the movie. Your movie is full of Shiva and stupid characters as before. 8) Modern wins and Veeru should not talk about the maximum amount. <br /> <br /> In the short story, I am surprised to see this movie because it looks like the original and cheap comic translations of the original. Please do not waste money and time in this movie. I think Upa Tourer (which I thought was the worst movie), is a good idea to see this stupid character, bad songs, and the sad aspect of seeing this awesome package. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Sourav
