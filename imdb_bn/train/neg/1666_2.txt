Which movies can be more naive than this? You can trust a piece of this script. And its predecessor oo is predictable that you can finish the plot and the first 10 minutes. He wants to be Barbie by acting (but he does not make it, doll has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> The opera novel seems to be a historical biography that passes the characters and makes it easy to finally anticipate in music. I do not comment on characters undisputed, but one of the best things in the film is the performance of Madness, which leads to a moleo-like one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> This movie is so cheesy that it is your tooth stick. I think the 13-year-old Brittany-Emotional girls are shouting, "Hey, give us a break. If we want fairy tales, Brother Grim's books are always hiding." I gave it 2 instead of one for Virginia Madison.
