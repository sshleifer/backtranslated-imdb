Buford's Beach Bnies gives a bad name in the B-grade T-and-film. As a fan of the genre, I am uneasy to find a little effort to absorb the young actress's competition. I specifically mention the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. Do the next generation of sad teenage boys seem to see it on the late night TV?
