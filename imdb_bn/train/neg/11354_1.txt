I have tolerated hundreds of children in the past, I have sometimes seen it as the worst one. <br /> <br /> 1) I feel the age of explaining to this day and my children Russia is not "bad boys". Also, the Russian names like "Popech" are inappropriate by fun. <br /> <br /> The grandfather's birthday party scene was a sex-related joke in which he mentioned that men drinking beer and talking to women on the phone. Two other flies unnecessarily use the word "naughty" twice. <br /> <br /> The whole film is the 1950's stereotype and campaign which, in essence, we think that we were proud to rise above as a nation. <br/> <br /> This is simply not crude, badly animated, more badly written and not worth the time to waste.
