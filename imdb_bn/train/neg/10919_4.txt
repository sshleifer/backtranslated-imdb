Bollywood fans mostly hold Amitabh Bachchan's mud in most cases, but I think it is very disappointing. Manmohan Desai had collaborated before films like Suhag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Promi and Kuli and I saw all of them so that I expected high expectations before seeing Mardo and I was very disappointed. My main key about Mard is that it seems like Amar Akbar Anthony Part II, probably Misses Desai came out of the concept, which is using the form for years and years. 1. Some cast members are repeated from the first AAA, for example, the Police Inspector, who has presented Amar, brought the Muslim, Akbar, Nippah Ray and many others. 2. AAA Nirup Roy loses her sight, she lost her voice in the mud 3. Aadhaar is famous song (Shiridi Wali Sai Bab) in AAA, our Amitabh mother is singing Sarawali. <br/> <br /> My other determination is that in some situations it seems ridiculous, true Manmohan Singh gave up your brain in the door, but with Mard I thought he was far away. I got frustrating songs rather than singing my last summer than the previous Manmohan Desai song. I know it swears that there are many fans but I do not like it a bit. It really hurts me to write this review because I was such a huge fan and I liked his movie since I was a kid.
