I rent this movie to see Dolf Lundgren, which I did not see in Rocky IV in a movie. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. Without Mr. Lundgering, all the parties played bad, who was right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The crooks were completely stereotyptical and there was no depth in the character of Lundgren. I do not really expect a movie excellence, but unfortunately this is not even decent action. Every turn of the plot is very unlikely and unbelievable, such as non-communalism and comic book characters began to bother me strongly. <br /> <br /> I would recommend some kids if they want something. Work like a comic, but if anything else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I suppose the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes is definitely influenced by anyone involved in this movie)
