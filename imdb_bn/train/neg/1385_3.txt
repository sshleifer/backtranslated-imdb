"Hack hap" or "black mask" (in English) was frustrating. I was told that it was a "Japanese version of Matrix". Imagine my frustration. The film was badly popped up or there was no good time with the soundtrack film. Another thing is that the dialogue was quite bad. The English version of this movie was thought very little and it only applied for the "stupid step" genre. I do not want to see a movie again
