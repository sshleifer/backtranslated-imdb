William Shatana is tolerant in small doses. Unfortunately, instead of giving up its character as a small loss, and in the middle fun, it has expanded its role and it is more fit. Just as the original Star Trek series happened. I think I will never understand American humor, which often gets 'top' to get the message. I vote with my feet. I do not look at shocking, which is shameful, because the rest was good. The additional role of Shatner also influenced James Sparcer's performance. But the majority society is going in the way of society, I guess. I do not travel to the same route. Frankly
