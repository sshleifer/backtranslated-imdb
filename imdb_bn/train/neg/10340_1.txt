This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I basically look at it out of a morbid curiosity, because I liked the novel, and I did not want to. I stopped it after less than an hour, although I wanted to stop it after five minutes. If i had It ignores the novel a lot and changes all kinds of causes. Unless the film is directed to free itself in the last 50 minutes or so (which would be impossible) I would not recommend it in any way. This is an insult among the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think that, as many people say, "The Bell Jar" is essentially essential, but it can be done without this special presentation. I would like to see one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter, who can judge it.
