This is one of the worst films created by Clark Gable. The only PARNELL was probably worse. It's very painful, and the dialogue is so shy that it should not be proud to create a Gable or Jean Harlow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Slammer (gangster talk like?) He hopes that he will do the right thing, but he will release him there - some of them are unknown, Lord, he "on the way of the family". Finally, the miscreants take the right thing back and in some way they meet each other with a happy ending! They forgot the need for wrapping the gap and spent a few years in Hugoscope. Leonard Moulton says, "They're the best here". By the standards? Best to produce unexpected chuckles? <br /> <br /> <br /> After saying this, my wife think Leonard Multin will find me and beat me. Hmm However, despite my comments, I think Mr. Maltin is the best critic and planet people (I hope he is happy). <br /> <br /> Update - 2/8/8 Because I dislike this movie for the first time (especially ridiculous), I decided to watch it again. After all, sometimes I see a film again when I want to do it a lot more and I understand it was too harsh. Although this has happened in a number of movies in recent months, I still dislike this picture - even secondly Most of it is not due to the first half of the film. In the first half, the character of Harlow was a stupid fool but at least it was credible. But when he was sent to prison, it was all clich√© until the ultimate ridiculous marriage scene took place. The bottom line is that this sequence is notoriously stupid - it just does not give any idea, and the film is about to make some fairy-tales instead of a love story about two verses. I am standing by my original review (despite not all "helpful") and think that moving from the park and possibly from the circus, it can be only the worst Galilean movie.
