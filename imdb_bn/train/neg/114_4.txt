Do not cast it. A fine group of actors, you can not find out. It's not setting it. The director is in love with New York City, and at the end of the film, so we all! Woody Ellen could not improve on what Bogdonovich did here. If you fall in love, or find love, place to go to Manhattan. No, the problem of the movie is scripts. There is no one. The actor falls in love with the first look, the word is unnecessary. That's what happens when Hollywood director directs his experience on the set. This is the reality of her and her colleagues, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie halls, and shallow, and less of the message.
