In fact, documentary use of stock nature of flashing bats in public is sometimes some of the most effective. There are frogs hanging from the cave roof, flying around the cave or walking around the caves. That alone enough to be troubled alone: ​​imagine them all swarming after you? And they must swim with a show-stooping sequence that took place in the 40 minute mark, a neutral illogical sunny sequence where a radioactive flash of bats appears to attack a police car, such as bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence takes about fifty minutes late to save the film, most of which are running around one or more people, screaming, engulfing some of their poor ghafballs, who are capable of batting bats. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, outside. So here is an effective summary of the film: A young couple is destroyed when a romantic gateway which is bitten by a bat. They bravely try to come out, but they try to comfort the people around him, so that they are somewhat more involved than the rabbis so that they can not control themselves and they should all be. <br /> <br /> Now, when someone is nimble in the face, covered with sweat, shakes the eyes like the cheap Moppets, and shouting to come out of me, you move away from him. You do not try to give him medicines, you do not try to tell him to love him, you give him his place, go home and try the beautiful scene next year. <br /> <br /> The people of this movie behave like a mortal, strongly advises to push the man to his thorns and he explodes, the type of man changes in the body type and kills a bunch of non-essential secondary characters. There is nothing wrong with that, but the film forgets that it tries to make some efforts in the characteristics of a low-budget animal and mental research. Instead of a giant film, we found a lot of people running around this guy trying to get a chill pill and finally he would go to the mountains so that more people should see him, people tried to push him behind. And pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main issue with the movie is incorrect that it happened at the top of the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty, and after the movie the man should have been after him instead of becoming a bat person about the journey. The real economical Pattaki is a small city police, who has lost his moral edge and has been involved in late Paul Carr as a medical friend, along with a few interesting characters in the picture with some interesting characters. Most of the messages are not available. <br /> <br /> This movie is horribly annoying, more than fifteen minutes long and it's known as a wonderful, forgotten little living creature. Ratman, which I saw today, and after grief, was inspired to try it. My and my brilliant ideas, although the scene with a police crane was an ugliness: very bad we could not have twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
