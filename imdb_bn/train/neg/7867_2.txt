All right, I tried and tried, but I still do not get this Guy Madin thing. Tailors of Gimli Hospital kept me cold, the Austrian villagers and the film's ice-cream were pretty nice but there was a lack of storytelling ... and this nude movie about abortion and hockey was just boring. I'm glad Madden's silent film is grateful, but for the same reason I dislike his movies because I dislike Quintin Tarantino's films: they feel more of the better, more fantasy films - the films that have developed or broken the new format of the film - and all Style and no substance A jump jump and strange camera angles can really disguise that Madden is an undivided David Lynch Winneb, though there is a benefit on his Tarantino: he usually does not write embarrassing dialogue, because most of his films depend on intertitles. The following line is, Madden's writers make clever tricks for the aspiring filmmakers.
