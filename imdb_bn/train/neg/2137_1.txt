Even the first 10 minutes of the movie were terrible. It is difficult to believe that anyone other than John Cusack will pay the money. As soon as the anti-military / anti-war films are destroyed at the box office, it is almost impossible that any kind of studio itself wants to be associated with this script. It may be the first to be like a politically sent derivative of some types of grayscale point blocks with ore and cusack again. But within just 90 seconds of the film, it has become clear that it is a gifted effort towards DR Strangelv. <br /> <br /> I've liked many Cusacks movies that I thought would take the risk of watching this DVD. I say that I do not know whether Cusack is intelligent enough for me, but if someone else can not wait for it, then again one can see another feature to play it. Cusack seems so unexpectedly hurt by George Bush and his hatred for Iraq war that he is willing to commit suicide. Tom Cruise has never had this gone away. Not even close
