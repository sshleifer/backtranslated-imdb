There are some bad movies there. Most of them are rather fun One of those flicks is "Criminally Insane 1". It was very enjoyable that it was enjoyable and it was re-precious. "Criminally Insane 2" should be one of the worst movies I have ever produced and I'm saying it is a lot because I'm not the kind of person to say. But believe me, it was just terrible and it's been just an hour for 1 hour to go very long. <br /> <br /> This movie is rather an inconsistent story, but when you want to see the story, the lean woman is killed because she is not eating. Well, you do not see in the movie that the first flashback sequences are from the very beginning. The new story can suddenly become funny that half of the athletes are sent home and kill them there, but nothing will happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that moment you are asleep. <br /> <br />> The camera work in this film is only oppressive. This literally reminds me of some of the shots with mine friends back when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is something else you can not understand a word as a character says something else. To illustrate how bad it is, go to the New York subway and try to understand what is being said aloud, what this movie sounds like. <br/> <br /> <br /> Now I know that its worst movie is very strict but words can tell that the issues they are talking about are not important. Do not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not trust me, see it for yourself. 1/10
