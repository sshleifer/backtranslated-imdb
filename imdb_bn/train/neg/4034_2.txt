Oh dear Well cast, but write and write directly an art and intelligence and direct intellect is a bit of a job. Even better comedy you will get the time and moment right. The part where I was not putting it all down, I was laughing loud but at that very low time. The main focus for me was in a free-flowing dialogue, which disturbed some people in the film. While reading your head script it might be great, but there is a different way of getting cameras and cameras. And the camera work on hand gives the strength to some parts of the film. The overall aspect was good, but the script was not what I had, but I'm sure you're good at reading your head's script. Sorry
