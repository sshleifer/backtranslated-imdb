I could not recommend more than this unnecessary piece of Christmas (believe me, here is a negative need twice - it's bad). The problem with opening credits was when it was released that the screenplay was the same person as the song writer. Musical numbers are much longer and none of them are good ("Thank you so much" is a decent melody, but the songs are stupid beyond the words). I would gladly bear the defeats of the chords in the scorches according to the order of the evil hell of the film, rather than sitting on this humiliation from the movie musical. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this movie (completely unknowingly) as Alec Guinness Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly puddle white suit, Guinness was cheerful in love with her scene, which tried to make it float like a ghost, or to show her disrespect in this horrible movie. Albert Finney, the best mix of Alastair Sim and Charles Loft, matched the creation of the lazy character of the depression of the catamodo / Scrooge. Finnis screws a man so horrible, it is impossible to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Clear all costs for this horrifying filming.
