.... because it shakes! You want to go to the movie maker and delete the movie maker and "Why?" Want to say Awesome camera work ... Calculate the time the camera tries to stay on one person and can not do it. Dialog is ridiculous Acting funny It seems that they took a ghost town in the West to see if they could make movies at least money. I bet $ 10 they used the home video camera to do this. That is, or cameraman was the most drunk. Is really more entertaining than trailer movies. If you ever want to host the "Worst Movie Party" then bring it. Want more entertainment ... look at a wall.
