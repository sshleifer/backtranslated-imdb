Even if 99.99% of people watched this movie Brazilian, but I'll be in English from this website's language. <br /> <br /> This movie is a part of cr * p. The worst act I have seen for a loooong time. The kids are terrible Especially the boy. For the first time I saw someone less prone to Anard Schwarzenegger, and a single voice tone, like reading a 5-year-old child in front of the class. Who is the main actor of the movie is so bad? The story is so shallow that my daughter can do a good job (she is 3 years old). It is so easy that it can be written in a napkin and can be said within 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities to enjoy this movie: 1) You are a pre-teen; 2) You have become so intelligent by the stupidity of the world that you think that any of the globose seal is remarkable; 3) You have a serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs! Brazil's movie scene shame!
