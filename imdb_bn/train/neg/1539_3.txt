I'm a big fan of Westerns but this one .... whew, what a stinker! I thought the closure of the bat was almost in the madness of what turned me in the insane dialogue. I think I might have written better dialogue than this when I got this eighth grade. And the poor actor! Given these terrible conversations, none of them came across looking for something ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Something better than what you get in the add-on movie <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. Perhaps he was the "big star" in this movie, if you call it a b-western, but you would like to appreciate it. Perhaps it should be called a B-minus Western. PT Sterling Hayden, who was present at other times alongside Joan Crowford, Bate Davies, Frank Sinatra and other major talents. In order to be present in his car, this poor thing tried to get down to the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> It's a boring thing in this movie that all people seem to see that they do not put them in a week and their faces are all sticky. I know the people of the old Western were not always well-made but for a person, this is a movie that you just want to go to 'Eblog!' Really, it's a crummy western Dave Pyle had to save this one, especially after the presence of many great Westerners. Bad, bad movie
