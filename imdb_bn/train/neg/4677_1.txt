What is the left winner Hollywood conquest? If the film glorifies rebellion as a rebel and noble leader for the pacifist policy. This novel ends with the character of peace played by Danil Washington, who is actually being promoted for his rebellion. What is this with this Hollywood equipment? Is this still the belt for MacCarthis? <br /> <br /> If I feel disgusted, then it is a political agenda that is bothered by the movie. This movie is portrayed as a military brass, and what? Battle of Ganga-Ho Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not bad? Think about it. Yet again, the crackers tilt the point of tide. Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across as a raving madman until he comes to his senses, totally 360 abandons his passion for blood, offers propaganda of dangerous Hunter Hunter, and retires from service Repentance by A man mutinyies, takes command of your boat, puts a nuclear risk at the first strike taking the US, and you promote him ???? What a shock!
