I claim this video is so accurate about Vietnam and both are embarrassed and bothered there. The truth about the Rodney King Heating all police officers as the film is about the whole of Vietnam War. Yes, bad things (and have happened) happened, but in general the people are like you. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all drag. The rebellion in Vietnam was an exception, not a rule. They've happened much more often than "hype" you have to believe. Oliver Stone has created a dinner to show the Vietnam War as a brutal bloodstorm, but they are actually very similar to Star Wars. If you believe in Vietnam as well, then please be kind and learn the truth. True: Viet Kong and NVA have done something worse than South Vietnam than any other soldier in the US armed forces. True: In World War II, the soldiers treated the enemy more badly than the soldiers in Vietnam, and when they came home, they were welcomed. The fine Americans have paid tribute to serving this country in Vietnam; Although the war was deadly since the political point of view, no one could ask for more than our soldiers, and such "most of the truth" fiction was just like the real things.
