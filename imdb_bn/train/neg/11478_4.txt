I am surprised that the critics @imdb gave this TV movie a high rating as their rating. This is an innocent, sweet, incomplete cliche 'picture which was the two big names of the past (both of which did a decent job), but this film supports low budget work which we can see in any day of the week less cable channel. I liked somebody alongside good romance, but my wife and I saw it - and we saw the rating - we said, "there are people who are going to rate this film very easily because there is nothing in their brain, their beliefs, their comfort or Challenging their cultural preferences. It is possible to create a good film like this (and its example from Away), but it is amateur M was. Some of the films is much less well than the other. In fact, another holiday films holidays inadequate. See the Family Stone. This is much more than slokera miles away.
