I saw this movie in DVD format. My copy might have been affected but I was frustrated with the lack of menu screens for DVDs. I would say that my primary reason for watching this movie was Claire Floral. While having fun watching, I think he was not as far away from my other films as far as I expected. I was actually equally satisfied to see Arkin turn in a ridiculous performance. I did not know the other two actors so I can not compare their performance, but they were fairly enjoyable. Acting in my opinion, this movie is the only respected quality. Story lines, some might say a little compulsory, lack of direction. I think the main problem is applicable to the script and not from the direction of this movie. If you enjoy these actors with no justification, I recommend this movie, but leave it otherwise.
