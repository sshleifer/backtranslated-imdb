Prior to this movie, I watched only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: Trashy Jimmy Fleck le Nottie de la Terre (1981), famous among the gentlemen of the gentleman, who has the outstanding performance of children's child Peter Bark, and joyfully lazy gull stripe nude for your murderer. The film was not a special spectacle of the film, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and these did not show cows and nudity). The killer, though, despite having a number of splatters and unwanted bare meat, dust, dust, dust. <br /> <br /> The story, a hotel where cast and crew are living in a horror movie during their shooting, is confusing and disgusting: when the blood does not flow and the skin does not hear, the film is a real struggle for coming (It took me four attempts to finish), unlike the continuous scenes of characters that are annoying and very few notes in themselves. <br /> <br /> The only topic of interest for this movie is its producer Lucio Flori used his death scenes in his mega-poor movie, Kat in the Brain (AKA nightmare concert) out pad. And if you've already seen that movie, there are few reasons to get annoyed with the genocide.
