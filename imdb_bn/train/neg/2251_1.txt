An amazing pill really pops up! <br /> <br /> An expected, slow-moving, self-destructive, flexible movie of mind that is throwing rusty bread with your own wrist looks like ... well, almost necessary. Acting for a thin dialogue has ended, each scene needs to be at least twice, complex details or carrier of how the carrier is breaking up, is too lazy and mundane for words. The music will be good if the movie does not fit, but in reality, three good songs are not fully rewarded for the necessary efforts to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I pray to see this picture of God for Narcosis or someone to shoot me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
