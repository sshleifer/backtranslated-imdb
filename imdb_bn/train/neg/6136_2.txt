Bob Barker's role of speech like the ear reminds him that he is running a country to run his show. But there's more to shine in this Turkey and snort. As a "face-to-face" child, Kurt Thomas exhibits some remarkable acrobatic skills, but there is no type of acting talent. There are a few wonderful moments (most of the crazy villages), and some lightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given "ninja" movie will give you more entertainment, and you will not be laughing to laugh.
