"White Noise" I think most of the movies talk about "Exorcist". The supposed truth seen as EVP was a really easy way to be true to the fact it was a fear. Many movies never come that instill fear in the minds of humans. Like I could have stayed in this movie, but not. The film has reduced itself to the low-grade PG-13 horror movie. No way nothing compares to "ring" or "six knowledge". Nobody really can take charge only in the horror film industry and only create a movie that will not only make us think, but it jumps us, screams, everything should be a horror movie. I'm seriously sick of the PG-13 Horror Genre, because it's becoming a part of its own. Our old days, blood and cow's day, Freddy Kr√ºger, Jason, The Mike Mayer days are needed. Some movies are not afraid of this mentality. So why try to pull it off? There is nothing other than a great ending in the history of film in some of the best of this movie ... Do not waste your money in this movie.
