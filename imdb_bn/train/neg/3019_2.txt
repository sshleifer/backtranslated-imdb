How can you take serious with your hard living, glamorously violent giant hunter stories * serious * noise? It's stupid. In addition, the director's visual style is annoying and disgusting, it is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-film rehash and acting disrespectful. Throughout the film, the film is presented in all the ways of a new character, and split flashbya is called - mostly in sequence - apparently only to make you look beautiful and confused. The film never shows you that does not really feel and then says "it did not really happen, it happened" - (First of all) see the 'First Lady' (fraudulent) murder scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> 1/5.
