All right, at the time of gratitude breaks in the past, when the whole family decided to stay together, everyone decided to watch a movie, and after Fred voted the maximum, we did what we said and said. <br /> <br /> There were several plot holes to stop the film, it was suppressive. The general explanation was canceled because of a specific incident happening. For example; Who is trying to stop the Santa clause? Is it some sort of corporation? A little explanation would be nice. Second: The movie has given you radioactive characters that have not shown any sympathy for their feelings or actions. Example: Wiley, the little Elph and Elph village's only tall girl. This film does not care about me because they saw each other twice and then they were couples and I could take care less. <br /> <br /> Third: Do I think it could be a family picture? His rating was low at the PGA only. There was a series of consultative conversations for a family film. It does not bother me, but if I was a parent, I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Paul Gaimatti was very indifferent about his role with the whole film, but in reality he was the only valuable person to watch the film. Vaughn had some funny moments but he played the same character for the last two films. The boy in the mouth (Nothing against Vaughn, he has been good in other movies) <br /> <br /> So this movie has attempted to release 10 out of 3 stars, just for someone to produce, film and release this flick. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will definitely pass this flick, or if you rented it on a rainy day it will save.
