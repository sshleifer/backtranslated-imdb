Feathers are not really a movie. It's a Wannabe movie, with Wannabe actors. Not with Richard Gare, he gave an amazing performance, but when an actor really gives his own character and the cast is acting only ... the result is as compassionate as this movie. You see, the acting concept is to hide what you're acting. What was Clay Dains doing this ?! She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. 99.9% of the film he found out everything! The job he was doing was asking stupid questions, such as "What do you really think ??", and creating silent faces. I was ashamed of his acting, and I liked him ... he was kind of a romantic movie, I do not know who he was chosen among all the actresses .... Lol, and Aaviri watched Livgene ?! This really smiles me .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing, this movie will have to work for you !!! I want to vote 5.
