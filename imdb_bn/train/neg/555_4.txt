The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. Plot horror ... but plus well played side by side, with some good screaming and rants. Sharon Stone is right this time ... even you do not have half as good as the original mind. The murder is not as poor as the first, which is shameful. It's not unexpected mess to say it's all though. When sex is quite graphic when others clean it (they are fully clothed) to fake it. The script is often weak, but banners and arguments are highlighted in Dr. Glass and Washburn. The plot twists a few times, but the end is horrible. 'Oh my God!' It's always constant to pull with its huge dolls. Chase sequences are brightly directed, and shots and camera angles bring impressive and otherwise, a bit of class in slowly-felt films. Sharon Stone is a bit old for this too. The first one, where we see her breasts, was delights. This time around, they are very awesome to describe. The film is rather mean to its self, but it is worth a go. Basically because the film deserves some good buzz ... the opening sequence is a highlight. Not critical, but if you like the first - leave this one. Do not destroy runs. You will be glad you left this stone unturned.
