I remember this show when I was a child. I do not think so much about it, just a few minor things about characters. For some reason I think it's really intense. It really was up early morning really up in the morning. I finally found an episode, after looking around the web for a long time. The first episode is no less. Criminey! This show was so awesome. It was probably made to play laser tags and to show kids having a great time. Opening the show with Khoshi Lee, his mother said, "My name is not Christopher, I am also Vaadi-phone warrior !!!!!" Then we were forced to watch the laser-tag for the kids "Foot Loose" song. And not a little bit quick, but the whole song. Ahhhhh my brain just thinks about it. Oh yes, and if I could not have been worse, even you could not see laser beams from their guns. They're just like running the whole "hose" songs around. Afterwards, Vodi's place or wherever he goes, he has a painful laser gun fight to Phil's "Su-Su-Sudi" song. Ah, believe me, you do not want to rest. What can I say ...... Light Shines !!!!!!!!!!
