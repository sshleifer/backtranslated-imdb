I do not know where to start; Acting, special effects and writing are all bad as you might possibly imagine. I can not believe that production workers reached a stage where they said, "Our work is finished, it's time to be free". I'm just glad that the first two of this series did not even make it to the UK. I really recommend watching this movie so that you can understand how well you can make good movies. <br /> <br /> "I do not know that IMDB users are afraid to see any" awesome "dinosaur wrist.
