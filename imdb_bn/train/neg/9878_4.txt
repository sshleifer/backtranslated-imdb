Os Endorson's "Fantastic Mr. Fox" has lots of love, unfortunately all love is for himself. It has been speculated that many times and efforts have been made to create this spontaneously intriguing universe, but in the script it is attempted to make fun of the same time and effort. The worrying thing I thought was it, and it could be the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. <br /> <br /> Animation is good in close shots of animals, but when the camera becomes really harsh on everything eyes away and be perfectly honest look like a mess. There was nothing really special about acting, Wes was waiting for her friends and a big name on special voice actors, which could possibly make the film even better. I'm sure the presence of two of South Park's crew at the beginning of George Clooney's voice acting, one of them, where he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is very shy and tries to try to be tricky and, despite the fact that, in general and in England, all the good animals play common American baseball, though the bad guys are stereotyptic English with the most insulting English accent. I can not control how much the film is wasted. I do not smile once.
