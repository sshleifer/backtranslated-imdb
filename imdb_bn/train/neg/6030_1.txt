All right, now, I know that millions of Americans who believe in the blessing: At the moment when all the resurrected Christ will be encouraged to meet God and the rest of humanity will be destroyed in the world by crippling and fire. And as the antichrist, Sirius's heartfelt fights with Jesus (an unreasonably anti-war mode). And I know the books were good sellers. . We believe, however. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, sprinkle the film in a bag and tear it with a stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the book is a lot better. Actually <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no need to revive this plot. If you have seen this movie then you can read the book. I could have been the only man on earth, who actually saw this for the worst of bad experience and I was not disappointed. Especially by Kirk Cameron, Grimlin, a growing "slightly increasing torment", who came to the showroom, found Christ, and decided that Shakes should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your profession has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you have spread the word of God so bad in movies, they do not make it for the dramatic release. Well, this is not strictly true: I think it was the only movie that went to DVD FIRST, with a voucher to watch the movie for free, it was released briefly in the theater! I still have vouchers! How many people have you shown? I do not know about you, but it did not come to my town. Of course, I live in Eniwy, where we sit to tear off the pages of useless liberal Bible and use them to roll in joints. So you go there. Actually, I will defeat three million people on Manhattan Island, one will not be kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Check out the supplementary contents of DVDs, where you will learn visually behind the scenery details. . . CAST and CREW will all have the same religious mentality. They do not come right and say this, but listen closely to what the filmmakers say. It's like a bunch of pods, combined to create a pod movie. How is that creepazoid? Actually, this thing is just a converted promotion, is not it? Can you imagine that it will not subscribe to the universal universal thing, silently on his forehead, "Holi humor dam! I have saved the potatoes well!" However, I'm hooked. I will see the rest of this Christian fiasco movie, especially one with Gary Busey, which I think is the Tribunal. At least he has excuses to take part in the bus. He trampled his head on foot while walking on the motorcycle. <br /> <br /> o <br /> <br /> Oh, that's another thing. All the innocent innocent innocent dogs are fighting, their Lash is dragging the ground in vain, because their owners have called in heaven? What's that with? We are feeling bad for dogs, and if we do, are we made of God? Is there no room in heaven for the best friend of the human that is not the IRK man? Foo <br /> <br /> This one is another reason I'm not known. Good night and good luck
