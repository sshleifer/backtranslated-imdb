AKA: Monday Monday <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I saw. Three people drink in vain, drink, and wake everyone, all about their way. This is considered to be a drama, but this is what it is, total waste of the film without the overall release quality. <br /> <br /> I am "wonderful," "beautiful" and "heroic" here. "I'm afraid, I can not agree, until these people came to be like the least known proto-men. <br /> <br /> It was not a movie, it wanders across and loses everyone except the audience. I have seen this three times, and anyone can see what I see in this trash for my life. There is nothing deep here, whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br />
