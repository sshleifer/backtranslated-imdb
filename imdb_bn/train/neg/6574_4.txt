(August, a little explosive forward) I received this tape from my local library, which kept a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I once visited West Virginia Matawan town, and there was a little museum. I saw the schedule for the city theater sitter in May 1953. Every day the movie will change in the theater. Since there will be more than ten decades of TV in the region, it is the most entertained city. In 1950 the "The Raid" was created for cities like Matawan. Although it was not listed for that month, I certainly did show some Monday or Tuesday night for the audience which is probably not too demanding. Historical Expedition - Brave and remarkable success - does not seem to have been done very well, so the film is full of stylish Hollywood, among which Lee Marvin has acted. Marvin used the opportunity to practice Liberty Valencia. And St. Allans seems more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the city than Washington DC. <br /> <br /> What really changed me into their conformed uniform when the attack has made me a snicker. Only insurgent uniforms seem so old in civil war painting. When Anne Bancroft's son held Van Halflin in his uniform just before his Red, I used to think that the boy was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then bring Anna Bunkert himself. When I was watching the film, I actually looked at IMDB and saw if there is another Ana Bancroft. Then the studio contract actress did not see anything like her next film, and she still did not attend "The Maracell Worker", "Agnes of God", and of course "Graduation". <br /> <br /> only 1) viewable. You live in St. Alban and 2). You will have to take a few hours to visualize the biggest news story in your home town in a Hollywood movie.
