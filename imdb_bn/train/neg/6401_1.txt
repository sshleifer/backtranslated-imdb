Can I do this until I need glasses? At the very least, anyone who can make a movie proves that. The genius is not considered. There is no similarity to the talent, taste or intelligence of those who have torn apart the reverse of this world. Target audience must be composed of children who have recently labotimized, and play with their own feces. Anyone else to get a snicker from this film will be very wise in the world. It consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not extend even obvious. It ends at the ridiculous. Jokes are the type of joker that the primary school children say (usually ribbon or sex), where they do not know the meaning of all the conditions they use. You know, one of the parents and the mother's garage. Applying any harsh methods of criticism will be absurd, since acting, writing, normal values ​​of instruction and never heard of such creative "mind". This does not have to be a judge behind the mess, but anyone who enjoyed this movie must be deeply reflected on their intentions in this world. <br /> <br />
