This is the first time I've ever seen a movie with Jamie Fox, and I bet it will end me. I failed to see why I was funny, although in the audience it was thought that it was very interesting when facing the camera, or "I'm going to take a shower". <br /> <br /> The plot is completely expected. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy is a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In it, officials screwing up. The final scene is completely incredible. You've been a man behind 2 years and millions of dollars, but do not you solve a small puzzle in your home? <br /> <br /> There is no great acting, no plot or story, and shooting MTV style is done. Do not waste your money on this money. <br /> <br />
