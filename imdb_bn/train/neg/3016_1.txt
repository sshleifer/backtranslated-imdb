I'm a fan of Tony Scott film, a lot. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'man on fire'. The most distant thing to find the movie! The story was drawn in water, and the choice was not so good at Mickey Roberts. And the whole army was very ineffective! <br /> <br /> This movie is centered around Qiyar Qinghati, and this movie reveals that she will never be a movie star! The movie came with the worst performance. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's 'N', but it takes a whole fridge cake! Sorry tones, 1 of 10!
