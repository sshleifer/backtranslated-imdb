This show is one of the worst shows of all time! Absolutely no original joke and they are always delayed a year. In 2009, they will say something about Michael Week's dogfight. Cast members wanted to stay in the SNL, but at least the people had to go to the bottom, crazy TV. The one-hour lunatic magazine jokes started, not the funny thing, the terrible John wanted stewart beans. So if you have any problems tell me ID loves to hear the opinions of 3 people to see this show. The family man keeps it good "Osama bin Laden hid in one place, cast a crazy TV. Why not watch a show.
