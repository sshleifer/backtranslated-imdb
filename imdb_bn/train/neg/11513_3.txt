* Spoilers can be * <br /> <br /> I bent backwards to be fair in this film. I knew it played Madonna. I knew the whole week in the theater. I knew it got a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful examination of such classes, culture and sex at the Italian price. The benefit of suspicion lasted ten minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, show some really stupid facial expressions). Adriano Ziannini plays the ship's first partner, who is humiliating Madonna's character and treats them together as a dirty scene. Why does she worry him so much? The plot was needed only so that when the two is drawn on the Mediterranean island of two deserts, the tables would be made and he would teach him a lesson. In spite of having nothing in common, how they fall in love and abuse with each other for two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of "Volunteer Away", a silent, simple, simple movie is over. Madonna usually gives a wooden performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna Ganyini, who has a fantastic scene with Madonna and her most scenes where she shocks her and kicks her with a butt, singing and dancing exquisitely on her demand. Guy Richie is his "stylish" editing which is ridiculous here Within a few years of the film, I heard of some of the worst dialogues in a big film. Finishing is unfortunate and impossible. It basically meets the "Blue Legoons" and fills up "overboard" and reduces previous nudity and reduces the sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Maybe the arrogance of Madonna is so big that she continues to prove herself to the appropriate actress. Please do it, for us, and for you. This is not his worst movie though. That distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Astound". He has not created anything worse than that ... yet.
