This is a horror disaster in a film. From the beginning to the end, it is played badly and even filled with bad aspects and edits. The only release part of the film is the number of straces, because it is impossible to see or hear parts of the crystoferson. The main problem of this movie is that we never see the character of Crisiferson in the struggle for his peak or streaseband character. The first fall should be seen and the second growing. Final Stresand Number __ If properly operated and edited, one of the highest final finals in the film. The singular shot of his face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. The wide range of band, audience and stage show has been shown, this number can be dynamic and interesting. This movie is definitely directed and edited by a NYU Film School Dropout. The only thing that can be bad popple. The final musical number is the only release part of this film and even completely confused by confusing technical decisions.
