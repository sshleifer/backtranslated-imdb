One of my friends bought this (very cheaply) and decided to give it to me on a birthday event. I thought I would never see it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover was kind, but then my friends and I really got bored. From the beginning to the end! I know quite a feat but it's really a wonderful composition. It's hard to describe. You see it, a real lesson is what they are able to believe when it is not a creative and smart and indeed. "Acting" is Sos-Trenen (you can actually laugh "The leading lady" for a while, that's the worst thing). The "story" is stupid and all of this film is really sucked. Please give special attention to "Sheriff". The man is an adult and there is no excuse for him to be involved in it. She is extremely bad as well. However it has some delightful moments. Check it out, huh
