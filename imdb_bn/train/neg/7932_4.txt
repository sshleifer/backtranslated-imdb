Oh dear! What a disappointment I've been looking at the old west of British TV for decades, and I was not aware of it before yesterday - most of the Scottish Westerners came every year or closer and generally valuable to see again. <br /> <br> Rich color and outdoor set were good, but I can tell about this film. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments I already made. Several times I felt like closing it, and eventually I through half, I ever did something to do. <br /> <br /> Scott's chic girls seemed unusual oily, his two sidekicks were boring and so Mexican was a bandit lad and I felt that the army uniform was 20 years old or more modern, it did not disturb the creators of other Westerners. . Perhaps it was better than the second half, but I could not wait and bothered to see.
