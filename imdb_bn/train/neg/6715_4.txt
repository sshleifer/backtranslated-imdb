If I did not get enlightened, I would enter the theater for 90 minutes of entertainment. I left the entertainment or illuminated. What this movie wants to do is not to increase its mind and it ends until something happens. There are a few funny lines and some incredibly inspired movie references (400 stains - for this character? Stop it!). Although none of the characters behave with more reverence, more than thirty gay men get the worst of it: all the predators, fat, sad, slabs. If you are in the mood for movies related to homosexual relations, watch instead of Partying Glanses, Longtime Companion, Trick, The Guy, Red Dart, Morris, Philadelphia. Thank you me <br /> <br />
