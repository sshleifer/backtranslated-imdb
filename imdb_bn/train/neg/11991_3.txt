- Bad element: This movie is a real shit. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake, I thought it was "Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are quite vain. A part of the film, he thinks he will take his anger in the window, his life will be better. I want to know the casting director and if he is high then acting was even more awesome than the adult. This movie sucked even a kiss scene. This movie is about killing the book. The book was great. I do not highly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good thing: I do not know what I can say. Some privacy parts which lets you go, but they are shot faster by acting fast stunt and acting fast. <br /> <br /> - My judgment: do not look.
