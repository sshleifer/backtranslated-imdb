This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The letters were so cold. Mother, she is the main character, but all "drunk". All right, she was dissatisfied with her marriage and always kept her husband and children. Her husband died. Then he goes to meet his son and meets this necklace with this girl and then falls asleep with him. Until this part, the movies are okay. Not nice, but it can be seen. The man is charming and who can blame him? All right, let's blame this frustration of losing your husband, not too drunk to sleep with your daughter's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> She became completely dark with the man. I started to dislike this segment where I dislike movies. She always wants to satisfy her in an "old fashion" with her while working in her son's house (the old things she learned), as if she gets her only attention, attention The person is probably not very interested (in fact, he seems to be sleeping with his charity activity) and instead of being insulted by him, he wanted to go to bed with her and to be beautiful for her. When he became very abusive. "I want to make you happy", he tells him a great way when he is insulting him very badly. <br /> <br /> How disappointed me in this movie, there is no lack of respect for my mother. He said to Craig, "I'm just an idiot wrapping". The first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This image is a shame of women's kind. If it was mine, I used to buy myself a small thing which could bring me the same satisfaction and a lot less mental pain ... :)
