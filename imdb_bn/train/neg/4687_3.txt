Spokillars (Not to be published in the first two minutes of the movie) <br /> <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is actually friendly, lonely, mentally disappointed. He is a very human, even sympathetic psychology, and is really invisible in character - no small achievement for such an acclaimed actor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the bad movie is so bad. Supporting performances (and performers) is a soft-core look (it does not support each character but Sy does not make 100% of the cardboard). Occasionally, the director seems to be trying to suspiciously despair: we tell from one of the first moments that Syed is a complete disappointment, b) he survives and c) that police arrest him and end up. So we left to worry about how and whys, and the answer to be given is not all that interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is plodding and concreved, and some illogical moments feature (for example, the husband dismisses his wife for her expensive taste, although she spends her free time at the local discount superstar). Almost two-thirds of the way, Syed has fooled some irrationally that it is astonishing that how concerned he really is about his grand revenge plan. And the final clich√©d interpretation of his psychology, right 'Peeping Tom,' is a terrific copout out of '. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is of the worst kind. It can be considered even worse for bad-movie movie lovers, in any other way, or painful, or incredible, or not bad. Instead, each line is purely secretive - such as a director outlined a newspaper copyright on a platform and said, 'Hey, I need a useful script for this job - within an hour.' It tries to scream me, to be honest. <br /> <br /> This movie appears to be brave of the Gulf Helper-Thriller of the eight hundred and nineties ('Hand that stone pedal', for example), and it's certainly unpleasant, it's not really scary. Sy fetishism sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable, but that film on yourself is not enough to work. In the end, everyone except Robin Williams is a technical shortage involved, this one. 10 out of 3
