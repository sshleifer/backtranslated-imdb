Dear Richard, I know we all love you at Home Implement with Team Allen. But seriously, do you have to do anything other than air bag lam signal? I used to think that the team will actually play a bit more by now or even become his personal assistant. I know that it seems to be harmful, but salary benefits are more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everybody sees you around the team and immediately thinks of "Tool Time". You'll also get the role often with Bob Villa. Instead, you are present for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and Smile. I know that the script was not too much, but you could add it. I mean come back The team is one of you. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bid line. On the contrary, fake dogs are actually less than showing dogs sport. The original was good. And you, Mr. Richard Carne, is more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
