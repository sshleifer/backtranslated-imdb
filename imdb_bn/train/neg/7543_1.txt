A soldier is on the side of the road to be sure that every 1 is driving the speed limit (its working); Then he pulls on a woman who he has a mother (a seat seat in a seat); He is telling him what's wrong and left ... they die. All right, I personally thought it was a good movie. When I was watching this movie in the theater, I was with some friends. This was our first night after summer so we wanted to go and watch a good movie. We all could see a suspense / thriller which was good for everyone in the group ... this was the biggest mistake of my life. I damaged the 7.oo dollars on the movie ticket, but I had to sit down with the brain for torture. This movie started with mystery and mystery and I seriously thought "it can not be bad" ... I was a lot wrong. The whole problem with this movie does not give any sense; Even if you can overcome bad acting, even the "not so horrible" storyline, and you still be surprised about the horrific mess of this movie. It is not enough to understand that you are not good enough to understand it, because no human can understand what this stupid movie is like with the brain. At this point you might think, "Oh man! I just want to see this movie, it seems to be bad, as this person says." Think of your head right now !!! I am trying to save you the trouble of showing this movie so that you can say that it is so bad that even after seeing it there is no point. Please do not make people the same mistake that I think this movie is possible ... it's not. I can give 1 of 10 out of 10 movies (if I could give a zero), and I do not recommend anyone watching this movie, you will find yourself many sleeping nights w.t.f. Trying to think That's about freaking movies.
