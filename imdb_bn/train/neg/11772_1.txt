I'll be short ... this film is shameful for everyone except for his cineographer. The truth of the criticism of the sexual tourism industry is that until we feel legitimate until a lasting dance scene "treats". This plot is not ridiculous that none other than the brightest fan of BAD dawn can find it. And because of God's love, please tell that this movie is a story of innocence or female empowerment, because it is not completely clear (child shameful lesbians, what the hell?). It was by the worst movie of the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw), someone may have broken half through the film because they could not take much of it. It may seem like an extremely critical rant, but in reality you can not find the release feature of this movie if you take it as a real comedy. This short film keeps an eye on the cocktails of the best class A drug.
