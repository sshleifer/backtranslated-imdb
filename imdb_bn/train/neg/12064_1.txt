This is one of the most annoying horror films I've ever seen, because it's a terrible God, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All characters are annoying, and terrible stories, plus I could see two twists away from the last mile! Great setting and unclear room must have helped if it is not very annoying and does not have a letter for it, plus I hope it will create the 100 way below, because it's worth being there in my opinion. Eventually John Carradine shows up to the end, it's a beautiful scene, but it's already too late, and its only screen time was flashbacks, and the only true scene of the movie when a character gets his face up messed up by the beans, it was rather magnificent. I got a DVD set set that was called back from the background and everyone was dependent on my opinion, plus it was lucky which was not included in a set I bought, otherwise I would have removed the window! This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's a terrible God, John Carradine has very limited screen time and I want to avoid it like a plug! You do not want to go through torture. Directions are terrible! Carl Manson is absolutely terrible! Work here, all things look cheap, waste its potential on making vague atmosphere and only put the film at incredibly dull speed. Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his view, but after that he is otherwise otherwise in the flashback scenes film. (Carradine Ruled !!) Mary Anders overnight terribly as Laura, she does not satisfy me all. Ivy Bethune is okay, and somewhat weird, but overacted, although she had a vague smile at the end. The rest of the cast, I did not pay too much attention, because I suffered a lot, but they were really bad. Please avoid this overall, it is not worth the torment! 5 of the BMMB
