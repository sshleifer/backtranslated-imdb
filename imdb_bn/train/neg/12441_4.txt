Some things need to be explained. Mark Ferrez's photo of Mark Ferris did not play this movie. I know that he was my dad. Delete that picture. Also, Mark Ferrez was the author, at least one. I have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It's been a year and if someone can point me towards receiving a copy, it would be great. The film was not so bad and it is trying to compare Star Wars to today's world and it is in vain to finance the other high technology science. If you see it, then it's worth it and enjoy it for humor. Film snobs have light up and enjoy some less creative and innovative films.
