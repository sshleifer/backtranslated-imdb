OK, simple and straightforward, if you're a fan of other grave rider games (yes, even AOD) stay away from the Legend. <br /> <br /> It's no doubt, still the most frustrating TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unnecessary and I gave up. I think I have been robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR had another PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. 6 poultry rider games control was standard. They were 'Taki' in AOD, but still the same general control sequence. In the legend, he completely changed his movement and control system and he is completely uncontrolled. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying 'Use the mouse' to comment otherwise. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a Gamepad' No, why should I? Others say, 'But it has been the criteria for controlling 3rd person for years' Well, I do not care, it's not ideal for any other TR games, so why is it messed up with it. Oh, I know, because they can not care less about their true, loyal fan base, they want to pay new kids cash, who do not listen to the series until they come to the film and do not earn a lot of money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the public of other posts mainly in the Eidos forum, telling people how it's trash, they probably hear it.
