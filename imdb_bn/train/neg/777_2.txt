I can not believe that such faded, zincogastic elements are being passed as Americans' art art material. In the beginning, as we say, "we are sure that they are playing for the right team" and from manipulation framing and lighting, A Love Divideed shows its real face. In an arbitrary manner that is shown by the Irish Catholics as the heart, Protestants represent the struggle between cowboys and American Indians, as poor as the representation of history, in the West of the East American countries. The story is distorted by the story of the Irish Catholics' stereotype and completely distorted; Filmmakers admire corruption! It is unfortunate that people still think that they can win moral rule by recognizing a movie so easily, away from the effort of the industry. There is no business in this movie or any legal movie or library.
