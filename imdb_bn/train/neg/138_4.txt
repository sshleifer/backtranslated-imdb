The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror film I've seen for a long time, that actually scared me. The performance was not very bad, and "the champed killer" was trustworthy and annoying. <br /> <br /> Bad: The story and the plot of the story are incredibly weak. There just was not it. The way the killer killed his victims was way too awful and despicable. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can manage Gore. <br /> <br /> Overall: A good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** *****
