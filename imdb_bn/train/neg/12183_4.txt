Christ A series of all-time great movies, leaving at least songs (helpless "recurring times" of tomorrow), but continued the annoying and unexpected tradition. During this time, Annie and her friends moved to London and were caught in the plot of Joan Collins for blowing Buckingham Palace or some such shots. The film draws attention to the annoying attitude of his minor character, how he is annoying: every time the "kidnapper of Lipin" is small! I could feel consumed down in my teeth powder myself. Slowly photography, slushy and plodding, the movie is not only a memorable line ("fool me, you talented talent!") And it does not really suggest the original.
