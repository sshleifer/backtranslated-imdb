If you appreciate the renaissance in Asia's horror, do not bother with cow. The film is a ring, a tale of two sisters, a queue and a zoo-on (or good elements such as i or inner senses), as well as a list of works. Those films take on subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and an undoubtedly non-Western bim what's terrible. Grew together gestures and organs of all things that have caused the horrors of America in the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> This image is trying to mix Asian ghost story and Hollywood Slashar Flick, but it is a bad fit. One aesthetic is bound to smother another; Which guess? The filmmakers do not have any personal story telling Ruigu to rob a miscreant mistress, but the situation is frustrating. Clich√©s, shit characters, stupid plotting, a dull ghost, huh.
