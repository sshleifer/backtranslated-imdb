Roger Ranking is one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was sometimes academically responsible for some of my favorite films (such as Edgar Allen Bo adaptations "Red Death Mask" and "Pitt and the Pendulam") as well as some uninterrupted and fast rubbish acceleration (like "animals from the spectacular sea" and " God of shark reef "). Corman is also immediately unclassiable and has created a movie ?? Simply put ?? It is almost impossible to judge properly. For example, "trips", as well as these fantastic "gas-s-ss" may be labeled as a bit cyclic absorption. In other words, they are incredibly weird hippie-culture-influenced films. Half of the time you have not got the slightest idea of ​​what's going on, the character is walking back through the screen and where is this whole thing going? The plot is simple and still effective: A strange but deadly nerve gas accidentally exposes and immediately destroys that the entire world population is 25 years old. It is a flexible post-apocalyptic sign-language landmark such as atmospheric, radioactive, and nail, but the writer George Armeez and Roger gradually decided to turn it into a "tripti" road-movie comedy. Anyone in the characters is trying to prevent their inevitable impending death; They just found out the party outside the street and the little juvenile crime syndicate. The "gas-es-sits" make it very difficult to be a frustrating boring and bizarre. The whole script appears improvised at the spot and all the fun is at. Of course, my cup is not tea, but the film has a fan base and a lot of fans, so who will tell me that you do not have the time or money value?
