This is probably the worst Christmas film. The plot is virtually unattainable, the acting (especially the Affleck) is the best poorer. Ben Affleck fans will probably protect this film but deeply they will certainly agree. So far as I could collect a plot involving one million merchants, Ben Affleck, he should go to a place where his childhood reminds him and burns the list of things he wants to forget from his childhood. While doing this, he ended up paying his family for Christmas for the family resident ... and this is the case. The film goes away and finally he gets together with the family girl .... Bla Bla Bla.
