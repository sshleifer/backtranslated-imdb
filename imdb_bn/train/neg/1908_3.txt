Yet another humiliation and gay men everywhere stopped. Attempting to link this to a comedy has nothing to suggest it. Again we have a striking 'straight' hero, who can not be guided by a woman supposedly.

Even I do not think he is attractive and I'm not a fat, ugly old gay man (but thankfully balding)! Here's what acting talent can be done here in a bad script and it is really frightening. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the filmmod, but then Hollyweed's work is unlike other hacks than he is different.
