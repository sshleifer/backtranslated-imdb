Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. She is barely of it. Most of the screens are affected by the wonderful jokes. A character that is pushing an ongoing name is closing Jerk. There are lots of inches jokes, where punch line someone has an erection. This film is fun, as Kirstie Allie's British accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started like a weak action movie: Five minutes of story and then left! Unclear joke However, alongside horror writing, the film is also badly directed and the actress is terrible. Also, this movie has many great b-movie actors having an old bad comedy click. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfrey, Randy Quayed, and Phil La Mart. There are some people spending more time on the screen than this Rodney, although he's billed like the original character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in the drug stores sold for five mobile phones. Even that's too much.
