It's really a bad movie with bad acting and very annoying motion, though Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All characters are just annoying (except Lamas), and absolutely no one to take root or care !, plus the action is very annoying. The film gives us 3 villains, who are really annoying, ridiculous, and seemingly just wanted to stop the seasons !, plus it sounds very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lemas has most of the charisma but he can not save this piece and believes that the Open was really cool, at the end but the middle was incredibly annoying and I got the urge to press Fast forward button! Plus the dialog is particularly ridiculous! A cool bar scene that I really liked, but once bowed down to Lamus Dock, and the scene where villain Jennifer's family tortured and killed. Actually it was supposed to find boring when it was ridiculous! It's really a bad movie with bad acting and very annoying motion, though Lorenzo Lama is really cool! But it is not enough, not recommended. Directions are very bad. George Erschbamer here is a very bad job, with the work of the middle camera, the position of the bland, and the film to keep at a boring speed. Acting is quite bad (without Lamas). Lorenzo Lama is great here, and when she is not required to work, she is quite funny to watch, and really has a cool character, and she had many charishas, ​​but she could not save it, and chemistry with her custom! (Lama rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and when he looks fit, he is not very convinced and there was no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but there's nothing screaming and scared, he's okay. Robert Scott was very annoying, and not very annoying, like Chief Wilheln, he was ridiculous like the other two. The rest of the cast is bad. Avoid Overall! Avoid, even if you like Lama (like me). * 5 out
