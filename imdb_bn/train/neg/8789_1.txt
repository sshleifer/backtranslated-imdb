I checked it for one dollar on DVD so that I could easily smile like this horror movie. Every time that you feel that it can not get worse, it does inevitably Acting is absolutely awesome. The plot makes no sense at all. There is nothing to do with the "cold vengeance" script of the US DVD version titled "Cold Vengeance". The action scenes are probably their first take. There are many errors during the conversation, indicating that there is no intention of taking at least any other action to make this movie portable. I can not remember seeing a bad movie and sometimes get something bad - well, unnecessary with Wesley Snippers. No, who I'm curious about, when the Oscars have the ability to get the best picture award compared to the bad, unexpected Oscars.
