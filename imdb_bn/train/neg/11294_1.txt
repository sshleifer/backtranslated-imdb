Well, I've been a great fan of Black for a long time and have been disengaged after watching this movie. Let's number the problems ... First of all, this picture was mostly the first of the same character. This is called the original Black Stallion called PREQUEL. Why is Shitan dam's name correct or its color is not available? In Black Stallion Returns, we learn the black chestnut mother in the sea and in this picture she named a gray mother named Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it was set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could have been wrong, but the first was set in the 1940s when the ship was destroyed. The time line is not quite right to me. Also, as a cave, there is a Frenchman at the beginning of the film which is believed to be Shitan's father ... It seems to be a yoke at another notice. Ben Ishaq is the only character that seems to relate to this movie even before in any way. Something might be a nice family movie but it's my biggest movie disappointment in the year.
