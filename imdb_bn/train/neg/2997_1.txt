It was pictured back-to-back with the reconstruction of Canaan's best-known novel, The Lost World in 1992. And it shows. <br /> <br /> This movie has started suddenly, the conspirators and challengers of the challenge to defeat the lost world are coming back to defend the prehistoric plate, but then everything is reduced. Everyone has been leaked to Platyu and we have gone through the weak, annoying, excessive rehearsing of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (who are never seen) are just ridiculous. Are we expecting that ugly toy? And the Trenosaur spot appears to be original. Please <br /> <br /> and keep the 1925 silent version of Lost World. In this era of CGI and other advanced influences, incredibly, the best version of the twentieth century, and until finally the one decides to make a decent reboot it will be there.
