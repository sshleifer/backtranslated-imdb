It is a good idea, good acting, good photography and a great thriller around, but which is confused and executed. <br /> <br /> Starring Garcia John Berlin, who is a LA forensic detective who moved to a small town in California city, according to a friend. He was soon involved in a formal murder investigation, which created his theoretical notion of the existence of his serial killer, which nobody else believed. The familiar victim is thought to be blind, which leads to romance with a blind girl - believing to be a witness - a nearby school for the dark. <br /> <br /> Despite a largely curiosity story, there was a lot of quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie, where I myself wondered, 'How do we hell here? Or 'How did we find it?' Despite good acting, I found it confusing and flawed. John Malkovich is an F.B.I. As there is a small part in the end. Get out of Berlin investigator. <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
