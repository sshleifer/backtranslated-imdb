Actually I have heard a lot of the movie that this movie was disrespectful. I do not believe that Morgan Freeman and Kevin Speacy have played the part in this movie and watched it by themselves. Apparently they were right. I was frustrated and frustrated all the time during the movie - why I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I certainly did not expect much from Justin because he was not actually in the movie / theater. Business But Morgan and Kevin? I could not ask myself why he had agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their role is rather stupid. <br /> <br /> If you think players get suck, then I have to pay more attention to the story. Actually the story is the main part of the movie, but I am saying ... believe me ... this is not a movie that you want to give credit for his story. Imagine, a smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) has written a story against this system and simultaneously learning how to make his boss (Morgan Freeman) a 'real' journalist. All of these were supported by agents, who are still the heart of the trial (LL Cool J) and a bright investigator (Kevin Speacy). In the end, they beat the system with a happy last story. <br /> <br /> Yes, I could not even continue this. Just reminding me of the movie is already sick. Friends of mine, do not see this! Save your money and time for another movie.
