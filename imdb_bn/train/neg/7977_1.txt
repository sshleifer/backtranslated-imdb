Well, the Montreal Jesus is basically an intelligent movie. Actors are really good and well in the technical aspects of the movie. But, although I was very interested in this and wanted to think and talk about religion (I was an atheist), it was hard to force myself to see the movie bitterly and my opinion was an interesting fun. Why is this movie so incredibly annoying? I do not know. It is not recommended just so and so.
