This is a simple story but it seems very manipulative. There is a lack of feeling for it, it does not leave a room without imagination or personal thinking or reflection time. <br /> <br /> Although the animation is well-received, I think it is very presentive. I liked more pictures from behind, I liked more space in the background and probably it would not be too bad for me. <br /> <br /> But it works well for a Hollywood style film, but it's Armman's derivative movie and this is bothering me. If this creator can work without voice-over, then perhaps a long film will be examined. <br /> <br /> I think the voice is very glitch.
