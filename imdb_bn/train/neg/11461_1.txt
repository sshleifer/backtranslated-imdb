Please do not waste +/- watching this movie for 2 hours of your life - do not fix it. Especially if someone is lucky that you graduate beside you. If you ask me or you cheek I wait for something to happen - it's not. I'm not one to stop watching those parts of the movie through one. I always have to see it through the end. What a huge mistake Make yourself a favor and go and draw a wall and watch it dry - much more entertaining. Please do not waste +/- watching this movie for 2 hours of your life - do not fix it.
