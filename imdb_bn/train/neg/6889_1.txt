I saw a preview of this picture while showing another DVD and "Zone Heder, Dean Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Walch, it could be better than the summer resurrection, so I ordered it to the local library." "Lawrence Welck" will bring more smiles than "the uncle's son". I felt sorry for the actors to read the script in their own privacy and they could not imagine what would happen to them. Actually tell their line in front of the camera. Most likely, at least, probably next time they are given a movie like this, they "just do not say!" One Anna two ....
