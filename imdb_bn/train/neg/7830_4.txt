So far, nightmares and dreams have become uncertain and frustrating. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, gave a little groundbreaking story in the groundbreaking or true horror way, but at least it was well-known, obscure and apparently striking, the strong performance of William Hurt and its very influential special effects. A mini series <br /> <br /> However, the second story of the series was just horrible, or not well. Badly in Platteplay, Unstable for Untouchables, Unfair heroes need to work unreasonably, and Characters, Unacceptable Expositions, require letters continuously in RAM. Acting overdone and unbelievable, and I feel more sympathetic for the cold blooded murder in the first story than the couple's newborn couple. The filmmaker used one million techniques to try to fool the fool, but the end result with amateur acting and writing seems like a new year's movie school project, the camera is going for itself and a little or a tangle towards the plot. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues this way, I would get bored. I am William H. Looking forward to Messi's installment, and hopefully he will be the perfect director and screenwriter for his segment. It is incompatible to predict the quality far too far.
