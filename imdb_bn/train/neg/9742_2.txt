It is an uninterrupted film about a scientist that creates a telepathter device and becomes terribly disconnected when using the machine in its own transport. Plots done before fly and others. He does not get the statue only, but he can electrocute people with a touch. What is really stupid about this film is that we believe that this person does the work that is against him Perhaps he can create millions of people for the organization he is working on, but the head of the organization tries to destroy his telepathter at every step of the path. Eventually, the projected guy does not hurt anyone in some of the others.
