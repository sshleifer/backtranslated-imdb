<br /> <br /> This movie takes big time. It reminds me of the movie's revival (Christopher Lambert), which I think is very annoying. And "Semana Santa" everywhere is an even poor movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Alida is a grand gentle lady in the history of european film. I like the mental appearance of "Suspriya" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I would say another good thing in this movie ... if you want to sleep fast then use it ...
