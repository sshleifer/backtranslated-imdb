Just saw it, me and my good half could believe how horrible and bad it works. If someone else thinks of her well, you will be happy easily. I actually leave this out for a night to visit, it has all been done before. That is to say. Hostel springs may remember, but at least it does not make you poorly played and lack of story lines, the same old stuff, re-written, I could not read much about this movie, even I have recommended to my friends, some of my fault said it was good! Relinking back to the back of hate, horror or hate than your average "scary movie", it would be said, please do not bother about this movie. Get Mary Poppin. Now that's awesome! I now go off, go to the movies and see some scarier than this, probably a little Miss Sunshine
