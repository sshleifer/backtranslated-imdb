I understand that in 1971 the US Army was destroyed, but this film was incredible. It was not supposed to be a training camp, the SV Penalty Battalion was a sad smile novel. The writer must certainly be a real army hate. Psycho Serengetante who beat the enemies of the people, he was in prison cell and the vain black top sergeant should be fired. These men were going abroad, the accepting unit would be surprised that all the unused disadvantaged employers are coming, and an investigation will take place. One of the scenes that it was completely blew was one of the electrocutions. The alleged barracks room lawyer was recruited, instructed on a barrel for the illegal order (for benefits of the POWs in the Geneva Convention), a listed person, a real assault on sexual assault and an overwhelming officer. Intead he just walked away. After that, discipline breaks down a madhouse level and the film becomes unwanted. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
