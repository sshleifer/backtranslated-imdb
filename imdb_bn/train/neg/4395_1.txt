December holidays special, like Frosty, should be produced especially with quality music and a healthy, yet light hearty tale. They must have a touch of holiday mysterious magic. Basically, their appearance, words, and feel should be ... well, "special" and they should have a suitable and suitable holiday holidays sub-text. <br /> <br /> When I saw Snowman on the Lodge of Frosty TV, I got my kids (6 and 8) the original Frosty story and enthusiastically pumped for it by telling me how many stories it enjoyed as a kid. My wife and children jumped on the couch to watch the movie, the hope was high, but in my 10 minutes my kids were awake and my wife and I used to "see each other" and keep looking at our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually talking about going to bed - I guess they got annoyed with insensitive language and pointless, isolated sections. I'm actually embarrassed about the frustration of this movie (and myself). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty is Snowman, along with the worse-normal episode as a bad episode of the strange parents, the Sponge Bob shoots out of a classic holiday movie. Do not make mistakes with me ... those shows are okay and I like them as the next guy, but when I look at the rough weird father or sponge bob, then my low expectations (medium, off-color, zero subtract, for mind) numbing episode ) Always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We spend some good books and spend reading the evening together. Snowman frosty is a much better choice than shameful shame.
