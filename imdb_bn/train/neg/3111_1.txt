I could have rated this movie 10 minus, but sadly it was not given. <br /> <br /> I can not walk in the first five minutes of this movie because I can not say. I was gone with my tendency and should have left immediately !! A lot of people have worked in our theater and sadly I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> This story lacks all the criteria for the story. No plot Awesome acting! Even Robin Williams was so frustrated that I could not see any other film. The solo talk of the story did not go out of the parlah talk. I liked the Tazaret scene. Very bad it does not shock some meat in the senselessness of the plot. The author and director of this photo will have to make the tower!
