First off, I have given some assurance that Mr. Chomsky escaped from the mouth. His interesting fact is that at the interesting counterpoint, people hit the campus circus. He comes across the desired, unassuming, practical. He does not meet the current political style (overwhelming bilateralism) and he is to set both his distinction to distant left side as well as to the left, and to set his sights on good grounds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is a ugly. In fact, I even call it a documentary but do not call a collection of lectures. Viewing "rebellious without rebellion" means not to be different from watching the speaker in the 3 taped segment on SP. There is no camera movement, no editing, no stylistic touch. There is no story, no description. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, production is strictly amateur. The audio is terrible and incompatible; Sometimes we can not speak Noah, at other times we can not hear the presence of those who are positive in their presence. When Num is speaking very rarely, we allow viewers to react, only when we make his wife a quick shot, clearly we see him with every speech and pride in his beams. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and say that you can check the taped lectures in the cassette or CD to listen in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 and ... I am a liberal mood today.
