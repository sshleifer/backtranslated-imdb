This woman acts as a mockery of the rights movement. Of course, it means COACH (movie) which means a wonderful experience. It goes to the same vein like FASTBREAK (which was good, but still fast), and basically a standard rental fluff. It's easy to understand what is meaningless for this movie. Suddenly, by choosing a path to victory, anyone who tries to spend time away from normal jobs by training a bunch of loots. This is the same feeling you can get after viewing it. An excellent effort to throw an opposite sex against a man's duty, but I hope for a better thing.
