The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it was hoped that you would see an enthusiastic, well-freed movie. Hopefully I hope to open the shot to fill. My thinking was related to this "film" because of the gradual advancement of "film": Did my popcorn have too much butter? Will the actors have to give this "film" director? Check my ticket at the box office? Yes, dear readers. I saw this picture in the theater! This is the only exception to watching a movie at home in the movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Was there any redemption value? Peter Lemongley was an ideal college "Nerd" in his moment, especially in a dog collar. Since another "film" went from trying to make a comical, a spiritual uplifter in a family drama. It is the one successful in this front. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
