After thinking about a great skill of the two roles in the Man of the Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas wandering in place of Brian Denhe? It was not the same as Spar and Harrison, as illustrated by Douglas. Perhaps he was so poor about the plot - to find Jimmy is followed by other people, returning to Jim after extended absence. He could not expect a girl to wait without any contact from him and find a competitor. For a Disney movie, there are abusive language, and unnecessary parts until Jim and Jessica are married - too much Lam. According to my family members, insult to the viewer's intelligence. I'll stick to the first one, and try to forget I've never seen a seagull!
