O my God, what a horrible film. All right people involved in the film, unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I have been paying for it, then I will be more upset. This image is obsolete. How Tarintino might be involved with such a slow, unexciting film. It is not surprising that it did not get much distribution, everyone was ashamed to be involved. I can create a good movie with a Data Camcoder and My Big Toy. Out of boring, I really hate it. Terninio just got some standing in my eyes. This will be some kind of ill joke. Do not bother with this film. If anyone even indicates that you will see it, kill them.
