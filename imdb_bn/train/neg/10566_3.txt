Although I consider myself a fan of the 5 television series in the series, the original film that was presented in the series was a weak start. Although there are many elements to be matured later in the series, the speed of the gaudering is slow, the makeup is somewhat inadequate and the plot is confusing. Bad, characteristic of the premier episode is poor. Although rating charts show that many fans are willing to ignore these problems, I think the collection has often stopped what happened in a spectacular series.
