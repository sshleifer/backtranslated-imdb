Although Len is intelligent in SNL, he only for one minute. Most SNL likes skit-to-movies, it can not complete 90 minutes. It's some clever moments (than you've seen the trailer) but the actors are basically wasteted. Tim Meadows does not have much better points in his but good but plots. Farrell has a bit of part. Farrell may be funny people ... but this is not the movie. What a shame
