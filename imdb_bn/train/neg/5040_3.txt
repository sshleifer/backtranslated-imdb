I've ever read comments about this being the best Chinese movie. Perhaps if you see only a dialogue between Chinese movies, long-stretch strings and silence, and the edit is hacked, then you're on the spot. <br /> <br /> Complicated story-lines? Hardly Try young and amateur. Fine Mood and Hunting Memory? Hardly Try out boring and trite flat out. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I could not wait for it to end. Especially when the best lines in the movie are "How are you? I'm fine, are you sure?" How nice! Character Depth I think the illogical smoking cigarette was supposed to speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I was totally disappointed in this. Even Zhang's sense of regret was better than "Road Home".
