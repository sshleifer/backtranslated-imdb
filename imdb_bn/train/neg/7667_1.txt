Definition of a hate defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of hatred or hate." If someone thinks of a more appropriate word or definition than in the dark, please let me know because I can come up with it well. However, I do not think that this word actually describes how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this picture with my two roommates. I have a similar taste to one, the other is an action / adventure flick guru. The next person usually does not take care of the size of the plot hole, as long as there are plenty of explosions in the film, he will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> It is said that we have entered the theater on Friday for watching only dark. I'm not surprised that we were the only man in the theater. When I started, I immediately asked. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst scene of a movie, and unfortunately I must admit that it gets worse. The opening scene is a 5-minute scroll text which is described. Yet I understood why it was described. The director obviously realized that only illiterate people would be able to confirm the idea of ​​paying for this movie. Yet, this first scenario is not the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it does not give any idea. It seems, in the same sequence, we are completely hearing about separation of movies. About an ancient civilization and its disguise with a portal, the other is about a mad scientist and his orphan test. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then start terrifying stories, acting, effects, and camera work. As actress they are red horror. He does not even do anything for one second, you think he is a museum curator. Slaughter is just bad, not believable, and there is no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> This plot is probably the worst thing caused by humans. The whole time and the same roommate is asking the question: What is this? What's going on? Without this scrolling rubbish, our slate itself has some described order. Are they good No Do they explain something? No Do we do anything to the audience at any time that we have to take care of? Again, no. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slaughter and Reed are together, yet they never act like other behaviors. But then left ... sex scene. I do not know again <br /> <br /> Well, I do not know, after 30 seconds of ending the tragic scene, we have a gunfight with 20 military forces and similar number of aliens. It is set on a heavy metal track and is more likely to brain hemorrhaging than possible thinking. <br /> <br /> And if that was not enough ... <br /> <br /> There are no major villains. There are scientist and "alien" things. At one point, the scientist controls foreign things and stands on a hill to attack the military mountain. Why? How did he become the Supreme Commander of this thing? Why do they listen to him? Again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is a hometown with Slayer and Red in the city. Why the city was rescued? What is the interruption thing to break through? What did the army tell them? Who knows ... and who does this point? I do not and you do not <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it was said that alien exposure to sunlight exposes the alien thing. And okay, you've guessed it, it's between & amp;% $ ing the day and it can be brighter. Maybe Alien bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know, and I do not have any difference. <br /> <br /> Now I ran out of the theater after the movie was over, my 6 feet 6 inches, Weaving my weapon and my Afro vibor did not say to see this movie. Even my Gong-ho action / adventure roommate (Any movie that can be spent and detonated for only 2 hours in the blast in one film is considered to be the greatest thing ever), acknowledged that the plot of the plot was very clear. <br /> <br /> To enrich this Crap-West I can give it 0.0 / 10 and if I do this I will reduce it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want this movie to be my worst enemy.
