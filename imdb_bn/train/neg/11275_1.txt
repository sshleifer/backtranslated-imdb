It's a star cast and really a long stock clone with a scary script. I do not have any idea why so big British actors have signed this junk, they are certainly guilty. A miss match for a story goes forever and forever, and if I did not pay for it, I could have closed it after 10 minutes. The worst movie ive is never seen, the real cruelly used bogow of honor (I use the word 'I') 'Gammo' (I feel guilty as a 'so-called director' for the lost time) half of my life) but with this trash Almost down right there. Of course the worst one I have ever seen is one of the 5 movies. Such stuff reminds Hollywood that real horror films have no exclusive rights to them.
