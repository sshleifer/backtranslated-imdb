I do not know much about filmmaking, but there are some stories of good movies to tell ... your letters will start and finish their journey. They might have been at Brooklyn's last exit, but it is not in a satisfactory way, and I do not understand the meaning of a happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brutal labor strike, set a number of thread threads at speed. The most unlikely character is some of the walks of movie walk around the screen. But the last exit of Brooklyn failed to conclusively convey these stories ... it does not shine at the end of their end, or some artistic "completion" explosions in some malicious stratosphere. <br /> <br /> in two cases, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> is a sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), hit and killed by a car. And for that it's in the movie .... He's gone, everyone's memory has been lost .. No response to his friends, enemies, lovers ... <br /> <br /> Another idiot is stupid, stupid , And secretly gay striking leader, rejected by labor, found by his gay boyfriend, and neighboring thugs, gets stomped by thugs. The scene of the beaten-out scene shows in Brooklyn's street, and street lighting is much like the Nazi death camps ... and the scene diminishes and continues ... and the camera pushes the body. Labor leader, and he has been crucified ..... PPPUULEVAJ. And of course it is also for her .... brain erosion ... has gone <br /> <br /> The following line ............. It does not matter what the critics of the film said in 1989 .... Depressed piece Avoid it. And if you are not predetermined, it is indeed an eligible NC-17 rating for physical, mental and sexual cruelty ... even the teenager does not see it.
