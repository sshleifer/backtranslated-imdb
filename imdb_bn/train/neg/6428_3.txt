This is the third E.L. Morris movie I saw, and I do not like growing his style. He is very interesting and has many characters, making a documentary for great personality, and then with the tongue-in-cheek edits, they have fun. This is not really their direct fraud, and Morris has been saying most of the time, "No, no, these people are really interesting, really!", But always these small tiny corners and not so subtle editing techniques that show that Maurice is joking behind them Being <br /> <br /> This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of biological separation ... Those who study African barbarous molerats, it is surprisingly anti-like, lion tomer, a man who is a garden full of animal-shaped baskets And a robot designer. Do you think the general theme of the movie is changing the question of animal, human, and life, questioning? So the title of fast, inexhaustible, and out-of-control does not actually mean anything in the picture ... right? Of course, Maurice thinks these people's emotions (he can call them "passion") feel a bit annoyed by creating synthetic designs on life. I do not share that fear and really appreciate some connections with Maurice. <br /> <br /> But I pressured her cruelty. Without a voice statement and leaving the words completely to the interviewers, it does not seem that Maurice never owes that concern to the collective head of viewers. Instead, he brings together footage of circus footage and pest together when they come out of the context of circus and pest, which shows collective inconsistency behind what these people are saying. I can not find them unreasonable, I find them all very handsome and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Of course, he did not nominate jokes, which means that he is a bad craftsman instead of silence. subverter Considering the way I watched these films, especially impressed me, I am not really interested in finding out what he is trying to do. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
