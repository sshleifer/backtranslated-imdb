Note to George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 Reef "I do not think so, * Reproduction *". <br /> <br /> Refer to my favorite "Why do you like her?", for complete stupidity. That is, and "OK is not good!" After all, I would say we have to credit the MST3K crew to try to laugh about this TV movie. You can not really have a lot of dialogue; Bill S. was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even he will deny it. A junior high school play club can do well. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying a book and reading 'Hamlet'.
