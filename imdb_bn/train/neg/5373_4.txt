A classic example of a growing problem with these movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack dramatically more loud than dialogue? What makes sense? This picture is not alone. Most movies seem to work this now. For two years, I thought it was a bit wrong on my TV, but I have a new TV and it's there again. The backdrop of a city block behind the actors is that the dialogue could sink. <br /> <br /> This film was even more confusing because, whatever the English version, the woman continued to be in Mumbai. I hope Jinn Reno will say, "Forgive, you do not talk or you'll find marble out of your mouth." If you see it in DVD and also have your High School French, then I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because Reno was so good on Lyon. People rave about the scenes, but I saw a TV and I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
