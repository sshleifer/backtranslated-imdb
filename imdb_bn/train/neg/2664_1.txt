The unexpected, clipped thriller has a young couple in cross-country research on America's most notorious murders, which is gradually becoming a street partner with a young girl and her graduate boyfriend - this is the true psychology. Arty and isolated, the option of the film's tone pouty in disguise and stupid flamboyance. Perhaps the creation of handsomely, but eventually ridiculous. Brand Pitt's performance is godly as a low-rent rented killer. * ****
