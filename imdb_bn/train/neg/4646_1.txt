Spinal tap was fun because if you knew a bit about heavy metals, then you have seen jokes throughout. If you know something about porn, this knock-down documentary will leave you cold. It's all about lying. <br /> <br /> The spinal tap was fun because it took a familiar world and pushed it to the top. This image is not funny just because it is a picture of how obscene is made that does not face any relation with the real world. <br /> <br /> Here the acting is horrible, but if the main idea is not much, then the movie was good. But it's not.
