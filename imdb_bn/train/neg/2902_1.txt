Spoiler: family reconciliation is a bunch of passive-aggressive people. The script is not telling them and some people will not work, at least someone with a discipline cone. The hero is falling for the woman when she will see her remarriage in the bookstore as her relative, she will be unaware that she will present her brother's friend in a reunion. He tried to postpone his brother's demand, but he knew that our hero clearly defrauded him, dressed in a robe and behaved like a brother and brutally insisted on him, he agreed with all the brothers how he saw him expand. Please. At one stage, he actually discovers and gets into a shower with him. She tried to cover her eyes. His heart is breaking. He thinks it's funny, as long as he suddenly decides that he does not want to be a brother and abandons the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really drags. The audience coughed and fidgeted his way through long sloping. Writing is intelligent and incredible. We almost went outside, but some would keep thinking that something would happen, but nooooo. All lovely reviews must be written by the rock, see the strap like this, dupe out poor suckers like me. Compared to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Tell me Shame on them, writers, actors, producers, and theaters create the screen to do this bad thing!
