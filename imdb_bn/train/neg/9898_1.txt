This version of "Moby Dick" insults the audience and claims that it is going to show a dirty first chapter sentence instead of Melville's novel - even the famous "Call of Ishmael Call". Apart from John Barrymore's even lazy performances, it is perhaps the biggest example to modify a famous novel to modify Hollywood's (especially initially Hollywood) and to encourage its potential at the box office. The beautiful, poetical language of the novel has been completely destroyed, and Ahab has been transformed from a satirical, reprehensible, emotional madman, an insane, intelligent hero who wants to kill only Moe Dick when his drunk (!) Turns away from his wooden structure Leg This psychological evil brother is addicted who wants to fianc√© for himself, and a different end!
