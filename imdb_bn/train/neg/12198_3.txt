Big Wars is growing with Transformers, I was not very familiar with the original Transformer, and now I have seen a great movie and now I saw the cartoon I saw it, I have to say that I like the real cartoon and live action movie, more than the Best of the World. . <br /> <br /> I do not like BW characters, I think the optimum prime-like character is better than the Optimus Prime. <br /> <I mean, "AutoBot's Transform and Roll Out!" "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" Sounds better than The voice of the original Optimus Prime still convinces me that he is more than an original commander, Optimus Prime. <br /> <br />, POWERSTAR OPTIMUS Prime Optimi is far stronger than Optimus. Just look at the web! <br /> <br /> The more bad version of the BG genre, the more serious version of the megatron genre is more like that. <br /> <br /> What cool, robot changing animals or robots in vehicles and spaceships changing? Depend on the Battle Transitioners of the Battlefield of the Day!
