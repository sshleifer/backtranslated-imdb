Dave Lucie (Dale Midchef), MaM Rachel (Dennis Crosby), 10-year-old Aileen (Bleede Beardle) and Gage (Miko Hughes), about 3 years old, went to this beautiful house of Mine. Keep the highway in every 90 seconds or in front of his house. Neighbors (wonderful Fred Guin) feel at home ... and their pet cemeteries show where babies buried their pets, but a little more pb The land that brings the dead back to life ... but the dead return to a nasty mood. <br /> <br /> "Definite Spilhers ** The novel of Stephen King was good - it was a long time but it created such characters and situations Which made you look after your care. This film jets up the development of all the characters and runs only thunder and violence. Animals die on camera (I know it It's still boring, but it's still boring); The little boy was hit by a half and opened at the time of his casket funeral (a complete sick scene), he was brought back to life and attacks and killed man with his mother (how could I hang him 3 years old) I think); A spooky awakening (do not ask), trying to help the family for some reason ... The movie only works for visitors to spread every deadly death or violence in your mouth. It just goes out of the way of shock you. ** Last Speaker ** <br /> <br /> There is no help in acting. Midchef is just awesome as a father - he's handsome and buff but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. The two kids are just boring. Only Gin handed it out with the film's best performance. <br /> <br /> This image accepts large laps for the audience and shows total respect for the characters incredibly stupid things (especially at the end of the Midchef). This film hit a big box office in 1989, which led to a more bad sign in 1992. I then saw it in a theater and how the audience kept tension on violence and I was scared to see what I saw. . A sick repulsive horror film. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> <br /> When you think it's complete and can not be bad, then Ramones can sing a title !!!!!! ("I will not be buried in a pet cemetery"). Truly beyond trust.
