Return to Scotland (again), Lasci (again) for justice for his life. Since the faithful dog is sleeping on his master's grave, according to law he must die. Curiously, it has been explained that the lassi was not a "legal" owner, which was obviously against the old Scottish law. Three days later, there is no owner, dogs must be destroyed. Admand Gavin (as John Tril) claims the case of the lassi, which leads to an extended flashback, which shows the acceptance of the loss of Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although it's a fun, based on the original story ("Graffiers Bobby"), "Challenge to Lacey" reconsider several earlier lassi scenarios; And, it is not developed on them. Speaking relatively, this one is sloppy and unexciting; And, it's a frustrating follow up on "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and most other actors may be charming, but this one can not raise. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "it's a wonderful life") is among the significant children supporting Lucie; After a long time, he would grow up to marry the "dark shadow" wonderful "Angelique" (Lara Parker).
