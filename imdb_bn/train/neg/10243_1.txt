This is the biggest pill I've ever seen shit. Do not hire! The makers of this movie may be the band to create another movie. It is a plot that starts with something, then nothing fades faster. Then I would see the paint dry as I look rather covered. The actors were terrible, the plot faded quickly, left to work left filming left. This shit is not a good thing to say about movies. If you rent this movie you will lose your money. I really enjoyed the National Lampon movie, but it was wasted time. Learn to write, learn to learn, learn to learn and learn instruction. I think I should file a lawsuit in this disguise that makes the film meaningless for the cost of the rental and time spent.
