I ended up watching tenants with close friends and hired the movie based on the look of Snoop Doug (a sensual idol of them). It is understood, I did not expect much. I thought the movie would include Snoop Dog related behaviors and include a common array of frequently viewed videos on fabulous rap videos. However, most part of my generalization was wrong. Unfortunately, this movie could not be made better. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie will be described as a serious serious drama, but I would describe it as a very seriously irritating drama flickr. The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg), who are trying to create their own separate compositions. The opposite lifestyle of their pole ends up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship comes across a wild roller-coaster throughout the film - most of which contributes to the character of Snoop - reminds someone of the serious cases of split personality disorders. And even though the movie is a drama, acting - which has a tragic and serious tune - Snooker and more ridiculous than anything else from the company. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend for those who pay attention to this movie because it has many dialogues and then there are many more conversations. There are some medieval conflicts, but even they are mostly restrained with dialogue. In the end, suddenly I was shocked and turned towards me. It twisted a little bit, was somewhat unexpected and was a perfect way to wrap a movie needed to finish. I could not help but watch the last credit, but started thinking, "Oh God, how can I finish this snazer?" However, the director carefully planted hints and subtleties directed toward tired - which is more visible than a crowded street Waldo except for nothing except all black sweaters.
