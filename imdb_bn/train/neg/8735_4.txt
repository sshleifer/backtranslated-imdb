Let me down in this movie whats up. When Hooper told the mayor to stop the park, it seemed like a lot like Jaw, when Roy Schieder told the mayor to stop the beach. They say no way to both summer! But the box tells Hooper to get the killer's mind and feel like one. But he's not really very interesting or exciting. While I am in the office, I am not sure how he and his partner have experience of working with police in relation to how they are going to solve this case. They just say the police work and we'll solve it. And what's up with all the old men with pool cues. Even they did not believe that they were a group of people. And then the man who was suspecting the man was looking for a murderer. Its hundred dollars itching and he thinks his D @ is the size of a schoolblog. Come on what cruddy line I thought he would beat him with baseball bats in other movies. I used this movie and would not buy it new. I recommend you ignore this movie. Oh, and you're enjoying a fun coffee, it was fun to see the microphone on the scene.
