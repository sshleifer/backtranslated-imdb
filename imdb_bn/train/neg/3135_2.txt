What was a piece of junk in this movie. The compound was right, but even the beginning of the fog effect was mixed with a giant mixture (even the effects of Hercules was also good) with normal size people. I knew it would be bad. But the really horrific part of the movie is the dialog. It's totally stupid, stupid and stupid. I felt like it's written by some 9th grade of creative class and acquired a degree. I want to hijack the compere van madm and other actors to follow this film. <br /> <br /> I was a partner of my chessy and bad movies (I like the vibration series), but this ... do not recommend at all. It's stupid and completely flabbergastingly bad dialogue will be cringe to you.
