What was the purpose of this photo? I recommend the performers and their producers and directors had nothing to do with a big payday to make a big deal. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Darn, could not keep my interest in this annoying movie. A braindead ex-pugilist falls with a weird woman and her relatives. She started out as a fix for the woman-it's a man, and being caught in a mortal wind up and a kidnapping project. It is very confusing I could not even write a decent criticism. If you see it, my sweet, then make it sure after dark so that you can go to sleep.
