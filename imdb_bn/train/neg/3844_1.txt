First of all, I want to say to everyone, I want to tell everyone that a friend of the actor who played "Transvestite", his name is Robert Dogdell, he is an awesome actor, although it is not saying much about his film, he has several plays and songs. She is currently teres b. C. Living in From where I came to, he laughs almost every Saturday in our house. * OK, now about the movie, I will not reconsider it for anyone who did not see it because it is not a watchful movie, I find it as a bad movie The main reason it never remains in place, it's time to keep bouncing in, so it is difficult to follow some points, and secondly, it is really annoying * Smile * While the acting is great, the movie just does not compare.
