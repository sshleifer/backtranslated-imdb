Do not ever waste your time on this point. Movie A rebuilding that was not needed to rebuild Everyone who came out of the theater made the same comment. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicholas was biking on the date palm, he was swimming in the water and roaming under the mountain with bees attack, but he still kept his case completely and the shirt became white. The very last scene <br /> <br /> While Alen played well with Bernstein and Cage, the film was as incredible as it was. It's amazing how wonderful actors can do such bad movies. They do not get a copy of the first script. If you are interested in watching the movie in a short time to get out of the DVD.
