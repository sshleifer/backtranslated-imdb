Strange and unlike characters turn their way through a radioactive plot that can wrap a rope and be interesting, if only you can take care of yourself. I can not speak this "twist and bend" (which contain all mysteries for a recipe for Tuna Casseroll) but not even the directing of the operator's ability to keep the characters centrally in the frame. On the other hand, Angel Harmon has a very nice atheist and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only true surprise for the movie is that it is a big name. When you do not get released on the theater in spite of a star-acting film, you may be interested in something bad. <br /> <br /> And indeed it is done.
