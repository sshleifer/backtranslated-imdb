"Arhaan" did not add positive to the Kung Fu style. It is a mistake to compare these confusing pictures with the values ​​of inspired craziness and Stephen Chow's film quality. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the war scene is nothing new. Everything presented here has been improved by the likes of Emu Zhang, Tony Jha and Jackie Chan. Intelligent motion pictures require the argument in battle. Can not serve a point that does not have any harmful effects like the "matrix" series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zia Zhang acted so easily with "House of Flying Daughters". Kung Fu movie having a martial arts background works well. Throwing inexperienced actors in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Uteo in "Assumei") unless you are a very talented director, who is proven "arrogance" is not like Seng-Waiyan Ryu.
