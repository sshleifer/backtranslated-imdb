* Keep ahead of spoilers and bashing extreme * <br /> <br /> When this show debuted at first, I found it tolerant and fun. There was a fairly expensive cartoon that likes kids and adults. It was high ratings along with sponges. But when Hartman and his team entered the chest, this fall started. <br /> <br /> First of all, the toilet humor is not all fun. You can easily ridicule a little cat with a little smile, but it is the only listener who can laugh at this kind of joke. Next kiddie has joke. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can not laugh like this! Somebody help me! But of course, it would not be worse if this event is not bad. Do you see how the team illustrates Australia? They did not see anything of them, but the conglobar-loving, booming-throwing ordinary people who live in the hot desert. But now ... this coup is guilty of the uprising of why really sucks the most of them ... JOKES above !!! The show is constantly showing the same jokes (most of them being irrational), it seems to be the greatest thing of all time! Cosmo is one of the most defective. They mentioned how they hated and the cosmos would be frustrated by referring to "super toilet" (which is also a mixture of kidduse humor in it). And who can forget that the dumpling battery rum rage, that every devout parents of EidSdale will use that e-mail episode? Do you know, that single parent or parent (negligence to other parents) would say the same sentence before entering their children's home? Yes, this may be the first-class humor to some people, but it is pure to others. *** <br /> <br /> If I do not make a mistake, believe that Butch Hartman is saying something about the end of the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says, it's like Monique Nicholledon Sho. I just do not agree with it ?? I think it's just another pile of horse trunks that we get our cartoon station every day, only bad.
