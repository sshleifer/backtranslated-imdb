SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> This is not really a very good movie ... but I like the idea behind it ... and filmmakers look good on considering the small budget. Had to work with. The film is apparently a "episode" of the Japanese Japanese Reality show, which sends several competitors to a seal off of "danger zone" and there are three dressed cripps sent after their assassination. Survival, if any, fame and fate ... All other people just put the dead in the air. The main flaw in this movie is that the performance is quite bad. Nobody thinks real "real". Acting actors of murderers are quite funny ... because they illustrate chassis and top-notch characters of popular modern horror movies ... and if it is a real show then how exactly will it be. The film seems to be being simultaneously ... a cameraman who follows the competitors of "Danger Zone" and everything can be seen from the standpoint of his camera ... but the lights continue and remain closed (one by one to "cut" For, I'll imagine).
