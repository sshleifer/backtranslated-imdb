Just saw a pre-screen tonight. Can i say It lives up to its middle trailer runs, even though it's not saying anything. It did not do any work that did not make any movie before it and it played in clich√© fashion that eventually I reached the point where I only stopped laughing because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let's play a comedy. <br /> <br /> So let's see ... we are trying to bring our former girlfriend back to us, but we have a great character Postal order is not enough, check. We have three friends, each of them has their own "personality", one of them is best friend, who tries to get the best friend of the main girl's character but is continually rejected, another friend is very painful, which is not seen in all positive 24 / 7 and it is cast for one-liners (in this case it only references the film's references A group, especially from Disney) and the third person whose name you never remember, but to be fulfilled in the square and to listen to anyone who will listen carefully and throw in sympathy ... check. Our daughter has a former boyfriend and her parents **** - Block the relationship in a possible way while searching for things, do not mention strange family members on behalf of the main character ... Check. We have an hour long movie in the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have continued oath of "funny" moments of the movie, people are frustrated or hit, trailer scenes and gay comebacks ... Check out. And the courage I dared to call it a spoiler, but we will publish it even before a thought that just as it is a thought that even it will even see the movie ... check it out. <br /> <br /> True, this may have ... No, wait ... a PG-13 movie should have been there. All that was needed to be excluded was F-bombs. Sincerely, getting more publicity from such crowds enjoying such humor, earning less media exposure, and thus were not liked more than people like me who should have tried it in recent times. R-rated comedies like SuperBad and Knocked-up. The humor of this movie is very common, which is not compatible with ordinary people. I bet and even the actors spoiled time for providing the camera with most conversations and activities. Let's put it this way ... in the theater, it will help you to laugh because it's a big screen and others laugh. When this movie hits the showtimes and you're turning it off 2:00 pm, you may be interested in changing the channel. The only thing to see is the warmth of Alice Eve (who is not quite 10, but still feels good). <br /> <br /> In addition to the main resolution, this image kicked many concubines on the side and forgot to write more stories that they tried to develop at the beginning of the movie, where everything mostly flies out of the window. So there is a main resolution, but what does it come to? This is not really clear-cut, or it allows the "feel-good" to happen in the end. <br /> <br /> Nothing was valuable in this movie, and it was a good soundtrack. In addition to the excellent choice of alternative rock songs of the 90s, in some parts of the film (it started more), there was a great enthusiast, which reminded me of composing / composing David Homs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I figured a lot of rock band gamers would be caught on onto the ones that you saw it. But I keep your money. If it is PG-13 and you are with a group of friends at the age of 15 on Friday night, then I will find myself. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does not compete with and compete with rated movies over the past few years and, ideally, it is certainly not good.
