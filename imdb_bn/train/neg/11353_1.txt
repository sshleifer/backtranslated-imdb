Today, I have visited an Athenian cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years old), I have paid 3 x 12 euros (total $ 45) to not mention gas, popcorn and soda, after returning my 3D special glasses It was called "forced" to see the theater and "forced" to see what might be a great 3D movie page, but the ill-fated "fight like" movie I was seen, as I have not seen in the past 20 years ... and it's a movie for children incomplete ... Heaven's name! <br /> <br /> PS1: Average work does not leave 850 euros in a month (approx $ 1050 USD) <br /> <br /> PS2 My kids like it ... > Murray, Murron> wrote the script and did not have any other children like those who created this "3D disrespect" <br /> <br /> PS3 3D Animation is fantastic but who gives ....!
