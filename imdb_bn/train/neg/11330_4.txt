"Monster" is sometimes annoying, one of the very long Hollywood contraptions. Many scenes seem completely without mesh and energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean have been lost in the production of this huge Hollywood. A central idea of ​​this film is that a Ranchor will oppose the surgery for oil in his country, is unreasonable, and I know it because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean Taylor served coffee, releasing this otherwise annoying film. See "Hood" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show" for a more accurate and striking picture of how the modernity of Texas has changed the modernity.
