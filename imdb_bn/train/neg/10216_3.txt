Fiction has made me so much excited about Stranjara, I signed up to IMDB to write this review. Stranger Than Fiction is a wonderful, complex, sensitive and thought provoking film that ends up so much. Once you've suspended the logic of multiple laptops (why Will Fellell did not hear the voice of Emma Thompson 10 years ago when she started writing her book? "The phone was restarted." How did she know that she was calling her?), The film Challenge anyone's thinking about death rate, fate and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A short history of Dustin Hoffman's literature themes, especially the former English fans, should be entertained. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, though Will Ferrell could easily be a bastard murderer as a demoniacal spirit. His beliefs are a big jump in his beliefs. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. To the very end, I could have 9 stars out of 10 in this movie. As a metaphor for the journey of life, the film as a reminder that the great literature is a comedy or a tragedy as a tribute to the concept of 'the truth of writing', but both are not extraordinary. The whole movie directs viewers to understand and accept the moment of the will of the future. And we do not know how much respect he will make to any character, why we will accept the end. The last thing happens, the screen goes white, the credit roll. A perfect film is a deep and powerful end. Controversial one end for the week. <br /> <br /> No !!!!!!!!! No credit rolled. That's not to say so. Say Hollywood did not slip within 10 minutes, which completely reduced film honesty and heart. Dustin Hoffman said right when he said, "This is not a great composition, it's okay." The movie is a perfect review. Without me, it was not even right. I was so annoyed with the real betrayal of the decision to rob the movie that I was angry with the movie. I often do not cry I can be less careful about most movies, but I'm still angry about this. <br /> <br /> My questions to the author Jack Helm are: The original movie is over when the screen is white? And you are forced by vapid movie capabilities-that the movie will be tackled on the last unreliable root? Or did you finish yourself? I've read you brilliantly. I hope the movie ends with the original script for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know Jack Helm will never see this review, and I could not contact him to ask for myself. But, please, cine-gear, am I the only one who feels this way than Stanang? Seeing this movie a good thing has come from me: I now double the LOST in translation.
