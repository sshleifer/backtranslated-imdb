Fine performance and art direction did not make a good movie. This movie is so shocking and sad, I could not feel absolutely any pleasure at the end of the "Happy" in the Union Strike. The attempt of humor involving the lake during pregnancy is utterly disastrous, and any film related to the Belvede brothers has already been staging a strike against it. On positive note, one of the best-known actors of Lang America, he made this price almost by keeping the VCR alone. I give this a 4.
