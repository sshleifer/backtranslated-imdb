Tasteless I can not write even cute about movies. I laugh the whole movie. It was not supposed to be fun. There is no source of what Matt Farnsworth is doing. Iowa culture and metha have no idea without the knowledge of the story. I know Farnasworth comes from Iowa, which makes his movie even more confusing. Why does the two main letters have the pronunciation? It does not make any sense. The act was in the middle and at very difficult times to watch. Fierce violence and sex movies are filled. I assume that violence and sex were supposed to make the film intensify, but it was added as unbelievable and objectionable. The end of the movie is so extraordinary that I can do what I can to laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief. As I was leaving the theater everyone was going to laugh with me. The end of the film meant to create tears, but it was just the opposite. Do not waste your time in this horrible movie, unless you want to see unconscious, sad, overacted, clich√©d drivel.
