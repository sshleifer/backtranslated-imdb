This is not a terrible movie, really, and Gleen and Ketle top-actor. In addition, they do an acceptable job with very weak scripts. The scenery is lovely and some interesting twists in the plot. In addition, why I created this actor and crew film, I professional because they are professionals and they pay for it. But I wonder why the studio spends time and money for making a movie and then does not publish it for theater audience? Even if a film is flopped at the box office, it must definitely earn some money. If you are interested in Keitel or Glen, rent the video or grab it on TV, as I did. Imagine, this movie will not help solve immigration campaign with Mexico, but the TV rental is far better than the experience of 90%.
