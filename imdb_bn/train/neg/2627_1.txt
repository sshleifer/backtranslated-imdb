This bomb is not just an 'explosion' after another, no comedies and simply stupid situations. Really, extremist extremists. The reality is not one of its strongest points. I can give it 1 out of 10. I could make it a zero but that option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lathgow and Shooterland deserve a good role. But then at the time we need all the money. And I'm still back to Tim Burton First on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough that he was a Turkey. But if it was a turkey, then this movie is not even a summer. I want to say, "give me my money". You can bet if I could. But that's the problem with the premium service, a variety of subscriptions.
