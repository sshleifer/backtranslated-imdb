I'm not a artistically prone person. I'm a science psychologist and I think this film was probably a movie of the Campi Arts type in the budget. I saw it parting with my drunk and my future step girl. We tried to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My mother tongue and her daughter stopped it and we went to the ocean 13, but this is another story. Do not be discouraged. I wake up the next morning and gave another shot to the movie. I started watching this movie again. I did not get it, I thought I could get it. I thought the most interesting part was the ash flooding and the fireplace found a place that was used to look like flowers. Interesting and still it was dead elements inside. It was a weird and bizarre movie. Maybe that was after them, but I will not be deceived again!
