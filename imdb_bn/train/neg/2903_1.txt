Oh dear This image can be sub-titled "When the author goes on the road to hartal!" What a stinker After reading the IMDb Review, in most cases I had such high expectations, which surprised me with the whole IMDB rating system, but it is a different matter. I loved Steve Carroll in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, etc. So I was expecting great things. Not saying, I'm disappointed that the year's lack. Many things are wrong with this movie, but I will show myself (a) the reluctance of any family that behaves like this person (a mass aerobics work, which planet is real life?), The camouflage script (love is murderous? Please), and the truth The donation character is so unlikely, have you thought that what she saw in her fell in love with her? This film was full of explosions with camouflage dialogue, wrinkle direction, ridiculous set-scene, and it was slow, slow, slow. If we did not live with my parents, we would leave for almost half an hour, who do not get too much money and do not want to waste money. Unlike the makers of this film, it was better to cut all the cash spent for making this movie a fool - which was more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid like this plague.
