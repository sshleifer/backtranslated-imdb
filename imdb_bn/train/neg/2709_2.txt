The only way to get something out of this movie is to contact it as a comedy. The light that I saw, gives it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. There is no depth in this picture and without any insight, it is a quantitative examination of "problem" and offers a little more than a quantitative examination. <br /> <br /> Creating a movie about stereotypes and creating a stereotype for every single character in your movie is a very poor technique - especially when the same characters break their hackneyed mold in only predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /> <br /> Boosta Rummies and Ice Cube make the movie almost noticeable and Michael Rapport becomes a better performer, but the script is so awful and social commentary is so fierce, it's hard to find something to redeem.
