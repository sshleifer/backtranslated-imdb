When I first heard about "Down to Earth", I was very excited. I was a fantastic big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially sunny in Dogma. But this picture proves frustration. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performance, and the movie was completely managed very badly. <br /> <br /> First stop, Chris Rock. She plays full movie as a standout comedy routine. Obviously, this scene works fine where he seems to be doing a standup, but it is not in the rest of the film. Even when he is talking to other characters, he still thinks he is trying to make people cheer up. He has some fun moments, but most of the time comes during the standup scene (no wonder he decided to make his character a comedian). For the rest of the cast, they are there enough to talk to someone Rock, none of them stand. Also, the film was badly directed. The film is basically a playful plot: the old white man plays like a black black comedian. Although I like the movie with multiple jokes, it could still work, and was quite funny. The problem was, we saw the rock too much and the old white people are not enough. It sounds funny because this white guy is calling Chris Rock's jokes, but most of the time we see Chris Rock, so it's not funny at all. In some scenes where they decide to show us white people like rack, in fact, ridiculous. If he was shown more then the movie was much more fun. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the humorous moments can not be created in such a way that "down to earth" worked poorly and weakly This one was very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
