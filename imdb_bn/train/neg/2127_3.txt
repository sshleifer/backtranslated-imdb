Why? Because one of the reasons, no attractive scenes were seen in a movie when opening Anne Margaret song "Bay by Birdi". He reprises at the end of the end, too (in a different mood!). Both surprising. Rent it and see it. Even if you see that it's all. You agree, I'm sure <br /> <br /> Everything was so nice about the original, just did not need a remix, sorry! Jason and Venus congratulate Tenn and Chinna as well as complimentary performances. Actually, all the actors and singers were giving their 'all' to this new version, but it's like trying to improve in "Casablanca" - it can not be fixed! It is a bit too sad to compare the emotionally compared to the trick you are trying to thank the remake, even sad, and even without any fault of the actors.
