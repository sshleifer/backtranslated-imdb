I just saw the second convent. I've enjoyed it before and figured it will be made for a well-lit Friday night film, some gore, some style, diverse humor and similar. I could not express it much sorrow. It seems that somebody set up the main thing for modern viewers to recreate the cheese-making epics like Night of the Dames, but the original thing was made. For the record I am not even a huge fan of the giants night, but some things I really dug about it. Confection cheese but not very well ness. In addition to the main daughter (favorite performance from Joanna Canton), Goth girl and Adrian Barbeau's Sweet Camo most characters were disrespectfully disrespectful, at the lowest low level of neutral, inferior Jockhud. The film is deeply threatened by a complete lack of nude nudity, which means it is difficult to see through the horror dialogue, to see the characters and to compliment the film's good aspects. The evil nuns get real and beautiful scenes in the design, although they are not afraid of anything, and the film is also well-equipped. At the end, when Adrian Barbeau looks at the scene, the film becomes quite entertaining because all the ugly people die and this is an evil nun wily. Stylized direction sometimes yields good results, though sometimes the camera moves very fast. After all, this is a movie where I can not make shining good things for me for disgusting things. More love for this type of movie can make it more enjoyable, but it was not a good time for me.
