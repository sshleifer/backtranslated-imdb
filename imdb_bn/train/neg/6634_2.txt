The first look of the cover of this film, it looks like a good Rock N Roll film. But do not fool the cover, or Alice Cooper and Blendy are in it. The story is just awesome, and so played. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about a road, it is a thin love story, so horrible that you see it right. The only good thing in this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I can give 2 out of 10. If it is not for music then it can be 0 out of 10. The meat rice is a terrible actor (at least he was in the 1980s), and the girl who plays the group does not look good too! This movie was a big disappointment for me, because it promises a lot of promise.
