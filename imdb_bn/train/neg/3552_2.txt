After I finally waited to see 20 wonderful years saw the Incompus and it is good to see, it certainly did not deserve to wait all this time. Incubus strictly horror film by numbers: Invisible killer / demon is raping and killing women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film goes like this: The movie opens with murder; Then blah blah blah; More blah blah blah; Then kill another; Even more blah blah blah; blah blah blah continued with; Yet another murder (wonderful, huh?); Bla Bla Bla, etc ... <br /> <br /> This image is completely expected from start to finish. The stupid "big" red-harness used throughout the film will not even be a 5-year old. And when I saw the character, I found the secret identity of Inqub at the moment, so when I was "wondering" the end of surprise, I would not be surprised or surprised. Actually, it was so funny that I watched the movie for a few days to be shiny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, this image is so large that the "rock band" is one of the few stand-out moments of this great flick. This is not a good scene scene because it is good but it is very funny and unnecessary because: The big screen-playing film shows a moment like rock video with a guy in red skin pants with a man wearing a fake long hair, all performed in a girl's scene, which is a movie theater In the washroom are being attacked by Incomas. What I can say about this movie is cinematography, which I actually liked. But apart from that, there is nothing remarkable about Incomas, except that it is ridiculously ridiculous.
