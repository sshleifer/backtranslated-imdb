"Seven mark" takes a lot of money from "Rosemary Baby" and "Owen" (it actually mixes two stories). Its title seems to be Bergman's "Seventh Seal". However, all the unconscious people spread throughout the world, and in parallel, tried to kill Murray's husband, trying to save a poor boy from death (who killed his parents, brother and sister). It is said to save both the Christian and Jewish religion (even the Bhanding Jews), which is sometimes funny funny (are you ever in school on Sunday? But they taught me that God loved!). The scene IMHO, a short conversation between Pastor John Hurd - which does not seem to be seriously, does not give him a more important part because the back acting is invaluable and young people. <br /> <Demi Moore has probably registered a similar wish to former husband Bruce Willis: To save the world. She does not live in movies for all that.
