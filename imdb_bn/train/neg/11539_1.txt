This is the biggest load of shit that I saw a long time ago. The last time I hated the movie, there was a lot of "28 days later" and "Magnolia" watching. Gillian Anderson frees herself from the street and there is no point in this movie, except for a sentence other than sick and hated sex / rape scenes, except for every sentence in the dialogue to use at least one "F". It's a few times It has played extremely cheap and has very low budget. My friend and I finally closed the movie about half an hour later. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud. Do not see it !!!
