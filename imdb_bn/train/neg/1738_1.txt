Douglas Fairbanks show absolutely no charisma here Caesar Romero has played a role as a real culprit and Bate Grable sang with a chorus- I would do that in Hungarian! <br /> <br /> <br /> This ridiculous plot deals with a photograph of a woman in a fortress save 1561 Rome that day by killing a winner. (Fairbanks) Now, let's go 300 years later, where Grible, just married with Count Romero, encounters the same situation when the Hungarian soldiers attack on their wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romeo works horribly and escapes before the arrival of the army. He disguised himself as a gypsy and played his violin when Fairbank was happy to stay in the castle. The last is worse than the last bad movie, when Garybell congratulates Fairbank for his good news - Romero has ruined the rage marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of the movie was made in 1948. Harry Davenport, it is an experienced supporter player who died in 1949; This must have been his last film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " See more of the dress that came out of the age of stones. I can not fathom wearing Fairbank.
