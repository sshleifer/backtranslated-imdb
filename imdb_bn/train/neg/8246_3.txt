Daddy's daughter Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West have received some horrific news in the local post office, they do not know that they were drowned by Charles Inesley of the thief. Meanwhile, father David Miles received a message (from young Robert Harron) who forced his father to leave the house; So, when young women come back, what can they be? At home alone. In the evening, the poor pair fell into bed, the local "Grand Ball of the Black and Tance" is in progress; And, a dark-skinned drinker. Griffith's dynamic pair ?? <br /> <br /> Inslee is one of her best life-round roles, "girls and dad" to steal film. Surprisingly, director Griffith appeared as one of the black face additions to the "Black and Tance" ball. "Biography Girl" Lawrence and West "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gies, especially "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); And, they are too tender in bed! The ethnic tune is unfortunate, because the story of the theft was stolen by saving a potentially harmed person from the big danger, it is a conspiracy therapist. <br /> <br /> *** girls and dad (2/1/09) d. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inesley
