I liked to give this movie a blank but it was not an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women can not work. I should know Bobby Brown when it was to suck. Someone in my house could not believe that I could not change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The concept of black women as a gunman in Western days is ridiculous. It's not just a nation thing, it's a gender. Two things are ridiculous to adjust. I'm sorry because some people in the film are not bad actors, but the film was terrible. It was not as credible as a movie. It may be 'recreational' for a particular group, but I am not in that group. Hah hah And use a great line from a great, great movie ... "I would say that."
