This movie is by the worst movie ever made. If you perform Lars in Heavyweight, then take a picture of a person who does not make this film. I would say that I could see leapretun in space in 6 minutes before I could see the movie's POS trailer. After this insult, Adam Sandler should be restricted from any film. It's a mix of cameras to watch this movie and willingly inserting your dick into a blender. Who does not consider this moment valuable to half of a brain cell? If I have an extra dollar and spend it, I would support the Lorraine Bobbitt Foundation before buying this movie.
