It seems to me, recently as a film school graduate, New Zealand has reached new heights at this time of the film, the general public thinks that every New Zealand film is best created. Sione's marriage proved this wrong mistake. <br /> <br /> It is completely overrated and not funny, and comments from other users IMDB away from 'Sunny' film. The only interesting thing available in this movie was the Derek de Winbe Black guy, but we were recycled by the jokes we heard earlier. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I'm a half-Samoan. Polynesian wanted to see how it would work with the representation. It was a complete ball-up - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I did not think anything new about Polynesian identity, even if it was in a tongue. I was disappointed with the ending of the film and the relationship between the characters' relationship - Miklie was a player who only wandered with white women, when 'Bocci Maiden' came to the city, there was some change in his brain. Maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then rejects it at the last moment and Palagi took her position as Polynesian Playboy for women. I did not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> Everyone felt very frustrating. My whole family went to look for a good smile, but it was really annoying to see the money in the movie. Jokes were the best lam, acting, especially the Seafar Girlfriend, Appleing, and I really enjoyed my hand in one of those perverted copies of the film to save myself for the $ 15 ticket price. <Br> <br /> I think the only good thing to come out of the movie is that it is the second step in Polynesian movies (second, of course, the one-sided film better than this). I hope you will not learn how the future of the Pacific filmmaker Polynesia and you can learn from Sien's wedding in the future that can be meaningful and intelligent. Even it is done in a ridiculous fashion.
