This series was possible, but I think the budget can not be seen. An interesting setup is not unlike "losing", it falls flat after the first episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, can create a compelling 90-minute film, but manufacturers prefer to drag it over. Most of the scenes were slow and lasting in front of the front. The music was very annoying and did not work as a whole. There were some letters that we cared because their characters did not grow during the period - well, one bit increased. The last series was terrible as the rest. Here, for the only Koodo Art Deep and set dressers, they have made an attractive appearance, the poor writer and the director lacked the foresight to make something interesting with the ingredients.
