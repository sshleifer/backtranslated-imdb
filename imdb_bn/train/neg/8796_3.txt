The average viewers who are looking for a feeling of internal harmony in a movie probably need to give it a pass. It creates a feeling that moves around a strange array of personal images that seems to be related to others, but never combined. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe, it is generally annoying and restrained to us who simply stop the hygiene. An excessive avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of an expression like Kara-Yang and Tarantino, but I have become warm by Andy Warhol. The only highlighted characteristic I have read in the values ​​of production, and there is not going to spend it on their own. <br /> <br /> This is one of the productions that you see and hear and anxiously awaiting and vain for some clever development of ideas or ideas to maintain all the extraordinary and beautiful separate scenes. Sorry Signed credits start unexpectedly as soon as your interest starts to stir. I've got the same big mess and guess what I'm guessing is a very intelligent and thorough comment about this movie that does not lead to a real understanding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
