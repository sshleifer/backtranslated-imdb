Do not make me wrong, I'm mostly fans of Woody films, probably the first of its 70's best artists (Annie Hall, Internal, Manhattan) and the first plays of the late / 90s of the 80's (Hanna, Crimes and Mademamians, Husband and Wife) I even liked some of his recent efforts (Melinda, something else, small crooks) but it was frustrating even though it was probably better than last year How wrong I was, however, can not be rap. <br /> <br /> It was sorted lazy - Originally match points, a cross between Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks came out with all the jokes - Woody seems like going outside as well as giving lines and 'sunny' catchphrases 'I mean all with due respect ...' until its blandness becomes all bare. <br /> <br /> I know that most actors are queuing to work with them but at least the script will be read at first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Woody will have to take a lot more behind the future of the camera, if He has a sense of 20 miles behind. <br /> <br /> If we do not have so much woody film then it will not be so tragic - compare it with - but it is clear that her best days are behind her and this trial is being judged by Woody as a joke to the industry Should call before one day. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
