I think there was a lost reason to get to "Times of the Times". Early premises (A competitor closes the winner's touchdown pass against the high school team, sometimes it can not be watched, and then again, two teams try to resume) I have never heard As Ron Shelton went to write a lot of good sports movies, I was surprised that there was more than that. I hope this picture is not as shaleton as it is written above, but the story does not shine green with pitching. <br /> <br /> We have this ground. From there you thought, or hoped, hope to have some twists along the way to keep something alive. There is no such luck. This script follows every expected clich√© you can think of. There is not a moment in this movie, before you publish the film, you will not come a mile away and it will end .... well if you can not end at the end of the first relay, you are here <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, do you think that Russell would once again object that he and Williams never forget that city? It is such a hair duck comedy that anyone with a lumpy duck script can think of how only their heads can smile. Of course there are some chocolates and to be honest, there is a real funny scene. Williams and Russell have marital problems and the wives invite them to do something for dinner. No one can understand that they were invited on Monday and yes, on Monday Night Football was going on. Keep in mind that the two teams have one win together to play, men (Williams especially) try to prevent the temptation of discovering how the game is going. Williams dissolves in some delightful bits of the scene to check the score using a bathroom visit as a silver. When he returned, he cures Russell's score. Later, Russell began to move on to his wife Williams, the television attracts their attention from television to another room. <br /> <br /> This is mostly obscure and inspired in silly movies and funny scenes.
