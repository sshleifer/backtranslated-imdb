Movie is awesome !!! In the past few years, I easily saw the worst movie. I'll say one of these movies for the next three years that this is the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for answering that burning question "What's the worst movie you've watched?" Answer: Celestine prediction. Trust me ... I have read the book, enjoyed the message and were excited to watch the movie, but then, they acted like ours to the audience, as we r * tarded There is no story and the story is very much confused by magic and coincidence. It is very bad to spell out their prophet's prophecies and not be able to wear them in a story of entertainment just following them. They did not spend any time in the development of the character and care was taken when the character died. This incredibly annoying movie was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck almost to the end. The book is very annoying but enjoyed parallels seen in daily life when I read books. The film does not give the same opportunity and I do not want to see if you want to continue to keep the book's words close to your heart. Do not watch this movie. Trust me
