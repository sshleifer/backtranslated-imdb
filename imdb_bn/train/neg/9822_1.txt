During the film, I died repeatedly. The only reason I could bear the fullness of the movie was because I could not believe how bad it was and it seemed that it would be better. This was really a horror film. I was so scared that I forgot what happened in my 4 hours of life that I would never return. The other two hours I spent mourning at the loss. Recommend this movie to whom you want to torture and tell them that they will kill them.
