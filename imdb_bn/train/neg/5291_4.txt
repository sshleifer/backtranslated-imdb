Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Roy (Ray Winston) has a criminal past, he has a problem with Alcohol is now making a drug habit, which makes him paranoid and his wife Valerie (Kathy Cheyke) gives domestic violence the tendency to try to combine the family but eventually more like the Dormat Trying to come. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of the son of Ray, Billy (Charlie Cride-Miles) and her growing drug habit, sending her from the railway. <br/> <br /> It is said that the British are enjoying being unhappy and that such films will be included in their entertainment. This highlight of movies like Muth by Blue. It is a story of a broken family, isolated by crime, poverty, torch and narcotics, such as Jeremy Kyle will lap up like a three-course meal. It is inevitably trying to unite a story of self destructive men, separate three generations apart and copy each other, separate family and women are strong enough, despite being strong enough. If you accept something from offset, you can see that it does not promise to watch from the beginning and it certainly does not get frustrated. <br /> <br /> What everyone said about the performance, and the main star, Winston and Burke, gave some wonderful acting. We lost Winston to his wife, with some other coke provoked paranoia, after her deafness broke, during a phone conversation with her and when she did not let her see the baby, she released a general operation of the words F and C. Likewise, in a private moment, we see that its compositions on the stairs with the ability to lose skillfully, have a serious impact on the night. <br /> <br /> This is another movie where there is no plot to follow, for example, the real life feeling of these hopeless lives from day to day. It has been praised by many (including Baftas!) But it was really very serious and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize for this, I knew what set about it from set-off, but sadly how I found it. **
