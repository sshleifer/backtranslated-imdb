This poor repetition of classic 1963 classic starts well, then replacing the mystery with muddled and unmatched special effects. For example, one of the coolest moments is, for example, when Nell and Theo are standing next to each other in beds, terrorists are crying out of their homes. Neil asked Theo to leave his hand because he was hurt by her. Then Nel saw Theo, who was a few feet away, and realized that Theo did not hold his hand. In the latest version, the nail is lying alone in bed, suddenly he slides across the floor and slides it. Whenever he tells the invisible power that he will be dragged, we can understand what happened. Can anyone mean the meaning of Nell's final word - "It's about family, it's always for the family". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones again showed that there is a little depth below her beautiful outer surface. Basically, Claire Bloom cautions her gay prompting. JETO-JONES must spell it out, for example, if he has a boyfriend or girlfriend, then he asks the nail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / >
