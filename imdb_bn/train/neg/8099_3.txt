It was definitely a great book and the possibilities of a truly great movie were there. But the casting decision completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a great actor to confirm, but there is a lack of memorabilia, moral contradictory features needed for a limited role. Jeff Daniels might be my favorite. <br /> <br /> Menny Griffiths is understandable because of eye eyesight, but again, she does not represent depth or conflict, so it must be stopped. <Br> <br /> This is a great example of how the film can create or break a file at the beginning of every decision, even the beginning of the film production.
