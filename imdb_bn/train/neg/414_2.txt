You are going to this movie, you know that the film has six lab technicians, which is in a sealed lab with a invisible submissive. So you're directly guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors are just the way you want them to expect, so there is no point for the plot. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure that it takes place in a lab with a B-movie or an engaging story of a movie, William Devane plays a part in: B-movie status immediately. <br /> <br /> The movie at the beginning is committed. In the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla which is becoming increasingly violent. Oh, foreboding. The best part of the whole movie is when the lab team again makes Gorilla visible. Great special effects <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a thriller There was no surprise, when Shui created like a freezer like McGuivar, which is 'Wah'? All right, there's a surprise. At that time, Cain (Bacon) returned to the lift in the last shafts. It's a wonderful event just because you're screaming on TV, 'Noooo! You are already dead! Movie is over! Shouting on TV, all I've done for the last 25 minutes is everything. 'Keep your F # @% goggles!' Instead of their infrared goggles so that they can see him, they try every other joke of the book (fire extinguisher, drilling system ...). <br /> <br /> The story is about to end. But special effects were good; The only reason I give it a 2/10
