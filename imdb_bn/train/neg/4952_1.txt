All right, I'm always a fan of Batman. I like the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I even read a Batman comic now and then So imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was frustrated. There is nothing in this series. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long toy commercial. No depth. And what the hacker had with the hack? Who, my most modest opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time and they killed him. I could say the worst part of his design. Actually, I hope I can say something about this series that was remote or creative. In short (because I believe I can say a lot more) Do not waste your time on this show, or your money.
