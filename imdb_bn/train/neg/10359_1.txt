Book series "Stylus" My favorite series from childhood. In the last 35+ years, I can read and re-read more than I can count. Characters, with all their attributes and errors, and near my heart. This adaptation includes wonderful, magical, spiritual stories very little that I love so much. Not saying that I was frustrated with this photo. It will be a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> If you do not read the book, imagine you will enjoy the movie. Activated passable, special effects have been made for TV movie, and the story is interesting However, if you like books, then this movie will have to avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, Lou'engel said of the film, 'I hope it's bad, and it's.' <br /> <br /> I like another critic here, I need to read the book again to remove this movie from my mind.
