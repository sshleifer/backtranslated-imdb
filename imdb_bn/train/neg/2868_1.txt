It actually insults the victims of BT assassins and their families. The facts of this movie are not close to the truth. Can not make a movie of real events, because there is no knowledge after real events become more interesting, after which it is created. Do not waste your time watching this for free. The low budget and the show's embarrassing screenplay that nothing should be made, which is actually what this movie is about. If they give me 10 in this movie then I want to. Acting sucked and it seems to have shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by watching this movie.
