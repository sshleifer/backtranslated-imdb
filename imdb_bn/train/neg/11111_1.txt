Do not bother to waste your money in this movie. You do not even go to your car and if you do not appeal to anyone else you can see this movie. You will see a movie this weekend, see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was awesome. Written from a totally random horror movie format. Given: One place in limited places, crazy people with different weapons, is a weird person who directs honest police officers to unify all the sources that can be united and innocent and very enthusiastic, yet beautiful and powerful women, many of whom call their girlfriend Be able to be able to. Mix together, add a lot of execution, and some keys to "spin" a little bit. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, and the characters were incredible - <br /> <br /> *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** Can you tell me how a Butcher shot the bathroom and shot him and shot him? ??? I'm in the army. We need these things for us. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I'll put it in the round decimal to give its lowest possible score.
