What a let down! This starts with a mysterious mystery and interesting characters. In the confession it was removed at the speed of a snake, but I rushed and saw. <br /> <br /> David Morris is always well-valued and he leads well with Surrey Jones. The Muslim direction was very interesting. We were tantalised with potential terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then Morris's character was killed and all the air balloons left. The last part was dusty, lazy, dust. The whole thing was too small beer and the denounment was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for him? My suggestion: instead see the paint dry.
