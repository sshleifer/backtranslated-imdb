I have never seen the original version of 1954 with Julie Garland, so there is no way to compare. Also, it has been a few years, but I found this story not to leap or captivating her romance. The film tells the story of two lovers, whose musical career is directed towards the opposite. John Norman Howard is frustrated, the lost rock star, based on a new, gifted new singing sensation, romance with Easter Hoffmann. His dramatic success only emphasized his fall. <br /> <br /> Main actor, Chris Christopherson and Barbara Streisand are adequate in their role, but their chemistry or dramas left most of the signs with me. The beautiful presentation of the Oscar winner song 'Ever Greene''s Strease is only remarkable to me for one side. She really has a strong and magnificent voice.
