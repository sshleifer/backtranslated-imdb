I saw this movie last night and there was someone hoping to get very few hopes, still frustrated. The biggest mistake of this horrifying film is that the main plot point (the person is awake during the surgery), there is nothing to do with the result. It will end in the same way regardless of. So, what was this point? Who knows Also, there were four illegal cases against this surgeon and he did not think that a patient would ask questions when he died on his table. Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely shameless and almost as bad as Christians. The whole thing was just ridiculous from the beginning. I'm pretty sure that if someone can feel your cut in your chest with your skeleton, you'll get more pain.
