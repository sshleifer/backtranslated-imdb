Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It is the cream of the crop, or **** if you get more worried, because it goes (or below) with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flintstone: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it may even be worse than the two, because at least at least they ridicule me with their stupidity. This just continuous pain made me cringe and start rolling when the pores rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out why this film is so incredibly oppressive. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It spins around a chip of a remote control car (?!) Which is crazy and how these terrorists want it. Fool stuff <br /> <br /> The work that has taken place like the other two home aliens, the bubytrareps and the same with everyone, but these bubbles are being executed without being funny, incredibly unexpected. I did not smile once (or even as the sunny), rather, I continually cringed and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. Instead of providing comic relief, the bird was irrational and annoying. <br /> <br /> acting, such as by a bunch of names, from poor to oppressed. There is no better performance here. Alex D. Unlike Linz absolutely and strange as the kid, the terrorists work (and look, look through their movie credits) as they have been quickly sorted off the street ... and well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I'm saying to some people: "People, it's for kids. It's not a man." Good people, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc and Toy Story before even considering getting this. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suits - see those reviews for more) is better than this! <br /> <br /> So in short, it's an unexpected shocking movie. It was clearly recycled for money, because it almost completely closes the first two; The only thing, it's completely humiliating as well as the first two. No man, infant or otherwise, should find no reason to see alone 3. Never It's bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
