Probably being a former MoscowVeet and humorous feeling, I prevented me from dragging this movie from the 'EarthSaus / Festival CrÃªp' trashcan. This is not the greatest movie of 2005, it is not a complete trash. It just has a lot of problems. I sincerely suspect that this movie was banned because of any 'ideological fear' or 'conservative tabos' or the other side of the movie, in contrast to being called 'brave' and 'incompatible' abroad. It was banned because the sensor knew that 99% of Russian filmmakers thought that it was invasive because of bad behavior while shooting and editing of this unnecessary movie by the Russian people. <br /> <br /> So we have a powerful opening shot. Wonderful sound design, nice compound - laden with meaning and symbolism. The use of symbols and positioning consistently bears the strongest aspects of the film (this is not a difficult visible number 4). In the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup. 3 (main?) Is a fun and well-written dialogue between characters, and we feel the way for these people, Russia's great country, human condition and its way. Then the movie starts at a slow pace. We start thinking that Yuyun is ahead. <br /> <br /> The rest is quite annoying, easy to keep. Sure, the village guy tigers the hartstrings, and has some fun moments. Excellent words, sure. But enjoying this movie, not mentioning the plot, was seriously compromised by pacing problems. And this, all (nicely shot) uncomfortable pain and lack of arrogance to sit in the dark, people will be angry with the 'offensive' stuff (personally, limited to being respected in the main objectionable scene). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soviet staff is more fruitful than that. So yes, 4 to 4 of my, my post-media-film In excellent condition and symbolic.
