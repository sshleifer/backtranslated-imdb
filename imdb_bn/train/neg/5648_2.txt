Boston has turned its trail legal and burner doors and whales have led it for the fall of pigs! This show was prevalent almost four seasons ago, it was a ridiculous impression in the legal system that all actors feel proud of filming. It was fun, diverse, and practical in some quantities. Illustrative characters are acceptable and a level between their illustration is real. Sex comment and activity were limited and ridiculous. Julie Boven was beautiful as she and other series, but she dragged in the lower depth of the media programming of gender and violence. Julie is a wonderful actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Ryan Edzardubius is an outstanding actor who plays his own role in recreation, from "Benson" to the generation of this generation, always showcasing productions and respectful performances for entertainment. Captain Kirk "is" Funny and humorous Candace Bergan and praised for its continuity in this product and a good actress. James Sparrow, there is no doubt of his acting ability, but he will have to return to his XXX sources as "crashes", as if he has many aspects and looks at him. We already trash this series and it really starts to smell !!!
