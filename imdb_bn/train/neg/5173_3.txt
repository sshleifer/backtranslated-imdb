I saw it really good and original when I saw this at a store. Like the Wolfs Creek, Texas is involved in the Censor genocide, and I mean it costs only three (about $ 6). I do not think it's too valuable to be honest. <br /> <br /> It seemed like the managers - 'Butcher b brothers' are awful or horrible of the girl slashher horror. This is a clutch-riding gerry that ends up with a dimensional with sadistic hours and fifteen minutes and you do not care less of what happened to them but for the audience try to care about the characters, they end up trying to add a vain monologue and at the beginning of the film it needs to be perfectly honest Was not there. <br /> <br /> The only good part was really middle / end - I will not destroy it for you. But that was only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Overall, an unmatched clock. It felt like a two-hour film but was actually only 75 minutes. If you want an arts movie-do not bother If you want a slash movie - do not bother - the movie is not running so slowly that is never happening.
