There is no reason to watch this movie. The idea of ​​a good conspiracy is very poorly operated. The middle of the film changes everything and nothing can be understood from here. The cause of the murder is not clear. Acting horror Nick Stahl probably needed a better manager. He was nice in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amy Benson from Buffy, has her character changed someday. Even you will be disappointed to enjoy those gratuitous sex and violence. Although the film was about 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for it), there is no deleted scene in the DVD, which means that it never gets annoyed to fill lost parts in letters. <Br> <br /> Do not spend time at this time.
