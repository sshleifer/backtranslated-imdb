It was recently in AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. Following the vein of "Voice to the Earth Core" and "Mysterious Island", I had high hopes for this adventure. I was disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the lazy story line that read from the five-year-old comic book. When they "half" the intelligent pre-modern people who make friends with the lost adventurers, make sure they will see the stars on the pottadactil bird. For the last time it is open to repeat the same effect "the time the people have forgotten". Do not waste your time.
