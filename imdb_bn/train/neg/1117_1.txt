I do not know exactly what the movie is about. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is dark without one second per day. For long, there are all kinds of insects disrupted shots. What little conversations in the movie are as crazy and non-monster as images. A black female enters the main character's apartment. Since she became pregnant overnight, then she got a head shot. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white nude woman appears. I did not run away so much about how bad the movie could be and the pointless. Verily, I want to see someone, so that they can tell me what they can say about it. But I do not want this level hell on anyone else.
