The hit blockbuster's "cheap by the conquest" comes with a strange dialogue, shallow plot line, and irrational amount of delicious return to the ABC family's efforts. Many people want to have two good actors, many of which were frustrating. It's a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already evil plot. Then, because they needed many actors, which meant that they would have been more resilient. So acting was not a five-star. The plot moved fairly quickly, and twists were bad and there was horrible time. Character connections and "last relationship" were very pagan and cliche for me. Good yourself and hire some good.
