I'm not taking too much time here, just wanted to be the Darkman 3 horrible. I have all 3 of the DVDs, DVD movie sets have been added to this collection. Darkman up there with the best, Indiana Jones, Alien, Star Wars, Die Hard, get you points There are many good horror, there is no thriller, set out. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set to give our Darkman Trilogy. The way you wondered how I came across this one DVD. I bought it through the Internet, but it's 4 regions, since you know that most of the US DVD players are 1 field. If you have a Sony PlayStation 2, then you have the best DVD player because it is an all-region player. Just go to set up then you choose the zip zone setting you want (1-9).
