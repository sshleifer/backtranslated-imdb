I do not want to call this movie in any movie - it's a movie that can not win any awards. The acting was as terrifying as the stupid circumstances were. It is just such a movie that many people think of an NRI bring to the audience, but it really hates foreigners for its curiosity and unexpected money to "try" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I think it is weird that there are so many hard times in front of many actors' cameras that speak English with the English language. I am sure many readers know what I am saying - in Hindi and on the cold points, all these token English phrases in regional movies are thrown in the movie. There are some Indian films where English seems completely genuine - Cyrus is the latest one. Although not a great movie, it does not seem to be a good film and "fancy" language. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed that in 2003 P3 was given NFA. The only semi-beneficial part of the trash was the Konkana and some interesting background score. Also, do not waste your time with this movie.
