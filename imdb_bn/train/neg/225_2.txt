SPEAKER: Young lover Jade, kicked by Spencer Kate (Andy McDowell) because he mistakenly believes that Z is in a relationship with two of his cathy friends. Kate thought she'd catch Delixo in her flat. Kate jade threw out the shoes door. Z to reluctantly leave, and then sit in the middle of the road to make his shoes. Then he gets run by a truck ("crushed", meaning the title). And died <br /> <br /> "And then he gets run by a truck." Can you imagine a photographer trying to submit a script with this plot element? Then, it's a comedy which wants to be fierce, but lacks any real fizz. But Z is not everyone but annoying. And then they kill Jedda and everybody is sad, until the cheeks can learn to love each other and can be helpful instead of being destructive. I give it 2 ugh.
