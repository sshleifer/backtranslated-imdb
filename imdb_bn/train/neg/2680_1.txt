Brockdown Palace is not a movie that I want to see. I did not like the movie while accusing some Australian drug addicts and drug smuggling Claire Danes and Kate Binsell in Thailand. I will not go to any country where I will not go to this movie. Actually stinks this movie. I like to go to Germany to meet the beautiful single girl. Germany I tolerate the country. I would rather stick to the United States instead. After watching some movies in the theater with false accusations of drug smuggling, I left the theater and my money was sent back because I could not bear the film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone who might be a drug smuggler, but forget it!
