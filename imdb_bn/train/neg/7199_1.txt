Why? !! It was an inspired, stupid and embarrassing film. They came from the frustrating town where they ... Pittsburgh PA! Why do they let this guy make such a BAAAAAD movie? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was a romantic comedy ... and there was no Robi-nothing. Disney which changed with the courtesy of the courtesy. Why ???? They have made a terrible explanation of this classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broaderick, his own movie is not fun to have fun. Sheesh !!
