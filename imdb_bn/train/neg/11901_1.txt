"Land of Plant" is not a movie. It is a grave stone for the career of German director W. Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many people think that "million dollar hotel" and now "lots of land" makes it completely clean; Vendors did not lose it, he has actually become a BAD director, created rare rare and sponsored stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> Someone might say that "the time you lose" comes for every director, but the Wenders' case is extreme. It seems that he knew everything about the movie completely forgotten and started again - just getting drunk results. <br /> <br /> In some languages, this movie is not worth your time.
