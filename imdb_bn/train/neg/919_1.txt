Although I acknowledge that I'm more fascinated than the last few comedy movies. <br /> <br /> The budget has to change pockets from actors. The production quality is so low that they actually make it fun to watch. A Guerrilla suit made by a man with a cardboard diving helmet reminding me of a Robert Monster <br /> <br /> In one scene a helpless victim gets their hands and leg cut. Geez, hard to believe but the Holy Night of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I am surprised, "no one will pass," does not start screaming and "it is only a scourge of flesh, I have become worse". Last year I saw that this is the most interesting scene. <br /> <br /> "Gladiator / monster" was a stitch. The last result was violent in a fairly inexpensive dress and the guy's gaiety. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that is bad enough to see. How to see a slow automatic accident in the picture <br /> <br />
