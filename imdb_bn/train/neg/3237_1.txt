I do not embrace myself in the eyes of realistic blood sheds, but when I hope to bleed, keep a DVD, and what I get is a bloody scene (eyeball) at the end of the trapping trapping trapping, and a shabby desk chair, I ended up thinking "Well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever." I would not consider this as much or an exercise of flush and blood "cinema" flowers; See if you can sit through them. There were some hard spots to see the flush and blood flow. The devil was not tested. It was good, stupid, and worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too much. I thought the DVD "Oh man, this should be sick." Thousands of times I was looking forward to seeing the girl as a girl. <br /> <br /> Two types of people are interested in this movie. 1) How Faid is really to see who is interested in fashing this movie, or 2) Awesome full. I want this and other guinea pigs for the next reason, but if I fall into the previous section then this movie will not float my boat. Actually, I can imagine this picture to increase blood ... like "you must kill B * TCHH !!" So in conclusion, the only reason for the film being the owner is to collect If you want killings that do not realize traditional horror, get traces of death. Sure, that suck too, but at least you will get the blood and you will guts hopefully. <br /> <br /> For anyone who appreciates this whip I can only see because they seem to think. There is no artistic merit that I can understand, there is no reason for its infamous, nothing. Just be a lame attempt to threaten.
