This is probably the worst excuse for television programming, oh, I do not know, what's going on now? This ridiculous "series" has happened. Although it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin, there is no good story in your personal life. It's mostly fooling, jockey is working like a small talk and white trash. Look, I love Britney's music as the next child, but this event is only pure filers for the nation who are addicted to Britain that they can see their clips of their clips (yes, it can be a genuine episode). Thank God God broke these two, because they were dust together. This show is toxic!
