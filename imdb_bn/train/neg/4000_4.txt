I enjoyed "American Movie", so I hired Chris Smith's first movie, which I thought was a documentary too. In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I gave it a go. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No dead end movie. If you are just going to check fatigue, true-life-life is rarely served. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it will come with any relevance 1) Many people suck lots of jobs and 2) Most of them are painful, minimum wage service jobs ... I knew I saw the picture beforehand. While it is struggling to feel truly "real" (handheld camera, any music etc.), the real "real world" happening is rarely happening. <br /> <br /> An employer Randie will be so impressive when she withdraws her check, after Randi leaves her after 3 days, the person told her that she would have to stay 6 months? Or after leaving his job (and after breaking the machine he was working), would everyone be so easy on him? <br /> <br /> <br /> One big problem is our hero (?), Randy. This guy is a damaged. Because he's not trapped in these jobs, or there's a terrible apartment, or looks like one. She is a dope. He does not pay attention or even try at this job. He has zero personality. I wanted to hire someone, I could not finish the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith is looking for, but guys, "This-e-non-important film" staff. "American Jobs" does not work.
