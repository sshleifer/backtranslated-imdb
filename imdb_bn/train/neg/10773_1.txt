I just saw this awesome thing on TV. Not saying that this is a movie that you just see how bad it can be. Frankly, I do not know how much the bar can go. <br /> <br /> Characters are made up of others with a crippled stereo-type, and the obvious effort to create another "bad news beer" is rarely embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I I have seen some valuable turkey during my time, but there is no reason to list them with this "Numero Yunu". <br /> <br /> I'll bring you this way, I saw the Vanilla Ice film because it was too bad it was fun. This ... is not good either.
