There is a reason that Jenny Leno himself would not accept this picture. It is consistently one of the worst films of all time. The acting is horrible, this script lacks the direction and the director himself is not sure about accepting the film. "A friend film," "an action / comedy," "mystery." It seems half way through, he gives up, and just for the ride together. Jane Lenny and Pat Murita are talented and dedicated actors. It was a shame that they were wasteted making their time and gifts to make this mess of a movie. J Leno and Pat Murita spent many years in their crafts on Hollywood circuits before engaging themselves with this. Mr Murita was already a star on the right, in the mid-1960s, this kind of TV and movie "Happy Day" as the classic star and weak but rich but Mr. T and Tina starred as star. And conquered America's heart on its role in powerful films "Midway", "The Karate Kid", and others. Mr. Leno TV shows were seen in the mid-70s. And was the top actor in American comedy clubs. He can be seen in countless TV stains and major movies. It's a shame, they agree to meet with this messy.
