I have seen this movie on television a long time ago. I think the film's background is being comfortable in many hotels affected by human beers. I did not think how much it was !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught the picture late on television in the night. I'm sure it should be a mistake because such movies usually disappear from existence and are not available again! Leo is playing the weekend of Suzanne Somers ('The Three' Company's Cristy playing her career). A swimming pool was installed outside the construction workers and eventually an ants lodged bother. Or I want to say, a * man's 'Aunt' entrusted * !! One of the workers actually attacked the ants. One minute he picked his clothes together in one of them, the next minute he was covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought that it was quite remote, you would see Mirna Laik play a wheelchair-bound resident outside the man with helicopter! <br/> <br /> The final scenes can illustrate his thinking on relief by Susan, Robert Foxworth and the third person sitting on the floor of the hotel room next to their back! Each other, covered with straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically the movie. There is no "disaster" appeal or a "big star" draw in the movie. It was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it's dumped at 4:00 pm in your local television station. <br /> <br /> If you want to get the best of Sujon Som√°r, then you can see an episode of 3's company. Check out this movie if you want to make bread on Mirna Lloyd Table and do something to pay your bills. <br /> <br /> 0/10
