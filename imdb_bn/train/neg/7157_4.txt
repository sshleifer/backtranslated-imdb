First seen 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange Story about a Drew Witch who tries to capture eternity by the heir of his dance. At least I think that was the relationship. One of the cruel qualities of Stephen King that is not contrary to The Shining is held. The difference was the performance of Nicholson's performance, which is not everything in this film. In the end, it is taken very seriously when attempts to express some litter-one fishing and mood do not work at all. Performance is not the problem here, but the story is about. Everything does not seem very easy to come together and the viewer's information has been left in plenty and there is no real understanding of what happened in the film. Christopher Walken's paternal grandmother's cousin has a very small touch, of course, she offers top-bills in the effort to sell the film. Do not buy this hostage and do not avoid this film. <br /> <br />
