Uma Thurman plays a young man with a zombie soul (and weirdly big toe), who has hatched the cross-country, finally found a true place in a group of peet-lit Cowgirls on a bird dedicated to preserving the Hoarding Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix falls in love with their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus was driven by Van Sant and adapted the book of Tom Robins, but his mockery was not the primary goal and the same as Cecilia (his goal was, but it was not for the audience), only the entire map was a sketch. The infamous box-office flop is not ignored so much that it was ignored, and one can see why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot and performance, directory touch and all the variations in cinematography. Tharman is trying to move a road to a sewing along the highway, but this pretty much made Kibosh in Phoenix's career. Writer Banc Hennery (who did not write it, but perhaps it should also) gave the most assured performance as a doctor working on one of those organs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
