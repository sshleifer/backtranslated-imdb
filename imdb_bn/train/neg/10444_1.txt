The great thing about cinema is its title only. In this case, the title is not telling the movie about the movie, "Slay on a Plane", as the example of not judging the cover by its cover. When I went to the theater, I was not expecting a citizen, I had the hope of the Independence Day, a movie that was pure popcorn fun, but instead, I called that horrible verdict Liota film as "obscurity", so how bad SAPP! . The only thing is that SOAP makes its title well. And not even the epic title for the film, the film did not have even a 40-minute view of "Snake" or "Flat"! What false advertising! If this is not for title, then SOAP will be another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie. RR rating? This will be the most unpublished and rating movie of all time! Movie makers only add a few words to create it, all violence is kept at pg-13 level. Do you really know R Rate? Rating Superstar Edge Rate! Instead of spoiling a snake in Samaresam, see him instead!
