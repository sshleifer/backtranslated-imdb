In spite of a continuation of a more powerful root, Friday 13th Friday, a psychiatric remake of Psychopathic Angela, with more concern, kills more casualties for their "immorality" in the camp. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. Some pretty braces have some beautiful braces sex scenes with attractive girls, but the movie is so odd (suspicious), rather it's a shit. It's <br /> <br /> * **** <br/> <br /> MPAA: Rated R. for graphic violence and pregnancy, nudity, and some sex, language and drug use.
