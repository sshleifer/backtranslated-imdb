Jerry Spooks retains the opportunity to listen to a wonderful story on Tom and fear his generosity. <br /> <br /> I did not think this special episode was funny: Humor was rather limited and Dada Lama (Jerry is basically a 'bad guy', hurts poor Tom for any particular reason). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " J's other cartoons do not have intimate intelligence.
