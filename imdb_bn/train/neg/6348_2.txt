Unrestrained stimulus is meaningless. In Alan's previous film, the object can not reduce the dust, dust, dust, and most of the imagination. And Immediately Will Will Ferrell hear me imitating his Woody Allen makes me second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even hates. It seems like 70-year-old Allen should stop working while clock clippings in the new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to get involved in the film, but it was impossible; My snyapses could not fire that slowly So, I wanted to sleep in sleep and sleep in the right place lying in the afternoon, I left my wife and daughter in the theater and went to my car where there was really good book for reading my books (George Bailey's wonderful Tom 30 years ago, "Germans.") The day is very good, thank you to Woody.
