I hate this movie. This is absolutely horrible, poor, poor, neutral acting, real real stupid stupid criminal who was not even fun at the lowest bit (the first two home-alone movies which were not very good). All the Boobie trap is weak, the unfortunate excuse for imagining the first two copies for ideas is that people who just write this money were just lazy because their paycheck does not go up to 20 bucks a week. This movie is absolutely weird, it is not even worth the rent. Actually do not see this TV! Use your eyes to see the first two more effective ways! I certainly give this 1 star (10 out). When I say, believe me if you like the first two, and you are not completely stupid person, you do not like this movie, do not see this movie !!!
