(A potential spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the most famous movie theater released. Nothing understands, there is some plot about a girl who has a strange attitude that may not die. The whole movie is just a bunch of random shots that do not really tie together, at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting does not exist, the camera work is shocking and the script is so confusing, it only makes the movie more difficult. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to put together a movie tie but nothing came. Of course the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
