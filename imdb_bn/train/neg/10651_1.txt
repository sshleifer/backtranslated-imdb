Want to know a slasher film set secret working set in a fitness center? Just pad out the film with super-tight workout outfits lovely ladies and they have a whing and floor grind like they are at a lady's club. The makers of this horror slash film did this work, and that little hostage kept me bitter to the end. This is the worst slashher film I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to make the channel switch, they'd add another scene with workout girls and I would have kept it. As a slash film, Killer Workout fails in every section I can think of. As a showcase for working beautiful girls, it is a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, unless half the movie is a big one and the show will not appeal to you.
