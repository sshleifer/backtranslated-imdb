Have fun that you have fun !!! <br /> <br /> But anyway I got this picture and 3 people and they were all in DVD. The movie started a good okey movie but it flies from the middle end. <br /> <br /> And to the end, just say it's the most climax of recent movie history. A lot of the last paragraph and if you like a dose of scalp horror, it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> 3/10
