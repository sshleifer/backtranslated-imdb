As much as I hate to say 'me too' as a response to other comments - it is absolutely true that there is nothing to do with the continuous disaster that includes 90 of the first 30 minutes of this movie. <br /> <br /> Banning somewhere is not a watchable film. It's not like a Hollywood product because it's not reliable. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad, yet cleansed plot (except for many dirty places in Russia and many people, even the old woman, get plenty of vodka), many vigues are so unnecessarily annoying, I am in my second package of Rolides. <br /> <br /> - Well, the movie is full of any descriptive threads <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
