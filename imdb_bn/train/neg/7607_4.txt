- When the local Sheriff is killed, his wife is determined to clean up the city until the city is cleaned up and clean. Although not everyone in the city, he is happy with what he is doing. Sheriff city town has a curfew order, owner of local salon (also a female) to take care of Sheriff a killer hire. There is no way that Shallif can fall in the love of the lover and boyfriend. <br /> <br /> - An example of gunsing that you have a fairly fun idea and combines with poor execution. There is a good movie trying out here. In a more efficient arm or big budget, glossing may be an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. For example, a drunken mess of a movie of gunsing. <br /> <br /> - Many movies are wrong with: There is no acting capacity, no acting power, uninterrupted and unusual dialogue, and set it as set. But the biggest culprit is editing. I was surprised to start a scene with the actors (and the horse for that matter) was definitely waiting for Corman's "action" to scream. Two riders scene on the horse standing next to the best one building. Suddenly, they roamed hard for several miles and ran around the corner. Or, for example, people who might transport across the city. We see a man entering a building and later on to see his horse mounted across the city. <br /> <br /> - It does not seem that there was some decent actor to work with Carmen. There was no big star, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were able to make everyone a better performer. But, in Songsing, there is not much to offer to them. <br /> <br /> - I have now seen both the movies version of MSST 3K and non-MST3. I would strongly recommend going to MST3K route.
