The first episode of this new show was today, and it was awesome. Shaggy was not only a sticky new voice that he heard about his line of torture, but it was far from the main idea and animation style, which is very rarely known as the 'Scooby-Doo' show. <br /> <br /> Fred and Velma also went away in the dark days and the school had nephew scrappy, the group still solved the mystery. This new show features a fight instead of Shaggy and Scottby James Bond's type Super Villene and his hechchmen live in a palace. There is not a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the next phase teaser that did not promise the Transformer type robot car to keep my mind easily). Can anyone take the Scooby Doo and do this? <br /> <br /> The show earned two points for two scenes featuring the Scube du gang, all of which talk to the correct voice without a chagrin and even I am very generous.
