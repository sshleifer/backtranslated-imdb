I was really scared by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a vague musical score. Really committed! Actually, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feel uncomfortable, because you are afraid of the worst fears. This movie has a real nightmare and everything is worse than it is. For half an hour I am trying to fall asleep and fall asleep with complete frustration, but the giant soundtrack awakens me. Net Noua is one of the most horrific images of your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and most of all: The worst fears are being seen from the thought of spending valuable money for movie tickets for your cheap, expensive amateur homemade video.
