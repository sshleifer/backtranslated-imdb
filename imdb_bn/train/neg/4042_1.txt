This picture is beautiful to watch, but really bad to see like the experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) has no idea. But it is very "artistic". Half of the half-clad actors are romantically looking for lots of romance and looking deep into each other's eyes. Lots of arty shots with people outside windows and frames. The dead and the people are wistfully terrible. Face up close to the face and body. When you get the troll on the cottage of the cat, you will be ready to throw a bottle of skin on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be about a father and son relationship, but you just wish them both * $ * and get it with each other. If you always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shot, have given your wish.
