The end of Wesemulla's Tarzan films is rather weak. <br /> <br /> First, spend most of the movie on Tarzan Floppy Sandals. In my opinion, Tarzan any shoes, sometimes portrayed or played as a shoe, takes away from the character, which is considered civilization as civilization and prone jungle. Second, the character Benzie mentioned in the previous post, completely summons the film as a comic fiddle. To me, his character is unnecessary for the film's plot. <br /> <br /> Also, the Wassomeran still spends a commanding image like Tarzan, but it was not in its best shape. In his next jungle gym movies, this picture of his body has improved slightly. <br /> <br /> The Octopus war is a terrific idea, but I think it should have been in the film of the former Wasomeran when he was his physical peak. Likewise, it takes only 30 seconds of the war, if Tajzan and his companion are pulled from 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic monster crocodile war, it will be more exciting. <br /> <br /> Brenda Josse, as Jane and Linda Christian as Jane, is very enjoying in the eyes, it does not manage to retrieve the last Weissular movie - a disappointing end to a great character.
