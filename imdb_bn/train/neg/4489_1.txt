'The Matrix' is a breathtaking summer blockbuster that was spectacular, but sharply 'twillight zone' - excited in the heat-system. The general rule applies here- and this sigail does not match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it does not even compare with it. <br /> <br /> 'Reloaded' exploded on the front of the screen in most non-professional fashion. The first impression in the first few seconds is usually a good dream as the Trinity is shot in a dream. Shortly after, film nose-dive After the first 45-minute disaster, they entered the Matrix and the Agent Smith war increased gradually and gradually increased. It decreases when reaching the 14-minute car chase sequence and eventually becomes worse in big forks. The worst 'Zion Rave' scene is overlong. This is nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a gracious excuse for indecent and boring dance music. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The first one was the intriguing plot, but here it is very linear to be remotely interesting. The film is basically a series of stylish diversions that are just about empty to us. It works on the big principles that are wrong. It seems that the 'Matrix' franchise has rapidly impacted special effects that have other franchises like 'Star Wars' Saga. <br /> <br /> The acting value is mostly poor. Of course the best character goes to Hugo Weaving's 'Agent Smith' - only to be a little interesting. Keanu Reeves Neo Neo is sure, but among all the special effects, there is little room for many effects. Academy Award nominee Lawrence Fishburn reduces a neutral consultant with poor dialogue. Carry Anne Moss as a worker cooks may be doing a lot better than any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor, thrown together movie, 'Matrix Reloaded' is frustrating. Those who did not like the first, could not surround it. This is only for dead-hard fans. Even the special effects of the film's own sub-genre Bananas (minority reports, The Matrix etc.) are still poor. My IMDB rating: 4.5 / 10
