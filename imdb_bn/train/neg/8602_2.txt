You must know about this movie that at the beginning, after the scene, where a guy falls into a lake and is eaten. Then they start rolling title credits: "Slugs!" See, in large letters, then soon followed by "The Movie". Light I was worried that I was wrongly shown in "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slogs: The Game Show". However, from there the movie deteriorated into a fatal-festival. You cut a man out of his hand because he slogans in his garden glove, two people were attacked by slogans during sexual harassment, and a girl fell behind him on the underground pathway, the murderer died by slug. This is a very stupid movie, which falls in the "Bad-It-Good" section. It was shot very poorly with poor movies that you taught to make it in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am very surprised that I have received this as the majority of scores here, because most of the people here do not love this type of movie. But if you want a movie that wants to be scary, it will become ridiculous but it's one of your main candidates.
