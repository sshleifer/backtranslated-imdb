"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; This is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible for American film-makers and critics to be so inferior and lubotomized that Hollywood fades that they will only praise the medieval film sky with no laugh? Why can I think this is the only romantic comedy (and I rarely use this word because there is nothing funny about this movie) got good reviews. <br /> <br /> I am sitting in this photo, Locale Lowell Ganz and Babel Mandel even immediately thought their script was fun. <br /> <br /> Brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into movies. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for the British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth James in 1997; Peter Hedesses received the voice of Horni for "Harby a Boy" (2002), and in 2000, when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for the film, then author D. V.V. Devinensis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they had the importance of Hornby's sense and humor. They made one of the best films of that year. <br /> <br /> Why is the American version of "fever pitch" so painful? The British version was not an excellent work, but it was charming, funny, unexpected, and our two letters that we like, can respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganj and Mandel have invented everything from Hornie's work. In America, they have broken the story, which is good and unique about Hornby's work and replaced it with a conventional drill. <br /> <br /> They converted a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy. Veering from the once wretched formula Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of them has a distinct function. One overweight, second cynical and aspiring, and a romantic third. Guess how many male friends are Ben (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> "High Fidelity" was not only funny but also a good man and woman, but attracted supporting letters. This "fever pitches", nothing is particularly interesting to friends of six supporter or not. They are very important, they are not even decorated. The only reason they are in this movie is because they claim the formula. The poor law Skye has a grateful role as a Lindsey's pals up to the wind. Lovely Sky certainly wanted to take him away by entering into Lloyd Wear. Come to think, Cusack made a nice Ben. Of course, Cusack is very smart to attach itself to very impressive scripts. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have a single, single moment that seems original or impossible. Expected to launch every plot, each hair rig wire. Ganj and Mandel for the labor laughter. The first 45 minutes became so slowly and slowly, that these chops realized that they were writing a comedy. You can activate the plot in this film with your watch. Gonz√°z and Mandel wrote it on the wall with the formula of writing a few screens. When they reached a specific page, they looked at the formula and said, "OK, the guru has said that this will happen now." And, Presto! <br /> <br /> Director Bobby and Peter Farrelli do not help in this film. They have no idea how their stories and characters can be presented (they handover the V.O statement to the play, but another person sitting behind Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to some very strange writing, our Barrymore and Falun will stumble through their irrational primary meeting. <br /> <br /> Better and striking than most of Barrymore She is like a Goldie Haone on her girlhood. But even his authority can not save this extraordinary horror film. He tried hard to wring some power and humor in this story. About 30 minutes in the movie, Lindsay told Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for his comment was that it was scripts. Something for Fallon's Ben does not even say anything remotely funny. Fallon is not funny or fun; When he is a comedy, he overacts. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Night Live" Fallon was never good. He was probably the most interesting person in that show. All the voices who remember lame sketches about a radio DJ? The only reason "Weekend update" works occasionally because Falun's classmate Tina Faye knows one or two things about the comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they're funny, and rarely behave in the same way are actually funny. This is true of Fallon. He feels very funny when he just raises a skirmish. His stouting, uncertain-off-shirt does not work on a small screen; <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this photo also needs some dramatic moments. If you think his comedy was bad, then wait until his dramatic staff loads. Especially two scenes - the first of a park, the second in front of Ben's school - is painful to watch. Dramatic skills for the scenes require an actor with a smidgen, but Fallon does not have the knowledge or ability to do their job. Its range of emotions is not even run to a tow from A <br /> <br /> There is no personality or depth of Ben. Often, he comes across as a beef. And that's a lovable one. It boggles the mind of what Linens will find interesting about her. Comparison of Fallon's performance in the British version of the font, and you will understand how extremely flat, vague and compelled are Fallon's Ben and how wrong he is for this role. The dramatic depth to see Fallon in "Fovee Peach" and it took a long time for the humorous Nuan of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Just as "High Fidelity" did, an Americanized "fever pitch" could work brighter. It just requires good writers, more qualified directors and, of course, a strong, funnier, smart leader. Make yourself a huge benefit: Avoid This Pixed Film; Hire the British version of 1997 and instead read the book of Horny.
