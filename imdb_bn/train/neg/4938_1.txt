Cavemen were by far the biggest load of shit I had ever been watching watching my time. Based on GeoCo's ad, this show is less entertaining than actual 30 seconds for Geoco. The makeup was half an ass-add, at least with the dentist, it's hard to imagine a cave with prefect white teeth. If this show was possible for a custom series for the fun series, but it made it for spontaneous show. Perhaps the author is similar to the GeoCo advertising, but perhaps it was a chance, instead the pilot did not have a good story line. I can give this show 1 out of 10, I like to choose the gap between 10 but this was not an option. I pray for a quick death at this show, less than 5 episodes before it died before a worthy death.
