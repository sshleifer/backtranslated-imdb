How did Bert Reynolds smile like smiling breaking in his next movies? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was it based on a book? I could not, but it was. And probably not a good vendor, I would digest. <br /> <br /> Another good-boy-son of Bart, who designed his group with a Freuded hen Magnet hit Batman, Anderson shows interest, and Nabers is a trusted mechanic / best friend. C as his cohort gram palm impresses. <br /> <br /> Many people here are Bart or Hal's friends, others will need work, and even the real NASCAR driver also comes into this act and wants to see more talent than SAG cards. <Br / > <br /> As far as laughing, Bubba Smith (former- "Police Academy") gets him as Batie's Chaupour, and Pietersen, in full elvevir mode, is very grateful as a woman. It's a shame that Burt throttled the time and effort in a film like "Starker S.", where he was disturbed for doing any work. It does not matter if it's done. They do not bother to write a character for him, why bother to work? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly Petersen's, and takes out-out. Now they are funny
