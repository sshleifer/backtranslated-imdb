This movie was interesting ... I wanted to see it for college college in India, but the summary tells you that this movie is almost one thing, when its details have very cold, difficult information. Richly they try to combine with all the elements where it is not true at the very end. Gore Factor is fantastic, however. Even at the very beginning, the cow is quite intense because you look away. If you want to see some cool things, just watch this movie, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you waste it while listening. I have seen rumors on other websites based on real events about this movie, but you can not find any information about it online ... so it is basically lost while watching this movie.
