Okay guys, we know why we can see the "Invisible Psychology" picture (just look at the cover!). T and all those places (T more than A). But ... there is no story to go with it? <br /> <br /> "Kiss," I can tell you - "These girls can be married!" Who needs the story? ? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you were to be called Nak Manikas then I would not have any problem. But because these guys are separated from "invisible people", they need some stories, you know, keep your mind busy. However, what they can do is how crazy doctors create an invisible serum and, when he cracks, uses it to spy on nude women and end up killing many teenage teenagers. And when you see that the bright-looking teenagers go after him, you will be grateful. <br /> <br /> and one star for this, but there is a little more grace for the fans of the skin, so go ahead carefully: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
