I like it but then I think I might have been ironing at the same time. Searano de Baggerac / Roxan has been recovered from simple-to-video ignorance by the recycling of a genuine inhuman, formulary Romcom genine gorophila. Playing on the fridge of the pot, he is caught in love trap, when insecurity allows him to close his best friend (Uma Thurman) himself, when a Calcutta court comes to court. <br /> <br /> This is a catchy movie about an interesting career in Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave a shot Hollywood tragedy with this picture. He is untenable, and his unnaturalness on studio productions on his ground is disrespectful, although he was also present at the Terrence owner's movies. Uma Thurman performs Dietzig at the Autopilot and Michael Lehmann packs it together efficiently. Although the Aikki phone sex though. 4/10
