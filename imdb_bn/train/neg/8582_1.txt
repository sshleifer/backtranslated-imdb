Unlike Baker Monty in Sheffield's Baker Bust, a series of continuous bills, this image is a fake. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Sheffield-born and still in town links. Someone said it could be set in Oklahoma, and it's about to sum it up for me. It looked like a romantic scene in North England made for the US market. Probably a lot of Americans - and many South English people - do not realize that Sheffield is a big city with almost half a million inhabitants with a modern urban culture. Among the giants, it was portrayed as some indifferent dead-end semi-rural small town, where all Sheffield's people started drinking in the same old fashioned water, and where a village people thought that a party was some village-it is similar to seeing. It was a small close community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The working class Sheffield men were quite different from their real life opponents, who usually embrace and communicate with each other and communicate briefly. Dry comments They do not shut up, and they certainly do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even Peak District, rural setting looked even to me alien. I recognized some of the places that I was going to hiking, but some pylon hailstorm expanded across a dark landscape area reminded me of Wales. Indeed, at the end of the credit I saw a reference to Guinness, Wales. Peak is crawling with the tourists and tourists in the district, the summer, the factory. It is located in two big cities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> None of men was shown as a partner or family; They exist in a vacuum <br /> <br /> The unemployed wants to see a film about Sheffielder who has led astray. This Sheffield was in the mind of middle-class writers and filmmakers only. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
