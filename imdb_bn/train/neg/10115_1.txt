I noticed my personal goals to go after the responsible for this picture. I also got the rental company to refund my money because I argued that they blamed false advertising. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that this movie itself is a p.os.s. But the cover art has sold me. Compared to the fact that the film is actually contrasted with cover art, I have a great influence on my children in Halloween. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, what do I say? Alabama raised - but there is a German accent !? It is beyond insulting.
