Yesterday I saw free money and this is the longest 90+ minutes in my life. With such a intriguing cast, I really thought I was for a treat - especially as I am brando fan Wrong! What a waste of talent Occasionally viewing frequent scenes (such as Cow Prod Scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for ridiculous setups (why did not they return the character of Charlie Shin to the truck's tower?) It tried to be a slapstick comedy, but I was not just buying it. Leave this one out. Just for Brando fans to die. <br /> <br /> I give 2 out of 10 because I still think Skidu made any bad movie.
