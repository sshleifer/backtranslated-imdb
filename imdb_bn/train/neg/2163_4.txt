Really shameful - I rarely see a movie and finally feel frustrated. I've seen a number of adaptations of Ira Levin - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and both of them liked it, but it did not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> When I read the plot outline - An award-winning playwright (Michael Kain) decided to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and stitched his script for his own success - I was excited. I like the thriller, Michael Kain is a good actor, a good director of Sydney Lloyt and Ira Levin's work is usually good. <br /> <br /> I will not loot it for anyone I have not seen it yet, but I too. D saying there are twists and winding loads. Many have worked hard without explaining the plot line of the film in detail. I enjoyed the first one ... 45 minutes ago, twists and turns were started and at that time my interest and pleasure started. Although I want to luminate credit for a very ridiculous end, which makes me laugh loudly. <br /> <br /> The original cast - Michael Kain, Christopher Reeve, Diane Canon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Although the clear fake Russian accession of Worth was little in my nerves (personal Irene is nothing, I think any actor's fake act will tease me). Although Canon's character was meant to be annoying, it was not sure, Diane became very upset. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this - I do not want you to stop watching it. My opinion - to give it a chance, you may like it, you may not be. It's all about the opinion.
