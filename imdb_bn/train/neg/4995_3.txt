I found this a real job to sit through this film. The soundtrack was not the best, and a few words made it hard to understand what it was said. The plot was not too short to move, and the move was often discontinued, and the film was a long-term conversation that seemed to be exotic. These conversations were switched from family groups and observers tied them together which were the common threads that were left to try and piece together. It is very rare that I rate this picture low and in this case I see that the whole viewing experience reminds me of "so what" and "why did I waste time looking at it."
