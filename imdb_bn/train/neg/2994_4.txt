I have seen this picture twice now, and I must say that I enjoyed both of it. It is fast paced and fun, but eventually duffy. Not saying that it might be a good follow-up screwing up due to trash. It is clear for those who have seen the terrible 'Jumbo Cropping Flees' that can be carried out by Bruno Matii for the massive damage to the film, and it may be quite a little complicated about it. It does not disable Full Syncophone, you can say that the styles of the directories are completely reversed, and in particular what is meant in the case of Mattei. This film is the epicenter of the viral outbreak (strangely referred to as the "top secret" by the scientist, it is probably more significant than its potentially mysterious effects on mankind anywhere in Southeast Asia. Like jumbo causes and the virus quickly covers an apparently arbitrary area of ​​land Our characters are unknowingly flowing into danger zones, and fight for their lives against infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The image seems to be halting half way between a junky flick and two out and out action : Adventure, and this confusion is most clearly caught by zombies. They do not seem to have a set of all common features. Tasah is shuffling a variety of types, so it is well transformed into the original, and possibly the creation of Fulci. The other major group is associated with the virus being infected, which has lost all their feelings, but has created a barbaric aggression and desire to achieve black belt in the slander: Uncertainty has often spread to whether or not to continue their top spherical strategy Or on their reckless hunting festival looks like a mass rotation busy with their brothers. Martial arts skills are not their only talent, they are guerrilla tactics, hidden on the roof and hidden under the haystack, and sometimes unknowingly, rather than from somewhere, heaven itself falls. This is definitely the work of Matteo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This type of visually retains sense of irony, 'I'm really thirsty ... for your blood'. In the end, the humorous turn turns DJ Zumbi, but continues to promote the advertisement of the fate of mankind, it only increases the WTF factor and exceeds any hope in a serious resolution. <br /> There is a notorious zombie head which slowly stretches itself through the air, creating a firework skeleton on its face, as it is said, 'Yes we know how bad it is.' <br /> <br /> The letters are just the dimensions you would expect. But its impenetrable dialogue and dubbing that really hinders us from taking our disaster seriously. The first soldier of death has said that an unstoppable zombie has been shown an impressive bold against the danger. Actually this is the first and probably when we hit the real Jimmy Agro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The person who played the main scientist has his heart, but there is no genius at its line completely random, so he ended up sound like a confused asthma. Scientists 'trying to find an antidote is completely disgraceful' Now let's combine these two molecules! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> In fact, In a preliminary scene a female hero explores a abandoned garage. When entering a room we are faced with a shoddy view of a moving image and a squirming mass on the floor, all in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a fast machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his awkwardness awakening everything in his despair. One of the real horrific moments in his strong aggression film. The hotel publishes the hotel before and after the theater which hosts the first phase of the outbreak, and after that the playground of our play is covered with thick thick emotions. There is a scene where one of the soldiers arrives in the house sitting in a cautionary manner, which clearly surrounds the base of the Nihhat and it is quite annoying. When they became strangers in the hotel, they became even more amazing, it became even more dramatic. But it is managed sloppily and it can not be as effective as that. <br /> <br /> I would say all that this film could be worthy of the potentially tropical junkie royal royal screw. , Rather through a bad and bad film. If there is nothing else, the strange smile is that I came to expect about eighty thousand Italian and the poor.
