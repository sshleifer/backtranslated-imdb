I really hate this show! I saw an episode, and I knew this show was really awesome. The line of the story has been badly written and executed, and Jokes is really bad ... I mean that it's only a DXT laboratory and a T ++ tie rip off of Johnny Quest, 'a disgraceful boy with a twinkle of pink hair and a talent tone sister Dog called; Dad and a smart, very busy mom in a bus-in-house ... oh-my-flip-like-god! Their father's parents are ** ** 'crazy home builders, so not gay! If my father is a home builder I will die personally! Shame that ... I really like. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more about this ... this rebel but only 3 words; To describe them, count three words: <br /> <br /> · Warm, Fool, and above all ... · F ** Kup! I said that people can all say, it is definitely making my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I had that one.
