By 1941 Colombia was a full-fledged main studio and could produce a film with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warren. The best soap opera on "Adam Hack Charts Sons", which can be said to be the best among the most amazing performances by Aggrid Bergman (the top bills for the first time in America's first film) and Warner Buckler.

Only everyone in the movie is good - well, when it comes to the middle of Vilnese, like Susan Haird is healthy ?? He is clearly the only spectacular person in the movie, although he is clearly channelizing Bate Davis and Vivienne Leigh; Is it the longest heir to launch its alcoholic first ?? But script saccharine remains and finishing is completely annoying. No wonder Bergman similarly planned "Valley of Decision" four years later.
