I've never seen a single bad film in a theater. I saw this movie at the 2004 Austin Film Festival, and I felt that this movie was accepted for the festival. It was an attractive courtyard and it seems to be anywhere, but when trying to do something, each became separated. Above all, if you're going to make a musical, find someone with musical talent. The music was playing Chess piano, which they were playing in the stereo of the room. The songs were very badly written, and when they were not clear rhymes, they were fierce-inspired rhymes that showed how they tried to work in this movie to expand. And you think you'll find a guy who can sing while making a musical instrument, right? Not in this case. Thankfully, they were singing half the songs in rhythm, but when they sang, they cringed me. Especially when they tried to sing similarities. And that's just the music address. There was some good acting, but many conversations were terrible, as well as most scenes. Apparently there was not enough coverage, or they were a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices to spend the film. At least the director agreed that no one would want the script unless they added a musical hook. I hope investors can again write music before making the same mistake.
