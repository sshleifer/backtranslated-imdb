I admit - In my opinion, Emma, ​​the single greatest novel ever written. As per the fulfillment as it may be a perfect creation. Jane Austen reached the top of his industry here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is one of the best polymers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emma's Smart Spiritual Twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill a perfect decorated. Production is handsome, but the interior is much darker. <br /> <br /> However, there are several major problems. First Mark Strong - Firstly, he does not feel right for Mr Knightley. Probably because he plays such a terrible Victorian Person role. It's badly bad. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the length. Simply tell, the film is too small - to get the right kind of feeling, it should be twice. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most significantly, there are adaptation quality. Austen dreams of an adapter - all conversations are already there. It only needs to be cut and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First of all, this is a rather frustrating movie, and the last thing should be frustrating. More significantly, Davis looks appropriate for the last rewrite as some kind of incognito festival. What are the planets, Thomas Hardy or small works, come from this? It is completely out in novel style and spirit. And I believe that it's mostly animated to try to improve. - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the Paltro version, or see Kate in a cold coffee farm.
