Three years ago, Rachel (Fratell) in Thrace with her friend drowned in the lake and was taking part in the lake with her friends. Rachel's friends think that she does not have time to stop herself and blame her for any control over her. So grab the breed and some chin and Rachel's constant nightmares to return to the same lake. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two friends are splattered before even leading the team. This flick is the feeling of playing a high school, where everyone forgot their lines and 'It's Wing' ... ... very bad! Writer Marks Gabriel as Richelieu's boyfriend Leo gave himself the role of meat. Some beautiful birds have been played outside of Futewell and Gabriel and there are few characters that they want to close the shit before being 'closed'. The presence of nerve focuses on several other players: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Neves. It's a memorable day you will not feel missing.
