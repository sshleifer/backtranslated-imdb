I think bad lorelle and hardie are better than any lorel and hardie, but only barely. It is tragic that Fox Films has released big releases on DVD, publishing people who are not familiar with L & H with most of their top performers than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Again the boys are shouting with a fool romantic plot about a guy discovered in an invisible ray. He loves Boss's daughter, who hates him and likes some junky people. It is impossible for folks to think that it is in their movies and needs H and H <br /> <br /> Boys, apart from their pancake makeup, look tired and old. The only scene that works for them in this film is when they try to get out of the window of the bedroom at night and the wicked scene where Robert Mitchell classic silent bad guy tries to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance" on Stan. <<br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of "Champion at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Child of Desert" instead.
