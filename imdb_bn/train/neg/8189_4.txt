It's always hard to do good work in your life than your siblings, always struggling to get out of that shadow and not boring from your family. So imagine your older brother Santa and then imagine how difficult it would be to be so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), pictured only by light-hogging, fame-hungry, Fred Too much praise for some obscure people who want to do After that, you do not know it, Fred needs financial grace and he needs to help his brother to run Christmas. And sunny and life education ensues. <br /> <br /> All right, that's what will happen. The fact is, we've got a Christmas movie, which is a good moment for Von's patented fast-teching, a ridiculously out-of-date music video moment, playing the auditor to stop Kevin Space Santa's operation (and that's the weakest), I saw Elizabeth Banks a lot Christmas decoration is not enough to quantify, John Michael Higgins's elif is decorated  ার, তিনি একটি উজ্জ্বল) এবং একটি সিনেমা যা খুব তিক্ততার মধ্যে সাঁতার কাটছে ভাল মৌসুমী ভাড়া মত মনে হয় এখনও তার পরের অর্ধেক মধ্যে খুব schmaltzy মনে হয় একটি বাণিজ্যিক মজা সময় সব খারাপ জিনিস এ মজাদার মত মনে। <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is accompanied by a ride, such as Kathy Bates, but it's not actually much more than a movie for the ground and if you like her style, you can find some things to enjoy here. Unfortunately, this season has very little to suggest stinker. Scripts out of Vaughn's rantings throws something decent without a special exception involving a ridiculous support group with a very special view of a very good special exception. <br /> <br /> You did not see the monthly card of David Dobkin as mediocre and staid as 20p that you sent for the month of Maschi and it seems that combining a mix together with a good mix or decent care will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding . No, we get a burnt, bland lump with a very sugar top. If you want a great, modern Christmas comedy then forget it and then hang out with the delightful elf. See it if you want: Santa Claus 2, Santa Baby, Santa Claus 3: Escape Clauses.
