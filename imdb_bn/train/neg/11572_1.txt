Slow, annoying, very repetitive Winston Company could not buy it any surprise. This Spallock must eat more McDonalds while filming and release the producer. There is no way you can see and enjoy this. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can not create a 2 minute film with this concept. I'm sorry to rent this movie. I will not see anything with the name Spurlock It is completely rubbish. Such filmmakers should be on YouTube and should not be given a contract of distribution. The film says that American buyers and their purchases are responsible for the current depression, when buying shopping and commodities, making money is funded by a healthy economy.
