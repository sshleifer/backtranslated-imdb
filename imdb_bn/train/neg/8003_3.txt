I will not be cheated by the 'burning' reviews quoted in the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining.", "A terrible freakout freakout.", And worst of all, with "JAWS with PAR." This movie is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> I am generally not bothered to write bad reviews for movies but I can not believe that it is resting in Comfort 7 at IMDB. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A girl is snagged by the monster (I would give them points for a good animal design, but it is not the creation of any WETA) and her semi-troupe spent the family spending an hour ... in the surrounding sewers of the Han River. There is no doubt in their search, and some have joined the Job? Whenever they find him, you realize that it was all too vain. On the other hand, a large part of the film is committed to a governmental compatibility, which involves a man in a fun scene, which is involved in spitting a guitar in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Bleach. This was bad. I'm not kidding Do you want to see a rotten monster movie? Deep rowing rentals At least you save 30 minutes of your life.
