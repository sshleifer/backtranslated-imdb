Now, I will not deny that when I stopped by eBay, I had high hopes. This was an incredible out-of-print job from the comedy master that I enjoyed. However, I was soon to be very disappointed. For those who enjoyed it, forgiveness, but I just became very hard to see Kalpatala Alak. I got some laughs, sure, but most came from funny music videos (which I got in the DVD) and the rest were largely admitted. You can say that it is not the highest achievement of AL's (the respect that goes to the UHF). Actually, I suspect that it will never jump in the DVD, so if you are a Ultra-Hard Al Fan and only own everything, then close eBay. Just do not have to pay too much for it.
