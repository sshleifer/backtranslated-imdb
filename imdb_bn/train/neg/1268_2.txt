Oh what a condescending movie! Set in Los Angeles, the heart of Hollywood filmmakers from Pov to the universe, this film tries as a deep social commentary on contemporary American fingers. <br /> <br /> The stereotyped, transitional character cross-path of their widely-modified socio-economic backgrounds, their daily, humdrum life. The plot is confused and desultory. The film is going on for a number of unfamiliar conspiracy such as a drive-by shooting, an abandoned child on the weeds, a gang gang of left-wing, a man flying in the night sky, a child in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all those events, the generous help of social "insight" given through a constant dialogue, such as letters compare notes compared to their life experience. One character says: "When you sit on the edge of the Grand Canyon, you will realize that we are kidding ... ... those stones are laughing at me and I can say my concern; <br /> < Another character reflects the meaning of his meaning: "There is a bay in this country, of which there is stuff and I do not think there is a massive volcanic eruption in the public ... find this huge hole on the ground. As it is ... big canyon, and that is pouring ... the rise of anger, and anger created violence ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> The acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The voice of the movie is self-satisfied with the contempt of the script for the audience. <br /> <br /> This is a movie project approved by Hollywood suites, who congratulates himself as the Almighty Guru everywhere. They think that their film is our absolute, unknown movie director, and the real meaning of American social change.
