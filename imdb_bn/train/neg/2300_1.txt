The "700 Club" will be the only television broadcasting program in the history of television. To make matters even worse, since 1966 it has been in the air, which means that if millions of people do not buy between their hatred and lies. Under the leadership of Pat Robertson, dishonest, Megalomomaniel founder and leader of the Christian coalition, "700 Club" propagated from the misconceptions and "news" and tried to convince its audience that they want to convince everyone that the problems of the world are gay, wiken, new-age spirituality , Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Non-fundamentalist Christians, Democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, statements Dancers, environmentalists, NASA scientists and others who do not share them blame them. Religious religious views This is the best fake news from the "Weekend Update" section of "The Daily Show" or "Saturday Night Live" or "Fox News". Of course, Pat always decides that every decision will take, whatever he thinks, and does not hurt or hurt any criminal. Meanwhile, he participated in the struggle to transform the United States into military forces and ask religious errors to stop their noses and donate to others - no amount can be less than $ 100. Members, by the way - PAT African Hira to buy oil from mining companies and reprimand companies by past governments for their misuse of government. No, Pat was not a good friend with Ziaer and Zimbabwe's dictatorship, so that he could acquire such wealth; It's all for God's glory, do you know what? And of course, the hosts of the "700 Club" are always willing to read "Letters written by visitors", as they like to keep it, each type of type in the same format and all of them are considered "visitors" in the same color paper, (They claim that "the words of wisdom" have come to them), but those who know what is happening to them. Rogramatite is ever present. In fact, when someone is using poor tool recordings, how can anyone take the show seriously? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This guy agrees with Jerry Fellow that 11 September 2001 US terrorist attacks are punishable by God for punishing us for homosexuality and feminism. Patrick has been publicly mentioned twice in the state department for bilateral surgeries; I had no doubt that his wealth had prevented him from arresting such a statement. Gay sex, its sexuality against single mothers and any sexual practice that she considered "sinner" is attractive, she is considered to be known about several prostitution during the Korean War. As the Bible says, be fruitful and attentive, so congratulations, Pat - thank you, perhaps there are several children born in single Korean mothers. Then, of course, he called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (he is a saint, but still). Oh, yes, and let's soon forget the time of compulsory abortion in China "Crusader for human life". Do not tell him too "Christian", <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I forgot his little talk that today Christians preaching the good news "Just as Jews were Nazi Germany." Sincerely, It is almost impossible to compare her "distress" to the horrors of horror. To talk, did I say that homosexuality has spread through the Nazi party in an effort to dissatisfied with homosexuality? Of course, history shows us that Nazi treated homosexuals, similarly they treated the Jews. Pat Robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. If he was a Pinocchio, his nose would be surrounded by the earth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, more people believe in him every day. Call this up to your wake up, man; "700 Club" is not the single largest program in the history of television, it is one of the largest. It is masquerading as bad as well; This is a wolf-in-sheep dress. It's dirty messy that tries to look clean, beautiful, and loving. It is a living testimony that the hateful, dangerous religious viewpoint is not restricted to certain groups of the Middle East. Even those who do not have Christian faith know that it goes against what Jesus teaches, and if Jesus is present in this "club", then he will not imitate them. Instead, he did the Pharisees during their time, and he would punish them as he did in front of the synagogue for the sake of their Telton's money. I can say that Pat had no chance to thank God; If he did, he would be the harbinger of Armageddon - and not the good guys as well.
