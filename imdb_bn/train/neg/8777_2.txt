All right, I was really struggling to get out of this movie to sell EVP, the movie originally got from me. I argued to hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula so I could stay with it. <br /> <br /> However, the image that was taken is not very good. It has been created and played efficiently, but it does not really capture you. There are many "jump" moments, and I looked at them and said "yes, I do not expect" without actually having the slightest blurry. <br /> <br /> Also the resolution can not be understood. If the power behind it is capable of doing things, then why would the hell use the proxy? Plus, the last caption was weird. They obviously keep it as part of "the film's credibility with all true claims", but for this to work it really needs to be in the beginning. But they can not get it in the beginning, because they keep the plot away ... until it stops, it stops like a mustache.
