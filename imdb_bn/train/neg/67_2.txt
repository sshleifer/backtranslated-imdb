Very soon, the political theme of this film is so clear and heavy handed over, that the results are completely anticipated. Any good textbook writing writing screenplaces will include determining the level of the letter, the letter arcs, and the three law structure suggestions. You can not find whats in this picture. Police are shown as famine, and consequently shallow, disabled and cowards. It is never seen by the makers of the film that the police can be a respected citizen, who can join the police as a good way to contribute to the welfare of the society. <br /> <br /> There is no scope for creating a viewer. Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. He is being arrested for stealing a horse, but we did not find any source for his crime or innocence. We saw him walk through a gull door, but only know that he is inside for three years when we heard some conversations later. <br /> <br /> There are many Ned shots in this picture. Camera with a serious expression I found that the film is really real. This is the direction of modern film, and it does not look at me anymore.
