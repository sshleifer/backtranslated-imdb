What a disappointment! I hate Mammy but it was worse! It was very tiring and incredible and at a certain time I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can not believe people actually do not like this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very believable. The whole movie was felt like a huge trip around America's most wanted home. The indication and combination of the combination never stopped was both very believable. I stopped paying attention to about 30 minutes. The total frustration of what was supposed to be out of a happy night became. What to Drag ... I think I've seen many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
