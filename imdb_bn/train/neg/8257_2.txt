"Gentlemen's Game" uses the game of golf in a country's club setting, which illustrates the discovery of a teenage girl about honesty, bias, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where I was going to this image, only to be proved wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that filmmakers knew where this title was. The moments defined in this film probably mix Gary Srinsius "The Karate Kid" and surmise that he is going to be a teenage golfer mentor. It is refreshing in a way that this movie refuses to follow the simplest and more working movie source. However, it still comes close as many concomved. Hat-wrecked people dazzle all the protests of civilization, or they fail to stop them for things that they believe, or are open to doing less respectable things than their position in society. Unfortunately, there are often no resolution at this moment. And without the fact that the club acts as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linking. It is a shame that writers and directors could not save a good movie, especially talented actors and possible things to setup.
