Oh why do people feel the need to take good things and make some changes? After reading this book based on this film a few years ago, I can say that it is a little smaller than the original book. I went to this photo with less hope - I knew it would be a painful telemovie - but it also failed to fill up. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - it's only the original name of the relationship. This is not the story of Carlito Brigant, this is a completely different story, which is given the same name. They only roam completely in front of the Karlot's Way fan; Luiz Guzman played an important role in the insult of humiliation by casting, who played an important role in the original film. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing that this film has been created now will not be made any other film. Carlitos Way addresses the original, obsolete elements of the book - I really liked to see something. I felt the same way as Chopper - their four books have valuable interviews of fantastic nuggets as well as could create a brilliant biography of Australia's most fearsome underworld, instead they created the movie about frustration, but the strange timing crank (though strange Erin Bena's performance was spot-on). Now we will not be going to show Carlotta's true early emergence and fall. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Even Puffy Combs suits her role. But they completely misunderstood the underworld's nature at that time (I am a crime-non-fiction buff) - the original films and books seem to be right (then wrote the attorney and now Judge Edwin Torres wrote) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
