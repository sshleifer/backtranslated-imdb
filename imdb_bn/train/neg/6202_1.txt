Although I have seen that I was so angry, even though I have seen an abusive end to life. I thought the director was screaming for attention, and the only way to achieve this was as much reactionary as possible. Since I have lived in the UK, I have come to love this country, but this film is pictally illustrated by the British youth. It can not be said but to avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. People involved will be ashamed.
