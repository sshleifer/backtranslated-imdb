All of the speakers are very often, Hollywood's Shakespeare adaptation movie piece entertainment. Beautiful shots they performed better and faithful to the text Films are quite powerful works by Branagh's "Henry V" and "Many Ado for nothing" in 1993. It is such a big disappointment for the hope that "love is lost in love", so hoping to be destroyed so unexpectedly. Sadly "the labor of love is lost" horror! King of Avatar (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends left drinking and women for three years to focus their studies. Plans start to separate when the Princess Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and his entourage arrive. Soon love is in the air and close to the Prince's mind of philosophy. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this image is not quite Shakespeare. Kenny Branhigh shines in the 1930s musical instruments, the plot is still there and the script remains, but it is now dedicated to horror musical taste. The classic "The Way You You Tonight", "Let's the Music and Dance", "I'm in the Sky" has been destroyed by the poor voice and destructive feeling that they are not here. <br /> <br> In addition to the poor singing, we are also being treated with increasingly extraordinary performance by regular adults. Ken Branagh and friends can enjoy enjoying this movie, but they provide strap-bump collections of our roles. <br /> <br /> The main actor (four men and four women) is equally terrible, and the only positive is a huge improvement over their true horror timothy spell. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves a complimentary film and it is consistently great Nathan Lane. Lane has proved for years that she is a comedy genius and in this feature she added humorous air to the guest coaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> there is nothing to say. "Love Lebanese Lost" In the old story, Branagh's original adoption is gentle praise. Unfortunately though, where the positive ending. Vulgarly acting, performing, singing and making, "the ruthless destruction of love" is probably the weakest Shakespeare adaptation for forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should not have been done. A poor, frustrating choice by Branagh and here is the good hope for his next attempt.
