... let me count the way. <br /> <br /> 1. A title-only 'remake' that shows every cliche in the slash handbook. <br /> <br /> 2. So a plot is so predictable that it is quite merciful. <br /> <br /> 3 All attempts in doubt or thrill have a complete weak execution. <br /> <br /> 4. Any Poor, Violence, or Gender Insurance is a PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain that is not terrible or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of letters that is so thin and stereotyped that we probably could not take care of them. <br /> <br /> 7. The lack of any effective hazardous atmosphere (different from the original Prime Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A script of dialogue outside the poor - it's the silence of the mind. <br /> <br /> A series of cardboard performances (not to make sure the actors are to blame). <br /> <br /> 10. Do not be brave enough to try to imagine a completely inactive tin-targeted slash - even the blood lotus. <br /> <br /> Save your money, it's not an intelligent awesome fan. <Br <br /> <br /> Out of BOMB ****
