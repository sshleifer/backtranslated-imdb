This movie was long and annoying. Surprised that it was chosen for cancer, although they preferred ugly. The point is that it seems completely empty in the gurnies, unlike other anti-starred Dutch stars like Karkhoff and Christishup. Even more so it has no cinematic quality. A long opening shot means the cinematic depth, it's a long annoying shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not recognize at all. The actor does not shine under his direction and takes time to lose. Leopold tried, but he did not expect that talent. Where are you and why? They really made some waves of Dutch movies Leopold just made another attempt.
