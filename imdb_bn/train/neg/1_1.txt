Robert DeNiro is the incredible cute illiterate drama of all time. This movie talent is so conspicuous, it's really weird. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. The character of Jane Fondara is his own joke, and not the funny one. The film moves at a snap speed, it is photographed in a bad suggestion, and is an integral publicity. Plug it into each cliche of the book. Swoozie Kurtz is a helpful introduction, but so what? <br /> <br /> The same new IMDB regime requires ten lines for each review. When a movie is in vain, ten lines of text are not required so that other readers know that it is time and waste of tapes. Avoid this movie.
