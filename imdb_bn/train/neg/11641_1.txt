Although I'm not a supporter of the usually created movie, I do not restrict myself to limits that leave borders and often I do not enjoy and do not really praise movies "breaking the rules". And it is true that director Pasolini broke the rules of the established movies. But my opinion is that he does not break them successfully or at a real point. <br /> <br /> The work of Passolini is apparently jerking, but it actually portrays how much less than it actually is on the screen, and his film seems to be of lesser artistic choices than amateur cinematography results. This DECAMERON is true. Pasolini often loved to use non-actors, and did it with remarkable results of many directors, but his non-actors were non-actors under the direction of Pasolini. This DECAMERON is true. Pasolini mostly includes images designed to shock, humiliate, or otherwise disassociate the audience. Such elements can often be used with shiny effects, but such elements as the hand of Pasolini seem to rarely contribute to the film. This DECAMERON is true. <br /> <br /> I understand that many people like, even love Pasolini films. Yet, I could never meet any of them ever, and I could never read anything about Pascolini or his work, which is reasonable for my liking or praise. Judging him from his work alone, I think he was an amateur director who "did not break the rules" because of his lack of skill - and who praised him by his first day's intellectual? The "existence of courage," which only makes him sure of bad habits like the filmmaker. I find her work tedious, unimpressive, and pretentious. And this, also, DECAMERON is true. It is tragic, really, it's really true that every Paosolini film is lonely to bear with me.
