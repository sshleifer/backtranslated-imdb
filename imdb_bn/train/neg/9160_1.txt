This movie was ridiculous. A friend rented it to Netflix and made me watch it. It is impossible to get disturbed about the characters and the plot that has so many gaffs and guffs. For example how are they ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The office of the priest's palace ... complete with a folding card table desk <br /> <br /> A decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But if you see the technical flaws past you will also get great acting and casting. I was most excited by Casting a proud gay actress to play right-wing religious Johouat. <br /> <br /> I appreciate his author / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / cast dentist / music (and whatever he actually moved on this) actually getting a movie like this. If you do not have anything better then this may be the subject of a fun group movie or even a drink, but do not rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
