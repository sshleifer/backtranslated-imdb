It is no doubt about the worst movie of Rajkanth. The first part is found to be hard comedy from Gondamani, but it is worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a dig at the Sons through the same name (dad) a stray and full length one-fishing boat. In the first half, Rajni talks about the normal series of his alignment and style and becomes the beggar of the second half, a beggar takes him to the Himalayas through an intercontinental portal, where the parent (special sannyasinera did not dig before) special power for any special reason (without action ). Is not this really interesting to start now? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is spoiling its magic and power and fighting politicians and related black magic. Normally expected shit with ridiculous implementation. Oh and the black magic did not work on our hero because he was just a parameter ... ... with the power cycle. Bad boys and general politicians are clichad, overvid, and ultimately, the plot that does not go anywhere itself is totally unimportant. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, it was fun to have time to call the father one-line during the public ceremony. Its fun to see others curse about this movie. AR Rehman compiled his movie track through Selim. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For it's sake. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely unfortunate. Japanis can stop the night movies after watching it. This film was probably the promotional material for entry into politics, but the results of the film killed his political dream. <br /> <br /> If you close your brain then have fun.
