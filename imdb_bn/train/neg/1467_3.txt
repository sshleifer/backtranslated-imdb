Astonomer Hitler's biographer, historian Ian Kershoe, who was originally the legal advisor to the TV movie, did not get disconcerted. The picture is historically very wrong. The mistakes started when Hitler's father Alouse died at home, in fact he died in Pabna. Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, in fact he went to Munich in 1913. I could go on forever. Hitler's childhood and youth have been portrayed in a very small way, which makes it difficult to understand the character of this frustrating neurotic man historically unauthorized. The important person in the early part of the party is not entirely absent as Hitler's father-in-law friend Dietrich Eckart or the "Philosopher" of Alfred Rosenberg. The characterization of Arnest Hontapnaglal is very problematic. In this film he is portrayed as a great character, who almost hates Hitler. He followed his own perspective by following Hanfstenglg's own gosses, which he gave in his life after the war. In fact, there was an opposition limit in Hansfengal and his "Fuehrer" was crazy about. But the biggest problem of the movie is Hitler's screenplay. He is identified as a person who is constantly uninterrupted, has no charisma or charm, and constantly orders all around. After watching the movie, a wonderful, such a hateful person has ever been able to find a follower. As we all know, what a crime Hitler was, naturally, every scriptwriter was tempted to portray Hitler as a completely annoying and incomprehensible. But the incident is, personally he may be quite charming and entertaining. His colleagues did not follow him because he constantly screamed at them, but they liked this weird man. Outside those historical errors, the film was well-formed, the actor gave a credible impression of the first class, location shots and production design era.
