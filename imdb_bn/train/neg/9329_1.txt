One of the worst movies I've ever seen is My only thought was: "How can I get my money back from Hollywood videos"? There is no way to these four dollars, or any dollar value. I think it was trying to rob the Mexican, or Vin Diesel movies, but failed to fail it. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, I'm sorry for the actors that they did not find anything good with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out to the front line of actors, it was so expected. The Mexican expression of leading lady was insulting worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
