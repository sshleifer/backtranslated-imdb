I'll give it a 3 because it shows the history that we need to know, so that it can not happen again. I agree with the UK's gentleman's comment. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich√©, no real plot Historical and technical error chaos Check out technical spaces in DE 529, or the Everts Class Destroyer Escort, and you'll see what you understand. I am now the month of its black history in the United States, and I'm just going to say racism to say this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, a "submarine" smuggling that turned them into a jolt. Sorry, but black people did much more on WWII, then this silly film would give credit for them. These movies look like their whiners. Let's start calling the name, I can manage it.
