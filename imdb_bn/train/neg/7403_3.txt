It was not the worst movie I ever saw, but that could be said about it almost. It starts off with some good atmosphere; The hospitals are aptly set up "eerie" in the mood sterilized and isolated. And then ... nothing. Well, something. There are just a few things that definitely do not fit ... and there is no effort to make the connection clear between the stimulus and still particularly the fearsome creeters and the hospital they have taken. I mean, come on, Bike Dude? <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was inside a head like a middle-aged trucker, which is a terribly threatening threat, and at the same time she really liked to choose. Sag down on an Afghan-covered sofa, undo its belt, cheap dog drink a dog (probably Schlitz), and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen many scarier truckers. At the truckstops. Drink coffee WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> Another monster cartoonist, even less terrible. At least, in the video, videos explain some of their presence in the hospital ... they apparently pop up randomly in places, some shit play "metal" and allow people to die a bit. Except for some good special effects, and acting that is not terribly terrible due to lack of outstanding writing, there's nothing left here. It's just a background-noise movie.
