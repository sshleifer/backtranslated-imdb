A scientist (John Carradine - sadly) brought the dead back to life. But they come back with a marble face. Finally all of them lead to disaster. <br /> <br /> The annoying, fully expected 1940s outing. When I was a child, I made this fool fool, but now I'm just dragging me. I had to struggle to stay awake! With one exception, acting terrible. Such stupid annoying actor! Frustrated <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carine, despite the script, really gives a very good performance. And there are some silent moments involving the Great Dan ghost that walk through the walls. There is also the worst knockout in cinematic history. Yet, none of them have fun enough to sit on it. To avoid.
