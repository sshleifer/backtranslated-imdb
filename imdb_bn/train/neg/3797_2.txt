Alex Rane (played by Olivia Gurner in the first film), since people fell into a terrible plot to replace machines, yet a war between humans and cyberbes has emerged and we are now lost, which is the daughter of a supernatural woman Olivier Gurner (she played her lowest role I've got only half of the power) which I have Here for the first time that these movies with the lowest link, however, is to create the suparabhaimena, he hides in 1980, and the future of a monster hunter threw him down. This confusing sci-fi clunker. Nimesis has become a civilization hit, I can see why people prefer, even though I was not a fan of this movie. Nemesis, very ambitiously trying to bring different ideas, develops a beautiful look and provides a lot of arrangement, it almost works. Nimesis 2 has no ambition, it is a perfect wrap of the terminator, which is a muscular woman, who considers Olivier's grunar as Master Master Thespian, and in the sequence of events it is the main selling point of explosive state. I admit that I was a real fan, but it was better suited to follow. The original feature also featured a good performance like Tim Thompson, Curry Hiroikee Taga, Them Matthews, Brian James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earl Halley, and this time it's a dull movie with a terrible vibe. Actually I saw this, it inspired to add the original half star. <br /> <br /> * between 4 (bad)
