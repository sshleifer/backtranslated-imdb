First be careful that I have seen this movie with TV and Dubbed English - which can be completely deprived of the atmosphere. Anyway, I'll rate what I've seen and hope that people will take away from that version. I found this movie excruciatingly dull. All the movie's atmosphere is lost with the drowning of a movie starving. I'm sorry, but the sin of the worst movie in my book will be slow without philosophy. I do not see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie. Maybe I've missed something, but I see it as I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, the US-based taste, most likely.
