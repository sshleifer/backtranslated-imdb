To review this movie, I have to quote the memorable scene of Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" (1994) without any doubt when Zeus and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and she is doing what she wants for a living. Zeus told Vincent that "he only had what he had been a pilot". Vincent asked, "What is a pilot?" And Zeus gave a very good description of a TV pilot: "All right, they show a show, they show a shot that is called a 'pilot.' Then they show a show that shows the show, and they decide on the power of a single show Whether they are going to make more shows, some pilots pick up and become a television program, nothing happens, nothing happens, now to expand on what Jules says N is the television show / pilot billions that have never been broadcast because they were not just ... well, perhaps the most notorious pilot thinks "wa * a * l * t * e * and", which is led by Gary "radar" Berghaf "M * A * S * Spin Off, hmm, is anyone really trying to punish Radar? So, the show has never been selected. How many people do not know (or they know what they know) Pilots are never shown in the air.  , কারণ তারা তাদের জন্য টেলিভিশন নেটওয়ার্কগুলির জন্য কঠোরভাবে প্রস্তুত হয়। কিছু কিছু তারা অতীত হয়ে গেছে এবং বায়ুতে পৌঁছে গেছে (অ্যানিমেটেড সিরিজের "পাইলট" সিরিজটি মনে মনে আসে, কারণ শো এর সিরিয়ালটি প্রায় চার মাস পরে শুরু হয় নি। However, many times we are all happy pilots can not make it wind, and why is it here? <br /> <br /> "Black bart", Mel Brooks comedy classic, "Blazing Saddles" with a supposed tie-in, a sitel and a "sitcom" bland with a little heart and no soul. "Saddles" was a controversial comedy, however, it's racist humor and pornographic comedy, which comes to mind "What fools have decided that it will make a great television show for Prime Time TV!" I said "supposedly", because one of the most memorable characters in the music There is no problem in this world of any TV show. Mail Brooks was not involved in the production of serial and it was the first time a long line of errors (in a related story, I recently found a series of TV shows about a clearance that was based on the "Clark" film. Do you see what? ??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Actually, before acting in his "real" acting, where he is playing a "G rating" Richard Pryor Among the other characters, most of the characters are copies of the characters of the film characters (if not, really bad): Jim is replaced by a similar character named The Waco Kid, which is a former Confederate soldier named Reb Jordan, who is fast with guns. Lillian von Schtupp is now a German dancer with a show dancer and a German Marlene Dietrich-type accent and personality, being a ripoff character in Bell Buzzer. Although it is much more similar in nature, the story of "bad guy" is in the story of Fern Malaga, who played by Nobel Wingham, who had told Harley Lama, if the rights to the name of the Warner Bros. are protected (see the triangle "Burning Saddles") and his son Curley ... What do I think Taggart? The story is a poor excuse for a limitation, much less pilot. Bert Mayer deals with the drunk boy and is the reason behind the out-of-control behavior that surrounds the city. Indeed, it is a story that tries to introduce all the letters of "series" and it does not focus on different and context, which will make it a "right" show. I really do not want to talk to it (and even if I wanted to) and initially it's Warner Bros. The studio was shot on the backlit and afterwards a sunny track has been added, so the show is set almost exactly "M * A * S * H" (a soft and dull "Sunny" that is similar to the series). Acting is so much, but a part that always laughs me, and in this way actor Rib Jordan often forgets his line and tries hard to remember them while trying to piece together a piece of the conversation. Haha The script is rather neutral and is trying to make racism more humorous than the film (Surprisingly, they use the word "n *** er" in a 22-minute episode on numerous occasions but rather for its time, and even today) and it becomes repetitive. <br /> <br /> If you ever get your hand in this invisible piece of SSSS ... very interesting novelty item, see it for a feeling of pilot viewing (on the collector's version of the legendary Saddles, God knows why). There, why not give yourself the first opportunity why the movie tie-in pilots never get windy.
