Please, even if you are in the worst mood, refrain from seeing this flick. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is anything right with this movie. I saw it at the friend's suggestion and I literally hugged my life 1 hour and 48 minutes. The sequence of poor performances, stupid aspects, weak stories and unfortunate steps - and when you combine it you get "double impact". Even the expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I learned a thing - never see Van Dam's action. They are pure waste of time!
