I think I saw such things before: college graduates they suck their life, that they do not understand their beautiful life, they are very good at all times. <br /> <br /> This movie is big chile and bite of truth from what I can do: they are actually the same plot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was < br /> <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but then again, I do not expect anything less. This movie was directed by the same person who pointed to Batman and Robin; <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict, it is 1 out of 10.
