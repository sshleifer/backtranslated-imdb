Stefan is an X-Con that Mary married five years ago. Their marriage lasted until Stefan was caught, and he offered to do a courier job. Stephen's job is to get a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which is easy to go. <br /> <br /> Germany's Stefan has sold a girl to Strefflab owner from Bosnia. Steven dislikes what he saw and decided to help Eli outside his hardship. Eli's father went to Sweden during the war, so Eli now lives with Stefan of Sweden. Eli promises to help her father find out to talk to Stefan of the past, no matter what. Finally, the whole situation seems more complicated than Stephen's return to Sweden. <br /> <br /> This image does not seem to be suitable for the general category of general Sweden because of American American citizenship. Regina Lund and Seychelia Bergwist make it an average, though the effect makes the movie a bit more. See for yourself and see it for yourself. <br /> <br />
