A terrible amateur movie director (not a toad sheet), his new friends and sisters explored a cave. Friends and sisters fall and rescue. Meanwhile, a gang of fearsome acting girls is defending their 'turf'. Whatever the hack is. This film is very bad by using the word and I very few .. It is good. The ridiculously painful unreasonable, "action" is simply sad. Now I have seen some violent 'horror' films in my time and failed to become witch in my view of watching low-budget movies, yet I still cry openly for anyone who likes to sit like this. Just for you among the most harsh maschocists. But the rest ran faster !! <br /> <br /> My grade: F.
