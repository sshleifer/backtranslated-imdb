This is not really very interested. The story is quite awesome and intolerable. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, the bill is good. Then it was quite uncomfortable. The team does not fit the role, he comes across as a smug self-inflated ass & Pruitt Tyler Vince is completely unconvincing as a trumpet player. As an idealist film and as a musician, it was a little offended after seeing it. There are no scenes of playing with the 1900 practice or his fellow band partner, he is completely self-motivated. I have trouble getting involved with this type of character, maybe I see the wrong movie. If there is no true emotion for your life or have knowledge about any music, please be happy with the suspicion of unbelief and see this waffle.
