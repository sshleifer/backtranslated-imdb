Movies and acting are not bad and J. Hernandez is doing well with Calita Brigante, but the film forgets that it can be a preview of the hit movie. The makers of this prick did not see the original Carlito wax clearly or were not concerned about at least continuity. This movie is an estimate that the original movie has already produced some history for us and the origin of this movie should be started or at least directed towards it. Originally, Carlito's closest friend did not make a look in this film, even without mentioning them. Originally Pankanga, Louis Guzman, in the film but he plays a completely different character. The original was performed in 1975 and the estimation was performed in 1969-70. Considering this movie less than 5 years ago, do you think Carlito's longtime friends will not make any appearance? Originally, Carlito was released from prison after spending 5 years in prison. Only the last few months of the prickle! *** Semi Speiler *** We know from the very beginning that Carlito has spent five years in prison, so the prickle gives us the Hollywood best wishes, it is an insult to the intelligence of the original fans. What will happen to Gayle? It is a lack of continuity that directs the film to release videos directly.
