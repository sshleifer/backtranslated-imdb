I saw this picture on the history channel (in 2006). After all, I realize that this is not a documentary - it's a drama. However, one might expect that at least critical "events" that the story is set can be based on actual events. Reagan shot and other characters were real people. The movie got that right. From there, reliance on fast decays of reliance. I did not hear this movie before watching it. After being a TV reporter during this incident, I am surprised that I did not hear of Richard Dreyfas painter Hugh's malicious behavior. The whole nation "I am in control ...", but Darfus Hugh blames an operating cabinet and is personally privately held. Seeing this movie I started researching on the Internet and found that most of the transcripts of these audio tapes and Citation Room conversations were pretending to re-present the film. Incredibly, many of the chaos in the White House, Secret Service, etc. to show the original "true" of the film - and the illogical behavior of the country's leadership and driving the world near the end of nuclear war - is a mistake. They did not happen! Sure, there are internal conflicts. Heig makes mistakes, performance in his press room is historically tragic and he is "tough". But there is nothing near the visible scene in the film. There are a number of serious errors listed, but a comparable comparison of recorded and written records and the imagination of this movie asks what the producers are trying to accomplish. Enlightened? Do you know? Entertainment? I believe they failed on three fronts. Objectives are difficult to understand, but serious questions should be asked about what such a ruthless innovation was. And, as my favorite history channel "Relay to Real" follow-on documentary, the central focus of the film - often there is no mention about the administration events on the shooting day. So, without the viewers were left to do much research - if any - help from the network.
