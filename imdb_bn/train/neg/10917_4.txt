I was a fan of Colombo, especially on the rainy Saturday, and after Fahrenheit 451, it was fun to see Oscar Verner, but this episode was very short. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and today's modern detective shows can be estimated in advance even before years. But the crazy sofa design and "modern" electronics equipment and, of course, were fun to have fun in the modern industry to sell compulsory subbarite fun. High-Tech House makes fun of the Disney version of Jateson or Tomarland and thinks of the "Wei-Out Gizmos" inventive writers. <br /> <br /> Play out if you are sunny outside, because Columbo episode is very good. Yet, these episodes are being broadcast, we should only be thankful for the TV.
