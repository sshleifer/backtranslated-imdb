After Highlander 2 (which I still refuse), I think it is impossible to signal a cry that could cause me to cry because it was very bad. I was roasted. I like the original Wargames, however, this movie is wrong with details about computer details and original movies. The original Wargames had some hack that worked at least. The computer did not know anything about the computer without using any word processor about anyone who wrote this movie. I even suspect he saw the original movie. Acting is not even believable. Please save yourself, in no circumstances do you see this movie? I do not know if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can not close the TV. This movie will ruin your life.
