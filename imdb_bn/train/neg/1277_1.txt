This movie still mocked my bones in my mind. This movie was not as bad as a budget, it worked badly, etc. Although it certainly had everything. The problem of this movie is deliberately trying to disturb the viewers and do it with great success. What do I want to know, is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely scary, but it's not supposed to be a horror movie. I could see the first segment trying to be awesome and fail, but what is the second segment? It's just boring. The third segment likes to see an artists film, which surprisingly produces a lot of painful segments. This is a persecution that this movie is not less than 100, so get your vote (1/10) people! I know some people have given this good review, but, well, they're trying hard to cheat you. Trust me, it's impossible to love this movie. The only feature of this movie is an amazing life-enhancing effect: It looks like you've only watched the film for years after just passing the first half hour.
