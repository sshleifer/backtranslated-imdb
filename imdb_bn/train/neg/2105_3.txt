Bell Lugosi is an intelligent insane scientist who uses Bride Woo Orchid to steal the life essence for elderly wife. Smile of this photo is smiling !! Many freaks, plus many padding and no plot makes this film seem a nightmare. I like how all types of pieces usually fall together at the end of Hollywood fashion. The story is never interesting, and you feel helpless when you watch the watch. <br /> <br /> I usually score Borick's flicks as low as this, but the midget adds enough laziness and entertainment to earn some points.
