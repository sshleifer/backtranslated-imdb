I have seen four films in this series. More and strays from each book book This is still the worst. My problem is that it does not follow the book titled in any way! Director and producer should be given a name other than "Loving Joy of Love". Similar to the book, the only thing about this film is the name of some of the characters (Wiley, Miss, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's name / age / pregnancy mistake. There is no place in the whole story line book. <br /> <br /> I found this disagreeable disagreement that I created a movie under the title of Jeanette Okay, her book and her fans, which is not right in any way. The music is very loud Actors are not believable - they have a lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> This may be if you want a good family movie. It is clear. If you expect a narrow version of the book but do not see it. I hope this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If more movies were made, I'd like to have Michael Landon, Jr. and others close to the real plot and story lines. The book is excellent and, closely followed, will do great movie!
