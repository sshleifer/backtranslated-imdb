In the US, you should consider the following when evaluating documentaries that focus on the relatively small groups of ultra-right wings and conservative groups. The United States has a population of 27 million population and a complex democracy and its expectation and its expectations and willingness to support human rights, which are its failures and negative aspects. Of course, it is expected that the extreme right-wing groups and highly conservative groups are in numerical numbers, but they are very small and isolated compared to the size of its population. The right-wing group has the right to per-capita basis in Europe, Britain and even Australia, per capita, the actual size of the Neo-Nazi group in Australia is higher than that of the United States. As representative of America's society, it is impossible to embarrass and embarrass the American public and their level of controversy by educating American society by deliberately and deliberately presenting this ultra-right wing group of psychology. By GreenStreet, deliberately small and disconnected groups select an image of America to create an image on the opposite end of the spectrum that is an abusive and deliberate sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to enlarge and fold the view of people who provide shelter to these subconscious and mortgages, hating the way of America and the way of life according to the consciousness of fashionable and imagined idealistic left wing ideology. This film was not created for profit, which is not about the American society and the human status to take the truth forward. Greenstreet can create documentaries that monitor the ultra-right wing conspiracies, the Military Industrial Complex, but fails to present intelligent and equitable real debate, which offers alternative alternative solutions for the failure of a vivid democracy. The movie show is open to anti-American support in this trash. His worst anti -USA trash is shameful SENSATIONALISM.
