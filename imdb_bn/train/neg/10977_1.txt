I live in Utah where this movie was created and I really do not want to do it. This is one God terrible flick. I really try and support independent films but Anthony is involved in this scandal and it is a scandal: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie can not do anything to drive this curse. Actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to this style, but instead he has smiled again from a tired movie. I look very badly, looking at bad films and being victim of uncertainty, it's too much. <br /> <br /> I can remember a scene especially at the end of Flickr where the whole scene is lit with car headlights. Now some might say that it was an effect that was used to create mood and excitement, but sadly this was the budget shoe budget of the movie. For the movie that claims itself to be scary, a viewer will see that he will be under severe pressure to look for a real cow, while on the other hand, without the color scene of the gourd syrup and red food. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing to reduce this film is the lack of pacing and character development, the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and parents must definitely track the boniser colleague before the scheduled time. Get their kids back This idea does not bug me, however, I am not really believable that when two main characters, those who have lost both children, will have time to come out with each other. It can be done in such a short time that it is unlikely, my first priority should be to bring my daughter back and at least inform the woman before she goes out with her. <br /> <br /> My last point .... and I will not catch it against Kelly, but the movie has shot entirely in the annoying, passionate video and the style on the film is moving away from any period of time. Although the film was given a million dollar makeover and reinstated the story and the annoying act and the lame could not keep the film alive. My only hope is that Brett Kelly will have to abstain from creating a seagull, which has been published on its website, a seagull which was half written in one meeting. <br /> <br /> Lord, help us all.
