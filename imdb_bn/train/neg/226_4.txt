Andy McDowell is as beautiful as 40-eese woman, whose late lead led her to a serious relationship at the beginning of a few young people and later with the long-term girlfriend of two long years. <br /> <br /> A gigolo / heartfelt young man, gold digger, "girl friend", dead-set to stop this "stupid relationship", their friend's "helper" (who has been blindly blinded by these gigolos) clever <br /> <br /> The brief succession of the circumstances is absolutely ridiculous, except for the incredible scenery, in the hope of the hope of a sweet love story. An unintended vibration left on the left side - these things can not happen! I have warned the high expectant viewer of this movie, except for the details of mountain-hunter, most of them (like me) will be very disappointed. Scales from 1 to 10, this is weak with me 4. There are so many good elements in your time that you do not have time.
