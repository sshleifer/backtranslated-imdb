Those who think about watching this movie have already got some trouble through their head. This film has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (you thought) It's another B, I mean E-grade movie is a bunch horny thirteen in some sex scenes Before they were seen before their spleens get a splendid tree splattered. It's not scary, funny or fun. If you really like poor stuff without plots, but see the cabin footer, at least the director did not sleep in the middle of the handle by managing this cone. Only if you do nothing in your life, and the only thing on TV that is oprah is to see it. Crying on the viewfree TV.
