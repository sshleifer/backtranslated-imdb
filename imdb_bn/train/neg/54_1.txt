The only good thing in this movie was a shot of Goldie Haun standing in his little French cut bikini children's pants, and he struggled to move dozens more unmarried women to the top of his scimpy little cotton, when he did jiggle and queued. Ooooof! Nina Hartley who rivals her lights. When I came out of the movie when I was fourteen, that shot almost killed me. After watching the other day on TV, my soul survived naughty Roldex, where he actually reminded me slowly and slowly slowly through the middle of the scene slowly, gradually and slowly. Was between '80. Kurt Russell will have a fun life.
