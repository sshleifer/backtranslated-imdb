This film was on screen as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. <br/> <br /> I really do not like it for the film. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that will take time for development, movies to publish characters and stream stories. Stability is good. But this picture was just a little slow. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Two completely different people had feelings of tension between them, really misfits, come together in a very irrational way. We had flexible moments and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I liked the setting and the way it was shot. It was clustrophobic and monochrome and it adds close to the film and strengthens the curiosity of the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not understand at all. What was it all was the point?
