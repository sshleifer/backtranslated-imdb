I like movies I love independent efforts and main studio productions. I love movies with adults and I love those who are involved in the unknown. I love the drama, comedy, action-adventures, science fiction, mystery, western, and style without fear. I love those who speak English as well as foreign films. I love good movies and even love bad guys, because almost never a movie fails to entertain or entertain. "Even cowgirls get blues." <br /> <br /> <br /> When I appeared "Cowgirls" on a late night, I joined nearly 10 visitors. I'm less than half, I'm left alone. Soon I could not bear the hassle of facing my eyes, and I went away as well. On this day "cowgirls" I just left out of the movie that remains still. <br /> <br /> I lacked this inconsolable, zero, trashy, pointless film, or lack of freedom to release how well. Not to say that it is one of the worst movies of all time, immoral and ineligible to every level. It tries to be tricky, but her idea of ​​feminism seems frustrating spiritual. It tries to be fun, but its humorous fat and deserves cringe. This is one of the few movies that drives your own god to disobey, so that you represent the titles in a way that rebels against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, then see "Waterworld", "Esther" but something other than that. New "Without Alexander." If you choose between it, then read a book instead.
