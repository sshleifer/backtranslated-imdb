Just do not bother. I thought I would watch a movie with great film and action. <br /> <br /> After the catchy startup, it's becoming boring and scary. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and it gets lost due to all the speed because it slows down the speed. In the end it gets better but does not really get great. I think the director took this movie very seriously. If you do not care about the plot in a movie, at least you want some nice steps. I dozed closer to the middle / main part Ratings 3/10 <br /> <br /> Durbabular.
