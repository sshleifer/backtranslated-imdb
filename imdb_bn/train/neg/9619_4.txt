If you can believe it, * another * leakyide cabin * another * * after one of the number of deadly accidents, * one of the other * leakyide cabins claim their number. Less and I see, a psycho wearing a masked hockey mask, a psycho (a cheap paper in it) keeps one on one by one. This mechanical 'Friday 13th' designer has achieved a slight ugly degree as one of the first digital shot features, but where interesting information is finished and remains, it is a predefined, sub-performance amateur production and repetitive BOM-MIC intruder. A last-second twist does little to lift spirits, and 'Memorial Day' drags a lake best and almost forgets. The only one for the insane slasher collector.
