It would be a good edit if it was a watchable Hollywood mediocre. It usually depends on the American thrilling plot - "Who is overwhelming." The actress is less than the average, but the detective's shiny look is most responsible for the film's best actor and film tension. The film was completely rolled by blank video and sound shots and it mostly looks like raw film material. Above all, if you do not see a movie like watching a movie, it shows as a movie project, a movie to see it. I guess this film would be enough to say, all else could really pull enough tension enough enough.
