(Will I ever learn when?) NPR's provocative critic I think that this Turkish was another citizen. <br /> <br /> I will admit: The setting, probably New York City, was so inferior and unexpected. I have reminded that the 70's were a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles. And all smoking! If the characters are cheap, then it is successful. <br /> <br /> To have a movie work (at least, in my easy conjecture), at least one sympathetic character should be. Just came to Nad Biti, and I could not wait to finish Nikki. If a hazard shot hits McKay, it may most likely show apathy. <br /> <br /> I could not remember when I hated a film firmly. I think I do not dig the "art" flicks which are a barbarian. Well good
