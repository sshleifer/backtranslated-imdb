This movie shows us something original. Every idea or (action) scene can be found in many movies released earlier. Fantastic Nick is completely plain here. Even Will Patton is not good at calm and evil. Mr. Duvall is okay, but there is a very small portion. So Angelina, so how can we determine her new acclaimed Stardom? Overall, there are many characters, so that nobody and nothing is specially detailed. This movie is easy to forget. Very bad, what do you think?
