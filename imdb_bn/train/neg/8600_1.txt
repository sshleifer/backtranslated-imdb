All in low budget history. This movie will be the worst. Indeed, some ridiculous aspects of the film, but in general it was simply horrific. I just can not figure out what a person can do to run a bunch of slugs. I mean they will be one of the slowest animals on the planet. The only part of this movie is to stop a guy's finger-slips. This was rather fun.
