For romantic comedies, after the end of the experience, I often judge the quality of the film based on my eyesight. Unfortunately for the "wedding date" I can only rate the image with 4 images in 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film's premiere, "The Pretty Omman", plays the opposite role of "Darkmatt" Nick, a high-priced male escort who has rented Debra Character Cats to take her sister to England for marriage. Develop a romantic relationship between potential sponsors and clients. But the dialogue was compulsory and artificial. And there was not enough romantic sparks between Nick and Cate's relationship. <br /> <br /> In a helpful introduction, Emmy Adams stood as a cat of Kat. Whenever Amy came to the screen, she worked as a spark plug and catalyst for the power of film. Perhaps the role of Kat, if Ady Adams was played, then the film could have more mobility. But when it started, instead of reaching Clinics, I was at least trying to show this Vietnam that the film had some real feelings and romance.
