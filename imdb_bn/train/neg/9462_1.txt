Inappropriate The PG rating of this movie is still a big mistake by MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-133 but gets this movie a PG? Please Parents can not be fooled, it is a big mistake to take children of primary school in this film. Many times I thought myself uncomfortable because the laugh was not inappropriate for the kids, because it was completely blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But beside that, Hat-In-Hat is still a terrible movie. Casting and overall appearance of the film is only reserved for the poor. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always preferred (or disgusting) Alex Beldwin both are good in their role though Preston is very nice for such a role. Kids conditional actors and it shows, especially with the Dakota Fanning. The only human aspect of the fanning film that keeps me watching and does not throw things in the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention a big talking cat in this movie? Mike Meyer is absolutely helpless. I do not like him as a voice of Shake, and I really believe that the mother should never allow children to film the state again. The image of the cat's picture is Fat Bastard and Austin PowerSchees. At last the cat could not come, she could have stayed away, but she came, even if one day, she wasted my life 82 minutes, personal anger and 82 minutes of conflict. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
