This is not a child movie !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like "bad acid trip" for kids under 5 years old. For a month, my 4-year-old will ask from time to time, "Why the rabbit was bleeding from his face" or "bulldozer why did all the bones bury?" (And that it was not the worst). We've been close to about 1/2 hours but have been harmed. Very shocking, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he forgot about the things piled up completely. Anyone who has to take this movie to the market in the market, they should be charged. ... (Omit me, my conscience is clear.)
