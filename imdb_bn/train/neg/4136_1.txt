I've read the reviews before watching this movie, and I did not believe them. I love crap movies and I expected this to be one average. It was not. This picture makes the camp look great like blood 1 and 2. The film has bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing tales, bad makeup- and it bothers me so I turned it off. Even nudity was even garbage! Do they have a budget for this photo? I do not think they did. You can tell if you like this image in 5 minutes or not. If you want to see a good cherry poor film go toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I've seen and felt it on TV, so do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
