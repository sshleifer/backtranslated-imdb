I personally think this movie is terrible, first of all, it was very less objective, and provided a direction of debate. The only person said that he was present as a group coming from Billy Gram Revival. Secondly, it was widely deviated from what he (Jesus) talked about about how violent Christians used to talk about it and to show the scene from Mel Gibson's "Passion". Eventually the director knows the former Principal of Conservative Private School in an interview, and tried to trap him in teaching children to believe. Oh and techno music make it hard to just watch the movie.
