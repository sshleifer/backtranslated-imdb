It is a very stupid and a little watched movie about the West Indies slavery and it has played Paddy from the "SafeField" show! Patrick Warburton has made his film debut in this movie and he is remarkably thin here. Oliver Reid has received top billing but he is rarely in the film. Warburton plays a white slaves and shows the reason for all the young and horny wives of the rich man to confront him because they all want to have sex with him. Arthie Kitt is the owner of a bird and they have so much nudity in this picture. If it is not drunken orgies at bordello then its young spouse they are introduced with her. Then, at last, the slaves revolted and bloody positions remained closed. No real political message, like the film "Burn", but only another contrived plot device to remove the story. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest came back to the rest! I hope they got plenty of dough because this is the first film to be quite bad. Nudity keeps it observable and the lack of a word of harbarten makes it laughable. Very bad movie but I admit that I want to see a sigell.
