I think some films banned during movie cinema are actually very important and very good movies. I would like to claim that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies, sensors should consider a ban on movies that threaten your IQ and your proximity. If they do one of the first hidden films, then there will definitely be "strokes." This picture is horrible with a capital 'A'. This is the worst movie ever played by Bart Reynolds .... Many credits of credit for "Canonball Run II", "Cop and a Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" in his CV! <br /> <br /> The Waffer-Slim Story introduces us to a successful stock car Rasa Stoker S (Reynolds), a fast car and a man who quickly loves women. He stuck in a disgraceful contract with the unclear promutor Clyde Turtle (Ned Bati). For the contract he will do some derogatory promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, as a giant chicken-like dress. The mixture is thrown into the lass (Jim Nabours), the slow pace of S and Pembrook Finney (Lonnie Anderson), a bimbo with a brain, which is smaller than the impressive Ace by Ace. <br /> <br /> This low-grade garbage director, Niham, was previously a stuntman and made many films based on his ability to manage spectacular stunts and car chases / races. Some of these movies are OK, like "Hooper" and "Stants Unlimited", but with the "Stoker S" he reached the carrier Nadir. Characters are so stupid that actually you feel sad for their acting actors. Anderson is especially saddled with such a silly role that makes you grind your teeth with frustration. Humor is weak and infantile across, and stunts and race sequences are unmarkmarkable. Out of the closing credits (even among all Reynolds-Neham collaboration), it is usually unclear, which impresses that this film can not make it more fun. Significant levels of "Stroke S" are a stinker.
