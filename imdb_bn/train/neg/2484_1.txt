I still can not believe that Wes Craven is responsible for this shit. This movie is worse than "deadly friend". This plot is stupid, the actress is moderate and the movie is deadly intensely. I do not know why Wes Crowon disagrees with this unanimous composition and favorite (probably) Turkish in his "Last House on the Left" section. Do not make me wrong, I really like her few movies, but it was sitting in a real torture and watching this.
