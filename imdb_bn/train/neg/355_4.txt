Just because there is one of the movies that the first surprise to you is that when it came out it was in such a heavy center - with nothing special but efficient and with great support from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to become stupid until you've got a murderer with a radioactivity on his forehead, with Sun Connor's wife (usually a psychoanalytic and disrespectful cap capo) on his forehead and a child (a very small Scarlett Johansen) ) In the shock of a engrossed skinner. <br /> <br /> is a movie that might be seen probably on the plane and even once.
