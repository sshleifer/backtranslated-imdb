It was a nice concept and the scene was beautiful but where it ends. It seems like to fit a lazy set to set off the West. The plot is just made in some sense. There was enough letters and enough time to develop their personality. There were unnecessary things that were not related to the plot and it helped to make the story go further. There were long empty moments where the plot could be invented but used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more knowledge and guidance. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the welding was great in my opinion. If you are just watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you.
