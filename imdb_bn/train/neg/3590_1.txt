How can someone sink less when trying to recover an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you <br /> <br /> If you are looking for what you see for a good Star Trek show then do not see it. <br /> <br /> The hajj-pajj, the actors are weak in painting of their characters, and most of the design work uninterrupted dogs. <br /> <br /> Powerful captains to see, do not see here! Like a strong federation attitude? Forget about it here! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It just deteriorated from there. Not even the uniform match, for goodness. They are too small or too big, collar with their breasts and mixes with one and two Uniform Season 3G and DS 9 uniforms in the TNG seasons. Strong discipline and the origin of traditional production to none of this generation! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seems to improve a little with each season. OK, I take that back. Who unexpectedly uses CG? The designer of this event <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not be disturbed by this, it will make my Star Trek sense. Throwing in previous shades also can not save this disaster. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I started crying openly, probably my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost broken. That's bad.
