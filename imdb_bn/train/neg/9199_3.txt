Lin Holistar, a small town lawyer, travels to big cities beside a business involving his friend Johnny's death. (Yes, despite the well-known Christian name of the Linen woman, a man. Why was the name of John Wen's birth name "Merian"?) Holisten first believed that Johnny died in the accident, but soon said that Johnny was murdered. Further investigation has revealed corruption, criminality and electoral malignancy, which is associated with the boss Cameron, the leading light of the political machine in the city. <br /> <br /> Popular in 1941 Starting from the movie Nir's style It's not Despite its theme "A Man Man Beread", a light romantic comedy from crime crime. Holiste falls in love with Cameron's attractive daughter Saber, and the film then focuses more on her romance, such as the sensation material. <br /> <br /> If this image is simply a simple serious drama. One critic has said that John Wayne is not as believable as a lawyer, but he could not play cowboys in every film, and a strong critic of the organized crime force was perhaps better in his compass. I agree with that critic when he said that Wayne was no Cary Grant impersonator. The romantic comedy was not just up her street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors should act in some part of their claim, regardless of whether they are not on the road, and one of the big stars that worked for the Wayuu republic photos. No doubt they wanted to get more milestones than they could. <br /> <br /> She said, Kerry Grant himself could not work as a "A man bitrate" as a comedy. Her trick is not a reflection of talent; It is a reflection of the lack of content of this movie. Someone may suspect that if someone can develop a sense of humor, then some may laugh at it. The light-hearted tone of the film does not make it a successful comedy; It just prevents it from being taken seriously as something else. This is a movie which is not a fish, nor meat, bird or red red deer. 3/10
