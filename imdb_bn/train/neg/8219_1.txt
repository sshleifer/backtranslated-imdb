When I choose a movie, I always look at 2 people in the terrible section, so I picked five out of the eyes, I hated this photo and thought that there is no story line and in no way can you enjoy it, it seems to my skin That people like to watch movies that only encourage violence for hell, it was less budget and very rubbish! I think I can do myself well. I think this was the worst movie of my life and you would not be bothered to see that the camera was bad and the picture was not bad and the word was not up to scratch, I thought it was a little like a chip rope to close the ballet. Works and it does not work on it that it was fairly fatal.
