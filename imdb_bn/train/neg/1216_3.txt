The suspense movie genre really dives it. Big problem incompleteness. I understand that you have to create a difficult situation that will create suspicions and intense feelings about what is going to happen next, but this film was expected and it is not believable. I have seen that I see this kind of movie, as long as I tell the actors to move away from the danger. Endless bad decisions are just borders from the common fool. If they take time to make it more realistic, I have enjoyed it. That said, you might be better off staying away from this one.
