Songwriter Robert Taylor (as Terry) "Shocked, Slap-happy" and one of the oldest is not yet seen in the spirit of Narva Shearer (like Consuelo). "During the rainy season, he makes the sun shine," Mr. Taylor explains. But whenever Mr. Sheare goes, Mr. Taylor gets a stick on his neck. Finally, in the Palm Beach Casino Shearer often, Taylor announces "I love you!" Shearar was pushed by George Sanders (as Tony) as he was involved with. However, for a gambling loan settlement, Sherora called Taylor "her cardboard lover", so that Mr. Sanders can be jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this film invites clear and appropriate three-word reviews: "His Cardboard Movie". This is the most notable for Shearer, the world's biggest star in "The Women" (1939), from "Who Gets Slapped" (1924, playing other consulo). To be justified, perhaps like the Shi'er film MGM, such viewers wanted to see the audience. However, the part is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Good in Padded and Powered, Taylor and Shearer "The Accept" (1940). If shearar continued, she might have been a better actress than "leading lady"; Apparently, he was no longer interested, and certainly did not require the money. A great view of the Teretta, when Christina Rossetti's "When I Die, My Beloved", while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, managed by George Kikor. <br /> <br /> **** Her Cardboard Girlfriend (6/42) George Cooker ~ Narma Shear, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
