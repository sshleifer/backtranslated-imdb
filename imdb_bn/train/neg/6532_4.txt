This film has started with the people of the world who discovered that their rockets on Mars have not been lost but they are being transferred to space near the planet. When it was recovered, crew members were sick, one alive and two missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, the set was pretty good, then I saw a movie movie. Plus, in the strange efforts of realism, the production uses a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this amazing invention was only on the page of Mars when the movie looked pretty cheap and the intensity of the symptom made my eyes bloody - it was bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had a good message about some interesting plots and space travel. For the lovers of the genre, it is a good price to see. For others, you can only find the whole thing forged - look for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> This is not particularly a good Sci-Fi film according to today's standards, compared to movies at that time, it stacks well. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the film, then pay attention to Dr. Tr√©man. He saw the wonderful image of Dr. Quest from "Johnny Quest" cartoon! Plus, he sounds and works a lot like that.
