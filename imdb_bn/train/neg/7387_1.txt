DVD was a joke, for the first few minutes the audio was horrible in sync, and Segalus was not afraid of his voice! Poor! When audio sync was good in 5 minutes, poor plots, lines, and actors would have to get another job because the film business should not have any of them. <br /> <br /> Some good movies in Segel were the last one joke in the first days and he and he should be embarrassed for the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Segal manages this, he comes back to meet another team to listen better, because there is no talent in him so much. <br /> <br /> This film is totally embarrassing for everyone involved in its production and disrespects those who have seen it. I closed it in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I want to get back the money to Block Booster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
