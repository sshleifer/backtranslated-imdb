When I heard such praise about this game, I watched over it when I leaned towards the wire. I do not see how the women and their "struggle" by focusing on this matter. I think if you have interest in the personal parts of a woman and how it affects their lives, it is for you. Otherwise, it is rather dull and annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, so, it's not just a guy "not getting it".
