This movie does not reflect Japanese culture for many years living in Japan, and it is not near to explain what Gishara is going to do. Unfortunately, a great opportunity to get closer to the wide audience of Japanese culture's broader audience has been missed, and Kyoto's Geisha gene genes help in destroying a country born from Samurai's country. Americans are shown around Japan when some of the most harmful moments in the movie. Geisha's dance was not pure. There was far more use of Chinese music. A minor but necessary description: The incense stick is not seen in the proper use. Sakura scene was almost ugly ugly! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were quite convinced as a Japanese person.
