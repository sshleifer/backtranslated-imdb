I went to see this picture yesterday and although I did not have high hopes for this film, I was very disappointed! I can not really believe that I spent my 96 minutes watching this picture ... it was bad !!! The story was disrespectful and the act was terrible (though it had a big name like Uma Thurman). This film rely heavily on its special effects ... but they have not had any effect on me personally. I honestly did not see the intentional ID and I strongly warn against showing this movie. This is the total waste of money and you will only be disappointed later. My advice is to save, save money, treat yourself, watch this film and not see it ... you can express regret for it!
