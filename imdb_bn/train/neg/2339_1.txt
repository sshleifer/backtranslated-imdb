This virtual movie shows more than an original movie on MVV's music-clips. There is no real story and when you are playing the movie, ask yourself: "What's going to happen?"; But nothing will happen. Story around Eric Klayk, a disappointed writer, the only good thing. Other people do not seem to have anything in common: then why do they unite them in a movie. With music you can watchable the worst movie. Most people watch it when I open the tap and water comes out of Bac music, but it is not a movie. Before conducting a film, the director must learn to write a script for 100 minutes or more.
