No, I'm not kidding. If they ever offer a film idea, they should be expelled from the studio. I'm serious Their movies are the same, and they only travel to foreign locations, their problems are easily corrected, hope to be popular and get new lovers. Think about it. If you ever see a movie that they have played with a different plot then contact me and tell me its name. These "movies" are bad on the TV and going to other countries. There is a reason not to go to the movie theater. I'm sure that they were really young and some o.k. Movies, some studio boss bought all their rights to do 15 years or more, so that what they are now, 17, they can make movies in other countries if they want to use the studio money. Suggest me, stay away from Mary Kat and Ashley! It's good for yourself!
