A great opportunity for rock music artists to create an interesting movie about Indie and indie managers. It could have been a decent film if it was John Lee's tragic past and how he suffered his mental anguish. Instead, it is a ridiculous effort to identify John Livien's life with John Linon. John Livienne was the wife of Swiss mother John Lennon and wanted to be as strong and profitable as Lenin. Rather than focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and having the ability to tie himself up to learn something about his life, it seems to be Lenan's heir, confused and addictive soul, who should be seen as a god instead. People I'm a John Lennon fan and this movie reminds me of another "crazy person" who is obsessed with Lennon's killer Mark David Chapman. Lennon is a man who is murdered by someone due to an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we have to remember it? John Lennon has given much to the world about his music and honesty, and I was refrained from seeing another boring person like Lennon's original character, and his beautiful contributions to the world were not shown. Yokoho earnestly commemorates John Lennon's memory and created a monument to Central Park, giving his fans the opportunity to honor them and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to try suicide. I found Lennon's memories this so annoying and disrespectful. He was a man of peace, who died cruelly foolish and such violence near this site felt like a terrible wound rehearsal for Lennon Fan. It completely destroyed the movie for me. It may be a decent movie, but it leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family stay in peace and should not be reminded of his harmful murder by this irresponsible film.
