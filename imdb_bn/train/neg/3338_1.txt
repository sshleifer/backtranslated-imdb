It takes 9 years to complete this picture. I think that in 9 years some would say, hey, this movie is terrible. I saw porn movies playing well. The story is tired and played. Abuse child turns into serial killer How to do something new for a change How did the abused child turn into a florist? At least that's a new twist. Why do everyone think that they can be directors with camera and movie ideas (especially the horoscope movie ideas)? I was stuck for 9 years to finish this film. That shows the firmness and the spirit. The next time they can focus on this kind of drive, they can focus on a good script. If you want to see an unsuccessful test to make indie film from a writer / director from Michigan but see a minute hate. If you want a good movie about Michigan writer / director Stick with Evil Dead
