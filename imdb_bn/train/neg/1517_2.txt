In the headline I write that the story is ridiculous. Below I'll tell you and say, my modest opinion is to destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> Cree and Dance are working on them, and it's not their best work, it's okay. Cast the rest, though, is really doing a poor job. You think, this does not blame the actor completely. The problem is that Chess and Dance are the only characters that can give even depth to the movie even smallest. There is a small room in the movie to create any depth among all other characters, or the character is so cliche that it does not matter how tough the actors are. <br /> <br /> The director's Se7en is complex, but just looking at the direction, I think he works well. <br /> <br /> But the story These are two types of scripts that are bad in two ways. Firstly it's a bad movie script. Characters shallow (except for gaire and dance letters), villains clich√©s and character actions are completely unbelievable. Also, the authors must have an agenda where they want to bring back our opinions and policies for hundreds of years. This is a type of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, despite the price they have paid in the price. This is a kind of movie that says that only the lines should be punished without justice, judge or jury, just in every form of sexual harassment. And of course, according to the movie, all sexually explicit sexuality in the missionary position by the married couple is sex. So, if you are going to film in school and an example is needed a bad script, or if you want to boost your writing script and boost an ego. See it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie
