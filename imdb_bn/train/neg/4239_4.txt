It was better than the average film I think, it's just for cable. I hope to have something like bad effects in classics such as Chess Meldrum and Christmas Rush or First Diary / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> Cast was well selected ... I especially liked the Living Legend Swat Commander on the stern pressure. It was so fortunate that the band of the brand was good for it to reconsider. Producers and designers did their homework because they saw the scenes and shots they saw in those days in 1997. So, if you get the chance to watch this movie, and I'm sure that since FX will reinstate everything 50 times ... take two hours and enjoy it.
