This image is notified as a cute romantic comedy. It's not romantic and it's certainly not an effective comedy. The misfortune of the far-flung character, "Tom", the other is a totally embarrassing catastrophe. We see Tony Colette's only skill and the happy look of Paltrow with frequency. Overall, will be avoided!
