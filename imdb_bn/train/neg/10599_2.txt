** Spinners ** ** <br /> <br /> The government has continued to develop Universal Solaris program, now known as Unisol. The soldiers are now strong and able to take more damage than ever before. But the government is getting reduced, the project has been threatened and supercomputer among everyone has been threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his safety. He started to run UniSul and run and run the Maya. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is almost one thing. Choreography war. The story is bad, and soon all fights are sinking. Whatever, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it does not make fun of a war where you know it is an integral part of Naturally you are sure that the hero will win, but you still want to fight between two equal fighters in the fight. One is inseparable and can not lose. Then the war just became a tool to extend time. You wait until the final battle when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unexpected enemies. To make my views even more subtle, a great and sure sign of a bad movie is how hard women are. Well, there really are not many things in them, because most of the letters are males (though at least one female is Unisole), but almost every woman needs to show a bra at least once. Women get along with this, but we pass through a strip club (less to use the computer) with more undressed women. At this moment the story does not give anything and the teenager's adolescents have to try to please the audience. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, boring fight. Not too much, no less Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
