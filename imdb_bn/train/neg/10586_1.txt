This is a good informative movie on PBS frontline vein. The problem is that the Frontline has already made this piece and El Paul Bremer has come to say about his story. Director of the film Charles Ferguson - Until a former think tank won the tank, the more troubled, the occupation was war supporters until the south. What will he think? <br /> <br /> The Poland invasion goes very well until it is objectionable by the Nazis of Poland. And how does this picture feel - apologize for occupying the war instead of rebuilding it. <br /> <br /> Ferguson thinks that the war can be run more well - just like a war can be good.
