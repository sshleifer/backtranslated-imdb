"Ambassad" is a common action flick. It's a lot worse than normal. One man walks on the other side with a machine gun shining. The other person burns a round, and a fire that burns on it causes a big fire to burn from the throat. Guess who is the good guy. Duh Such as through and through "ambassad". Not good movies, not good movies, not a good movie, "Ambassador" with the cast of B-movie veterans, it fails at all levels, going through mechanical motion even though they know they are the actual victims. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
