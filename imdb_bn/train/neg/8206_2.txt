I like this film to be less tolerant with my very favorite actor James Spadar. It was not. After the first half an hour, I saw the rest with my remote control so that fast forward is ready. So trite, so ideally, one knows what each scene is going to happen. Can even predict the word of dialogue for the word This is a movie that makes one scratch more and says, "Was this movie ever made?" In an effort to say positive things, I will add that there are some light recreational special effects. However, if you have seen 5Sai / Fi movies, or if you are over 9 years old then please yourself and avoid it.
