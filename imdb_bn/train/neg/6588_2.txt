The following movies have most of the burning problems: 1) lots of checkies. Seriously, terrible "twists" everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The details jump around time, which would be better to do well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Falcon characters that are not completely stable or very well do not change for any reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big one: Great job. From the top of almost every person. <br /> <br /> Some of the best points from the picture below are: 1) Leadership looks very good. <br /> <br /> I saw this, there are only two types of people in this movie: a) People can sit for 90 minutes because people can lead lead. <br /> <br /> b) Those who often think of themselves, "I like Hollywood's Drake Rife with Cleches and Acquisition, but only if I can see it in Korean ..." There are many good Korean movies, Why waste time with garbage?
