I grew up with the 'Superman 2' theater version ("S2T") and a kid, I loved it more than Part 1 because it was not just Superman and three superman-type villains, it started with a lip? ? Superman Conversion and Rescue Scene Best Clark Kent Children and Superman did not have to wait for the screen to appear, as in I section. Now as an adult, I can see how the powerful fell with S2T (see: My review.) I always back - the story of how they fired unknowingly and unjustly to the original director and Richard Donner from second phase. (It was a rare, then there would be two separate films together to make a film, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' for example 2 and 3.) Unfortunately, Richard Donner's Cut (or "S2RD") I'm still completely It can not recommend. Has gone, the Great Superman changes scene, the entire Paris Rescue was, as part of the first part of S2T I had a wonderful repeat. Actually, they all wrote this: "Superman before?" In S2RD. Part I or S2T did not have special effects, but S2RD, they were mostly unselfish ridiculous ?? Like Loose falling from the daily Planet window. I acknowledge that some new scenes have worked and those who have picked up welcomed the departure of any scenes in the "honeymoon suit". Overall, if you grow up on S2T, and you like it as a child ?? I'm not nitpicking as an adult, you'll absolutely see S2RD as it's a brand-new childhood experience with almost a dozen new new scenes. (Spoiler Alert) Unfortunately, the worst change ends: strange memories kiss from S2T has also ended with 'I'. It's not just a lazy, not a pair of valve, why does not that happen, why does not Clerk get back to that diner. And does he "give up time" for the competition?
