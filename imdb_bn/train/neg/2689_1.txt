Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hate "September 11". These pictures were bad on a common basis. The exception of the Alejandro Gonzalez Innerruta Segment, which was the most effective and straightforward, small film was the best annoying and worst offensive. The worst I thought was the provocative segment of Yusuf Shahin, where he compared the American soldiers with the suicide bombing of Palestine, even fighting for greater reasons for suicide bombs so far. The segment was completely closed and the lack of any punishment for the shadow, my time and the waste of patience. It was good to guess 11 different directors from different countries to express their opinion in the tragedy, but in fact, it was wasted.
