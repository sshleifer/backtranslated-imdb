I always liked the bill because of its great script and letters, but recently I think it has become a mental kind of soap. If you look at promotional pictures / posters of bills, you will now see two officials kissing / kissing or doing something for friendship, but promotional images of the bill will show some of the offense before it happens. This proves that it has changed much as an average type of television soap from absolutely amazing police drama. When I see it, I think I see a police version of Cornish Street or something similar. I have to say that I still like the bill because I'm interested in police work and similar things, but I really miss the bill that was used in the world. I want to rate it as 2 to 10 because you have to admit that this bill was completely destroyed by the acceptors. <br /> <br /> Both of them have gone for script and characters, most of the great characters have gone (even though there is still a bit to remember) and I'm not saying that the new characters are poor or not because they are definitely not, There is a lack of tough appearance, personality and script lines. All of the old letters were used because most of the newcomers involved in the problem of folly and family problems. <br /> <br /> One of the only television programs on television this day, the bill will always be an interesting thing to watch, but I say it has lost its many uniqueness (if it has the correct spelling) and now it's a terrible, untrue television Be classified as soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended for better sunset about police officers involved in stupidity - 2/10
