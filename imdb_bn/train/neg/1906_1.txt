They played it on the July 4 Twilight Zone Marathon and it's hands down, I've seen the worst Twilight Zone episode. It has completely gone out of sync with the rest of the series. Although the Twilight Zone is a remarkable series and many episodes suddenly end up being prophetic, it has completely moved from place to place. Compare it to legends like "Stop at Willabby" or "Midnight Sun" and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Booster Keaton has done that with such terrible stuff, and honestly, one of its historical comedy tricks will stoop on this episode. Although he seems to have tried a bit, he still needed money ... and there is no explanation.
