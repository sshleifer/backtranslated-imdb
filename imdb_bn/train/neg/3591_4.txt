First off, tell me that I'm a great believer in Fanpro stuff. I can see it as a way to continue the long program after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are an example of excellent efforts. So there is a soft spot for my fanfood stuff, which means that I usually ignore what I badly slate. <br /> <br /> So ST: HF Well, the best thing is to stop first. Enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and, in most cases, the various ships crew seem to have a good time with their role. Later, the effects are not bad for Home-Brew's efforts, you really have nothing to fool. The story is not too bad. Not particularly innovative, but there are substantial elements and at least ongoing story-stories. <br /> <br /> But there are a lot of errors. <br /> <br /> First off, although they are quite clearly in order to rip-off the Star Trek footage, set backdrip, music and effects, they do not rush for any reason to create any other scientific-music music scores. From the alliance, the starship trupper holds the orchestral head on one side or the other. Similarly, most of the footage is from other movies, Dutifully on CGI'd to look it different. Gray Worshipshops, for example, although incognito, StarDrostars of Star Warsa are pretty obvious. The station from StationShop Truppers is clearly the Fleet Battalion Station Tikondaroga. Similarly, the sound effects of different Star Wars movies are displayed in space battles, such as animation on footage. In one scene in the first or second season, I think, you will fly past even during a war of two TIA fighters, which in no way halt your suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> It's painful to see the roles that are different from reasonable. Everyone progresses as the season progresses, but the screen expects too many scents, especially in the early seasons. They liked some interesting acting. Let's just say the food replicas of this show are set to "cakes" permanently and it leaves it. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are usually quite effective. But in reality, a person who has decided to use a cheaper cloth and cardiacian mask for any other than background or "moving" shot should be seriously killed. They just exceed the unrealistic. Every time I saw one of them (not giving too much laugh) I defeated the unfortunate soul with a gun and declared that "it's a stick up!" In one scene a "Cardassian" actually discusses when wearing this one. The lips will not only move, but there will be face where the mask is even open. Anyone that needs to be slapped harder. They do not take a pure knife! There are some good things to do, but weirdly funny make-up work, such as Harmon Munster's appearance is the same. <br /> <br /> Although the text is coherent, nothing new. Instead of the script carried out like a continuation of DS9, with ship carrying ships from DS12 to different missions. The new enemy, "Gray", is not very annoying and the plot line involved with them is effectively redistributed to class threads. That is to fill Starfleet Gray, Gray is very strong, Starfleet rarely escapes from their lives, then through technology, they start to find ways to fight the enemies. Etc. The conflict is in bone dialogue. Star Trek writers have the ability to write "Insert Technobabal" in the long scripts. This is usually an exposition of the latest plan to deal with the enemy using "quantum phase discriminator" or "isolation charge" etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that they are in this case and a solution. <Br /> <br /> These words are simply lazy. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF has created a mess of it, where they include real-world comments on this idea. <br /> <br /> Strategic advice such as "feel good", but when a group is already standing by the character trio. Similarly, when the situation is asked, a strategic officer replies that "we count three warriors". Does he actually need to count them? Come on! I asked the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" Or "you can double check". But my favorite comment is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Comms Officer: "No, we can only send and receive <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, season 1 and 2 are quite bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4 and 5, where it starts significantly, Season 6 looks quite reasonable till then. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with their favorite media for the groups. Quicktime sucks, quite clearly and as soon as they move to the divx / avi format. Some of these actually take our downloaded shows and want to monitor the size and peer in the small QT window on their computer monitor. QuickTime does not only make this difficult, but 320x180 resolution shows do not scale well. Actually, it makes shocking strangers , As they were copying the tenth generation VHS tape. High-race downloadable option they could do to include Mapakse. <br /> <br /> However, the show has promise, and I'm starting to like the character. But on this 40 episode, so I'm not sure it tells a lot about the character of the development. <br /> <br /> But what you can say, it's free. <br /> <br /> <br /> PS: Among 28 votes, 19 people rated this shot 9 or 10. Hmmm ... are we seeing the same program? Or are you 19-year-old three years old?
