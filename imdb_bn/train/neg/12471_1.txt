Living in Middle East (Israel), I was excited to buy my ticket in Syria. After watching the trailer, and the thriller-lover, I first saw the fastest moving, breathing movie, which is to make policies around the world and to separate the relationship between oil, energy and corruption from a new angle. Well, I almost quit the movie. The speed was painfully slow, almost all the letters were stereotyped, the intruded editing made the argument very difficult, but Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, until finally you make no difference to it. Save your money, save your time, select another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Charitsky
