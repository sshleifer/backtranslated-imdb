This really deserves an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this event for ages, and sharked around the show series 7. But this episode proves that the shark has jumped the show. It is not worth getting lazy, unreasonable, self-motivated and junk like Bevs and Botthead. <br /> <br /> It may be funny and still funny - Caribbean pirates, Mummies, Counting of Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies will not be taken seriously. However, there are these things as ridiculous "The worst thing I have ever seen." And actually, this is the worst part of Sturgate that I've ever seen. It's absolutely awesome, and it's coming to someone with Stargate on its bases. <br /> <br /> I want to sell all my Streggle Props, most importantly.
