This image just goes around the circle and they do not know where the viewers are. At first I thought ... Mr. Mmm, it may be a great movie, but it just goes on and after and finally you do not know what's going on. The lead lady played well and played well in her role, and psycho fella, unclear, but after a little while you do not really care what this film just drags. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, being familiar, or film they're sorry they ever regret.
