'The Hills II II', sometimes somewhat uninterrupted and intelligent stupid, appears to be somewhat occasionally in growing sutuals, it produces 90 minutes of outstanding movies. Or worse, but you choose to see it. The 2006 'Hills' remake was one of the year's greatest, and one of the most horrific, horror movies, this signal received every spark to create such a feat. Part 2 does not get off the ground, and his mind does not have silent dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Living off the tourists who are filled in the region. Viewers of this episode keep viewers in the same desert, now they are secretly guarded by the military and what can happen to that poor family. When a group of military trainees were brought to campus, they emerged without any signs of life. A deadly reality prevents them soon, they realize that they are not alone. And the bloody fate given to many of them before them will soon become their destiny. <br /> <br /> It does not realize that there is no valid reason for the hills. But the box office and critics last year had been well received by critics because it is not surprising that production will start in a series and still earn money. There is no rhythm or argument at this time, incredible and ridiculous set-up for incredible characters, integral killings, non-existent stories and ways to reduce self-interest. Basically, director Alexander Aja created a classical classic of Cranven in a remake that was a unique and thoroughly annoying experience. The one that crosses the line at a very many events. His open exposition of violence, cruel torture, well-documented characterization and white imitation mystery has been used effectively to shock and resurrect all viewers. Almost second time, it is rehashed down-down. There are no styles, no spots It tries to raise the tension by breaking the body, when it is really there, then produces such a movie, where it seems less than the current bloodbath than the cow. <br /> <br /> It fails to keep your attention in subject matter when distorting deprived mutants who capture women for tragic development. It's a bore, nothing more. There is no bite 'hill'. There is nothing too scary about Horoscope, despite a jump or two here and there. It seems like something you see in a Sci-Fi channel, only some F-bombs, a blood splitter here and there, and a graphic birth scene that's more serious than depression. It's cheap. And with 'the hill', you're sewing. With no effort, you can not expect anything expected. <br /> <br /> Replaced with director Martin Weiss as the first big mistake director to film, what he does spoils any kind of emotional resonance. But more frustrating, Wrong writing of Wesy Craven and his son Jonathan Cravane incorrectly scripts. You ask, how likely can it be? Such dialogue makes that look no comparisons like Shakespeare. Craven had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but I would not expect something like this from him. It's so funny funny, you have to think, is Crayon doing so much fun? Or did the studio dump him after he stopped him? The head of the film is one dimensional talking with no emotion or common sense. Acting is just as bad. The only character that can win you is 'Napoleon' Napoli, scraping child who does not fit with others. Even the terrible and instinct-driven villains, whom we got some benefit from the deepest of our thinking a year ago, they got mixed with apathy. You do not hate them, you do not like them. You can not honestly care less. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "You are afraid of fear of" The Hills is easy ", but to enjoy your trash Difficult time to find something. Generally as it is generic, and here's absolutely nothing we've already seen many times. I can not express this enough, like the plug-in 'The Hills II II' avoids. It's awesome, unoriginal, insane, and a bore. Stuck in the real view of the remake or crane. Because if you do not walk after the first thirty minutes, do not say that I have warned you.
