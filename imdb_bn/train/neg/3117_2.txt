My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan. I like him very much, but usually he should be focusing on "he who is well fed" and comedic role. My thoughts have been confirmed with this movie. I was totally bored throughout the film. The story was predicted. I understand it was inspired by a true story. But, I guess there may be some mysteries or conspiracies while maintaining true in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship may be more searched. However, more importantly, there was deep search of "son" soil. His psychological profile has been interesting in the delve. He is probably not a long history that is touched without maximum patronage. If my husband was not such a huge Williams fan, then we could have left for 20 minutes. Too bad I can not get back my $ 20 or 2 hours.
