This is really a terrible "B" movie. It's stupid and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic "routine in the show business" routine, is almost nonexistent. Indeed, the film is an excuse to highlight only the war effort and to highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Besie, Duke Allington, Bob Crosby and Freddie Slack. Each group gets about three minutes in value, the exception is Miss Mills Brothers, because two reasons warranted for two reasons. Anne Miller is not able to dance for the last few minutes of the film, and there is nothing to do, but his staff struts into the barricades of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the picture, in my eyes, happened in the Duke Elington Segment. The band appears to be in a painful position, playing on a train. (Then in the deep south, while traveling, the band was separated by railroad cars.) Johnny Hodges can be seen by the Duke and Harry Karno can be identified. At the end of the film, Trumpeter / Biologist Rays Nens shocked the sky in the camera and a "uncle Tom" pressed his eyes and Will Best played in most of the films. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this respect for separation is really sad. Some movies go best disappear.
