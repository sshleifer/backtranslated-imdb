Possible Spoilers, Probably I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams less True" is one of the worst movies ever made. Above all, the film was created in the height of Disney's Secret Rage. It was created at the same time as "The Little Mormaade 2", "The Jungle Book II," and "Peter Pan II", which was controversial among their original movie classics. (Disney has created "The Hanback of Notre Dame 2" and "Atlantis 2", but I'm going to exclude the issue because their original movies were never the first classics.) Ask me to go ahead. I am an enthusiastic fan of well-liked Disney movies and I basically worship the original Disney "Cinderella". Continuity of "Cinderella" was a waste of time. Signal character of Cinderella was much different than the original girl. I grew up to see. Basically, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella was a very characteristic moment like the phrase of the current era, "I'm going to enjoy this!" You say that the new sinderella (as I have tenderly named him) says, "Eh!" This is Cinderella. I try to find the best among people, but Anastasia, a religionist, good in the signal! Why hack? Why did they become like Lady Trimin and Daizela is a very terrible family member for the little excitement! Sia My question to the world: Did the Disneyians see the original "syndrome" when creating this series? Well, that does not seem so obvious. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was abusive as Dreszella and Lady Tremine as Sindhullela. I was all for release and for forgiveness, but there was no point in release for Anastasia in this movie. The first one, Anastasia was evil. Second, he's good. One can not just leave a story like this. I hope Disney understands that this film is ashamed of Walt Disney's name among other movies. Perhaps now that Michael Isner left, everything will start to be transformed around the house of the mouse.
