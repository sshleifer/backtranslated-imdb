Looking for the promise to start off the cum start, killing the killer with a brutal death scene by a mask. The mask itself is very cool, and the one used in the 1990's slasher film "Granny" looks almost similar. Since then the film is mostly boring. We have got some more deaths which are good again, but they do not have enough. Death is so good because they are frenzied and bloody. The story behind the film was actually rather interesting and in most cases it was not very annoying to work very well. <br /> <br /> If I do not die, I can avoid it - there is not enough here to create enough slash flicker here.
