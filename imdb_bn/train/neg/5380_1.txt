While writing this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDB voters rated this image 10 or 1. I can only give self-esteem that it is given to 10 people, they are Cast or crew members. <br /> <br /> They say that enough monkeys and adequate time and adequate typewriters, the monkeys will finish the Shakespeare's entire works, only by random productions on the keyboard. However, I seriously doubt that the same monkey and time has been given, you can find this movie to find 10 ratings units. <br /> <br /> I slowly saw the first half, stupidly that this image would develop on some levels, plots or letters, or maybe create a social comment or rare intellectual thought. That failed, I was ready to accept action, mystery, comedy, horror, even exposed sex as a way of holding my attention. Finally, I was frustrated and as a result, most of the second half was shown on double-speed because I searched in vain for some small snippets of cinematic release. Sadly, there was no one. <br /> <br /> If "The Chuck" is standing against an episode of Skua Doo, I think the cartoon will conquer the hand in terms of mystery, conspiracies and uncertainty. Due to the talk of cartoon characters, the cast members of the cast cast were acceptable (best) and Brooke Bailey's embarrassing, fragile incarnation of death, dull variety of shame in London with the screenplay of London, I was sorry for that. <br /> <br /> I used to like to finish a positive note but the second-rate festival of contemporary punk rock even failed to entertain soundtracks, let alone to increase the only poor flash.
