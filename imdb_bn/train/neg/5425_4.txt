I got the mirror mirror because it was mainly Yvonne de Carlo (I think he was great among American Gothic) but sadly he did not have a big role in this film. It starts right and the speed moves along nicely ... but in the end it starts to get a bit tedious and dull. It does not seem to be an annoying film, but it is not very average and spectacular. I did not like it on the "posession" side and there was no decent ghor scene. Plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the last did not get so much knowledge. I like the story surrounding the Gothic girl and the story of retaliation for her abusers. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend Mirror Mirror to particularly alarming fans - it's nothing to bewild yourself.
