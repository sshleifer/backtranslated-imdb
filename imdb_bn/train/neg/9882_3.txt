There are just two good things about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by both previous critics as well): There are two good things about Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspirational beauty. She has a shot in this movie where she even gave a run for her money to Kathryn Zeta-Jones, and it's really a high praise. Her nudity is short and intelligent, but just enough to see her face. <br /> <br /> B) With the setting of the Greek island, its sun and crystal-clear blue water. <br /> <br /> There is no story, dialogue is uncomfortable, and sometimes strange funny ("where you were a woman!"), and Peter Hutton's character is a thin blur. Bo presents the sacrifice of his character, but once again you have to do this bad thing with dialogue, it is not wrong to blame the actors (the fact that he is almost a name in almost every sentence called "Damir"). Oh, and although this film is set on a Greek island, it is most likely not a Greek sound can be heard - apparently everyone speaks in English, from the children to the old man. (*)
