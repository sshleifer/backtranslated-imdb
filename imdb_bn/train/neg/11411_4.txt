The story line has been rehashed many times; "Life is a breath of retirement". A number of plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have ended the subject, but it is still a wonderful platform for character study. <br /> <br /> If Gideon is made more enthusiastically bright, but the dialogue is painful, annoying and the story is completely flooded with clich√©s (even Gideon's "Easy Wisdom" subtitle and smiles about me being almost helpless about the essence ). Most indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film, but the rest of the actors are not enough to make the lack of focus irrelevant.
