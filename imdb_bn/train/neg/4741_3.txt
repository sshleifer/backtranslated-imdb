Wandi U. Homeworking Warrior is a very good, strong plot but it is destroyed by the delicious details throughout the film. I do not enjoy a small teenager and this movie too. I thought the effects are horrible, but they might seem to be entertaining for younger kids. Destroying the action of matrix action, you know it was absolutely fake. Then Yen was low, an evil spirit that was temporarily desperate and the desire of the house, where Andy tried to win. It ended like a common-sense movie, when Andy and her Buddhist monk cousin Saturn Yen defeated (and destroyed him for ever). So Wondi is learning a lesson ... Bla, Bla, Bla. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
