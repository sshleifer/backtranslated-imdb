All the elements in this movie were a smart, comic comedy, but for some reason it took the Dammas route. It probably did not know the audience: but it is not just a movie of men and a story given by the film, but it is very sticky and stupid to apply to women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen legally blonde and her sequel, then like this bewilderingly terrible sequel. Great actors like Lock Wilson should expect good stuff. Jessica Simpson can be more manageable. Rachel Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are discouraged to support the absurd role instead of having fun. <br /> <br /> There are so many things in this movie that the number of images, different uber-clich√© montages, last minute "misunderstandings" even the children's chaos It only offers lazy script writing. <br /> <br /> This film will be enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it can do better than the glaring tasks you might be hoping for, and the increasingly frustrating as the past roll in the scene.
