Oh dear, oh dear. What I expected was this intelligent watching started. I could not believe what I saw. There was a time when I thought it was a comedy. How do I like the government's plan to capture terrorist leaders, ruthlessly rush a man who is disarmed, and hopes to catch him and escape from the rocket pack. If it was only that simple. I finally found a movie that is worse than "Out of Space, Plan 9".
