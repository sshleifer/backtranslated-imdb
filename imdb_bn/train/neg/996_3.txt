Revenge film is one of my favorite themes. Moros, one of my favorite themes in the film "The Revenge of Failure". Looking at Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I hope the more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this movie is a poor half-hearted effort that has not revealed anything except the lack of film strength and lack of focus. <br /> <br /> * The last scene, the scene of rape / torture of men's men, came as a female revenge rape fantasy nothing less. However, the film does not even follow with this. Instead, the drone-out scene (which has exceeded the brutal atrocities of primary rape in both graphic and degree), expressed regret over the facial shots of Dawson or "it did work <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, do we feel bad about the rapist? Are we happy with the revenge of Dawson? ? Is it what we call it atrocity? We are afraid of Dawson's moment of tragic transparency, along with this failure, the film is weirdly arranged with more styles than the substance, the thin-throating of the characters, the monotonous dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to take the movies in their own films I do not really know what they really are.
