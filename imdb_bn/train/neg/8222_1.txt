Um ... Okay, I think I get a whole Shaky-cam, Gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately, I think a Gorilla can make a good movie ... This thing was just a complete hassle for getting this thing. Bad acting, bad directions, bad stories and horror cinematography I do not know how this garbage released pond, but it and unfortunately I saw it. Greg Swisen and Ryan Thyssen (Harry and Lloyd) have been in Tennessee, "Five Ages The Eyes", I think it looks like a "Blair Witch" type film but it is decreasing ... OK is a stereo nose Dive I was really embarrassed for this young women, for whom I was convinced the Hollywood starmade, but this dung lasted in the hip. The dialog is ridiculous, and as you hear it actually aggravates you. How it is supposed to be a horrific flick is another mystery, since it's nothing even distraught scary about it, except that I saw it ... Try it for size: 5 of you and one of them, do not math and beat his ass. .. "end". Sadly, this silence of more than 95 minutes has become stupid ... <br /> <br /> I found it free and wanted my money back.
