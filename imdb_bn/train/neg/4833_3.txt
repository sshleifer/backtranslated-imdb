Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscars of Avatar, because the politicians wanted the hero to fight for a war hero, the United States is still fighting for this war. I do not really want to go here in politics, but let's make it more clear than the summer sky. The injury locker is not really outstanding, no real plot. I never feel like 50,000 people in Hungary, what the party likes and what people like to like. The same campaign films were produced at that time, except for the exception that they were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable part of the "American Wars Cool" style, there are definitely better films to choose from.
