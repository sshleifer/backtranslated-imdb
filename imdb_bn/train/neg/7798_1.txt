This review is based on the unexpected world of Shock-and-Ram video released in 2002. How bad is it? This is terrible, which represents the '1' IMDB scale - but it's much worse than that. Imagine that a real German language can improve printing issues - curious English language dubbing is not very funny - but really, this is one of the worst amateur movies you can see. The bodies of the film are slow and painful as before, and they do not seem to speak or think beyond the next meal. However, they are fairly intelligent enough to contribute to circles, and to know that Western tabs about genetia will doubtfully affect their dinner table conversations. The Land of the Dead of George Romero has strengthened a zombie nation that maintains a discipline of social cohesion; Here, the junkies are nothing more than just the canvas for the opposite fantasies of director Andresas Sannas. In addition to social standard reading, even worse, there is a complete lack of entertainment, the Zombie 9 0 is a bad joke on some of the money wasted on it.
