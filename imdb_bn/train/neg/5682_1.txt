This movie is incredible ridiculous. I love horror movies, but I've never seen it the worst. I'm a big fan of Gore, but most of the deaths of this movie are not shown. It only shows our dead body, and the actual exhibitions of this movie are really terrible. Graphics so probably look fake. The actors are as awkward as well. They have no real passion. I only ruined my time by seeing this piece of film, but at the beginning of it I had to present myself to the actual footage of the animals that were being beaten. If I could rate this one 10, I would like to. This * movie * c. Fad <br /> <br /> Do not look it up.
