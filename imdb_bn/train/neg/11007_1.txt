Recently, they are trying to make the TV TV commercials on TV this night. Do not believe in betrayal. I was one of the unfortunate people to see this stinker in the theater. In my opinion, behind the Mac and Me (Bad # 1) and Jack Frost (# 22 Bad), in my opinion, the worst movie of all time, but I must admit that they are all close and all terrible! Actually, this movie is not funny, or annoying or it claims to do anything else that does not waste your money. It's the only good thing to give your worst enemy. I'm not lying about that. Anyone you want to kill or torture, be the main candidate for this movie. That's terrible. If you do not trust me, you can enjoy the sadness of seeing it, which I suspect may be able to finish. Two thumbs down enthusiastically.
