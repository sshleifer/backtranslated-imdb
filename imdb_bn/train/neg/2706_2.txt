Yes, the race is racist. People are even racist in college. This is a good point and the problem of racism has been played many times in the movie. Separate education sets apart from the pack that it deals with the problem of potentially ham-fished and potentially racism, oh yes it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This picture deals with Frankenstein's most difficulties in relation to Frankenstein, it turns round the clock in a cruel and lazy manner. Most characters are cartoonists, one-dimensional, characteristic (lesbian feminists, angry black people), which can dramatically and predictably respond to situations. Instead of defying stereotypes, this film is overpopulated with them. Angry black men feel cheated, hate feminine men, etc. (A feminist also has a mark that "dead men do not rape." What do I mean?) I do not want to give it away, but if the film seems to be a neutral lona or a date rapist, then perhaps how would you expect them They must behave. The changes that took place among the characters seem to be clear to everyone in the movie. Depending on whether the big plot of the plot will act as violent neo-Nazi violent neo-Nazis. I guess you only need to see the clock to know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it is considered "reti" and "hard-heating", but they are bad nazis. I agree the Nazis are evil, but that's my point. Everyone think Nazis are bad! We are not breaking any new ground here. Since the 1930s, Nazis have been portrayed as villains. The film does not challenge any aspect or gives bold statements. It's not just a vegetable, after school-special, deals with the problem you know about the procedure. There is no controversial problem because of opposition to rape, anti-national, and anti-Nazi. <br /> <br /> Expected high education, cartoon and a stupid word. To avoid all costs.
