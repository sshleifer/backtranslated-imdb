The film's foundation is threatening: a woman is pregnant when she kisses a newborn baby at a time. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie starts, a horrific opening scene establishes that it is a C-type Saifai TV movie. It's a big star track and a bit x-file, but it's annoying from anything else. <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable and great when the film works. It looked more like a 2-potter in a bad sci-fi TV series. No mystery and no thrills, but for the lack of effort. Many of the main characters are just expected dramatic contests. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
