Woosh ??! People ?? What can I say ... <br /> <br /> The opening scene, maybe? We see a bunch of mongoloid-barbarians with some debris jumps off the worst make-up jumps off the wall. They roam around and attack some father with a girl wearing a small costume. The child is closed, Mangloddah follows him and one of them is apparently behind the rape, but instead she publishes one of her breasts and kidnaps her. Then, the buddy (still on the run) looked at a horse and tried to steal it. Suddenly ?? The hero looking with a bad wings like a bad angel says, "It's my horse!" Saying. The execution of the mighty power only made his appearance. Upon reaching Manglods, Deathstalkers all of them (with dude) some improper Mexicanos are considered to be Western tunes (it seems to be a sword and a witch spot, so what's with 'Arabi-Tromometos'?) And then goes up to Capri Girl and her breasts exposes She starts to rub them and the Capital Girl seems to like it. She likes her lips and starts caressing the Deathstalker. When they are going down to the bottom, this old father seems to be preventing the death of a perfect day (for a perfect completion of a small film). <br /> <br /> tell me now ?? There is no point in which feminist anger will insert the film, or any other male audience will say, "This is going to be a hell of a good movie!" The plot is easy to throw a kitten from the balcony: the executioner must awaken Georgia's sword and use it to steal the magic challenge of living and evil magician Munker. <br /> <br /> Decapitations, Separation, Random bleeding, Boxing tough and embarrassing sword fighting, this film also has a large amount of T! ts and a $ $ shot. I initially wanted to add an extra point to this movie that I could count on for each gratuitous shot for nude boobies. After 9 points (not even half of the film), I had to give up counting. It is confusing to me from the rest of the movie. And the rest of the movie was left. Completely crazy stuff. Look at this mutant cat / insect-like creature, Muncher has a pet and is feeding her eyes and fingers. And here's a funny question: will a person's body enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple: you surround him a little, take the knife and then try to rape him. Then you discover that she is not actually a woman, so you throw her out of your bed and tell her to leave your house. It works well, I tell you. Deathstalker also does it, and Deathluster-Way, the right way! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Women are delicious There are blood, sex, violence, rape and tasty chicken. There is a complete pointless tournament, which only pushing a group of rebels out of each other and hacking them. My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer, it was used to defeat the poor rival in bloody decorations. And my favorite competitor is undoubtedly Worthag-Head (Gemini Guard's Monument from Jadi Return). I will not publish when the film ends, but I'm ready to encourage you when you are thrown into a 4-way hijacked climax film. <br /> <br /> And of course, there is a great display of incompetence across the whole movie. A man is dragged behind a horse on a dirt road and the next point-of-view shot shows him not being dragged to grass (no road). The magical tattoos change from the side of the same scene (in the shot, on the left side of the head, on the right side) on the magical head. Well, after all, a magician from Muncher. It is that, or this movie was shot in an alternative universe where things like "continuity" are not simply available. <br /> <br /> As much as I've enjoyed and I'm waiting for 3 installments in this series, I have enough brutality to not pass this movie. I am ready, though, to give it the maximum number of minimum points, so I can be able to spend a few points to follow the potentially inferior order. Deathstalker might be a fantastic, trashy, and lazy Canaan rip off, it could be a scary movie.
