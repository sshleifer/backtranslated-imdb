Amy Hackerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of 1962 gangster film that is made from the tradition of Warner Brothers. Michael Ketan looked at a middle-aged gangster while trying to steal something from his pet shop in 1935 to take away the life of an elderly gangster in his middle child. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) continued the health care, so Keaton falls under the pretextual age through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the rewards remand Demeter runs in a rival criminal game and Keton eventually passes the medal. Joe Pispopo is running like a sunny day like Danny Varmin, yes, all right, Varmin! Griffin turned Dunne Keaton's younger brother to the district attorney, his wife Glynis O'Connor, and Marilu Henna Keaton's mole play. The image seems to be notoriously cheap, it seems to be a television show rather than a theatrical film. <br /> <br /> The film is a great start and slows as expected after the first half. Due to the combination of dialogue and gag, the film has its own ownership of the first half, but it quickly vanishes vapor and the second half interferes and falls into obscenity. Keaton chews the scenes doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton is not funny, there are quite lazy lines that are just illogical. Piscopo does not have "a lot of time" once in a while. Several supportive actors Danny Davito, Dom Delois, Ray Walton are trying to keep Alan Hell Junior as a desk sergeant and keep Saudi bonds as a dishonestly clean woman, like street vendors. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and does not recovers. Closed scene using the Roaming TwentyZ is the Wildclass Gaelic movie call displayed in March before the movie. I think Hackerling should know better because the target audience must be aware of the real war of liberation war of Roaming Twenty. * 4/2 star 1/2
