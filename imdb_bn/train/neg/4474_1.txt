My life wasted, .... the director should be ashamed. Why do people think that they want to create vain movies, they will not make any sense to me. When he finally died, he laughs at me. The channel had to change many times throughout the film because I'm feeling embarrassed by such bad acting. Hopefully, the man who plays the hit will not be able to work again. On top of this, I hope the director never can make another film, and this shit has been brought back. {10 out of 0}
