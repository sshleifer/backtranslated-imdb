This is a stupid movie. If the film does not promise such a promise, maybe my verdict will not be so harsh, but I felt cheated on this movie and played it for fools every time. <br /> <br /> I did not have any beef with acting, but I thought the characters were awful. The movie begins with the character of Clive Oven that tells us he is a criminal mastermind and how he planned the perfect bank robbery, which he often reminds us later. Oh yes, he told us that he was in a prison cell, even though it turned into a stupid metaphor. No fool knows that the best bank robbery is a place where at least the number of things can be a possible mistake and you have gone a long way before appearing before the police. But Clive Owey's scheme should hang around the bank for hours - without any reason, but almost to pull and as far as I can say is terrible. To control him hostage, discuss with the police, and most imaginefully, doing this old-house work in the bank's stockroom and hiding there for a week (I hope he needs enough food and urine in a bucket) and then sneak again Thief Yes, sure that sounds like a perfect crime to me, Clive! This plan is so running that does not distinguish the sole reason. It was the screenplay. So <br /> <br /> and then there are many vague details: Why was the police so convinced that the hypocrites were among the prisoners? Who is the character of Jodie Foster, and why is she so important that she has her mayor in his tenure and does not have to call her Angel Agent of Denzel because "it's on her pay scale?" How foolish are these policemen that they can not steal a person for an hour to speak abroad? How did the robbers go to sleep and Clive Owe was roaming for a week? How did they get to know the number and issues of the bank's chairman's past and his safe deposit boxes? Why leave Clive Wayne JD Foster or Police? Since they have never seen AK-47s of toys? How do you bug a pizza box, anyway? How does Clive Owe manage to sneak out of a safe area of ​​the bank during working hours, unselected? Do these overwhelming criminals really feel detained enough to make this police cable slip a diamond? <br /> <br /> There is no answer to this question. There are movies that have depth due to the surprise of off-screen incident, but I did not feel like Inside Man. It has been felt like scenes that these things have been spun from the movie, or these questions do not have any answer in the first place and it is weak. Particularly annoying, Jodie Foster does not reveal what she reveals, but she remembers how important she is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are no redeeming features in this movie.
