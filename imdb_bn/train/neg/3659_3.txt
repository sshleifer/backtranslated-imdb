This review is applicable for film cut which is usually available as "Wolfman's Ferry". I understand that there is an incomplete version with additional footage and I hope it has at least eight nine significant scenes that are not known to be known as "the furry of Kashmir". In short, the movie makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the Tibet tour, where he was attacked by a hey. Since this has turned into a hewolf. Danninski is a doctor, a scientist, and a coach like a college. His female colleague, Ilona Elman, involved in a vague form of hypnosis ... "Chematodes", a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head. Elman thinks that it will enable him to "change the direction of the human brain", naturally he will be able to rule the world, but he can connect with that wire without any problems. <br /> <br /> Elman is also broken, because he kidnapped Dannysky and took him to his hidden laboratory. He has a bunch of other people stuck alongside. Some of them look like GPs and are in separate positions. The other is definitely hippies. Elman felt that one day he could "help them to be human again" (?), But he already controls them with their Chematodes. Waldemar became his hairy hit man, Verrufefwo jumped like Junkie - until the filmmakers decided to use the footage from another dancewirewirewall movie "Frankenstein's Bloody Terrorism" (Do not ask), at that time the change of Naschy's weareal makeup changed And he churches around like an animal. <br /> <br /> Is it any ideas? Any? Well That's the saving grace of the film. It does not try to try and engage you at an intellectual level, it only moves at full speed, which can connect a foolless dialogue or a cheap horror movie set with it. "Wolfman's Sunrise" may be the best movie ever made in Halloween party. If you do not pay attention at all, and in fact, you will be completely confused.
