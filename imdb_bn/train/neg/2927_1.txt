Somewhere, outside, there will always be a list of the greatest gay films of all time. A person who captures the stars' camera shots and wanders in the spring, or at a place where they take a spaghetti attention and cautiously cautions on the cats. The image of this motion sickness is a story of a boy and boy and they live and love and get trapped and stuck in grottos and there is a mother in them and someone else has no mother and they talk and walk and have swimming and sex and get drunk and then Broken and someone goes to hospital for eight days and then comes out and goes very fast and is in rewind and many of them are lasting Shots are seen or sitting and do nothing. I think it is a strategy to make an impersonation film, or perhaps it is so bad that it has to be broken for long periods of shots because otherwise it is about 14 minutes to depend on their plot or story. Do not make me wrong, this is about the 30th gay film that I saw in the past 30 months and some of them (mostly) have been very constructive, anticipated and annoying, but it's really a terrible waste. So far the best was the "Beautiful Things". So, I saw it and after the first shot that was Linked and Linkedar, I thought "Oh, no, it's going to be creative syndi mah" but I gave it a chance and saw it and after finishing it worked the trunk with the DVD. Sorry, I did not like it and if you are sorry I'm sorry.
