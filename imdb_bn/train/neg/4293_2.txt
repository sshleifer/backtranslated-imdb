"The Rainmaker", which was released in 1956 - Best Actor of His Time Kathryn Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Bert Lancaster are the main players. Even they can not save this completely on the melodrama played. Firstly, Haupburn is a horrible miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brightness as an actress, even she can not pull it off. He was too old to be credible as a lot of this, and was very old for the part. The lancaster works ultimately, and Earl Holman is far too much like Hamy and Jethro Clapett. The only bridge and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to emerge above a bit - but even they can do so only. Looks like 1950's when Catherine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress, and that's right. He just made a bad choice here. Thankfully for his fans (I was among them) He did not do much of them. Despite a list listing and good production quality, it does not work.
