For my life I do not understand the good reviews on this piece of shit. It was vain. Matthew Modine was a terrible miscast as a leading female man. Guina Gerson, well, others have said it, but I'll repeat, why fooling? Completely unnecessary. And its acting was just bad. I do not know whether to throw by pronunciation, or what to do. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> The girl fell in love with Modine, suddenly she inserted half of her head into her mouth and acted in a stupid way? Where did that come from? I think we felt sorry for her that we began to break her marriage with her wedding work, but to be honest, I could not be less careful about any of these people.
