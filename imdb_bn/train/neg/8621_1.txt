The previous poster certainly worked in the movie. It's a joke and it's not that bad and it will not review such a movie as it is. Referring to all the names of the actors and mentioning what was in the past, it is a sure sign that she is in some way related to it. <Br /> <br /> It's now in the cinema and I was sure that it was a movie where pornographic stars (whose name is Aava beautiful and well-established) were forced to do something else due to some crazy taxes. Also, when I first saw it, I was sure it was created in 1986, and I was born in '73, so I thought that I knew what I was saying ... but not ... It was made in 1993 !! Incredible! <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say so bad that it is a good movie. Like watching a train debris.
