Most of the horror cars in this movie that I have ever seen in movies, and evidently hottest women, but I should say that it is still one of the worst movies. <br /> <br /> The plot here, and if you read it a little bit, you also have the acting. <br /> <br /> Get started, bring letters, sing hot women (clear lips sync). When the music agent or producer comes, he is awesome to ask him the race. She down, down to many bad memories. The hero of the flash war, returning from war, has been a series of fights, and has become a movie hero with the attitude that he is better than the best. Quick drive off the external car. Brother Race, then died. Hero for the revenge of death, trafficking arms from a friend! (You have never seen this friend before or after, but really take care of her) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I'm really sure of you; Yes, give me arms; Are you sure Yes; All right, I guess I can not speak to you outside, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he wanders at his uncle's house, whose brother's car is driving. The woman finds out, she decides to rescue her, she leaves, and she does not kill her uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yes, it is necessary to throw in a unilateral scene with the people who feel bad, who are coming to kill someone who is not really important, but maybe it adds a small plot. The race is not even exciting, of course, it ends with two cars running, and the one that wins will end suddenly. <br /> <br /> Well, I saved you for $ 7.00. Because you can send me all your money, I will give you the same amount as the movie. Do not make me wrong, the cars are awesome, and Nadia is beautiful, but it's really a terrible movie.
