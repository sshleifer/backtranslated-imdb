This is a very sad movie. Really Nothing happens in this movie. Script bad !!! I think they copy and paste the first 15 pages into 90 pages. Producers must have thought of creating a Hollywood movie in Belgium. They did not succeed Now in the third week, it's only 22 hours or more in Antwerp and Brussels. In the past we saw really good movies like dance in Belgium. Shade is a waste of your time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after watching a real movie. If you see the 10-minute shadow you see it all. It is executed on local radio and TV. I hope to shave the shadows too soon.
