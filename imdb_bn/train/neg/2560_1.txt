Well I saw this last night and one thing which it was not entirely terrible was it was straightforward. There was no assassination around Bush that this child was anti-Christ. However, the film was only poorly written. For example, they never interpret the dentist as "accidental events" or how ultimately the police end up miraculously at home to not rescue the so-called so-called child. The death scenes were really really bad and were not really entertaining. Children were annoying to choose Anti-Christ and they could really choose a good child. Just do not waste your time on this.
