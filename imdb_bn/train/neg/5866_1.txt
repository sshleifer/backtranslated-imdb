I remember this movie at the age of 13 (looks like many reviews seem like eleven 13!) With a group of friends of the school We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and fell for general commercial advertisements. This is a great comedy for us. We got frozen in about 45 minutes, and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was awesome and casual, and many cry from Billy Crystal forced us to laugh, we could not laugh. I accidentally fluttered on this review and did not say to the rest of the world what was a cyclone waste of the film, now if you rent it, you deserve to be paid what you have received, you will be warned !!
