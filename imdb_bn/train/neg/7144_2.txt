It was often better to sit through this whole God-fearing "film" that I would never be able to enjoy such a bad thing any more. Acting - 0, Script - 0, Male lead - 0 (Eight miles to Shadder Bob, who got a girl as a hero warrior), Nadia Bazreenlin - 10 (She is not a great and terrible actress). This is a criterion that I used to build two on it. I've lost count but I believe that movie movies, sometimes, in this movie. The driver who miraculously dared his father to appear at the end of the race, from there it cemented the previous statement anywhere. Plus he looks for any reason. He has not even mentioned before. I do not know what else to say here. See it when it comes to TV within a few hours. At least it will be edited for some of its advertising.
