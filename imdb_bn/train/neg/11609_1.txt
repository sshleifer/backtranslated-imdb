I'm not from America and I know what's 'Wife Swap' When a program came out of that name, I was thrilled to see some fantastic glamorized sex moments from the show. But what I got was a real sucking stupidity I am misunderstood by its title name, it does not have any adult content, no nudity, and even pornographic conversations (have thrown a wide cast cast Hallmark channel and I think they clean it up to edit / deactivate it). <br /> <br /> A program that gives a picture of current American / western family state, overweight molytic people, malicious teenagers, and the ongoing picture of their sucking family. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more properly) were elected to reside in everyone's homes and to change their family routine, according to their own new rules. Sometimes it turns out to be better or more equally bad At the end, each mother was brought back with her husband and tried to finish what they did with each family on the last day. The contestants are fighting each other for their rights. I was sucked to see all this instead of seeing some cool adult sexual stuff. I mean, who has done this program, more than that has given the name "wif swap"; It is known as "Mother Swap". All of them spoil all the great things standing for the swap of the real wife! <br /> <br /> Female silence show the average shiny reality.
