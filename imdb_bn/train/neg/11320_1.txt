Someone has to pay the car ... it's really awful ... Gene cloud's cyborg makes it like going with the wind ... at the moment I want to be sued for returning ... Fortunately, it created serious stupidity ... From whom I fell asleep. How can these skills actors make these dogs? I would rather spend time watching the algae beside fish tank tanks than to participate in this totally horrible concoction of different styles. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. Walmart $ 5.99 is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need it, but wait for them to drop them after a few years of their content and are frustrated because they do not sell. <<br /> <br /> Please, die for the love of God, because of the film's ambiguity.
