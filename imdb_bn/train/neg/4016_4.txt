In the United States the DVD was published in the code HRGD 002 in the United States, there is no ASIN, VFC 19796 disc, no IFPI code internal rim. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is no issue to comment on an adult movie. But this is a brief plot, and the letters are credible. It is shown in the United States general movies. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the way of Pennsylvania in 1975. <br /> <br /> This way it is a place for encyclopedia of films. DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and perhaps a VHS tape was used as source
