I just finished reading a book by Anita Luos, and the McDonald's TCM Magazine's movie has seen its angel costume cool (impressive wings), so I thought I wanted to watch this movie. I have never heard of this movie before, so I had no idea about it. He was aware of the start of awareness like Playboy and McDonald's with Eddie. The scene where he was uninterrupted and watched in his simple angel dresses while he was in wings, that was not really respectful. When Eddie went to sleep and portrayed him as a real angel, I was also with the film. But after a while I was separated for me. Eddie "sleeps" for the whole movie, so it's a dream. Whatever happens from there, because he is dreaming. The rest were less plots and vain. I had to strengthen myself with the stick. And when McDonald moved from the number of musical numbers to musical numbers in some crazy sculptures, the final number was only padded. <br /> <br /> If the ADT is "awake" very soon and the original story continues, or is he really married an angel, I think it is much more interesting. I wanted to see more of his real character. <br /> <br /> It was not enough musical numbers to say a musical. The first few songs were good, but McDonald's got the gitbug number as a nail on the chalkboard. Completely wrong for his operatic voice. Even, Eddie and McDonald still manage to shine, what they really see.
