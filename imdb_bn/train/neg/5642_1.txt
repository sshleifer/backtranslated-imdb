This title seems more like a painting exercise than a film that should be publicly expressed. For Dafoe and his wife it must be fun to work together in a film for the first time, without being considered as people could actually see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have seen 'aunty' movie before and it has not come to be arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me the whole point. <br /> <br /> I think it's a matter of talking for itself that the only person to rate this movie is under the age of 10 years of age. Undoubtedly, the film was forced to throw us on for uninterrupted erotic scenes. You can call it erotic It certainly did not taste.
