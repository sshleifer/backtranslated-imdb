The film starts with some scrolling text that takes about five minutes. It gives basic summaries of what is happening. It has been easily done with acting but instead you will get a scrolling text effect. After the bomb blast that you are learning a little about, the characters that you are learning about, remember that you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the soil and then crashes through the whole movie. Not only can the plot change, but you may ask yourself if you see the same movie. I've never played video games, but there are those who know. From my understanding, whether you played the game or not, the film does not do any good. Save your money until you want to sleep in the theater.
