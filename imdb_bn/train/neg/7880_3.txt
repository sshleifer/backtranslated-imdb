The Animal Farm (1954) unanimously had very good reading about the dangers. The iron fist and the ignorance of the empty head and the rulers can change how good the ideal and can be distorted. Unfortunately, this movie does not represent any of these. What we see is a piece of fingers that is inside many fingers and indicates. Animation and instruction were good considering budget and time, but very short description of George Orwell's novel is very absent. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see, novel or watch only if this watch is all interested in watching an adaptation of the novelette. I found this one to be just a bit moderate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
