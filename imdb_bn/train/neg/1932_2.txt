If the makers of Atlantis have something to say in this movie, their theme (literally) has been immersed in "special effects" on characterization. Often, while trying to "keep up" with summer action blockbusters, Disney star leans towards Warren's "shoot-up" character in favor of the character-driven, movie-a-non-message system. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (CGI). They are wrong, and beautiful, handicap animation days, the fast window assembly rally for CGI. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Due to choosing to accompany Glittes, this misses frustratingly. <br /> <br /> Another problem is panning the movie. It starts confusing and is not appreciated then starting a rocket along with a choppy story editing style. Millo Thatch came out on the door with the audience (well voiced by Michael J. Fox) and is thinking "Gee will be terribly terrible in what happens after reaching Atlantis there." Unfortunately, a lot will not happen. The secret of Atlantis remains hidden with the storytellers, knowing how to interpret the true island / continent. They are afraid to imagine where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is even estimated, even from the imagination-based perspective entirely. The audience will ask the audience to leave the theater "Now what was the point of the film? What was the point of the film? Why can not remember surviving Atlantans when many of them live through" current "disaster and why did Atlantis drown?" And then immediately They started forgetting what they saw. There is nothing left or left to think about ... except in their pocket money. <br /> <br /> The characters and their motivation are equally invisible. In 1914, Kida entered the Kida (spoiler) from the bright zillionaire found in the mission with more money than the existence of the whole planet, and Volunteerly her man desert from !!! Cruise violent, bi-dimensional people (for 1914) p. C. Race and gender Like a destructive specialist, he came in a brief voice from the Washington Brothers. Most of the jokes are the overall one-liner that is to be deleted by the audience for two reasons: They are distributed in power-motion pacing and are usually flexible. At the end of the movie it is difficult to believe the way these supporter players are making moral changes. <br /> <br /> We appreciate Disney's trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is not the first Disney. There are cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to convert. Little children will be scared by visible scenes and will go to dark in large quantities by subtitles (when characters speak Atlantan language). In the first five minutes of the operation, about 200 people were killed without second thought. Clearly Disney thinks that if you do not know who the person is, why should you care? Again, there is no feeling at the level of the film. <br /> <br /> The latest animated film made by Muzen and Tarzan Disney which was done very well. Sadly, Atlantis returns to the failed attempts of Hutchbackback in Black Collodon and Nottre Dame Huntbackback. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A pic of Peter Pan is coming soon but no one knows what the result will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney science fiction has discovered, they hope that they understand more than the audience than the novel. We hope that the upcoming "Treasure Planet", Robert L. A science-graduate adaptation of Stevenson's "Treasure Island", will receive more heart than "Atlantis: The Lost Empire".
