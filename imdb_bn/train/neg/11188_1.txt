This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Duration I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to see this steaming turd of a movie. Unbelievably neutral, bad acting, horror scripts, often incoherent, and many scenes that do not seem to be any relevance to the overall film (eg Heath Ledger's pastor partner lives with the nail of a wall by a ghost ... what was in that scene? A postcard Answer please ...) <br /> <br /> I'm sticking with this movie for this ongoing time Got medals. I would like to take a serious kick rather than sitting in this movie. <br /> <br /> It should throw 100 under the IMDB. Hopefully 1/10 my vote will help him in this way.
