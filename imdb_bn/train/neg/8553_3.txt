It's actually a pretty bad film. Doctrines are not reversed even after Collins in that film. However, my major mistakes about the film are that it is impossible and it's annoying annoying for a long time. For a particular reason, the complete idea of ​​the former SAS joining the terrorists is not very convincing and why you may not be surprised why a group of highly organized terrorists fall prey to that (which becomes very strange later). The film starts in an impressive strong scene, but it remains prolonged for long periods of time. In general, I think the winners will be disappointed that the 45-minute episode is an interesting episode but there is no feature film in the story. Although the film was reasonably successful, this movie started the death of Collins' career, who created the fate of fortune and military films mostly in the eighties. Sad, because he is actually quite versatile actor, but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his role more carefully and there is a profession that is still successful.
