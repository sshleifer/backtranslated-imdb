I went to see the Omega Code with a group of 15 total Christians. We all hope a good piece of Christian filmmaking. What we got was an excitingly painful, drawn-out, and quite annoying attempt at a movie. It has a good value to look at, but it does not have any real idea of ​​poor performance, shameless dialogue with a weak script and direction. In the first 15 minutes, we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our team kept this film for more cheese than "Anakonda". None of us could believe that this movie is less than 2 hours. Dazzling effects and sticky looking cinematography can not save these bad, bad movies. I'll give it 3 out of 10, and the rating is only high because I hired the hateful "film" Wearluff (1996) at night.
