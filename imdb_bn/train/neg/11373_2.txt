It is not clear to see the film (hence, those who present their lawsuit recommend research), but the purpose of this presentation and the promotion of violence and tolerance against all non-Muslims is absurdity, and also completely fails the human condition factor. The Qur'an demands that the Qur'an speaks a lot about how much religious Muslims need to communicate with non-Muslims, but no realist realizes that everybody who does not feel himself to be a follower of Islam, with faith and beliefs and all the principles of the system Adhere to There are many reasons to call the audience; the audience should see the presentation with a healthy suspicion; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who claimed to be a former Muslim who suppressed Bethlehem's work on terrorism. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in these claims. I'm never a Muslim. I do not read the Koran. I'm not a Christian, or many believe me But I'm an intelligent and intelligent man. Although the film is quite annoying, in the presentation of how many Muslims see their obligation towards Islam; I have reminded you that there is more to Islam than the fundamentalists' opinion. As well as their fundamentalists and missionary Christians, there is a diversity in the intensity of beliefs and obligations between Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you have to be a salt saker on hand. One grain will not be enough, you will need more. Use your own mind than what is said in the 98 minute video and think for yourself, review the presented research and evaluate the world's situation and how Islam fits in it. Those who keep this film together, there is a common thread of a political relationship, which indicates a particular bias. Be your own brain.
