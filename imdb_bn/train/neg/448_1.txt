I hate what this show is about how Leeds is written. These women have no self esteem or dignity. The whole plot is to throw their boys themselves. Amanda Bynes' genius is completely wasted. She was brilliant on "all that" and her own show. Why did they have behind him and Jenny Garth on the backpack, airhead, reckless, behind, "old maid" wannabes out of me <br /> <br /> Their plots and dialogs remind me of "Simpsons", Homer says whenever his cartoon character is not on the pooch screen, "Everyone should ask, Where is Puchi?". All the talking centers on whining about some people, and then whining some people. Sometimes they change it and instead whines people. Then they break back or end together. 2 Women are shallow, stupid, or sexual immorality. The only word I can think is "sucks".
