The mood of this movie is quite good and it is felt by some good performance of love of 80. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script is executed, except for a few comedic moments, and it comes off as weird, I hope it wanted to be intense. The script is full of dramatic and incredible and right wing clich√©s that the script writer probably saw a panorama documentary in front of the national. The biggest problem is that there is no real story in this movie. It all ticks in the right "arty" box, but in reality nothing will happen and ultimately you are surprised by what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating
