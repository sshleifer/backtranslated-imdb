What a joke I see this on Channel 1 and I think paint dry watching is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar van Dien roped in him in this nightmare. Terrible acting, very annoying plot and terrible aspects It's terrible, it's fun. It is supposed to be mysterious, but it's a comedy. Check out this movie if you want to see terrible acting, ridiculous script writing and sub-cross plots. If I were Van Deeven, I did not give my 10% request to my agent, but in the process I set fire to flames. What a turkey It is not even fit to be MSST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure insomnia. I especially put Van Diyan on the overboard and it comes back in a few minutes! I can only write the image that the authors were written by the non-union writers who took advantage of the strike. What a horrible movie !!!
