This is a movie about how men think about women about love. A woman narrates face to face in a night and it declares a love story. <br /> <br /> I think 10 psychologists have found that only three of them got real true real true true voices through them. I waited to make the film look better, and it was not good at all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun idea, and I want it to be good, but it did not succeed. Maybe if they loved the story, then it worked.
