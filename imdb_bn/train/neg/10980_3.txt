Really a terrific film It seems that in the early 90's it was made by a straight person that shows that the Goggles are good, natural, mainstream-aspiring people. Retrograde to objectionable point, LTR indicates that the way to get together for monogamous, lonely, sex-crazy gay and marriage is the preferred way of marriage. How nice! Who knew Supporting characters are the characteristics of gay stereotype (lungs, bitter, lonely queen, fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are small interest Milkostest, middle class, middle-class clones. <br /> <br /> As far as the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned, there is not much to say: we've seen it before and have done a lot of good.
