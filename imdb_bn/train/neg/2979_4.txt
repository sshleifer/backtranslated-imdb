"Gone with the Bound" is one of the most popular movies in history. This is a movie that loves mother, grandmother, and shut-ins who go to movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, hit it. The sight is a snail's corpse, and it's very dangerous in the Gore section. On the other hand, "Jumbo 3" is very generous with the enemies on the bodies and bloodshed - so, it is better than "gone with the wind". It is not overrated Most critics are unclear that under any confusion. This, though, is not annoying. After stealing a terrorist virus, it drops when he is being followed by helicopter, and leak into the chemical ground. The terrorist, who has been facing a nasty conspiracy, is hiding in a hotel room where he gradually became a homemade meat. Her first victim is a clean lady. Once he was bitten, Lucio Florchi's brand of hell broke. Naturally, for the flowering flick, the actress is violent, the storyline jumps into the plot, and Gou is abundant. Launched the film directed by Phulasi and Bruno Mati, to interpret the schizophrenic nature instead. It was shot very badly, very badly edited and sound design flat. Nevertheless, it lies in the killing and is preserved by his lukewarm loyalty by his indifferent passings. If you are an unwanted full then you surely worth the picking. Or did not "go with the wind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
