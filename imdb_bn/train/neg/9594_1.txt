I just registered the IMDB to comment on this picture. <br /> <br /> I was sitting through this movie, and the way it affected me was that I do not want to stop it anyhow. <br /> <br /> I have seen quite a number of action movies and what not, but the most fierce fights I have ever seen in a movie of the Princess Blade. Most of the sword battles are undoubtedly hoping that the swords hanging behind the sword and on the fourth and the opponents are not doing the same. I have seen many good student films with good action and strong plot. <br /> <br /> Now we have a "future" action movie which is a bad job, and there is no sign of a practically future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies have no work and it shows the development relationship between princesses and peasants / terrorists and his disturbed sister. The film has multiple plot lines and none of them is valuable. <br /> <br /> I saw the part of the problem that the dobby was quite bad. The whole cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what's going on. But I got the general idea. (My eyes could not save the movie to know exactly what was said) <br /> <br /> If you heard about this future action / self-rule, you have heard the mistake. Thats what I thought when I had heard about it, and now I have lost 90 minutes of my life. This does not happen to you. It's a good clear steering.
