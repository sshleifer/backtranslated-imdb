I have seen other guinea pigs films like Manhole and Heroes Die Dies, like Marie, and they are quite sick, but at least they have a wonderful idea (but dark). Although there is nothing more than a movie, there is a plot of punishment for submission to a young girl in various ways of Satan's examination, torture and violence and there is no plot and there is no ransom. It is probably not afraid distant without mind-set, but it is certainly hateful and I certainly will not say it entertainment. Now, I'm not the character of good taste in movies and I like my trash and sled, but it was too much for me. For all the annoying, in fact, I find out that annoying thing whenever possible, but this was a little more. Kicking the young girl, the headphones are stored up to the teeth through continuous noise, and then torn with raw meat and hearts and hanging in the jungle with a hammer. If you think that it seems to be fantastic, but go for it, but it will definitely stop seeing me guinea pig stuff. 10 out 1, absolutely boring
