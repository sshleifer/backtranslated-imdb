I was in the premiere of the 1997 film Toronto Film Festival. After screening, when a writer / director and some cast members offer an answer to any question, no one can be bothered to ask anyone. Very rarely has a movie been so badly directed (why did the random frame tumble out of some scenes in the world?), Played badly (to parade David's Arkett, Dorothy Parker, he does not run the opening shoes of A to B., and brings a lunch) and Absolutely in vain The character behaves completely in character for no reason except to remove the character from the specific direction. For a long time, the film comes to a completely random and unending end that is supposed to "really make you think". Unfortunately, this is what you think is, "Well, I have 90 minutes of my life and I'm not coming back."
