This film became very optimistic with a story about a director who lost his sight and a blind woman who was forced to help him. However, somewhere between the script writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> One incredible incident followed the next (Russia must be very small because they are all bumper each other, all the time), inspiring to understand the senses of the female character (why did she follow it after closing the ship? Do not try to call anyone on the ship for a mobile phone?), The next story was completely ridiculous (the boyfriend and boyfriend were supposed to be funny? And with a younger sister? What was pati?). Still, the film is completely expected to have this objectionable deliberate plot. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing about this is that there are many possibilities. I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visual and the score were very nice and the main characters were also good actors. So it could really be a good film ... but it was not.
