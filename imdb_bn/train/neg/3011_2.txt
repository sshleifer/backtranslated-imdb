I was very excited to see this movie, expecting a visual journey on artistic beauty and nature's relationship, including the "river and tide" of wisdom type. However, I did not get it. Instead, I get a fairly uninspired film about how bad people are in the industry for me. Which is clearly an incomplete claim. <br /> <br /> Photographer feels confused about the aesthetic qualities of her paintings and she often disagrees with the supposed "moral" duty to open the images with pictures on the edges. And undoubtedly, the images are generally not that impressive. And according to this "Artist" scale, some of the grounds make it beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all cases, a stupid movie. For those who want to feel good about their environmental consciousness ... but who do not want to think about the complexity of these neighborhood problems.
