Oh dear I was very disappointed that this movie was a rip-off of the Japanese ringuo. Well, I guess America also made its version, but at least it was a completely rebuild. So, so sad. I enjoy watching Filipino movies and I know that some great things can come out of this little country, so I can not believe that this will happen. Claudine and Chris are so big names, they are surprised that they are related to the theft. Any damn filmmakers in the Philippines: You do not have to lower these people to earn money. Filipinos have many movie buffs that make out and watch in their enjoyable movies!
