I was not really surprised .... movies are not better than the books that were produced. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because it was one of my favorite books, though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they moved away from the story of the book and the movie version did not reveal how terrible it was. The end was very different. Lara Flin Bole looked terrible because of some really bad cosmetic surgery. Best of acting was unmarkable at best. Perhaps the dramatic version is made so that it does not have to be so much in the life time "Made for TV movie" box, but it would be a good flick. If you have seen this movie then I encourage you to read the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and hopefully every time I read it I enjoy it.
