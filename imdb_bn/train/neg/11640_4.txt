I like to call him at Pierre Paolo Pasolini, or PPP (due to love of male reproduction), perhaps the most prominent European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground. How can see "art" in this dirty, cheap sex-rope concoction is beyond me. Here some "stories" may come out directly from a soft-core pornographic film, and I do not talk too much about nudity, but simple and common, often unpleasant stories. Anyone who enjoyed this relatively cluttered but stupid curiosity must "dur Schulmaedchenreport" sink his teeth in the film series of soft-porn German 70, because it looks like "Dissmun". <br /> <br /> The movie is run away from all levels till the end: <br /> <br /> 1. Edit An example: 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds is a retreat scene that is completely clear in the wrong place. It should have been kept about a minute later, but I guess Pasolini must be forced to hire the editors to maintain, who have little time to make "fine detail" of making movies. Pee-pee-pee fans would probably resist by saying that it was deliberately installed - which I suspect is too much. Besides, even if it was true, it would be even worse, because following the story does not make it difficult to achieve anything. (It's not just one of the "Eraserhead" or Tarantino's broken-form movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting Vey sloppy Triple pie fans (8 of them all) proudly use "3P-O" using "real men instead of actors". (Actor is not a man or is Martian? Of course, many actors have sub-par IQ, but should that mean we should disrespect them?) Other directors have used amateur and have succeeded (like Alan Parker or De Niro), why the PPP MPA is so awful in his movie? Answer Again sloppiness is panic. Pasolini is all soft, and trying to get as much as possible the toothless people of their teeth. She is a lazy director, if you want an IMPERFECTIST. Anti-Kubrick, I think ... The main goal of PEPPP is to find out the teeth of elderly people (and their favorite young people) as far as possible for older persons of Casting. There is a common source in the world of passolin: lack of tooth + odd face = realism. It's all good and great to be teeth-free, but at least try to find at least semi-decent performance from these inexperienced Neo-Theesians, otherwise you are an amateur amateur - an amateur director in Pasolini. 3P-0 was not able to achieve this achievement or there was no change in anything that did not change. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even see terrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization. If 3P-0 feels that the microphone has a lot of trouble while drawing a film, then he tried to try together at least to produce, that is, to tell all these left actors their lines in the studio so that we can not look at the faces of the audience, elsewhere in the movie Incognito dialogue will continue. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of ideas. We have about a dozen stories that are not meaningfully connected. Some are designed to make headlines and other things that create anti-church ideas (more on later), some simply mere sexual twist, such as cheap men (sometimes gay) fantasies. The stories and the characters are not funny at the intelligent stage (if at all) but at the lowest level. 10 year old kids can laugh here ... and there is no mistake, but still do not call it high quality, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, there is a growing argument for the story. It's not saying. PPP could keep the order in any other way and we used the same movie. This means that you can start from the beginning and then go back to the beginning. Etc. "Decameron" Spaghetti is like a bowl: The way you start eating it, you can start with any thread, making it no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The story 'resolves foolishness. Most of the stories end with a cheaper gogh / joke, something extraordinary mobile phone pinlight beyond a pornographic book, although there is no conclusion of some stories: they just end up. Finito At the best times, stories are semi-novelties, only meaning deep money - unless you find "deep" meaning in a language. Of course, there is nothing easier than to find "feeling" and finding its absence. Therefore, any hardcore pornographic film can be continuously philosophical / mixed. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> For the revolt of the Church ... some observers are excited about the attack on Catholics and what they do not. Basically, it's all good and fine - above all, I'm not an atheist myself - but those who ignore it are simple but essentially true that the Westlis were Marxist. Calling black castle like a pot. Criticism of the Church for a Marxist silence and stupidity? Where does he get nervous? Besides, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his high-mighty and self-righteous attitude is not fair. Above all, Marxists believe: they only replaced the acceptable God with the idea of ​​the borrowers, which is just another supernatural deliberate thinking. So I can not get excited about the anti-religious antics of PPP. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it? "He was not actually mentioning this silly little movie like the industry, what was he? If he wanted - poor confused people - then I was amazed why he did not give up when he dreamed, and did not make those bad films ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you want to read my changed subtitles?
