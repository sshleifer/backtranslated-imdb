I do not understand how these animated movies are coming out, and people do not like how good it is (or worse). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They like animated many beautiful things (most people who rate this film). The theater was almost full, and I look forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. I was stupid bored to tell the truth. It was incredible predictable and just plain unfunny. There was a couple chuckles across the movie and that was. Of course they try to get cheaper laugh time and time again, but do not work. My son almost always tells me that he wants a DVD, we see an animated movie, but not for this. My daughter was asleep by half way. Also, kids' character animations looked weird. I have heard from them that Polar Express saw my daughter nightmare. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm not the one who thinks all things negative. But the quality is quality and they throw it out like many animated movies, it's very few.
