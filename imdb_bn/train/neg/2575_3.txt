This does not really match up to Cagliostro's Castle. Not as funny or sloppy or hyperactive as lupine. The scenery and music are uninspired and the plot is not just interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only good thing is Fujiu's nudity (only in the uncut version). It helps to spice up some annoying scenes. CoC was a villain and set up the movie for some fictional set pieces. The location in TSoTG is not too vivacious or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zinta, Gomeen and Jenz do not provide performance even for entertainment at this time. They are just like to meet a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /> <br /> DVD full-frame with DVD stereo sound. It has a modest amount of additional, with several trailers. But a strange thing. Once inserted player does not have any chapter selection on the disk or timeline displayed. Although you can avoid the next scene number using Remote.
