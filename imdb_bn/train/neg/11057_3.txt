What about dama's childhood? - Is the operation of Double Herenia spreading panic with the internal activities of the human body? What about "infinite land"? The game was discovered as a child that destroyed the stick man as close to each other, which meant that the pregnancy was the final danger. His relationship with his parents, and his mother's mental problem, which was more relevant than his own relationship to his father? His brother's negligence on his birth? What about its estuaries with insects and animals? How did he break the road and hang in the wood behind his house? Will focus more on his cancer? And what about his parents divorce? All these things that should have been included in the film. Instead, the filmmaker chose to supply us with snapshots of one or two nights of life and combined with confusing series and occasionally unnecessary flashbacks, in events that were not particularly relevant for our understanding of Dahmor. <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Why does the creator of the photo not see how Dahmara was interested in people as objects? He could have made this point many times, especially in the scenes where he drove his victims, when he had sex with them (which was actually a health club, not a dramatic club). Instead she looks ramming away from behind him. <br /> <br /> I'm just grateful that you can cram in only 90 minutes (or longer) so much information, but why spend so much big part examining its relationship with Louis Pant? (Known as Rodney in this photo). My only guess is that the director tried to build Pint's character, tried to give us fear or sympathy, but this film could be about Jeffrey Dahmar, why could not he spend these forty minutes? What is anything else? If the scene and their relationship were substantially important then only fair enough, but it was not. The scene of the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks, is an important part of Jeffrey Dahmar's story because it was due to the first killings and the impact on the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the film does not explain its first murder or whether it has not killed again for nine years. We guess, because her hairstyle is different, and she's wearing glasses that it's a flashback, but when? And why? <br /> <br /> What about the house he had built in his sitting room at the end of his career? Our most important formula to understand Dahamar and his motivation is that some people may find my need for true authenticity and a little bit detail, but in Jeffrey Dahmar's study in depth, see it. The film is very similar to Plain that its individual and the crimes she did. Why Jeffrey is reluctant to spend time preparing a film based on Dahmar? Rather than dealing with the main problems of its breeding and upcoming killings in madness <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be no 18 certificate, at number 15. We have to look deeper in our isolation, understand that he was different from the rest of us. This does not mean that the drill that is actually shown in the head of the Conakra Sinasomofone, for example, is an indication of at least the number of people killed, and actually what was the modus operandi at the time of the killing. Anyone seeing this picture who does not know the story of Dahmara may think that he killed only a few. He actually killed seventeen people. <br /> <br /> Without the lack of information and depth, the film is not all bad. There are some excellent cinematography, and better performance than the two main characters. I want to work again by a filmmaker who has more knowledge, more power, and the first place is a good reason for filmmaking.
