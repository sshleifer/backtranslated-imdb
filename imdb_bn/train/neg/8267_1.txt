I'm starting to see a pattern giving 1 to 1 movie. They made me watch my wife almost all the movies Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste of the movie. However, these pre-teen girls' goals are usually drawn but worse than usual. Again, the author broke the original rule of which film. He made the original character unlikely. She starts with a complete b * tch to her friend at the beginning, and then she finds out at the age of 30, she is basically a sh * tty person (topics, etc.). Why do we feel for this person? Okay, let's get past that we can. Jennifer Garner can get as far as you can without any kind of distortion. I do not know whether this is the fault of his or the author, but his character has gone out of Threshold for the annoyance. Here is a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are not entertaining, they are boring. At the most shameful moment in the movie, when they start dancing in the "Thriller" Holy chains that are painful It's that dance practice at its beginning. He explains why he knows it, but a whole club people ??? Oh !!! McCannina will be more credible! Suddenly he was completely incompetent and how could he do his job and did not show any notice? At least in the "Big", the character of Tom Hans was a job that could be understood by the child. Switching to this body / child becoming an adult overnight movie is really getting out of hand, and this is far too far.
