Back in the 1970s, WPIX ran "Superman of Superman" each week for several years. Once every time, we would like to get a treatment if we want to warm the neighboring programs "Superman and Mole Man" in the air. I always looked for those days. Recently seen this, I was really surprised that it was actually bad. <br /> <br /> It was not bad due to special effect or its lack. Indeed, George River's Superman costume was very bad, the edges of the foam padding seemed to be more applicable to him to be clearly visible. And true, the joke of men was even worse in the dress. Zupira, silave hem, and poorly-punched fabric are considered to be a woolen cover despite being poorly fit in bag clothes, it could not make a ten-year fool. But there was this harmful error. <br /> <br /> No, it was a bad commercial platform. Time and again, Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from bad. A lynch mob is searching for animals? Rather than surrounded by a violent crowd or searching for animals, he stood by explaining the dangers of the situation to Luis and PR John. Are there corners of animals? Again, he is watching and talking around but does not save them until they are shot. Luca Benson, the city's RAB-Roger, shot him? Attempt to kill a reasonable person, but Superman gives up man for more problems. Superman's thorns had several opportunities to resolve the problem, but sometimes they did not enjoy them. <br /> <br /> Both of them, George Reeves and Phillis Quotes have played well, probably comfortable in roles. If only a good script is given to work with them.
