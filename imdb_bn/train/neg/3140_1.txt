I think I would probably like the best of the new Star Wars movie "Phantom Menace", it will probably be outside the "Titanic" water, if you forgive the punishment, the office receipt, and as a result it is number one spot out. Every time I hear someone say that "Titanic" is their best film, I think myself, "You do not see many movies, do not you?" What a sarcasm You can create 50 good films that are much better than "Titanic" and for the same price tag. <br /> <br /> "Well, it won many academy awards, many people really liked it" someone could say his defense. Well, the McDonalds eat a lot of people like Spice Girls, billions, and billions of people, but it does not mean high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans may be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the part of the problem for me was Mega-Hip on the film. I waited a month to see it and, finally, it did not meet the expectations placed on it, which attracted more attention in the story of simply stupid fools. It is true, "Phantom Menace" will probably enjoy similar luck. But <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" A) Flame rubbing disguised as a serious piece of sugar action. B) Three-hour epic that is the best moment given in the trailer. C) A sad love story outside of belief or entertainment. D) There is something good about the documentaries, which I have enjoyed more. e) A movie of arrogance living up to the level displayed with real ships. F) 3 hours of robbery that I will never get back, so I can remember the best motivation for a time machine. When I can see someone who does not see it yet, I say, "I can trade places with you." G) Hypotharamia is a real victim of a slap in the face. How long can we believe that cold water cools down and yet the intelligent sentences can be made? H) Thanks, a movie which is recognized for any performance achievement in Oscars. I) create a technical achievement in the film, and anything else. <br /> <br /> The only reason I post it as an anonymous comment is that I do not welcome 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo Di Caprio, who do not doubt his defense came, and I'm really interested in hearing Titanic's story, acting or length. Not so.
