I can not believe how uneducated this movie is. It is like watching the police academy, if it is not with those people, there is no source of what they are saying, and ... wait, a fool robot that should be a sided. I understand the suspension of disbelief, but it's just totally stupid There is no plot in this movie only. It is looking at someone who pretends to be a doctor, often throwing irrational words as the chief of the staff as a major medical facility. Plus people are wearing clothes that are unfitting for a space program. I think I see a valley girl "B" in the film, space.
