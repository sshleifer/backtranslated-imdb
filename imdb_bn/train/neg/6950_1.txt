We all knew before being promoted, Ron Moore's mini-series is not a galactica of a ballotista. That's okay It just means it must stand on yourself. It can not depend on Battlestar Galactica. If it is good then it is good for your own ability and Ron Moore has something to boast about. If the report is true, what did Moore want? However, if his short series rots, he is not ashamed to mention the shameful, off-screen curtailed staff of all the excellent actors performed on the screen. And this is what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini series is no reconstruction. I do not even call it a fantasy. This is a new product, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not happen with the same place and words and technology in the galactica universe. It does not refer to Galactic's search for thirteen tribes. No it does not depend on the legend and mystery underpinned Galactica. Ron Moore's short series A Space-opera, Action Flick officially presented to Batlaster Galactic. <br /> <br /> Maybe you have to say, "another" space-opera, action flick. To go as a plot, its slightly original, even attractive. I could relay the whole thing without warning you a spoiler. But I will not blame you on that. I'll just hit the most important points. Ready now? Here it is: just watch the trailer. Yes <br /> <br /> Yes, the Creator of human beings wants to destroy people by making humans. (I think they have forgotten Azizov's rules.) They look like humans, so we have the whole alien-we have things. There is at least no time travel. Oh, many war scenes and random acts of sexual and violence. The final result was when Murray was drawn from Galextika, the formal proposal dried up more than respect. I mean, he can not even think of himself? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes I wanted to see something else. I'm not worried about the character of Moore, because I could not identify with any of them. This incident hit me when Cylons started their attack. Armageddon on the scale of a planet, and I do not give a curse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only way to protect humanity is by jad jad jad. They have chosen the safer way instead of risking their life to protect others. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Ron Moore Mini series was an activity without any purpose, a movie of a trompo ,telas, was not going anywhere yet. And I just wanted to be it. And when the time is over, my life has been sucked from me. Against my own will, I was going into a psychological, soulless zombie, which kind of would probably appeal to this mini series. I have to fill myself. I wanted to do this and I swear to the fact that I needed to see 5 episodes of Babylon. Actually two episodes, and I felt much better. And happy
