I'm so confused. What was this movie in the world? What was the motivation of the killer? He was very angry, but I still can not understand why. This movie has nothing understood. It was a zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I suppose it will make a mountain. Or a stack. Shit Acting was terrible. When I was looking for some of the actors of this movie, they had very few things that I heard, and it was not surprising. I can not decide whether they should be sorry for the disappointment of the movie, or they should not offer another acting job again. Getting started . . Are now! (Seinfeld references.) Really, though, do not waste your time with this. There is nothing so much fun that there is nothing to do. It was undoubtedly one of the worst slash flicks - no, one of the worst Flickr, which I could never have seen, and I saw a couple of things.
