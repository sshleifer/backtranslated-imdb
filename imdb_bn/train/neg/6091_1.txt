I bought a gloriously gratuitous sensational, above, recreational bloodbath in this movie. I got one of them. This film really fails at every level, is not least horror or funny, it only produces terrible movies and does not provide any valuable things to the visitors. It is so bad that the promise of being raw, violent and cruel is far away, there have been very few violence. Virtually no blood shed, and no tension. Acting, direction and dialogue are absolutely intolerable. Really, this is really ridiculous. I could fairly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly do not want to see it again. Do not waste your time on celluloid waste; This is really probably the worst movie made. If I could give it a bit bigger, I'd like to
