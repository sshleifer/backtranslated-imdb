When you get your hands on a British film, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, light etc.; This image is business. It is done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an estimated one and a half hours. But when you look under the professional level, you really do not find anything. Besides feeling good to you and supporting a drug-liberal perspective, there really is nothing to do. Script medium, plot predictable and end up being Hollywood's worst past one. In all its English pleasure, it is only a shameful and cruel attempt to create another "full Monti". Why did they make this picture? I certainly did not get a yarn, without making money.
