I just registered this comment (which echoed some of the majority here), the performance is worse than the suborder, it is usually spread over stereotypes held, most of the colorless female physics (all the bod brain) is the worst display, There are some lines. <br /> <br /> "Everyone lets see what these guys can do," but they are not limited to. I should also mention that when they show innocent citizens involved in crashes, you end up feeling bad feelings for innocent people and hate their own characters. The character of Eddie Grafin is one of the most painful black people, which only guides the wrong way. He may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow for such a character search. Do you want a movie to leave the audience next to that bad guy? Ocean 11. This movie only hates bad people instead of keeping visitors to you. <br /> <br /> Even movies can not be ready for this movie. That Enzo Griffin completely wrecked up this movie sums up. It just sucks.
