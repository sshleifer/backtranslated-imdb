In the worst case-my-like-no-no-no-movie scene was: If Willis's goal was to save the doctor, he was forced to take out his "people" missionary. He will be left in the first helicopter and beyond the boundaries of those refugees. He will not compromise his package for refugees. How does it work? But, as I mentioned, this Hollywood, we must have the drama. That's why we make movies, because the reality is not very complicated. However, I think Willis and the well-known doctor had chemistry functioning. That said, there are some good work scenes in the film. It's not a waste of time, "sun tears" DVD rental fee pricing. Check it out in the rainy days and you'll be satisfied.
