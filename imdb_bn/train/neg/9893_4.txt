I only hope that any classicist / ancient historians do not see "Cleopatra", or if they did, they started laughing at it. The film is even more odd, more ridiculous than "gladiator" (even at least a well-written script which is clear in its historical flaws and in line with the story). Before Caesar's assassination, Seychel's successor Octavius ​​is most embarrassed: At the age of 19 years old, <br /> <br /> as well as acting moderate. When Timothy Dalton pointed out James Bond, he said, "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Jane is a ridiculous dense Mark Aunty. And Leonora's Bhorela tried his best to tempt his Pharaoh (who did not see all the good in the real life) but was stopped as unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This is a warning for all these historians - this film is not true in life!
