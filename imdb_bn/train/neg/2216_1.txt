I am the lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for you to stop thinking about anything else in your world. Even a stupid B-movie will even laugh at me and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so awful that I had to register IMDB so that I could warn others. At first there was science of making Shark-Man, which rarely touched the film. To keep viewers interested, they are sure that there was blood every few minutes. During the attack scene, the camera moved away from the attack, but you saw that the bloodletting was a bleeding bucket to tell you that the blood was bloody and probably the person was dead (what a super special effect). On returning to science, I found it very interesting that women's test subjects were kept naked and testing tools needed to be monitored by their breast tissues. However, this movie is weak plot development, terrible stories, and I'm pretty sorry to say acting. Even William ForSouth, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Cambos could not save the spots.
