In the first part, Cheba Cuba is about that part of her life. There are many different battles in it, and Che is taking care of many vulnerable wounded (remember that he was a physician). It ended by the victory of the Castro Revolution; Che gets Havana. The second part is Che, what is guessed in Bolivia. There are many separatist wars in it and many of the highly categorical injured in the Che. <br /> <br /> When I realized it was an "epic" (I never knew * but before I knew the title), I naturally think of their greatest epic, Lawrence of David Lin's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the same way, especially they all wear "Che" beard and consider wearing all the Che Chee fatigues. In viewers, this result is not able to identify anyone other than Che, Bancio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). Although Dell Torro is horrific, it appears to be the only visual character with "Lawrence" with Peter O'Wowel: no Alex Guinness, nor Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn. You get this idea. <br /> <br /> Other characters are interchangeable, this reference results in a loss. Che's top associates are killed, you feel no regret, because you do not know who they are. Even when Che died, (I think it is not a mockery), there is no sympathy from the audience - he's just dead. <br /> <br /> She is like a human being a dimensional. In addition to the revolutionary and second stage against Jesus on the basis of moral integrity, what we learn about Che is that he married five children (he told another character in the end). What was his motivation? A complete enigma <br /> <br /> Perhaps Soderbergh is deliberately aping lin. Like Soderberg's Che, Lean never knows anything about our Lawrence, mysterious person in Arabia. But at least one of Lawrence's friends (Sharif) and associate (Guinness, Quinn) was there. He was helpless as he was helpless - for example, there were human attributes. Che is like a machine, as warmer as the Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war epic in Mongolia. Looks like this is a wonderful life.
