I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and it's a charming side to the Chennai Rice. I do not want that fairly spenny. Spenny ruins this movie. He allowed Kenny and his hot girlfriend to pitch the film. However, it is quite annoying with viewers with Roger Ebert. There are not really many celebrities in this movie, and mostly do not seem to be multiple lines. Overall this movie was frustrating. I only suggest watching it if you got it with the 1st DVD Kenny vs. Wicker of the season (it comes free for a third disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to check out PayPal Chase.
