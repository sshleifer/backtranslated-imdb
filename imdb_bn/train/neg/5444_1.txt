It was 1974 and it played Martin Shane. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the Slovak reformed, got a good woman, and the war Did not want to. <br /> <br /> In real life, Salvic can be an innocent innocent, or he just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Anyone who did not or was not for the decision making of Slovak, but it was a movie when a country was fighting when it was asked why it was fighting and took the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If there is no relation to Victim in Vietnam, in 1974 (Willie Nelson says, let's say the truth, it was about war in Vietnam, not WWII), EOS was campaign as Gong Ho The plaintiff was in Forties. <br /> <br /> According to this movie, Slovik said its location, plain and easy. She had a nervous problem. Hack, I have clinical nervous condition, and believe me, if I did military duty, then my nerves only let my nerves go and could fail in my work and could get a deposit or KPTT or not. Latrine responsibility without any problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe in Telefilk, then Slovic did not have an option, because of his criminal history <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, Believers want to believe. The services or military duty that I have been able to deal with this decade or decade movies will also accept most of the same opinion. <br /> <br /> Serve your country in the 1940s and 1950s. <BR> <br /> In the 1960s and 1970s, make fun of your country. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie looked like Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and when he was executed he became emotional. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional explosion could have been easy to work with in its declaration of nervous condition, but perhaps the film wanted to show him as a man and he would soon become sad when he died. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought that the girl of the summer was married to Mary, and finally the camp was fun with the prayer of the Lord, because they saw who they could say quickly. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie can be seen without realization. Trick Dick Nixon and Vietnam War <br /> <br /> I hope it is valuable for Salvic and anyone who likes to follow his example.
