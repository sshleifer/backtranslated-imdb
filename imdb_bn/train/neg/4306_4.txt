There is a good thing in this movie: Lola Galdini's ass! Sorry so sorry but this is true. Very bad he is not a nude. It has at least made this mess. We see other chick boobs but she is nowhere near Lola. And man, what is the Ardent Assent? People look like screaming! As a result "the normal B-movie that you expect. The story was possible. They had a good idea but they do not know how they are run. Cinematography is just a general awful. Ugly! The guide is uninspired and the end result is played in a bland thriller and played with lame twists. Lola Gaudini is as great as a cheap, slutty way vixen but she also stores "results" from trash and not fun trash, just plain old stinking trash.
