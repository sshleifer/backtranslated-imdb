The worst movie seen from Gingerrell's afternoon I think it's a horror / comedy. I pretty much predict each scene of this movie. Special effects were not so special. I believe that I can have a good influence from what I said around the house. I could say something like this about the movie, but I do not fear that I do not. Even the Kulio should be ashamed to be present in Turkey. After a little thought, there is something good to say about this movie - it's been over.
