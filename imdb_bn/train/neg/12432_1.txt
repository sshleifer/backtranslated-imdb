This is the greatest movie ever seen ever! See part 1 and 2, but nobody will say that it is better than the first two! I mean, really, you do not make a movie, then create a siggle with the same characters and actors, and then make another series with different characters and actors! I mean, if it does not have a "home allon" movie then it's OK, but they make it a home solo movie. Culkin is now too old, so make you guess off making sequels! Love, this movie makes me sick! Buy Part 1 and 2
