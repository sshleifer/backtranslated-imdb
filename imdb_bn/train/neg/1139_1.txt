Please note that I did not see the film since the discovery of it in 2007, and my city is small and it does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm actually researching the title character Richard Morris Buck at the University and I want to point out that based on the main character they were in fact totally different !!! Hollywood ideas and artistic licenses have been given, really Dr. The rest have completely supported violence for the healing of dementia among women, and never used it as generous to represent the film. I think, ridiculous to see the critics of various movies who are writing for legitimate newspapers, which have some historic grounds for this movie! The only real event I can see is Friendship between Beck and Walt Whitman. Do not waste your time in a movie by the film industry, who truly feel proud of the horror of the experience of this doctor.
