There have been many unknown movies or movies that I really liked gave bad reviews. It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> it decreased and used the camera strategy which I thought was seeing a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and was taking most movies and then went on to say, "What's this?" Once I decided not to take the film seriously and saw it from a very frankly perspective, it became more enjoyable. This is a film that still hits the MTS 3000.
