I chose to watch this movie because it got a good score in IMDB. But many people have actually got poor taste or some are fixing the score. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was really frustrating. The movie is just as stupid and movies as fetched away. There is no reason to summarize the plot - but here's it: It seems like someone thinks: "Would not it be great to make a movie where there was a snake in the air? And then some snakes go crazy and bite and stuff will start ?!" That's about it! The plot is slim and unoriginal. Snakes are bad CGI (but it gives ideas to spend the corners in a movie that none of their right mind will recommend!) The acting is poor, and all people are incredible stereos. <br /> <br /> To add it: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - Stay away!
