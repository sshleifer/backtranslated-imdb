I always thought people were very little about this old Andy Hardy movie. A couple of them were not bad. Modern film critics generally do not like such addictions, which are very good-like two shoe films. <br /> <br /> I can not save this movie. You may still have a date dialog but still laughs and laughs. If you see this, you ask your own head, "How can you get stupid?" If you know what I mean, it's less than Konai. It is so intelligent that I actually can not sit for a long time for a lot of people. <br /> <br /> This story is essentially trying to get out of the "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) jam because he is involved in some debutant from New York City It makes some stories about things that were final. In the old days people were much more socially aware. You will hear the word "social-magnet" as if rich or beautiful people are intelligent but this is the highest achievement you can make in life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Find out. Also, if you like to sing Judy Garland, then this is your ticket, because she sings some songs here and she stops her way in the heart of Andy. Oh man, I almost even write about this!
