Well, I ordered my pay-per-view in this house because I was bored and started laughing. I must admit, I used to chocolate several times, but I do not think they were in any part. I did not understand why this movie was made. It may be a comedy but seriously, I do not find a singer sex, or a naked 70 year old woman is not very funny. This film has been trying to fit itself into the comedy 'Gross Out' of American Pie and Road Trip in recent years, but it just unfortunately failed. It was quite a fair way then it was a comedy. Why, Cameron Dij has added his name to this movie in the world?!? This was the only thing I liked about this movie when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I was sexy and enjoyable and it worked well. Also, avoid this movie. 3/10
