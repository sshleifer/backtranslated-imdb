Really, I can not believe I spent 5 dollars in this movie. I was a huge zombie fanatic and thought that movies might not be that bad. Was it zombies right? I was wrong! The film was a momentary moment ... I thought it was cold when the man burst on his head, but that was it. Overall, I think it would be more enjoyable to make more slides in Vinegar's VAT to secretate a razorblood slide on my bare nuts, then watch this movie again. The film could have been better if we could see some fools, then we saw trailers for other films produced by this company. Beware of buyers ... if you are not in mochochism.
