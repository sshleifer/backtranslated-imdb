I started watching this movie with my girl friend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I can stay in the end. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I like Gene Hughes Angle, but I think he would have to eat us, and so he took it to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, others can not say 'art' or something that I could not express, but that I did not understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only bad movie I've seen was the crash, but I'm sure that now there's enough experience to see it successfully again. <br /> <br /> Best wishes !! ; O)
