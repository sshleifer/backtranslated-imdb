O god The idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. In addition to the point it seems to be written by a 5 year old. The plot, acting and even the film's screenplay and filming were all out of disrespect. <br /> <br /> I usually do not have this critical about any movie, because every person has his style. But this film was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and I think it must be so, because such movies are a joke to the romantic genre. <Br> <br /> I would recommend only movies to anyone who is a fan of Thriller movies or even to stay away from this movie.
