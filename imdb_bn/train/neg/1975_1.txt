To be perfectly honest, I did not see many Western movies, but I found out which one is good. This is the worst western country on today's planet. Are there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that the movie of the wall would be closed which everyone loved, little or no, completely annoyed! Secondly, in that day and age, women did not have the tendency to carry black women and use guns. Asian chick says English is perfect? If the setting is west then Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay cock was not too much, the film was just shit since the beginning. Now do not make me wrong. I'm not racist or white, so after reading this movie teacher will not have to, I have never seen this movie the worst presentation of black people!
