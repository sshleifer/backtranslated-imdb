Dragstrip Hollow's ghost is a violent movie in the early 1950s. This is not a horror or science fiction movie. The plot expressed concern over a group of thirteen people who are kicking in their "hot rod" club because they can not fill the rent. Once kicked, they decided to try an old Hunted House. The only saving grace for the film is that "Ghost" (Paul Blaestale in Shrey's Suit), Bleddale's work turned out to be the giant of the movie.
