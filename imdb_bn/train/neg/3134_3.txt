"Fallen ones" fall under the category of waste of life (WOL). I regret that I was not two hours old now. My other family members also watched the movie and made embarrassing comments on the screen and made original for Mmidi. I felt sorry for the actor (Wagner). I read another negative review and can not add anything else to this movie, it can reduce it to 25 minutes, so it can take a 30-minute slot on the TV without any platform. It reminds me of a dish that has good ingredients, but if it is served it is not a smoked mixture. According to my modest opinion, 42 feet Mummy should be 8-10 feet and accept the mysterious concept and instead replace many people who want to deny the truth and want DNA samples for bad reasons. The heroes are denied and they give ear to their college. After all was screwed by evil people. Save the heroes' day and everyone will prove wrong.
