Come, what is the deal with this event, how do power rangers? I always felt that the show was originally brought from Japan, which was great in Japan, and toy trade became the most ridiculous and arbitrary excuse in history! <br/> <br /> Bad hairstyles, bad costumes, earrings, etc. The humorous ridiculous images in the early 1990's show two derision, bulk and from school, "Dua", Main actor, Jason, Trine, Tommy, Kimberly , Billy and Jack, I just want to say one thing: give me a BREAK day! <br /> <br /> Disney has bought the rights to this event almost five years ago from Japan and then Disney. <br /> <br /> Now the crowd will have to withstand the repetition of this show on the Disney Channel. <br /> <br /> I can say again I have to give a break!
