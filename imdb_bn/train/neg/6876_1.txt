The French girl, the freedom fighter, 17-year-old boy, to be released from sexuality for sex of 17-year-old virgin boy, is too much meat to go out of the breathless breath of Illinois air to help the 17-year-old farm boy down? Help! I am so annoyed and amazed by the irrationality of this photo that I can not clearly say how ridiculous it is.
