Last night I saw this movie and I have already been struggling to remember a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals who escaped from a place suppressing colony. They fly a spaceship dustbin carrier moon; When there, they terrorize the dust workers who work on money. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that scientists of low budget are often involved in desert planets or like this movie, criminals flee colonies from the colony. Why this I have no idea. But I can say with certainty that such films are always barbaric. This one is really no exception. It's a decent credit sequence and half start with reasonably good music soundtrack starting well. Then it degenerates into an annoying Sci-Fi thriller. There are very few results in this movie that I am literally struggling to write a helpful review, so if you read it, I apologize to you not being able to illuminate the film's neutrality and discretion. For the record, I remember a tired body of baddi, a tired bundle of powders, some atomic surgery and a nude woman. Even more than I am struggling. <br /> <br /> If you think you may be interested in Chunter Dustin Men's Activities, then I will not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would suggest them to your friends who wish to sleep them and steal their wallets.
