Making a movie about eating a baby by wild dogs and wrongly accused of killing the soil is a real challenge, but it succeeds in the success of these successes. Maril Strip shows his life, musician, excessive damage, but that humorous talent that makes you laugh even when you fight with extreme humor like mother. <br /> <br /> If dogs are not humorous about feeding children, you can be uncomfortable seeing it in your cup of cup, and yes, it is a curious choice of French subjects, but the film rarely has something to do with it because its Focus on giving a showcase for accent and facial contortions. <br /> <br /> Throwing media attention and excitement into slam, and neglecting truth or ethics, gives the film a scary point that they are bad.
