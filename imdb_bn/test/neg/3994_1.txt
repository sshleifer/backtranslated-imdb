Let me get this straight ... The "lock-down" mechanism for the "church" protection can protect the spirits from leaving but the final solution is brought to the ground?! LOFL! Maybe I miss the plot. Maybe this guy is from film or some of Ed Wood's school. This movie is about as vulnerable as the church itself. Hey ... Probably that point. That was the whole Rosemary's Baby-Esq segment Hillary. I can go to the Halloween clothing store in my corner and get a better drag than that. The whole picture needs restoration. Correctly There were so many things that played down ... many things that could jump me through my seat and through ceiling. I'm not sure the writing is false with writing or editing but the ratings I see should not be higher in rating.
