First look at 2/25/2002 - 4 of 4 (D-George P. Cosmatos): The predictive action thriller, which can guess what's happening next to a frequent movie gear. Charlie Shane is the best son of the President who does not like the rest of the President. Of course, he is involved in a situation where he has been created repeatedly and has a friend in the White House, played by Satherland, who naturally does not live this way for a long time. A reporter directed by his other friend Linda Hamilton (who can say very little or no in this meaningless role), and of course, his biggest and best friend is President (Sam Waterstein) who survived his flock despite all the end. Otherwise he is almost killed. Despite greed and acting talent load, still stupid action-pack is meaningless consciousness (all too much waste).
