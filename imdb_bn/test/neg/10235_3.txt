Carroll is the biggest of this transition time film. This film was a very classic example of "Taki" (the first real sound film was "Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, acting in this movie is very broad and very meritorious. But <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Silent" was widely employed to teach actors), created some playful scenes that were not intended to be curiosity. <br /> <br> Carole Lomarder's next superb acting ability is all the broad gestures, melodramas and enthusiastic strangers underneath. <br /> <br /> This period is primarily interesting as the historical curiosity, and it is completely unreasonable comedy - camp values.
