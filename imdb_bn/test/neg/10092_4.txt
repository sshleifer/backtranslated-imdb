Wow, I was really frustrated. I'm not really planning to watch this movie in theaters, and I'm stuck in this plan. It would be really a TV movie for the sake of creating. I was excited to see it because I was a big fan of Fareja Balak, but the film did not judge him. Actually I'm a little disappointed with acting around. Feueruza Balkh tattoos is a terrific cover, it annoys me every time I see my shoulders. <br /> <br /> There was no flow of film, it was very difficult to enter. One scene, we get angry, get excited, we want blood, when the perception increases, then the director takes us to another scene to show love between Annie and Bobby. It was more enjoyable to follow if it was split into three sectional Sunday comic strips. <br /> <br /> There were also some logic behind the selected letters to play some parts. Gangster leaders were not very credible scrawny boys. Matt Dillon is the head of the church organization? Come on, pause me. There was just no fear. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack .. Wow. I think it's one of the worst musical score I've heard. What awesome guitar solos, my God The words of my teeth were more delightful to my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> However, want to make a positive comment about the movie. The settings are done nicely. I like the colors, that's a good job to carry that duration.
