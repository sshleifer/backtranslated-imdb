<br /> <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this picture is that a common man who would disappoint this person and thirsty toxic wastes will be transformed into superheroes. Completely inconsistent term for 1985 is also unclear. This movie is listed as a horror ... I followed a series by following this series .... <br /> <br /> Now when this film was given it was too bad to be made that I did not show anymore I did not ... Acting was too horrible for an independent film that I think is a terrible part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> Drug Druging, Sumo, Godzilla Gate ... I I'm in for a glance which is running anti-drug campaign ... Head I like Godzilla and Good Sumo ... I'm not in it but still feel the height of the height of this film is to make this film 1000 hands sleeve and ground salt to create. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Shi <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < In other words, this movie is June ... Rather than seeing the leaves dry and working with explosive diarrhea, the film will be shown again ... the first person I will use is not only the film packaging as flexible But I'll be ready to burn a good movie and script.
