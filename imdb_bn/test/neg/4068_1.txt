I can not believe anyone that has actually made this film. Stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical. With the departure of 747 major aircrafts, the pilot pulled the trails at speed. Then you have five armed men, half of which are completely automatic weapon ammunition until a bullet breaks the walls of the cabin at 38,000 feet. Then a full bullet hit a FUEL line at the bottom of the stomach and we see fuel fuel from the flat side. Acting was just awesome and forced. There just does not seem to be any direction. I saw some fantastic horror movies in my life but I was very disappointed with the names of these pictures.
