The stupid stupid Gaff, from the former genius John Hughes, who will make a film about sperm from 'Look Who Talking' soon after getting some of his stars. He again re-used the 'Home Alone' formula to create this stupid comedy, where a child travels to Chicago, kidnapper J Joe Montagna, Joe Patoliano and Bryan Heli try to catch him, who endures many tired skeptics. If Montague and Pantiolano can not smile anywhere in your movie but you are having trouble, but the laxity of the film is causing the most resentment in the scene where people fail to target a child wandering around the crowd.
