Based on what I saw in this show I think I would see it again. It is not even remotely trustworthy and really Derek's character makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but seeing such a debris, he goes out of his way again and again? Why do I want to see that ?! No thanks, there are many shows that are confusing characters (for example, the future Pimph Phil) where the wicked do not win or if they are not on their way. <br /> <br /> I think drawing a picture about living with siblings is a terrible picture. Yes Life is not a pink but could try to portray a character that was not completely evil and victorious. <br /> <br /> I would like to see if you want to see Vilane Joy.
