I love comedy and I love independent films, but it was very slow and humor was very regional. I think it was good if it was a good letter choice, but it was like the general general-x slacker type, just like people who have created problems in high schools for forty years ... I understand a high appreciation of the young indie filmmakers While it's worth it, it's a very average movie.
