I was frustrated with the signal of Hannan Rajkumar. I can see what I was trying to do with the story, show how the marriage life is going on for the update and Derek, but the story was not attractive enough to attract my attention and it began to cover the same bases as the original. <Br /> <br /> This is not funny. Jean-Bob was turned into a princess and then brought back to a frog and nobody saw it happen and he was really trying to mean that it really did. <br /> <br /> Villain junk and animation is not as captivating as the first movie. <br /> <br /> Rani is a very annoying character and instead of rejoicing with Derek to rescue her mother, you are hoping that she will spell a spell in her voice box to stop her conversation. <br /> <br /> This is shameful because I really like the first movie but it does not depend on my expectations.
