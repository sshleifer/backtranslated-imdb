The genius and sincerity of this film was to create that I want to make it better. Everyone is clearly trying their best to become truth on an euphemism premises, but it is a very deep point of view, the effort involved in the emotional confusion to survive an infection on the screen. This is an attempt to capture the level of gaseum pattern of celluloid - the result is fake and slow. I try to give it a 10, but an overall 5.
