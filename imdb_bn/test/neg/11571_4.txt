28 years before 9/11, another 9/11, which represented an important date in the history of Chile, South America, and the whole world. In 1973, a bloody coup in Chile on this date, Salvador Allende was elected by the first Marxist President in any place in the world and finished the Chilean democracy transition from capitalism to the democratic transformation of capitalism. When the Armed Forces attacked Presidential Palace, Alan committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this picture was very prevalent and very nostalgic during Alander's regime. Frequently bored and Alander was a controversial figure in his country and the history of the whole world. Indeed, he was elected democratically, but his policies pushed Chile to the economic crisis. He was blocked by coup and right-wing dictatorship and was suppressed for human rights violations, but he was a collaborator of Castro, who saw another way to create a revolution. We will never know whether he will succeed immediately in building a socialist and democratic society. The authors of the film completely take hold of the album, on the other hand, there is no opinion or opinion to explain, why questioned the opposition of the middle class class, or how its democratic views can be combined with support, to answer the question. Or being supported by Castro. Speech tones are nostalgic and apologetic, almost promotional. Those who want to better understand this episode of history, they have to wait for a more balanced and motivational film or book in the future.
