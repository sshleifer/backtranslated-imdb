No! No no My whole being is a classic movie that revolts against this awesome remake. I knew we were heading for trouble due to Magg Ryan's moment of humor and clothes coming from the moment of the screen - literally he saw the inside of the garden digging it. Meg Ryan Playing Meg Ryan - How's That Tiring ?! And it got worse ... very bad. Awesome Clutch Line, Stock Charts, Growing Ideas, I'm looking at the "First Wives Club" spin off and watching the final weekend of the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Just once, but it seems like a dozen times - there is nothing original or fresh about it. You are not ashamed!
