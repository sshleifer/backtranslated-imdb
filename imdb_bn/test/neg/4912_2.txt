Imran Hashmi Bhat on Martar's post had some good role in the film, but the other director used her kissing and naughty film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this kind of rage has got disturbed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning this film has a nice twist, I felt like Abbas Mustan's film, but then suddenly it suddenly happened suddenly with love, suddenly envy and bad clim Into reopening. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anth Mahdv√°n made a horror movie, saving music is a camera-fantastic fantasy <br /> <br /> <br /> Imran Hashimi repeats his work in his previous movie And 2's expressions on Dino are harsh, he is practicing Hindi suddenly and in some scenes, okay, the publisher and annoyer of Udi
