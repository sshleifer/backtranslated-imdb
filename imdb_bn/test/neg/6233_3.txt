I never heard of "clearing" until it got annoyed with some friends of local blockbuster and it has attracted our attention. The details of the DVD jacket hold us interested, but once we pop it into the DVD player, then it starts fast. <br /> <br /> The story was dragged for a very long time. The same framework is followed to include kidnappings like other minors. However, the most suspicious parts were at the beginning of the film. Then, the outline was followed properly and it created a pair of "clearing". There were a lot of flashbacks and grievances of the victim's family were not interesting and the nature of the film did not increase. And I find that I do not like it at all, probably it did not lead me to choose a movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was not terrible ... although it was not the best. Robert Redford gave much better performance. The dysfunctional character of Will Duffo was that I saw the whole story, and the audience saw the change in the movie within just ten minutes. The painting illustrated by Helen Miron's Robert Redford's wife was flat and arranged according to the same generic mold as other films. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there is nothing to do with "clearing" rave. Use your movie rental money for something else ... like "Garden State", perhaps?
