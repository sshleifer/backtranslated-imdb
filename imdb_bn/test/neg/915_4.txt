It is difficult to rate a writer / director's first attempt. After all, I'm writing or guided more than a movie. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but was suffering from an uneven flow. Finally, the idea is that a person (Jean Roule) is the choice of choosing a bang life and walking straight, and even fall in love with the girl (Tattana Ali) of the person you killed. Again, it claims to have something original and this film lacks fundamentality. <br /> <br /> I had been drawn to include many favorites: True Lies, Wayne's World, Palm Greyer (Jackie Brown), Frank Langley (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck), and Wing Rums (Rosewood). , Dead of the Dead). They were not frustrated by their performance, but there was little to do with them. <br /> <br /> The video is becoming more and more direct, but this does not mean that it will be time consuming. Perhaps Hunter's sophomore efforts will be more enjoyable.
