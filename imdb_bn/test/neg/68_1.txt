Wieke Hildegard Kaneef enters a group of people in an isolated hotel and closes them in a totally hateful, disgusting way. I thought I saw it completely until an unfortunate man was crucified and his head was burnt to the fire. Hilde is a very funny girl. He takes a joke-hateful hat and closes his mouth ... then hangs on the opposite side of the chimney for the pregnant fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it as one of the best films to the end ... to the end. I must admit I loved the end. It is a boy and fantastically possessed corner looking by linda blair involving his toy tape recorder. This scene lasts only for one minute and ends at the end of the movie, but you know the old lecture: "If you've got a great finish, people will only forgive you on something!"
