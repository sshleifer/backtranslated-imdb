The director was perhaps at the stage of his elementary education when he tried his hand in the West. Have to look at the outfits. Everybody scrubbed as well as ready for the church, well-brushed, well-clad and looks good iron. Even the horse is well groomed and shiny look. It's a Western, loud for tears out! It is supposed to look dust, nasty and sweaty. And then girls in this bird have played amateur. A whole lot, a dozen or more, all beautiful and well-established, were only newly raped and widowed, but rarely a tears flowed. Instead, they all show great interest (if they do not want to be selfless) newcomer seven fireworks who later comfort them with love, bandage and comfort in love while fighting birds.
