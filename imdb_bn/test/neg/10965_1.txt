Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is "awesome" very good. I was sitting in the first 15 minutes of filming before acting bad, casting was bad and camera work was bad. I have heard that there is a download of this film floating on the Internet, this is the bandwidth value even "note". <br /> <br /> As long as I wrote this review, the average vote of this film was 8.5, which encouraged me to see it, and it had an average weight of 10, probably lying and voted by rock. This movie is a "note" for everyone. Or father, if you want to punish your kids through this bogus movie, then they are sitting in it for Halloween.
