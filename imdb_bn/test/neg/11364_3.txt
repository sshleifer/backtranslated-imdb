* Here's a giant cash-in * on a plane hostage, the flight of the Living Dead gives you what you expect. <br /> <br /> There is little or no plot in this picture, which you would expect from such a movie. Although, part of it is fun, I would say. Zombie-action is especially entertaining. Once the movie is released, it will never stop; Pacing is difficult. <br /> <br /> The real special effect is very good, but CGI is terrible and confusing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie seems to be open. Let's hope that the fruit does not come. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Horoscope sub-zombie victims, I would recommend this to you; It's worth at least one clock. However, if you're only a bright fan of the style, leave it on the roof. <br /> <br /> 3/10
