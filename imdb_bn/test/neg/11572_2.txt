Imagine Jim Wynorski must have slipped the mind when he wrote one of these scripts. Although animal scenes are almost identical but I do not think the actors repeat the lines of other films, it is very rare. I was happy to see J Richardson and Glory Ann Gilbert. Gloria is a movie but nothing comes from her tits (my husband's feeling) nothing comes Jerry Mente should live on a living island, his performance is stern, incredible and he's just a little beef. The man ate the view of the ocean coming out of the cobbles, and then destroyed the dung for extra smell. At least we know that people of the next generation of monster snakes will become parents before they make eggs. Jerry's mother would be as great as Cobra. Sit back with a 6 contract or a couple of joints. It will ease the pain.
