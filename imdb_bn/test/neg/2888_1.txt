This flashing is worse than horror! It took a good story plot and turned it into a schizophrenic movie. Photography fantastic amateur . . The camera of 8 mm kits looks like a filthy 5th grade home movie project. . . The edit has been done by some who are followed by psychological flashbacks (during the time of medicine and torch), with some scenes followed by small, unexpected scenes, then cut parts of the chopped scene. . . Completely unnecessary and gratuitous nudity . . Missing scene. . . Day view, apparently turning into the scene during the night, then return suddenly. . . Of course there is no continuity. The good acting skills of Tom Scarit, Wondi Hughes, and James Mason have been lost as cast performers supporting "key" - (Villain and Anderson forget women - very amateur acting). This movie is also a good candidate for the remix, even with scripts and hughes. . . It's been just professionally this time.
