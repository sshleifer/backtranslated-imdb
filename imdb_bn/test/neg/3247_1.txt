Audience is an insane attack of sense. It's a mixed-mash of mixed Hindi and English movies - badly done. This name carries from the 70's 'Multi Star cast', which also carries the 2002 version. 70 second Sunil Dutt / Rina Roy star cast - "Nagin" and the Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible 2 are taken from the visual effects (a terrible attempt). <br /> <br /> Environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar, Manisha - college kids !!! !!!), Monisha is a victim of Koirala, who attacked two students on the basis of our joint efforts. When Manisha saw that Monisha was a Naga (Nag) serpent, like a girl in the previous life of her life, and now a great, all-and-a-shaped (echdhari nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life . Monisha appealed to him to take revenge for his violation and murder. <br /> <br /> So crazy killings start, where vengeance begins to unite every man of the lover's group, increasing efforts and techniques with constant effort. Effects are very cheap, with computer-made skilton, morphing bodies and motorcycle sticks removed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Raj Babar, who is from Nagin, is playing a Catholic priest, who provides more respite to our boys. Religiously correct "multi-religion locket (original nagin was only a" om "). Sunny Deol shows his current life and the love of Manisha's love for the final savior against Manish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are less than average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you do not. Fancy cheap thrills.
