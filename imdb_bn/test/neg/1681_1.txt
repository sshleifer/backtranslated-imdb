Alongside any development, there is a clear one-note character, great performance like those who read sounds like easy, and ridiculous special effects combine to make it really bite. The story begins with Kando Rousseau and his fellow soldiers al-Qaeda training base attack. The scene tells us that Al-Qaeda has recently come to look for a final weapon, and also works to illustrate the character of Russia's only character, which shows the tendency to work together. With the help of a collection of empty slates and walk stereotypes with French spy, Rossou travels to the Chechnya region that can catch the mad scientist working for the terrorists. Alongside the road, they face a huge disaster for some of the meat consuming bats in the light of daylight for some reason. From there, the film does not get much more than the scary tactics, a scene in which a glimpse of the bat throws the solder's arm!
