Each time once, an indie comes along that is a wonderful cast and a story which can not be really interesting and feel, but the movie sucks. Some recent film "Levitti" and "Objects of Security" in this unfortunate category, and now "United States of Leland". <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling, Kevin Speacy, Don Chadle, Zenna Malone, Lane Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kenny Washington are among the awesome castes. Gosling is a prominent writer (Specy)'s teenage son Leland P. Plays Fitzgerald, who does a boring and apologetic crime (killing a disabled child), but it does not remember and does not seem to have any purpose. <br /> <br /> A teacher from Qivalell Hall, who is trying to understand Don Chadle Landland, (and uses a book about him as well), and his former girlfriend known Malone. We see flashbacks due to their bad relationship (due to its heroin addiction). Sounds like a terrific little drama, is not it? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually written badly. Conversation and description are bound to bother about "life" and bound by glamorous platuids, characters have two-dimensional indie clay, and this leads Llanden to sympathize in some ways, it focuses on its crime. <br /> <br /> In most cases there is no problem with acting. Gosling (who was Oscar's worthy in "Believer") is a brilliant young actor, but as he wrote, none of these characters (above all Leland) seem like real people, so there is not much for him but his ridiculous line mumble and Sad look <br /> <br /> Knowing Malone is the most memorable. One of the most expressive faces he's ever seen. Even playing an underrated character in such a bad movie, he can break your heart at a glance. When the good stuff is available to work with it (like "Danny Darko" or "The dangerous life of the boys"), it's really amazing. <br /> <br /> But this is not a good element. Perhaps it can be somewhat effective after a huge rewrite, but it is really shallow for a film that looks "in the United States of London", very complex, and in its "deep" love.
