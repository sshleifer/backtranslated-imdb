Simply, this movie only has saving grace settings, costume and a OK punk concert. I do not want to know how HR Zigar must remember about his cyber image in this film cover. Finally, what I could do was plain comment about film playwright, I hope the film's "fix" will be played in their minor fashion. I'm obviously a comedian! I think this film is about the first 20 minute soul. Was it aimed as half-baked humorously as the rest? I just do not know about all the obvious political revelations (police "Ficak" is trying to rape, "Ficak" and Fat Boy and female / female singer of punk concert) and slow use of war sequences (which screams "martial arts coordinator"). The character "Steve" has bothered me because he is trying to choose the people who are locked in the street (he is tied on his shoulders and raped) and at the end he looks bad at breaking his neck (I want to know how I want to show you this)? ) Although I have certainly improved other characters than "splatter", but it may have gone somewhere. If this was 0 for the movie, but it got it, but it's a 1.
