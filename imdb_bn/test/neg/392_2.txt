Now, I like "Lethal Weepon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can not believe that Shane Black wrote this pill ... or David Morse and John C. It's in McGinley I screen it for a film festival. Awful, terrifying. Everyone smiled It does not mention the promotional and heavy transfer ... stupid. Also, it's astonishing that the LA looks like Cambodian The whole concept of time traveled through post-traumatic stress disorder is stupid. Combined with "Butterfly Effect 2", "Born in July 4" (I used the signal to show how bad this movie is, but it is managed by Michael Bay's second unit director). That's bad. 2 They are purely based on the production value.
