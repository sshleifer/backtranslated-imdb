I was debating between this movie and 2012, but it has selected the inglorious basters due to the amazing high IMDb ratings. I would say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I hope many malicious dialogue. I got a huge dose of the former, but the next is not enough. I felt a slight change. The ratio of violence to violence is very important and I think this movie is completely wrong. Plot more? It is that that is believable or really entertaining that all. Save your time and money. I can not believe what this rating is for the glory and violent taste of modern people.
