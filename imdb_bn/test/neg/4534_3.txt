This picture was some funny moment. Louie, the main character was cast well along with some other decent supporter characters. The first shot of the movie sets the tone, but the direction and the story fly away from there. From a bend at the end (also interesting and funny), I wanted the good aspects of this film and more advanced story. Without any plot, the whole idea is good! I was just willing to execute execution on this small film. It was possible but it was not just providing products.
