I love Chesie horror movies, I think dead living and bad taste are great and I think sleeping party massacre II (even not related to this movie) is ridiculous. But this movie is very cool, I did not smile, I did not even enjoy it. You will see such mistakes that are not even in camps. She liked the scene where the woman opened the window, where she puts it on her head? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not break this thought, it is related to sleeping party genocide series. It's terrible and I've never got a point even distributing it to anyone. Hire it with a fake name and burn it, please favor everyone else.
