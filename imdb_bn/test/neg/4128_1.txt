First off, I just saw a movie in Soviweim, which is known as Survival Island. It says it's a 2006 movie with Billy Jane and I like him and I did not think I could check it out. Looked interesting I saw it, and decided to find this new face, Juan Pablo de Pace and OMDB's IMDB, I could not believe that this movie has been named three and will be a new movie? It is being played again in the shoightime channel within 1 hour and 30 minutes, and this date is May 28 and ETT or Florida time. You can check your showtime list by title and see it. I can not find the details, so you can see the movie, but at a time there is a woman in white bikini that takes you to the water, you see her naked body .... When she comes back from the water you see her bottoms. Funny, there are a lot of other mess up. I can not believe in coincidence I decided to show this movie ... Go! If people name it, it sells some movie studios but it's already running in the showtime, haha. Good smile I give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C-, D + Cinema.
