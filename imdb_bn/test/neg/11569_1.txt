I was so impressed that Tim Kinside's Huntington Hunt was something I tried to do. It must be in the near future, of course, public post. Invite a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the Dark Warrior and its underlying variants (not, no!), A deadly fighter named Neo. As well as they face mutant, crazy female, sewer worm, a big spider leg and some holes in the robot. Eating! <br /> <br /> Sadly, robot holocaust is very low (or down) on the Hunts level. Clocking at a painful 79-minute (box 90s), it's a cheap flick. The set is a wide range of designs and clothing from a carnival horse house, that everyone in the near future will love John Trouvalta of the final dance number of the staning album. A combination of the old buildings and central parks of the atomic ruins debris. The Dark Wan Headquarters is infinitely known as The Power Station and it looks like a power station. Acting omitted the bad Angelica Jazzer as the evil valentine. Jazz is a complete 'bad level level'. Vit er gets the skin tasteless acczent, uncommonly a performance that becomes the only reason he recommends this film. He also distributed the only nudity of the film in the film's "Ananda Chamber" section. Ed French again provides the effect of robots but they are not nearly as slimy as Mutyant Hunt is doing his job.
