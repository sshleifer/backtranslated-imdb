"Crimes of Passion" is a movie that is frustrating mostly. Where do I start? The volume? It is frustrating simple and full of gaps. Direction? A cheap B movie reminisce. Acting? John Laughlin is terribly terrible in his role as Bobby "good-willed husband-of-frozen wife", unbeknownst to Annie Potts "frozen wife" Emmy, and it's only Cathy Turner (more than the average) and Antony Perkins (excellent) which passable acting marks Get to More specifically, Antoine Perkins has acted as a distorted revered Peter Sheyen, when Turner has directed the role of sexy Chinese Blue and managed to break Joan Kane's satisfaction. Unfortunately, only Turner and Perkins films are inadequate to help get a grade higher than 4/10. If you want to see Turner in some exciting scenes see this (although depending on the calculation the film can easily be mixed in its competition - for example "Basic Institute"), otherwise avoid.
