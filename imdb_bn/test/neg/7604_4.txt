It was a real let down for me. Original Bride with White Hair is a great Kung Fu fantasy film but this one was quite weak. Unfortunately, I did not look after all the new stories that influenced the screen time, and the story was not well developed. Although the first movie was tragic and it was a tedious (since I only counted the time when sick lovers would actually be seen) The action was also poor at this one. The wars were not very dancers, and there were not many kung fu in fact. The very weak sword fought between one of the most disliked luys and lynn pregnancies. Lynn used himself mainly by using telescopes to throw a wall on the wall and sometimes throwing his hair, far from the strap shown in the previous film and the impressive display of Kung-Fu. I still gave this movie 4 because at least it was at a fast speed and I wanted to see what was going to happen at the end, even though I first (first saw anyone) predicted how it would work and after seeing it I found it anti-climatic and If they wanted, they would have left the appropriate creator or simply the story. I really recommend the first, but only for the fans of the section and those who want to see Linne one more time to apply.
