This movie starts from this and never can reach it. The title of this movie promises a lot more than it provides. A man who is filled with usual cliches in the synagogue and a story is his sexuality question. People agree, even mandatory flamboyant type. Lead (Kevin McQuey) has reason to work with him because they are fairly influential. Simon Callo, a horny straight game, always worth watching, and by the only reason he's with the movie. However, its men's group "meditation" or whatever they are doing is getting very annoying about the long order of garbage. It seems that the film has been left in a light mix of a confusing effort to change the non stop inactivity. The same comment applies to a really weird and unconvincing camping trip. Do not worry about tape breaks so you can get a snack. Let's run things; You do not miss anything Hugo weaving character is essential. She appears in a sequence with less Lead one and is not even meeting the rest. The results of that sequence are not explained, and there is nothing to do with the Hugo Real Estate contract details. The film ends with total frustration, because there is no resolution. Things simply fades out and we are sending off the credit. This is an interlude with no formation.
