I often see the exhibition in AFI Fist 2006 with about 30 people in the empty 1000-seat auditorium. After the lack of audience, the festival program began its opening remarks, "At least some of the participants in this festival have got a good taste in the film". Well, Mr. Programmer, after seeing this film, I must answer, "No we do not, or you too!" Due to the US sanctions, he and his mysterious family are dangerously running illegal Canadian whiskey because the pieces of the "back woods" follow the young (so not) Wild Bill. The old deadline (Chris Christopherson and the company) does not require money to save their Ramshawal Vermont farm, but rather to offer small wild bills in the quality of manhood. <br /> <br /> Although nicely been photographed, this adventure story is good in films like this, lack of "tension" and what makes credibility. Christopherson's helpless performance and dry solidarity remind me of a dream where I was once playing Al Gore Wiley Wanker. I was just not careful and when wild bills came out of thin air to give advice to mysterious grandmother, it is not right. Yes, I fell asleep for more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Gary Fryer has done a good job as Carrie Fryey's role in the role of Ferrell Beller; Chris McDermott, the eldest daughter of Big Bill, uses those crippled blue eyes for her acting advantage. <br /> <br /> But Jack Cravens is waiting for a $ 2 bout in a blockbuster.
