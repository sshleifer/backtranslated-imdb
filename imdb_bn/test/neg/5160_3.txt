I realized that the trailer of this photo bothered me when it was something that was coming out. Here are a few "Indie" films about the power of reviews here, and later on, my opinion was completely opposite to all other critics, I started thinking, if possible, I see different movies from these people, Or are they probably trying to make their work bigger picture makers / family etc.? Hmmm <br /> <br /> Are you interested in showing respect to Pulp Fiction and 11:14 am? Busy performers, stupid scores (reducing various scenes) and without logical incredible jumps? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> My open letter to two players in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'From' Samuel El Jackan is a La Poppy Fiction. No one can do what he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please bring something original. Do you have a slight disrespect for destroying this thing by pretending to be quintin tarantino. <br /> <br /> Just scary, and I can not really see anyone can say how well a movie is. It is a disagreement that people have been able to score at 8.5, such as movies such as Pope Fiction or Goodfellas. There is no where around this movie; A 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it a 3.
