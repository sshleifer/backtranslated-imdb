Well, this movie was not terrible because I thought it would be. I was hoping to give it a star. I chose to give it three. Why? Well, for a Chess horror / sci-fi movie, it's not all bad. Of course, the characters are sticky (such as their acting - including a young Leonardo Di Caprio), influential influences and monsters ... All right, just say that I saw some more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... but there was something about this movie that made me end up Saw it. A little bit of sunny help I guess a little bit. And if you ever want to see alien pass gas, then this film will save you in your dream. 3/10
