This movie has the worst performing performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks the power to say at least. What power did Clayton Moore give us. I never felt in this movie that Spillsbury was worried about doing something. Revenge, love, justice? This guy does not have a picture. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plots do not force them to be friends, you will not get the idea that they want to quarrel with each other. Plus, as well as have more interesting personalities. <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialog is predictive and annoying. <br /> <br /> The description is wildly bad and you can see how the image can look if you are familiar with Hazard Dux. I can not believe the director will agree on this. It insulted me and explained the plot lines I saw. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horse and the location look good, probably only when you hire a movieographer to be your director. </ br> <br /> RATING-2 will be able to see you to laugh or show off to a foreigner for a bad movie.
