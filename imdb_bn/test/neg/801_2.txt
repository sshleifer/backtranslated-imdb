Set in 1976, set-up was not set up for any reason other than keeping busy, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Danny Darko'), and Camara Diaz and James Merceden Narmer and Arthur Lewis were identified as a young couple. Although he has both successful employees, he supposedly struggled financially - as a high school teacher, he as an optical expert in the research center of Virginia, Langley, of NASA. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, Lewis finds a passel sitting in their home, a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a Mr. Steward points out that he'll come back at 5:00 PM to explain the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, operated by Frank Langley, dressed in a perfect silky row. The suit He is godly but business, but his most notable feature seems to have been his face, which has been flown halfway and inappropriately. Langley is the only thing to be an observer in the film, but unfortunately, it has been upgraded by its own makeup, which is similar to Christopher Nullan's 'The Dark Knight' to Harvey 'two face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart). It's like an elephant in the room: it can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little confusing. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he'll be back in 24 hours to collect the button. If, at that time, they decided to unlock and push the button, he would give them $ 1 million in cash. Only catch - and it's a big one - that somewhere a stranger will die. It may be across the city, it may be on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victims will be unknown to them. As a show of good faith, he gave them a bad $ 100 bill, whether they put the button on whether it pushed the button. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norman suspect, the whole thing is believed to scam or a broad hoax, but it is not long before they start to wonder what might happen if they push the bit? Will they really get a million dollars? Anyone really die? Awesome imagination, Norma Button slaps Nothing happened. However, when the stairway shows the next day with a full briefcase full of cash, giving them the means to make their primary relief alarm. They decided to stop the whole thing, but Steward told them it was too late. "You have already pushed the buttons," he explained. When Stuart left Limo, Arthur notes the license number, which he later was registered with the National Security Agency. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the film begins to float deep in inappropriate areas as secondary. Letter springing nosebleeds and start flashing signs of peace. Meanwhile, the city attacks Paddi, Slack-Javed Gaiks in a bad shirt, who begins to follow Arthur like the Scouting Party in advance for the competition of the Jordi Alien Nerds. Arthur has finally leaked to the library (?), Where Stiverd's spinsterish wife has been leaked - whom we have not seen yet - and told Arthur that he must go to the place to get out of the library. Three vertical columns of sugar looking digital water effect. 'What will I do if I'm wrong?', Arthur asks, is less boring than the situation, and certainly less less annoying than the audience. 'Eternal feud,' the spinster said disrespectfully. <br /> <br /> Arthur goes to the middle column of digital fluid effects, and some absence of sudden appearance can be seen, even when his water cocoon moves on the soft bed. When he wakes up and sees him, the water bubble explodes and Arthur falls into the bed of water, which is strange enough, only to drop from the overhead water pipes outside the limits of the camera, when a Shadowen Merceden and Diaz Flow Bed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was declared dead, but later came back to life, transformed into a superman, who now has the 'work of lightning' and whose ability allowed him to accept CIA, NSA and NASA. <br /> <br /> <br /> What is all this trash? Apparently, to determine whether the goal of Steward is to be valued for humanity, apply the Bible's character test (for example, 'binding of Isaac'). If enough people pass the button test by denying it, then the styled god-like authority will abandon the nation. Unfortunately, those who impose soft and arthur-like buttons should be punished for their moral stupidity, which ultimately has seen such a 'respectful' lady or tiger 'picture' among them, except for recreational or other coherent schemes. <br /> <br /> 'Box' represents unmatched psychoanalytic masturbation that new Buddhist philosophy students want to atonize after some beers. Richard Kelly's existentialist Pittifg Gray's tired exercise has finally reduced the weight of his own ignorance; Ultimately, the tortured faded of unsupported ideas, such as combining many colors, with a mixture of many colors, a film-sculpted gray outlet, one of the ladies in-flight movies, whose plot is neither less or less <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, <br /> <br /> Seeing the box, I'm pretty sure how he feels.
