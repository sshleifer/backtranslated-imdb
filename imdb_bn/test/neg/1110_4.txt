First off, I'm a horror fan. But this "Tobey Hooper" production (the real Texas Chess and the people of the pollutant !!) was also a fan below the benchmark. Acting was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the leading women were just right. The story is something we have never seen before, a wonderful package or whatever. Never exciting or intense, and splash up blood does not count any special effects. The scary zombie kids are white-faced with dark eyes and that's it .. It works in the early 70's, but not now. Director J. come. Cardon did not work well to keep the secret, halfway through the risk of falling asleep. My vote is basically based on the leading acting, but it can be easily said to be the child of Karna 8: From the corn field to the mine ... enough says ..
