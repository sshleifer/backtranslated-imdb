Adventure of Hercules will be the greatest excuse for a movie that is still going on. You will have to look a long way to find anything to reach the stage of the inconsistency of this movie. Acting ?? Bad Edit ?? Bad Direction ?? Bad Special effect ?? Bad and ridiculous Plots ?? Bad Light ?? Bad Cinematography Bad Costume design ?? Bad and innocent Everything else ?? Bad Adventure of Hercules is enjoyable as the main bread. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real patience test. One for this is the mascot or Lou Ferrigno completists (if any exist). <br /> <br /> I learned eight things from seeing the Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you do not have budget for your particular special effects, rotate the view of the previous movie. It'll look great - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. During the search for Zeus's thunder recovery, take a break for frequent stops to oilyize your body. It worked for Phargino and his two Amazon companions. <br /> <br /> 3 The activities of a sword fighting, the use of magic, and other day-to-day activities in ancient Greece make a sound similar to a game of pack man or estordord. <br /> <br /> 4. Ancient Greek deities used to wear extra clothing in some Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. You will make your crappy movie's runtime pad, stretch the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw some overly grandiose music. It also helps if it helps you drag views from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 6. When the bad guys attack Hercules at one point, the scenes become much smoother. <br /> <br /> 7. William Burger did something for the money. <br /> <br /> 8. I think it was not possible, but the first picture of Hercules Adventures, makes Harcoulis (1983), look like an Academy Award winner.
