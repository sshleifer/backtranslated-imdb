Most movies I really like are art-house rentals and rarely appear in the top ten lists of box-office. That said, I found "Northfork" completely unknown I have no idea what it was even about. Writing about a different movie in the New York Times, Stephen Holden once said that some people think that they can just drop something on the screen and that act as a fairy tale. I looked at this review several times while watching "NorthFork". <br /> <br /> I gave two to one-to-ten scale.
