Overall, it's a pretty bad film. But for Pathmark 5 dollars, it was not the total waste. Actors / actresses are not big names (though TV shows something like shows), so I will not do my usual Troy McClure thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As the shaman see LA a train and travel hap Another plot is going to be a lot; Two women like drug smuggling. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes turned down down a total. As fierce and glorious as the whole movie, Grand Finlay is completely computer-animated. <br /> <br /> I saw an extended version where there was a great deal of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! Bonus features were okay. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: D-
