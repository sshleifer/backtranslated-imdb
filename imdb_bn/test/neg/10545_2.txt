The first toxic film was dark, poor and mountainous. This movie is an illogical fight from Chezzy jazz music, there is no real pride and the worst poisonous mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, part 1's character does not see anything like them (Clare, Wom Junko), change the names of characters (Clare or Sarah?). This is the biggest violent violence, dark humor and political error of the first film. This film can be PG rating if it is not for nudity. Really hair I could not stand this one, although part 1 is a huge fan.
