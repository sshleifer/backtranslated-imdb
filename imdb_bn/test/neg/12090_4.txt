I wanted to choose one of these - the situation was wealthy, and the setting was unusual and interesting. But the story is difficult to swallow that is difficult to melt with the element of the child girl Gothic romance. The director is unfavorable against the 'goi' character - for the content of extraordinary cardboard characters - and oddly compelling the heroic homeworking behavior of the heroine. Potential attractive power struggle between inventor and secrecy is not really tackled. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers get more credibility when feminists begin to express sympathy and act honestly. With the problem. This film has more closely combined with 'The 7 Piece of Sona', another sincere failure, more than 'piano' - a real story of emotion.
