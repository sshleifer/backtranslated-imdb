The Women (2008) Sadly, such talented waste by Diane English. I enjoyed everyone with what I saw and saw with Ante Bening, Candie's Bergen, Bate Miller, Clarice Lichmann and Meg Ryan, Jada Panket Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes, who might not be my favorite actor. See how the film can be annoying, expected, embarrassing, sloppy, and just bad? It was created by Diane Engel, known as the author of a very successful TV show, Murphy Brown, and it was his first film for which he wrote a script. The film has been a labor of love for the English who has tried it for many years and I respect it. I also found scenes with a small but memorable showcase, fun, smart and enjoyable way with even supporter, Bergen, Leichman, Carrie Fisher and Bate Middle, but generally the movie "Sex and the City" months ago I saw it but beside the woman I found the penis and the city very well, it was simply brighter. At least, delivery of sex and city hospitals was protected from the long and transparent view of the room, where the letters had a child and his friends supported him. What did he do for poor Debra Messing, the nightmare he had inserted into, and we, together with the audience? Films like "The Women" give full name, Chic Flex, a bad name. There is no mistake in this section, but why it is so difficult to create a really good comedy about friendship, mother tongue, and professional affirmation of female friendship and hardship? It can be related to all modern women, very very compelling and important issues. Why can movies be made in line, dialogue and situation, so when the movie ends, they will be forgotten, funny and objectionable? <br /> <br /> I've checked out the new movie after being the real woman from my local library and I really enjoyed it. The story said well 70 years ago, and kept my interest in all the way. The old movie was a real star power.
