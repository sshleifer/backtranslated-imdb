He worked for the worst government of the 20th century, yet historian and Bafa called World War II as a bright strategist in a civil soldier, soldier and mechanical warfare. If only Hitler gave him military and maternal love, he liked Africa, the argument went away, things went very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was actually a military genius, and all was a prominent, honest man. <br /> <br /> <br /> But this image has emerged from its way of portraying its closest child. He is trying to win the battle of Hitler, but he continually interferes with the Fuhrer and orders him to be impaired, which Ramel (James Mason) expressed surprise but rarely questions and sometimes does not disobey. Only when it is clear that Hitler is leading to the destruction of Germany, Rommel is thinking of sedition against him; This hesitant role plays as the main theme of the film, in bad situations, good people are trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Just like Mason Ramel is fine, but it is rarely memorable performance, say, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this image was so intriguing to see him like a decent humanity that it forgot to make him attractive. His wife Lucy (a young Jessica Tandy, a well cast) occasionally falls into some warmth, but usually Mason is called to give tough British performance? For example, Brittas were trying to claim Rael for themselves (though all the Nazis have English pronunciation without Hitler in all fairness). <br /> <br /> There is nothing to suggest in this cheap war, swiping any stock footage, and beach doubling in southern Tunisia, especially the film. A remake might be interesting (I could only choose Ed Harris because of a little physical likelihood and good works, Harris might also work), it was a little spicy, but this movie has mostly shown me how much we have been claiming as a spectator in the last fifty years; A biography will not cut it longer than this bland.
