I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make things worse, it lasts for about three hours. Time is a terrific waste, unless you want to match against unlimited millions of biblical knowledge of your kids. Do yourself good - instead of Sahara walk. Since I do not see this movie you have to give a ten-line statement, so I have to say that there is absolutely no free quality. God's conversation with Noah is ridiculous. The whole thing is "Let's swap a biblical account look" has a stench. Why is it not appropriate if fundamental reasoning is spent in Bible film? Since the basic argument is not met, some disturbing. The film begins with a disclaimer about the poetic licenses ... which is the century's incompleteness. Poet rape But then, poetic will be in favor of an unmerited.
