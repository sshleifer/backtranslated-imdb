I have found that most opinions are not positively positive yet, at least positive. I can not understand. The only explanation I can find is that those who commented have something to do with the film, because it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It makes "Boggy Creek II" and "mutant" look like terrible masterpieces. Acting is the best shaky, and horror for the most part. The whole movie is almost black, perhaps so they can shoot it in the same position. The giant will see something like Roger Cromel, one of the worst movies. And the plot ... well, less good said about it. <br /> <br /> One to avoid one cost.
