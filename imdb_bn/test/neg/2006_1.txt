Hey, if people thought Ed Wood was a bad director but they did not see the movie completely. I mean the graphing plot was in the hole and used was the cast. Shoddy special effects. I do not believe that this movie has come out of Hollywood studio. A high school drama club could probably come up with a good product. I had their Erika Eleniak under the fantastic Caspar Van Deeven and rated actors. Their agent should be shot to request this sign in the dribble so that they do not read the scripts. I still can not believe that there was a survivor of Little Linger movie, I was hurting my head all the time, why he was the descendant of Van Helsing and not the last person. I am a worshiper of Vampire films and the worst is that they can take part in it so that it can never be seen in the light of day.
