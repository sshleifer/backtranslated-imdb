As a Spanish tourist I am a terrible mistake as a Los Angeles and Spanish tourist. I went to see "The Woman" is my favorite one of all time. I have seen the original many times, actually I own it. My ray Deeen to see the remake was based on the English woman who was responsible for "Murphy Brown", though: How bad can it be? He must know what he is doing. Well, I do not know what to say. I do not understand what happened. Botoxed women are a rather depressing thing. Meg Ryan or anyone who played Mary - she looked a little like a magnificent version of Mag Ryan ... probably another Mega Ryan was wearing a mask - she did not bring in the characters of Narma Shear in 1939. What a tired, unbearable prototype that has become a Frenchman in a new loser "Friend" Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Panket Smith, what I saw was disconnected and if it is not enough: the role made by Eva Mendes, Joan Crowford as Crystal is his best and funny performance. Poster sign for how Eva Mendes's cast is actually wrong, how bad it has turned into a commercial effort. I do not respect it for a 1 for Candice Bergen and Claris Leachman
