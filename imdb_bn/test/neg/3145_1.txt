I was old for this show when I came to the first 6. At first, when I was a small child there were a few children shows in Til Street, which I saw and learned, but there was no other than that. My cousin came first after seven years after several years of my birth. Barney was a very big part of the ones they saw. When I first saw this show, I told my grandmother that it would not teach anything, using magic to fix everything. I was 9 years old, there was no idea about how many nine-year-old TV shows. The more I saw or heard of Barney's teachings, I said more about how bad the show was. Strange Things My parents who were a small child in the middle of the 80's, which was on my way. They agreed and the same thing said what I did. The sad thing about this is that my cousin is bigger now 13 and they still agree on what they saw. This is not his creative fraud, it is not the right to think of someone different from you. If the person stole his O.K stolen or steals the mind that it has gone. Be honest with yourself, Barney does not teach children from outside to earn money. The more interested children will see it more interested children. Children are not fooled because they are not educated, they just do not know any better, the second Barney makes a show and parents buy it. I never believed that Barney could influence people on TV. If you have a young child reading them, show a show that teaches their numbers, do not let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking a lot, smokes some and your finger shows your child to this show and they one day will see their babies get the same whip and buy the same brand.
