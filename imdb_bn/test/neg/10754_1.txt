Last night I went to see this picture as a birthday presenting at National Film Theater in London. This is the first time I've seen it, and I think it's a scary "twister" that I've ever seen. For some reason, spontaneous and painting that is unclear and unclear, clearly not particularly beautiful or severely shot, I do not fully understand why it is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I usually enjoy movies that are difficult to see due to borders or even movies due to their length or unusual painting. But this was really, really terrible.
