Does this picture seem to be better than war on each other? Guant CG's battle of these animals, which is the war! However, one of the guns used in the movie is a need. Apparently because they use cheats. Calculate the amount of shots they used before ... Oh wait that they do not have to reload. Whatever the shot count ... it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The effects of the film's sound effects vary from tigers to elephants. Oh and I forgot to mention that this giant comodo dragon was stolen like hell? Since the actors are looking at the animal aspect, they are astonished. <br /> <br /> Whenever someone dies, you can talk about it because they all work for him, they put their arms up in the air and crucify them to save themselves ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The final gem is that the author of this script is full of brain and full knowledge of only one gland. With "events" as both animals indifferent to comments such as "animals" as "helpless animals" they are just full of fun facts.
