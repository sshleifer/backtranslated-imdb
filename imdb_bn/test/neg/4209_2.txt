This used DVD looked cheap, and got it for a shiny. I recently found "The Octakosen" in the DVD and bought it to remember it, it was seen as a pre-teen theater and at the time it was loving. This American carpet is now a problem with "going back" in the film, since I have seen many Hong Kong and Thai action films since then, where war scenes are long, fast and jaw hanging. I especially think of the war like Jackie and Beni "The Jet", at the end of "Dragon forever", or in Tony Jha's round-stairs "guardian" battle. Hollywood Kung-Fu offers are not only "film rights", but also make certified skills as chalk, occasionally weird look. What's worse than a war going on a slow pace? Then you know it looked crappy at normal speed, so they slow it down for effect. It looks like how ridiculous the opposition is that they are standing and just waiting to kick in the chest. <br /> <br /> poor chalk, there is no intensity in this film, nor does he introduce any religious danger. Compare with his ex-star Bruce Lee, who showed a dress and burn attitude. When Bruce sends a bomb against some rival (s), you think that the wind around is almost going to happen. "Breaker, Breaker" Chuck accidentally kicked the man with full nonsense. When the judge came to see him in prison and executed him, Chuck looked at sorrow, and I thought "okay ... the third eye is doing the focus and the judge will catch the throat and get out of it", but he has a doe eye Nothing but look terrible. And when the DVD case you expect, the 1 hour, 5 minute runtime is listed, this is actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so the pain of seeing more than 20 minutes. <Br / <br /> <br /> For the great war, go to the first "police story" Jackie Chan ... the battle of shopping mall is pure gold .......
