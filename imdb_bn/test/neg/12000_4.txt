Wow, this is a Chess movie! It starts off as it should be a bell slash, the cameras are running under the following dogs, with dogs. It became a little annoying and followed the stories of some girls inspired by the Indian spirits of some girls. Then we get a lot of covered girl and a lot of other naked girl shots in the bath. When "Zombie Zombie" comes out of the world and starts the violence of women, it suddenly gets chessy. We even get a Samurai Indian <br /> <br /> This movie has become quite annoying, though I found the story of four Indians who were quite interesting. Once the Indian Zombies (or whatever you want to call for them is technically zombies) start all the fun when girls start terrorists. This is not a special glitch and it can not be taken seriously, it's a bit fun to see when you're bored or drinking with friends. I can not think that it worked as well as a short story though the first half is tedious boring.
