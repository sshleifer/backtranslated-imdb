This will be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Charles Band made 96 'best movies in this little seen gem. David Finker's jealousy with the visual flair is very realistic and incredibly styled why why the band 'Deliverance from Kilo 2: Evil,' 'The Regina Pearce Affair', 'Sherwood's Virgins' Forest,' and 'Timegate: Tales of the Stood Tamps' . <br /> <br /> With a very sophisticated story - a small body with a big head controls a family of weird families, who checks out nude women, this film may be a bit too much for young viewers and only for the most educated viewers , But for those who see it, the band expresses subtle messages about human condition through its superiority Able t. The head is a symbol of lost love and the desire for our own inner self, which all of us have to face at one stage or another, and for that reason I was able to deeply add this picture to the personal level. Although critics compared the band with re-animations and other fewer works, but the head and the hill stood on the rest. It's gorier, but not stupid. The gorilla of this film is well-made and used to raise the story rather than a cheap tribute to the audience. Also, the special effects of this movie are absolutely the top pure, easily done the best work of a horror movie ... well ... never! The work of this photo is considered to be the work of the sensation of the blind, the limbless HBO. My only problem with this movie is the complete frontal nudity, which was ultimately unnecessary to achieve the goal of the composer - creating a timeless epic that will always be forever in history as the greatest movie of all time. If this is not for a little problem, then I will give this movie a perfect 10.
