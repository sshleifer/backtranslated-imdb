It's not a terrible movie ... but there's giant scenery where you'll be roaming on a sunny floor - not a good thing for any action / thriller. Acting is quite decent for a SciFi channel movie generally. Barry Corbin plays a credible US Senator, and Lau Diamond Philips again gives us an appropriate military / police / sheriff / agent / martial figure. Special effects are good, "special" - for example, exterior train shots are very clearly a model train. <br /> <br /> Gupta: A squally open scene strikes a steady car. The car exploded in the fire but did not budge an inch. After the impact, the asteroid is at the top of the car's hood - it is impossible to get the low intensity of the meteor. <br /> <br /> The story of a good helicopter accident ("Drag, Pull!") is to get to the classic pierced bridge over 1000 lb yards waiting for the train , Annoying folks might eventually get it, eventually set up the signal. <br /> <br /> Alien invasion scenes are sunny. They are removed by harmful cute dolls and light speed - Remember Monty Python rabbits? Spieler Gough: After four clips at one stage, the clip can be shot because they can go at lightning speed. Later, Todd Bridges used a small flame thrower rigs in the film, which he used to send some animals to close range. Several times, Lou Diamond Phillips is easily able to catch animals with his bare hands.
