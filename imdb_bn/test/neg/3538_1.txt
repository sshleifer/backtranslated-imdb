The only reason to watch this movie was because it was Giovanni Ribisi and it was considered "Horror". Do not be fooled, I saw this movie the worst "horror" movie. This is about people who go to the secret place, among which there is a "monster". The demon is a man running around a cute face blue sweat pants who has a hunger for his brain. Some people die, some people do not. In the end they cast a flat off monster and then fly happily away. But oh no! Monitor still after a plan! Spend two hours in any other way to see dry paint on a wall, believe me, this shit is more entertaining.
