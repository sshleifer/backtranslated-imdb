This is one of the biggest pieces of shit I had ever seen. I, seriously. If Woody Harrelson shoes are to be seen by someone else, and your wife is thinking of even considing, then it would be better to sleep with millions of dollars for other people. Finally, he was speaking on the bed and saying how good it would be for him to build his house or money with that money. Woody did not completely agree before talking to her. How can you believe in him? If they were really married, would they also consider? I am not worried about how frustrating I was. This is the most ridiculous thing in my life that I have ever heard. Then, he flips out on her. Obviously, his wife had no right to disbelieve, his wife was only sleeping with another man, who is very rich and handsome. Oh and wait, then he has to apologize to the person after filing for divorce, so he can stay with the person he can sleep with. Of course, Woody does not have the right to say anything to him, or especially after his card roy haw card. Then, at the end of the film, he apparently loves Woody and miss him a lot, until he leaves the Hobbies, until he tries to give up some ridiculous folly, and he is asleep thanks to Hobbs ???? Are you kidding me Was he under contract as his sex slave or something ?? What do i mean to sleep Oh and wait it gets better. Before he gets out of the car, he passionately kisses him. Yes, she is not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting go, good ole 'request for a last time you go with me. Smooch smooch, smooch Although I'm still a rich man I'm married to a guy. I have never seen such pieces in my life. How do we feel good after that horrible end? What was supposed to be represented in this movie? Nothing came out of this! This was the most uninterrupted movie of my life. Two sad people are disappointed. If I were Woody, then I would tell him to drown in that water body that he was nearby. Apparently, he had no self esteem. What was the thought of Roy Hobbs taking this terrible role? I feel like puking after watching this. This movie was so bad, it was seriously ridiculous. I want to return two hours of my life that I did not see this piece of ****.
