When Puffy Becks Cheer, beware of her soft, colorful upholstery. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. Josh (Mark Duplas) and Emily (Catherine Aslton), a lover-couple couple, have a hard time with their relationship. One argument came up one night and to prepare, Josh Emilike asked to come beside the road to his father's house where Josh planned to supply Lajvi Relecca for his father's birthday. Emily accepts the journey and brother Rite (Rith Wilkins), who seeks more contact with the lives of other people than herself. <br /> <br /> The road blows fast. Between Josh and Emily as well as a bitter feeling for The Chapel Chair (it is initially very gusto and Josh split up as soon as "believe" to reconsider the original owner). Rite quickly realized that the reason for the problems of Emily and Josh is that LazyBoy and one night it sets it to the torch. <br /> <br /> And finally we're listening to the chair, although there are many minutes left in the picture. <br /> <br /> The big thing is, the title of the film is the chair of the chair, when it is not sitting on the central seat. It is a destructive relationship between Josh and Emily, and how the roads seal their feelings with each other. Once the chair is destroyed, there is no mention of it, although they reach the parents' birthdays of Josh's parents without gifts. Josh never mentions a chair or even tells his father. There is no connection between it and this human life. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why there is not a tie in the end? Bad scripts <br /> <br /> Another annoyance is Mark Duplas's brother, Joy Duplus, not a director, cameraman (and not very good). Holds the autofocus of the camera and the rights are right before zoom-in and almost every scene in circles outside the circle and focus. Initially it took a delicate and artistic feeling, but quickly became intolerable. <br /> <br /> The movie is accessible and entertaining. All actors / actresses have done fine. But due to the lack of poor production quality, suspended end, and parallel to the head, this spark has created many problems.
