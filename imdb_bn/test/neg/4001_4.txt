Generally, I love this "newborn" thrillers. Some good examples are "fatal attraction," "single white woman," and "audition." Well done, they can be a lot of fun, and difficult shocks and scares are worth an hour or two. Of course, the opposite can be true: doing bad things, they can be tedious and stupid. "The Hand the Rocks The Cradle" is the next one. <br /> <br /> <br /> Welcome to Bartels, Clare (Anabela Ciauro) and other family members of Michael McCoy. But busy intending to hire an old woman by Claire Michael. One day, Petton looks at a woman named Flanders (Rebecca Demorne), and she looks perfect, Bartels hired him. Of course, once he shows up, his strange life is slowly stirring ... <br /> <br /> This picture suffers from most of the problems, but the biggest is the management of villains. Peyton is not credible. How it has been written and how it played it. The things they do are supposed to keep us on the edge so they are ridiculous. De Mornay does not help much. He portrayed Petton as two different people. Although true that he was supposed to be the perfect grandson while hiding his psychological tendency, De Moreen's performance created a division between his two aspects of his character. <br /> <br /> Another actor is good. Anavella Cyrolra is awesome as bone clay. The impressive role is very natural, but unfortunately, the script gives him down. Matt McCau's almost invisible. However, Julian Moore Claire's friend is as happy as Marlin. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately he's only on screen for five minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you do not know it from this ugly scene. The film has some decent shocks, but it is poorly spaced and Climax, while creating some tension, is actually ridiculous. It is said that he is working with a script that can be considered to be the best impressive. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when you come to Nani, stay with Frank Dresher. This one should go straight to bin in the video.
