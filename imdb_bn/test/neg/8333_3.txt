I went to see it because I have never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was frustrated, because it does not give much opinion of the biggest city in Israel. Is it also lovely ?? A movie that you do not guess on its meaning until you finally leave it with a shoulder wave. <br /> <br /> Chief actor Batiya, a female of her twentieth century, who worked as a waitress for the catered marriage. Her parents obviously do not take care of her too much, and when the little girl comes out of the ocean with an inflammatory ring around her, Batia is forced to take care of her. The little girl is not talking, Batia can not give her social services because it is closed on weekends and the agency. So she takes her roof roof to her apartment, and when it comes to working in the evening, she needs to take with her a little girl. Boss is very dissatisfied with this work and other bugs in Batier's performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another major character is Keren, who is married. On his wedding party (where Batia is certainly working), she climbed on her feet from a room of a lady room, whose door would not open, and so she and her new husband could not take the plan to leave the Caribbean. They end up in a dingy hotel seafront without a view. It has bad smell, noise from traffic, and Cain is complaining all the time. Does her husband meet an amazingly attractive old woman ?? A writer ?? Who is in the hotel, worried about the care being asleep with this bizarre person. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The elderly woman who is hired to care for is very drunk and no English, only speaking German and Hebrew. Joy English but speak no Hebrew or German Joy is mostly concerned with her son coming back to the Philippines, and she asks him to buy a toy boat. He plans to find the perfect boat in a shop and buy it. The girl who rented the winner did not meet the acting actress, and her mother, in the adaptation of the post-modern "physical theater" of Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Which of these three stories ?? Which intersect temporarily ?? Perhaps it is supposed to mean something deeper to solve themselves. I do not get it. The little girl has a fantasy ingredient in Batia's relationship, and perhaps the relation between the lamp and the existence of her parents is in no way contrary to this relationship. When looking at the jay shop's window toy boat, there is such a strange effect where the small pond air flies like a wind, and they are on the scale of real living. A description of Cain and the strange poetry about a vessel around a ship in a hotel room brochure cover shows a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized that I was not going to break any sleep. If someone is out there, what is the idea about it, perhaps they can fill me up.
