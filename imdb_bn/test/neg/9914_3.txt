If the day after tomorrow seems impossible, then wait for it to see. <br /> <br /> It's okay, in most cases of disaster movies usually occur in 1 billion cases which are combined in other situations. In this case, even two huge storm systems are joined. Clear so far. Oh, but hold on, no, "the event" is the demolition and the subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Later people load the material of human interest - in this case a deceiver husband, a mental gun - an insurgent girl, a rebel girl, a hacker with a point of proof, a senator trying to push an agenda , A reporter is trying to stand against "male" and a pregnant woman is stuck in the elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally add some tower events to add excitement. <br /> <br /> If the director tries to adapt to a meaningless plot line, then there will be no time for actual disaster. The computer graphics graphics system is almost certainly inevitably. <br /> <br /> If you can not be a truck model firmly, then you really should not take Twister, explosive power station, to Las Vegas <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The morality of creation creates even more. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with students of the first month movie, Zed, Hackneynid, Clich-Sucked Scripts, but for God, this does not mean that anyone can turn their movie! <br /> <br /> This makes it uncomfortably incredible. 10.0 The Apocalypse is not very awesome. Avoid both of them.
