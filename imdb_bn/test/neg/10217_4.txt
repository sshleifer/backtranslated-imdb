WARNING: This review is the main speaker. Do not read if you want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Just a few people know my vote (my vote was the fifth) and send it to someone. Well, in the late 1980s professional wrestling was beautiful. Ladies Professional Wrestling Association, a women's women's organization has been opened. It was a great league, and one of the names of Ms. Lesios Roster was one. I always had one of the best people in the LPWA in terms of ring efficiency and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWH had been closed in the early 90's, so it seemed to be just natural talent to one of the kindergarten actors like Emmy, did not it? But was there an alternative to such stuff? This movie is really bad. It continues along, I compared it to an underlying movie called 'Survivor Quest', only this movie made everything 'Survive Quest' enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went to the tape meat to get ahead quickly through the preview. At first, I was not paying too much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Laceios. 'Oh,' I thought, 'Here's another movie that's watching Mimi.' But when pulled the preview, I became aware that it was a preview ?? 'Without fear!' Whenever you watch the movie, you are in trouble when you see only the first preview! These things are pretty much worth the plot. Lesso plays a former kickboxer who lives on an opponent / friend to hurt, so he focuses on his second career, which he shares with his friend Sammy: an Thumb guide. On this special occasion, he gets a troop of three couples. It's OK to take two couples to take place. You think that a couple, a Caucasian husband and Korean wife will be discovered, because there is a problem in them, because of the film, but it is often ignored for the jungle beer, which is consistently scared of the Korean wife. Curiosity is fun for the first time, but it does nine times. The third couple is only painful to see: It consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They insulted again, and Mr. Page used to use his video camera when he is busy playing cruel trick on his portal wife ?? Like your common American couple! Before growing, Mr pages are spying on two fool boys and their prostitution. One of them slaughtered prostitution and found out that Mr. Page tapped it out. So the danger starts, because two people track their trips, and we wait ?? And wait ?? And wait ?? And wait for them to do something eventually. When they do this, then it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Cast. They can work with them as hard as they can. Chief criminal director Robert F. Lyons, who wants to get out of the manager's chair while playing some part. Launches the lions and closes the scene of a vicious, casual thing that you start to think that she was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot. There is even an inefficient moment when there is a wide daylight scenery with thugs in a night scene. Then there are word sections. The sound of music and background strongly strengthens dialogue so that you have to move your ear to the right side of your television speaker. Do not move the head on the screen! It's not worth listening to bad writing lines. When talking about poor writing, Lace also got some credit as co-authors. Some interesting features of the characters are often abandoned for lip shots or bad practical jokes. Initially, Lacey throws a cold with a switch blade knife, so once it does not seem that they are in trouble after two fools. When the miscreants end up kicking their back part in a good and long battle with Laceos, then all of our Castes have to laugh together, even though one of them is shot and bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy eventually. None other than the poor souls did not see the film, when Misty acted in the wrestling ring, the old glory days would have desired. Junta score: 4 out of 10
