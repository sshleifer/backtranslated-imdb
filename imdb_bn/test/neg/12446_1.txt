Wow, this film is immersed under the usual scales of the absolute, annoying and unimaginable film that I've seen recently. The acting was poor and robotic. The story was so nice that you could summarize it a little short of 5 minutes. The audio was too poor and dirty even hard to hear; Perhaps it was closed from the camera? I'm not sure any of the 3 illuminated critics have commented on the movie, but it was not. Perhaps the director saw that his film received better reviews, before starting to show at least real reviews. <br /> <br /> Save your time or you'll just waste your time and money. Absolute suck!
