I can say by other comments that sometimes I could never enjoy this painful piece, as I felt. <br /> <br /> The whole time I saw it I was scared that anyone could make a movie this stupid! Where is the world going forward? I think it's my fault to sit through the whole movie. (Ug!) But it was like a bad car ruin, I could not see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from all costs. It's stupid movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> All stupid - stories, scripts, and especially acting, everything! If you watch the film, you must close the TV and think "Any movie can be so sad", or keep an eye on curiosity, to see if they can get even more stupid (they can not). << br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can call it) have to go back to them seriously, one of them does not have 100 talents, and I am very doubtful that you can live this way. There is terrible vain junk that nobody wants to see them on the right side! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
