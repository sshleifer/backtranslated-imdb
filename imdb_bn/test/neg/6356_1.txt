My first question is not about horrific acting, it's not about horror writing, it's guidance. The choices I made about cinematography are some of the bad decisions I've ever seen. Why should every single bad guy die in slow motion? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shot makes it so that you can not see what's going on. I was right about closing the movie because of the pronunciation of Jalal Mary, when it takes a sexual scene, I think it might be better, not good. If you rate special effects on the A, B, C rating scale, then I have to put it around a watt or around, and I mentioned the acting? Wow, it was bad !!! And the whole "experience of disaster" is the misuse of misuse of the cover phrase, which is: "Matrix must have been deadlier". I've always compared this movie to comparisons compared to matrices. If you do not see this movie, then you can not find any suitable reason to hit your head against the wall.
