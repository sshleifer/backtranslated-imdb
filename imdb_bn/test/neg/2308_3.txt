I remember when "The Love Machine" was released first in the theater. I was only 13 years old, most young people were very young to publish Motion Pictures, but I was not too old to send my mother's papers to school in Jacqueline Susan's novel, and I was abstained from 'naughty bit' with my school colleagues. <</ br> <br /> While I'm not sure what my problem was at such a young age, but I was much more in the book. I bought a "sugarcane" ring like a cover of paper and I think advertising for perfume, "janadu" which was cross-propagated and highlighted in the film. Despite so much interest, I did not really see the film several years later. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many: his hopscocoing script, which suddenly runs chips with a thread that connects from one event to another; His date, horny (brass instrument, I mean) score music of ersatz bacharach; Flat, first adoption performance; Boring sexuality - I have never seen so prominently featured bathrobes before a movie. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or some laziness is said, someone pops someone in blue clothes! Very strange, that; And of course, the 70's fashion circus train on endless display. Poor Dian Canon's performance (which does not decrease in any great way, but the head on the rest of the cast) is said to wear it. However, the main responsibility of the film is Robin Stone, a true photographer, John Phillip Law (just enough) to love each and every girl (and above-the-top male photo photographer). <br /> <br /> The law is just terrible and dragged out of the street, quickly extracting scripts pages, and asking for cooling in the spot. Just useless! Not only that, he was present in blood synthesis or some frustration. She looks across the van and the sick throughout and most of her female is more than a pound smaller than the Costa. Robin Stone should not be hunky, not hockey. <br /> <br /> Anyone making this film difficult (It's slowly as per today's standards) I request you to be surrounded by the "Climatic" war scenes. "Here Miss Canon (balance of 23 pounds of teasing hair) finally leaves the starry acting style and releases it with a smiling smile, at the moment the clip of the film creates a memorable release moment for all those highlighted." Try to compete in the Valley of Dolls " The infamous Explosion-Toilet scene, "Love machine" is finally nothing <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />
