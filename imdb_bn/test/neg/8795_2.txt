<br /> <br /> To make this short and sweet: I hope this movie will not be considered as a basic work for American film-making "General-Asian". Acting was to sub-par, reliant on stereotype, raised voices, and to express the message of ultra-inflected eye-buggies. Chris Chan Park does not go deep into any of his characters, and therefore allows them to be angry / frustrated / distant / unusual Asian characters. These illustrations do not mysteriously make up characters; It makes them confusing and unsympathetic. I think the Asian is more complicated than us. <br /> <br /> I did not get out of the movie. It is incredible that the life of these characters was long, blood brothers, like each other, so that they worked with the length of time to help their friends. The main character was something beyond her superficial trait of girlfriend, incredible. Incredible that hard-working migrant parents will not pay for their boys' college education. The strangers that were strangely even needed, that is, namely: Jack, who was behind the bed and quickly forgot. <br /> <br /> The story line, which I actually did not think was possible, was allowed to come into itself for two reasons: 1) the plain letter for which I had no sympathy / affair, 2) the plot was unreasonable Sichutu has spread to the scene, like the Sense / Donat Shock series with Amy Hills which is simply ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the park for its efforts, because I'm sure that it worked very hard for filmmaking, and I would give him the suspicion about time as a Rookie director / image writer, but I sincerely hope that The next time he will go a little deeper This is the first movie about Korean American experience since this movie is that it means that it is automatically good.
