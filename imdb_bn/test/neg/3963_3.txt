You know that when this movie was a lot better then animal - in this case, a little dog - the best actor on the screen! This movie is so bad, so amateur, feeling embarrassed to see this by dogs. He ("rusty," our golden retivisor) could do better than people here. <br /> <br /> It's almost an interesting story so far: The child finds animals, does not like pets or does not want to be one of the parents, but "pets" protects the children from the wind, and now it's a hero and an official of the family Member. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a big hit, but VHS did not see it until the mid-90's. I was amazed how bad it was. Why so fuss on a film? In the early '70s, I was so beautiful that a beautiful family picture stood in the crowd? Probably. In the decade of the '70s there was not much entertainment, many people are very hungry for stories of beautiful little creatures. Who can prevent this cute little dog? I do not But I can resist the film: This is a grade B story which plays terrible. <br /> <br /> Recommended for small-dog animals only and I mean "lovers" because these pet owners are trying to see this movie even on this day and this age.
