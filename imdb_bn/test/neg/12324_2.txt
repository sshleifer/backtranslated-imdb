It was physically painful through the film, maybe because I (like my age, and a lot of people) I grew up with Sice and at the same time his books - funny, cute, scary and confusing. "Hat in the Hat" destroys all the interest and enthusiasm in the story, and like the cats, Mike Mayer's performance is mostly rebellious. Borscht belt actant, weird pattern, inappropriate joke, charming costume? To see the real problem, the books had to go back and read again: Books are easy. This movie overlines and paths, much more way. <br /> <br /> You do not expect the movie from each toy to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but it will set up a new new one.
