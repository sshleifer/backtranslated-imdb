I'll start the first movie. Remove Abbott and Costlot from Cast and you've got a bad color film, tough cardboard from the casting section, poorly sounded word (especially the time of the song!) And the annoying conversation (eg listen to the line "Mr. Deenclople's" ads). Clearly some studio hacks thought that they could earn cash in Disney's classic presentation of "Mickey and Bianstock", but perhaps the viewers could prevent more impossible (unlikely) or double features (more likely). Even this movie should be insulted to children while showing them. Total waste of celluloid. Now, about the acting of Abbott and Costello. Boad Abbott always played straight man, and was a bad guy from all accounts. On the radio, his character was usually smooth fast ticker and was especially fun when his speed leaked him lines and smooth on the wrong. In movies, he still plays straight man, but a concerque artist. That's not bad, but that character Groucho played perfection by Marx. The real enemy of both of the film Lou Costello Again, he was funny on the radio. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but was not too slow! I got glib with the line, and got rid of me when Abbott's ad would be lib lib. In the film, I do not know whether it is his decision, or his character Sten Laurel is an embarrassing character in the film, which again works even more by Jerry Lewis. Why change? He was funny when he was smart on the radio - but here he became a child-like character, which seems like he is embroiled for every shot cameras. This character is shown in each movie and their reputation on the radio brings only a single stain. Lauril and Hardy coped with a poor (very, very poor) copy of their film career left. Films were even more fun if they played their radio characters instead of changing the stock casting.
