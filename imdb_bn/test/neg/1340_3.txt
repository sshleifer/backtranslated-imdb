I went along with this movie with some difficulty; Both original writing and acting are an excellent composition and unfortunately my fears are realized. It was a comedy and I was sitting in the theater waiting for intelligence and humor - I'm still waiting, it seems. At present, updating the story did not work just fine and making characters completely extremist - why did she introduce the character of BUET Miller? In 1939 the related character was an integral part of the plot. The woman laughed a few times in the movie, but talking to her mother about the exception of one of Mag Ryan's lines, nothing touched me as funny and told her that it was not like the 1930s film - I was so sorry that I was watching the 1930s edition. It was all very sensitive 'sisters together' and actually there was some need for acrobatic intelligence and clever dialogue from the real game- I still see the original film and like a line I've never thought of before. There is no way to stop this new version and the 1939 film is politically incorrect according to today's standards, but each thread was uploaded and after the movie ended - it happened so strongly. This remix should be labeled carefully for a viewer - if you know the original, do not be disturbed: I've been cheated by losing part of my life in this movie that saw this amazing piece. Bring the jungle red !!
