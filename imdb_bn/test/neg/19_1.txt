This film can not be serious because it killed a innocent looking kid named Curtis. The other two psycho kids are kind of beautiful but the Curtis kid is very ugly because he's wearing this huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered about the wrong set and he really told to take revenge on the netheras. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis shooting the man during his sweet time. I put my finger on the fast moving button because he took too long and what was his voice? He is fourteen and ten not as sound. Another thing that I hated was that he used to laugh like an idiot and did not have any indication. <br /> <br /> They then put the boring child in the freezer and the way he finds a flashlight there. Do not have any ideas and do not have music. Music scene has not been fit. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, annoying and time consuming. See a different movie on your birthday.
