I'm encouraged to see this movie because I've heard it's good word: it was this thrilling real crime milestone, annoying, frustrating ... all the jazzs Well, I'm annoyed because I've spent money for it, and I'm surprised that something awful is actually released. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But if this is a "new look", then it is probably "fresh and completely disabled" as "new": I just saw it, and I have no feeling of it or Even what should be tried to understand what the director wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I think I would say something about the plot but really, it was so stupid and inconsistent that if I had done too many plots, I would rarely remember. A "Monson Tape" was a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), Then distributed an hour of "69" silly random footage, then Polanski's assassination (showing a bad school game) and finally some malicious parts about a bunch of drugs And kill each other in a lane (I'm not your child), and then it's over (thank God) (I have no idea Do not tell me to do it), remembering what I just saw!) The performance was very terrible. And how difficult is a "Manson" to convince? Get a small skinny scrawny block, place a messy wing and a mother-in-law on it. You have the mood but this "mansion" does not even look perfect. She just looks like, a block in a cheap wiege and painted in Santa's beard dark black color. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie is really about it: Manson's family has not given any idea, so this film, no idea. It's symbolic! (Yes, okay) I'm still not too angry to spend this money, I've blocked my normal hideout on this site and registered for this photo only to vote 1 and post this warning, which would hopefully make others spend money in this trash Interrupt Stay away from it, it is not worth the rent. <br /> <br /> PS. The latest US TV production "Helter Skater" has received a bad reviews here, but I saw it in the last month (I also saw the original 1976) and compared to the "Mansion family", the new helter skater Brilliant and Flash. And I was frustrated! "Mansion Family" How Bad! This makes a defective and mostly frustrating TV movie perfect.
