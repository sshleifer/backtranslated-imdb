I saw the first movie of Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fédéani, Ukil Miles Egg. In 1961 another film titled Richard Beshat was present, which was the only stab of Hammer Films' Michael Carrass and Westerns; The original Italian title was originally translated as Sam Walabas, but did they call him Amman? Although it was actually the Wallach in Italian version, which certainly shows respect to Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> The course of curiosity and incompetence increases so much that I often become smiling: the terrible number of a great French French culture; A complete irrelevant bar room brawl; Actors are doing Somersaults while being shot; A child villager is doing an impossible dance routine; Slow void uses (actually abuse); And, to watch the character of the most extravagant, Gordon Mitchell and LincolnTat title, easily watch two actresses (played by their actors!) And then never show them in the rest of the movie! ! <br /> <br /> Lead actor Robert Woods is obsessed with Amnestus on his dead body. Actress Simon Vetteli (Actually, the director's own daughter!) The villain's broadcast is quite curious, but unfortunately, he will not get much in this film? Despite having heart changes in the end The main musical theme is actually quite good but again, the title song itself is quite lousy.
