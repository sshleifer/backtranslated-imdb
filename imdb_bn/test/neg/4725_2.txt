One from the wrong side of the "review" track below, two meanings: You will not hear anything except praise from me and do not fool me by my ratings. I can tell you that there is no accident in this review, but technically ... this is a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... screw up the review. I'm just going to ramble a bit. It's been a time since I've done so much fun with so bad pictures. And if you can not enjoy this piece of complete fork, then you just have no sense of humor. First off, this movie was taken seriously, and it's coming from the main direction. The story A doctor's son is sick last time. Daddy-doctor decided that the heart-transplant is the only way to save his son. So, in a really crazy-doctor-style, he decided that Gorilla's heart would do this technique. Of course, the gorilla-heart is "too strong for human", so Sonny-son transforms into this harmful app-man, which is immediately freed and is victims of a murder and rape (because it will make any horny animals, is not it?). Our App-Man's make-up is ridiculous. There is no other way to put it simply: the guys seem to be the face! I'm talking about emigrating here, hard brown kind! Beautiful! The flicker's hole is also wonderful: as well as the actual footage of Open Heart Surgery, we also have extraordinary nets (but quite nasty) that see the effects of blood and gore: a decapitation, eye goggles, throat leakage, snatching on someone's forehead ... it's ridiculous, and in fact It is absolutely astonishing why the night of bloody apps has become a list of the notorious UK video-netizens, because The film portrays the painful things easily taken seriously ridiculous. Oh, the only bloody Epe is going on there, on the other hand. So, not saying that Bustia Humana in El LaRoPilant is a much more accurate title for advertising this awesome and trustworthy story, which has been wrongly misplaced. <br /> <br /> The bloody violence or the nudity portrayal of random women, this movie manages extremely entertaining with elements like nonsensical dialogue, cheap cardboard set, plot stupidity and incredibly bad performance. Just some random examples, perhaps? About sets: Anyone can clearly see that set designers can create different interior sets using the same wall, door, window (etc.): for example: one side of the hospital room - beside windows where the unconscious wrestler girl seems to be lying, the laboratory of the laboratory Shows suspiciously similar to window where ap-man escapes; set-designer also likes  াবরেটরি থেকে পার্শ্ব-উইন্ডোর একটি অংশ নেয়, এটিটিকে আরও বড় করে তোলে এবং ঠিক হাসপাতালের কনফারেন্স রুমে স্থাপন করা হয়েছে; যেকোন ভবনে সমস্ত দেয়াল একই ধূসর হয়; ...)। Then there's park setting. Clearly shot in a studio, you can see (several events) grass is loose. Whenever there is some struggle / war / rape, then the grass is changed only and it makes sense and you can see gray concrete from the studio-floor below. <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the doctors are debating about the disappearance of the unconscious wrestling girl (a latency that would mean bad propaganda in the hospital). , Daddy-Doctor intelligently <br /> <br /> <br /> In the same controversy, a fellow doctor screamed, "A sleepy person can wake up from sleep!" The disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl. <br /> <br /> - After our investigating detective, through the logical process of its logical subtraction, concluding and saying its superior that the killer must be half-human / half-animal, its superior answer added that it is unreasonable, adding the line "It's late, The more potential and more, you are seeing many of the images of terrorism on your television. "... really one of the best lines in the movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br -> Twenty scenes Daddy-Doctor and his Igor's assistant zoo kidnap from the zoo and the unconscious wrestling girl in the hospital - these good thoughts of kidnapping take candy from the baby. <br /> <br /> - Daddy-doctor talks to God a lot, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> - An old lady cried out, "Hey !!! a dead man ... a dead man ... a dead man !! a dead man !!!" - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> EPA-TARD-MAN-like breeding or something has increased, are men trying to rape at this time? Our leading living wrestling beauty (Norman Lazarano) can not even compete in the climatic wrestling competition with the Ap-Tard-Man near the end of the film ... but the ap-tard-man begins to show love of some maternal love in the end ... almost (and I say "Around") The true King Kong-style (ie above a building and on the ground and on people by screaming people). <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's enough now. I'm here to break the fragmentary drake pieces for more than two cents of Vimitron's original result: 2/10. Vitometron rating from track wrong: 8/10 See this movie, people It's good value!
