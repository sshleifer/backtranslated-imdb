That's what they came for the first feature film of Proposed Caret Top. <br /> <br /> A fool surfer (cowboy) got an R & D enterprise from the old Kahuna (Jack Warden). Things are less than swimming, but when the corrupt corporate campaigners try to make an adverse decision, the company gets worse. The most amazing thing about this movie is that the smart-girl Courtney Thorny-Smith, in this red-headed step, seems to be least attractive to the child (but then, he is only a million heirs). Comic Larry Miller got sweat from a plastic cup at 'classic' moments. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try the funny latitude of the United Nations, and this is exactly where this belongs - in the toilet ... flush twice ...
