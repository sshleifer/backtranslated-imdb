The German Regional-Broadcasting Station Station both showed the WRD "General" and the ODC. On Saturday I saw "General" and I thought, it was not very bad, it was not very good. But yesterday I saw the ODC and stopped it almost an hour later. Although Kevin Spacey, the lead actor of the film, seems completely confused and unstable. The general said and ordered the story directly, but the ODC just wanted to be quiet. Guy Richie films have a reference in the film "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but these films do not have the coolness. <br /> <br /> So finally I'll rate it 3 of 3!
