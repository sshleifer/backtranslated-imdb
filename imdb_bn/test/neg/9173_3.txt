Can I say ... it does not have too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> Simmons is the only bright in any way, but he only has 3 scenes. I understand that keeping his screen timeline is minimal, he has kept his mysterious psychological air, but I can not help but his talent is broken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no such scene in the movie that impressed me or thought that I saw something special. The cinematography was quite beautiful ... I thought that the desert in the sepia washed the desert ... is not very inspirational ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood came out of the prison only partially thinking. By adding something to the real story, the average 'twillight zone' script, as well as the entire length of the script, is also created. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
