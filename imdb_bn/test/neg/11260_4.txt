This disappointing adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "The In Electric Miss Of Confederate Dead" Basically it is rather bad because of miscasting the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, usually a fine actor, does not just hold Bark's "Dave Rabiexx". As the main generosity of Robicocos, John Goodman did a poor job as "heavy". The actress-friend of Robichx does not look like "A" link leading to a leading man. The rest of the movie is mainly not a local name, which is not only big for the novel but also justice. <br /> <br /> The movie and Jones' performance are very quick for a thing. In Berke's successive novels, Robichx gives a feeling that he has fits most of his time in his environment, behind and moving slowly. It's like deep south and south louisiana. Subsequently, Robicus is almost manic in his activities. Jones only moves on a fast speed through the whole movie. She does not change Nid bati is lost. Mary Steinberg is out of place. This is just about setting the best things about. The whole movie gives the impression of a TV movie.
