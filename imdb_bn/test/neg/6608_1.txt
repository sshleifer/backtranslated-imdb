A great example of how Brodzki's creation did not make a movie. The first was a book written with a great humor. The book which has many supporters will be happy to provide help when the producers decide to recruit for some reasons who have heard the book very rarely in the first place. Then came a script full of meaningless and meaningless as possible. At the same time, the script was written only for those who actually understood some of the books. Anything made in this movie by any means (such as "I'm not like an ice sheet, you can burn yourself." Yenfar mentioned as a word of caution - warns that this film is critically inadequate). To add to it, we must mention that the amount of money spent on the movie does not matter, but with the effect of two (2) computers, it seems like an amateur production, which is a visible dragon. Even clothing that is really borrowed from the poor theater. That's the best way to look this out. And to add to it we have only a few 'nude scenes' so that they stay in the film because there is no explanation that a person can call plots. The film has only one power that can create very little for everyone - the music is not bad. Although I want to select, I would like to choose it separately. It sounds good if you do not have to look at this failure of super production.
