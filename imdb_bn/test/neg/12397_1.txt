After a meteorite land of "Boston" (really somewhere in Isle of Man), a horrible, dirty alien monster giant was released and a local girls entered the school, causing Maya to become a student and bend it like a zombie-animal. This picture is apparently a loose (and I pressed loose) rebuilding the 1986 film with the same name, it's the same monster but features a different plot. Both images are terrible, but the 1986 edition credits, it was watchable. Do not let it begin with all the problems? Acting, especially from lead professor, was very bad. This image is believed to be held in Boston (we know it because the filmmakers had the concept of putting "Boston Police" or "Boston Gas Company" in everything), but everyone considered British accent to be abominable (at least they use Boston accent. Do not try, thank god). The script is a big faulty mess. When writing the image of a necklace containing a piece of mobile phone you can bring people back to the zombie-student, then how is this the best example of fools? What is our brave hero? No, they run around zombie-shoiting instead of students. I'm glad Director Paul Mathews, who wrote / operated the weak film "Grim" in 1995, does not know exactly how he would do his films. The place of the movie is horribly annoying. The light is awful. The film looks cheap and soft. One of the most frustrating aspects is the lack of significant emphasis. 99% of the death scenes are coming out of a dark corner and dragging someone, when we hear that the "frightened" conference is not a good thing in the past, and of course it does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. Sega opening order in space seems like it can be made in Microsoft Slideshows for God! Finally the "explosion" of gas tanks was just terrible. All right, I want to consider myself as a fair critic, so credit will give me credit - the effect of the animal was really cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
