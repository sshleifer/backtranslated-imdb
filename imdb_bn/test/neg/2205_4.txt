I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, so I was barely very disappointed and frustrated in this movie! The film is actually Robert Ryan, who has tied jam's hero and love triangle. Good sorrow, Gabbi Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this film !! This is not a problem for many visitors, but I'm not from Gabby Hayes, Sidekick's Walter Breinen School ... although I would say that its line was somewhat ridiculous than the boring of these movies in comparison to many movies in his movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gradually, I do not understand or realize I do not understand, I'm just too dirty for his own love <br /> <br /> The direction is unclear, and the two main guys are most dissatisfied. The objection to the end. The whole movie became fake, unreal, and weakly portrayed. <br /> <br /> Plus the side, Anne Jeffres is very sexy in her very short sections of this movie. It is not really sure whether its singer, or anyone else, but anyone had a very nice voice at it. Mrs. Jeffres was also a wonderful couple of moments. The script was much needed for it, or to completely erase its character. As it was, its nice moments were not enough to help the film. Finally, there's Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and is no mean nonsense for setting right things. Some people complain that before 1950, his characters were very happy, but it never bothered me. I would make him happy before the 1950s, or after the violent and violent 1950s ... RyanDolf Scott was a real Western hero. I would like to say it, but if you allow this film to pass, then you are not a hard fan of the dead ... there are so many good scott movies that this Do not miss
