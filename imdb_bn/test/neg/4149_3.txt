Like many other critics like the child of 80, I hate the original V and V: Final Battle. I do not own both VHS and hook up the VCR to see them. I remember this short lifestyle does not really like the series, but why I can not remember, so I rent the first disc In the third episode I was refreshing my memory. It's terrible. The writing is terrifying beyond that. It's not even fun. There was a lot of material to work with them here, but they just did not know what they could do, they became lively alienas with our lifetime. How cool and potentially full Elizabeth Starchild idea? Do they think that in order to compete with their mother romantically, she has to become an intelligent, annoying teen? Mark Cigarette was less embarrassed than having a Bustmaster II when he was trapped in this drill .... The point is, you are one of the little people who discovered V or an old man in us rediscover some old fun, looking at yourself And this skip!
