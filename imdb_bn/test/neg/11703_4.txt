Ghost Story is in love with an interesting feminist revenge story, senior list of A-list, colorful flashbacks like nifty-colored blacksmiths with old men's youth. Awesome staccato music is an excellent actress actress in upcoming fear, atmospheric New England winter weather, and title role. The Ghost Story can be much more effective in black and white, and can eliminate more louder special effects and present more casual screenplay (why do not we have to worry about two trailer-parking acholites scripts) The biggest damage to the film is Craig Wasan (Bill Clearly cut off during Mehra's birth), who may be perfect from editing or bad acting Not fully effective. He seems to be "expert" in huge eyes, wide-scattered feedback shots; Here's a lot of personality However, unlike Elise Krige, face confrontation, mysterious, horrible terrible horror at the bottom. However, his EVA gallery is even unclear before completing his fate; I mean, a young woman, such as "I want to bite you" or "Dance with me, you are a little tad!" There is no living land already. The Ghost Story has been much better at low-key, wall-fall mode. Overdone special effect undercut the complete chill factor.
