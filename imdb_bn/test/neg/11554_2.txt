I was interested in watching this movie while in the mid-1990s (30 miles from Eskamba) of Michigan's high peninsula. This is U.P. With its value and some superficial understanding of the quirks, promisingly enough starts. Life. But Jeff Daniels was obviously not involved in a less-rooted approach, which was considered as a suitable creator of space and people. Instead, he presented very strange humor and some wildly unfounded mysterious / supernatural elements. Although this can be done in a well-known region of the United States, it is not a good movie.
