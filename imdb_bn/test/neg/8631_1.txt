This is a horror movie ever made in Hollywood. How can it be accepted as a European masterpiece and warns its life until it gets slack, unless it is a dry hole that has a pest body on the windowsill. Horrible because it reveals how the world of Hollywood actually works: The unexplained meaning of the dross. It makes me amazed that if the Hollywood process fails to forget the talent, how many great movies can fill my memory straps. Tears for children killed! Watch Spurloos or keep reading golden eggs, if you dare, because they will come back to you for eternity in your life forever: when you are walking on the street and you see a 'missing' poster; Lots of common looking parking; When you hear the Tour de France on the radio; And, especially, when you think "what's the harm?" After a sock with a hole in it on a perfectly ordinary day. <br /> <br /> I can give it a blank.
