His widow, Karen Tienne (Lori Hururing), recently spent her entire money to care for her sick wife, moved to her late husband's run-down family home in his two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chalo Moreetz) village in Pennsylvania, where Local legends are talking about moving around the streets. <br /> <br /> The author and director names of this film were enough to send my spine within the opening credits: Bois Davidson is responsible for 'Genius' for writing scripts for STV titles such as Antips 1 and 2, Spider and Crocodile, while J. S. Cardone God gave 'video nasty' slayer and dull vampire jump. As such is responsible for the suspicious genius, I did not expect much from the Wicked Little things. <br /> <br /> And after finishing the film, I'm happy that I keep my expectations low. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film sometimes looks good, makes use of strange wooden locks, and Cast gives reasonable performance in providing a cleft drift that works with them, but the plot is so hard, bad writing and enthusiastic to be enthusiastic Impossible to relate. The most important, most likely, movie killers, who kill every child in the wake of death every night, do little work to add at least a bit of scare, makeup smoke, black contact, and some starkly stained shop stains. In the sense of danger. Scout Taylor-Compton and the Company, to warn the small fears, the Creator creates a loud shout with every collision, but their complimentary attempts to scare among the audience come in handy: Do not get rid of little harmful ones <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, a good creator, but totally, maliciously O Little Things (UK ekaeeica hair) immediately forgotten trash ?? There is another quarrel with Cardon and Davidson's paintings only.
