Lugosi as God? Transvestiteites discussed in a movie in the film in the 1950s? By Golly, this will be an Ed Wood film. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie, at the same time I felt the combination of crime, joy and vomiting. The story is about Glenn (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing change-ego glenda. However, when this movie was created now, I saw Kevin Clayne playing Glen / Glenda. Notice how all changes to the cross-dragcer's version of their male names (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberts, etc.). It tries to portray sympathetically as a mental disorder rather than a graphic distortion. <br /> <br /> However, Glenn Glenn / Glendor manages to slip into slavery and S & M sequences in his early story. In addition to these intense scenes, the devil shows himself, probably having a bad hairstyle. Dialogue and motion is not existent, but the film is enjoyable in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sterno said, keep your favorite lace pants for this.
