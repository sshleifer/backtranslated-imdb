I think I was actually expecting a Bollywood remix of "The Fog" from the title, but in fact it's sort of "what you did in the summer of summer" with some elements of "the screen", and not a very good one. In addition to a couple of very entertaining songs and numbers of dance, it is quite awesome. It probably got a decent budget and yet it was not that delicious, it was ruined over the residual repetition. A young woman is not afraid to enter a beauty contest, because she wants to conquer her sister (she does not look like her brother), but she wins anyway, and of course, the vague person comes after him, and is killed, After which the "hide the body" comes in an enthusiastic game. Of course, the body disappears and no one knows why, but nobody knows, and they are finally waiting to uncover a ridiculous plot. With all these tedious rehabs, some nifty dance numbers, especially the Simran Party's dance number, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it is very colorful, it's good and low fun, and it's completely dirty film. I would rather see this old Ramsey brothers' brother's movie, although some feel that they are not available, in most cases it is a crime itself. But this is not a big crime like this photo. I take one for this one observer group, so take my advice, do not bother me. 10 out of 2
