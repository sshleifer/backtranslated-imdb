I am very excited about this film because of its slightly liberal plot line. For more details, <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Really terrible - wood, shallow. <br /> <br /> Grief is poor, so bloody is weak that I can only think why they are annoyed to use graffiti artists. It was clear in spray scenarios that they got other people to 'work'. They can paint the actors and they can save some cents for themselves. <br /> <br /> I want to avoid all this cost of this image. <br /> <br /> Children used to soundtracks. I heard something on my iPod, I'm going to be afraid of coming back into my mind a few days ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> As long as you're thinking of yourself "Wow, it's been a while since I've really seen a movie."
