The joke about the children of Bebas in the opening ceremony was as soon as this movie should have ended. I like Robin Harris and most of his comedy but really interesting routine can not see the whole family. Try to make an interesting joke for Jerry Seinfeld's joker to present a subject and as long as you can turn it into a movie. This movie had to be self-service because I could not find anyone who found the settings or antique contact. The most interesting thing about this movie is to stop the author and producer as some of the price. 1/10 because they are no half star.
