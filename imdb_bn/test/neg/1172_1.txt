The story of Ed Gin is an annoying and horror story. Ed was truly an offensive character and his legacy continued to inspire the 'great' like Tooth Fair, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How such an impressive man has inspired such annoying melodramatic fragments? Ed gyne produces breast breast, cracks from crab, light out skin, and dances with human skin on the bottom of the moon. They did not make any film, because we had to give a fictitious horror deputy and instead a homeless, sexually hungry girlfriend had to give a fabulous story. This movie began to go out of its way to falsify the false history of the movie. Am I worried that most movies make history better than the way of truth; This one seems to reduce it. I just do not get it.
