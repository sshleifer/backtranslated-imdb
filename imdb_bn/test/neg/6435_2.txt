License fee to see this trash, and pay for it with strict cash? Sunny, no sign of laughter, God knows how it won the buffets! <br /> <br /> We are now under the "eastenders" for the twentieth century. What, when the great British people are going to see this terrible soap? Crass Pop! This program does not highlight the reality at the east end of London compared to the daily life of Beirut and never did it. <br /> <br /> I know the ancestors (kind) are kind, brave, hardworking and trustworthy. And one of their highest attributes is humor. The Eastenders went through the worst of London Blitz and still kept two fingers close to Hitler. And what do we see on our screen for five days a week (including our public)? There is nothing more than a bunch of crying, "wounds from neck" wimps, who seem to do something other than to sit in a pub of sniping each other completely. What a great advertisement for Britain !! Do the writers really believe that they are pumping? Obviously, the euphoria of public works, but then I heard that apparently nobody could be convinced to believe in something.
