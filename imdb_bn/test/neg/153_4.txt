I think why critics consider this movie to be five big stars, it's not fantastic, but I think it's a look from director Sean Levi (night at the museum, cheaper by dozen). Originally 14 years old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm from Middle Frankie Monjim) often lied to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not write his creative writing he will fail in his entire semester and he will be able to grade in the summer Repeat. So he completed his work, but withdrew from Hollywood producer Martin Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he left his paper with the story of "Big Fat Leah" in the car. He found out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and turned it into a big movie, so he and his best friend Kleley (Man of Amanda Bains) are in a mission to prove Jason to tell the truth. Of course, Martin Jason's parents are so nasty and sunny to give a phone call to Harry (Michael Brian French), and he even burns the "Big Fat Leah" letter. So now Jason and Claire are determined to make Marty's life as hell as possible, until she agrees to call Jason's father. They make blue nuggets in their swimming pool, and orange hair color in shampoo, and chaos for Mart√≠'s carrier, creating more nasty jokes. Jason thinks he wants to give up, but do not worry, all those characters, who despise Marty's, help in the final work, and as soon as Jason's parents bring him, he wants to prove his authenticity and the boy he is giving, big style. Mrs. Kirkham, Monty Kirkham, Donald Edison Fishes like Vince Jackson, Mrs. Phil Caldwell as Sandra Oh, Russell Hornsby Marx Dancan, Christine Tucci Carroll Shepherd and American Piey John Choi as Dustin 'Dusty Wang. . Muniz Choicey, Bairns proved to be a very gifted gifted support, and even though he was wasting his time and talents a little, yet Jayanti is getting worse. This is a children's film, so if it seems to be a bit chic, or predictable, remember it, and try to enjoy performance and slapstick. OK!
