The film tells you to be aware and wise. It destroys anything and everything, the Bible claims to be true. People like me were interesting in the first episode and the second was crushing. This is said to be "condemned", and if you believe it. It is sad to hear that many people consider it to be the best form of the Bible. However, this movie shows you many topics and topics, which can be interpreted as the film version of "Revelation." Some of us think that such things will not be misused. One good thing about the movie is that it promotes strong moral awareness and doubles your work. The director has just forgotten that some people already work on the basis of the fact that they believe and love in the Bible ... why would they try to change it, unless you do the devil?
