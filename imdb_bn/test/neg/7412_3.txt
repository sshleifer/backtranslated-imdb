Well, I read another comment. It does not seem to sounded any better, but decided to tape it anyway. Perhaps it will not be so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course I'll look at the same strange things. Extra use from faded black, some strange camera angle and cross-cut dialog for different conversations with the same people at the same time! But I see all that I think: Well, maybe it will always be annoying if it always goes slowly. Conversation is not that exciting, but compulsory kind. And after the really small scene the Black Constant Fading really makes the story feel like fast forwarding very interesting part too. Without annoying bit. At the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I really liked this picture? Not really. There were some interesting ideas about how to keep from interrupting the audience when the director was trying to identify the character. But he is overdoing it. It gets annoying, and sometimes confusing. Apparently, he only managed the second movie, so perhaps he would learn in the future and make a really good thing. And if you are sitting there (in the future) after this wonderful reading, now the famous director second movie is worth the watch. Well, if he is good in the future, definitely check this shit and be surprised that he has never achieved the third. Otherwise, the film is not really valuable until you are interested in making movies and you want to see a way to see which you can see compulsive boring roles.
