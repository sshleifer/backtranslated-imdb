I've never seen the original 1930s version of the film, but I've seen this remake in a big production studio for several years. Actors like Mej Ryan and Anneet Benning once were close to one level of perplexity, painful to sleep on their way through the role of bad writing. There is no desire to be present in front of the camera for any person in this photo. <br /> <br /> Magic Pocket Smith and Deborah Messing played a vague role that does not have any effect on the plot and adds no entertainment value. The character of Jada Pacquet Smith is not used to be more than appearing to be African African lesbian character, but in reality he wants to look cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stealing to portray wealthy but annoying and desperately neglected husband and fun to cover the role of silence by portraying Vixen. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, elegance, humor, or lack of sympathy for any characters. It was almost felt that the film was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful hope light, but it is slightly slow and it varies around Claris Leachman. Leachman still has a tremendous talent in bringing her extraordinary charm and ridiculous to the film, her a small role.
