Played badly, poorly written and badly managed. Special effects are cheap. The best performance is by Yvette Napir, but that's not saying much. The story is a confusing mess about corporate greed, which tries to rescue the remains of an astronaut station and those trapped in the trap. <br /> <br /> There is little doubt and there are even fewer steps. It is a car that is not a bad car, but the rest of the film is only lost every time.
