No, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is not a movie, it is an excuse to dance to the people. It's not just good. Even the dance is half of entertaining as a slow and medium 'Dirty Dancing', leave a good dance movie. <br /> <br /> Is this love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is this comedy? It is not that this film is quite a bit, that it fails to try to get the film done. The film has become more meaningless as the film progresses further. <br /> <br /> Actually, the terrible, curtains in all respects are trying to say something about our relationship but unfortunately failed. Look for the moment - when Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you feel that the film may be better for highlighting the dust atmosphere. For one second.
