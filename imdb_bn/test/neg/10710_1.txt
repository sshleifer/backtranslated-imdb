Warning: This may damage your movie. See, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> Think that we can not learn from the past as humans. The futureist society has glamorized Hitler's belief, leaving a nation of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. It makes my stomach sick. Also the amplitude of a y bomb is insane. Even in our struggle for self-preservation, our instinct will prevent the elimination of humanity. We've done wrong in the past: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in '45, but due to this we avoid a major mistake in '63 during the Cuban missile crisis
