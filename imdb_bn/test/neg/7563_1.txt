When I first opened the first scene in Eugene, Oregon, I should know that the characters you love to like and who regret their excommunication days from high school, they have a film bud, but they can not, such victims are unable to It's so bad and worse than dialogue that's worse. <br /> <br /> Then, Clich, three high school lost in the losing LA, and here if the film can be realistic, they have been shown trying to find a career. But not, as a used car salesman, the other is truly hurt to sell the magazine in the garage call center. Even more appealing to the audience than the horrific foreign accent, rather than the horrible terrible act that the venue operates. And, in order to establish an executive recruitment agency to earn money from fraudulent insurance scams, they show "good life supposedly" in LA night stages, so that they do not get SAG well with the cast of tall and bad actors ... <br /> <br /> I could go to this bad movie, but walking from the theater, there were six people at the beginning, and when I was f When the man left, the only ones in the audience resin. I wanted to like this picture, but I could not find a qualification among stories, characters, writing, dialogue, or actors. Anyone should throw this film in retirement Amen ... enough ...
