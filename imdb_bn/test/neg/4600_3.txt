This movie does not mean well. I was really frustrated by so many levels on. It's hat hat type bukowski Hey, I read that man in college - see what Matt Dillon is doing with him. And I like Matt Dillon. I thought he came like a little closer to Hong Kong, but most of them are just crazy cheeks. Although I would take care of a character, and here's a lot of care about here. I think time may be rude to Bakoski, and it bothers me a lot, because writing posts were difficult during the counter culture time. Sitting hard, the scene went somewhere, and a soundtrack that I want to vomit. I got less, asking for too little.
