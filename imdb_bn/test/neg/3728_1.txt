Without any doubt, I sat through the worst movie. And that's exactly what I said, because I saw the fate of the terrible movie. <br /> <br /> But I did not see a movie which represented every single character, it was an intelligent man. Sincerely, the entire script was not a respectable character. <br/> <br /> Can I not believe that Keonu Reeves and Cameron Diaz agree to participate in such an absurdity? And I did not see their other movies, I've enjoyed their performance so far. It was not that bad acting, just the whole story line was moronic.
