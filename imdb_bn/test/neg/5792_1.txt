This movie hit my face. I do not understand it ... things have happened, irrationally, and usually they are bursting in song and dance numbers. I can not praise people praising this praise. There are B-movies, and then there are B-Musical instruments, and then there are rakulas. <br /> <br /> The songs want me to walk in a wall. The only saving grace is that in the musical explosions a musical video converts that makes the pain easy, but why it still fails to prove justification for it to exist. The most horrific section of the movie is the cartoon dance of Tony Basil with his weird song. But in a brilliant way, he can tell the deaf to the tone, in contrast to the pop music sensation Rakula (Muka Rapula) and Mona ..., he can manage to find the notes he's looking for. So if you want to ask about life for about 90 minutes then check out this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
