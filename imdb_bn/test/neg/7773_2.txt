If you are a sucker for corny movies and are looking to see something you do not have to pay close attention, this may be worth watching. The story itself is very unrealistic Dialogue is not very credible. It is suspicious that you will find yourself related to these characters because none of them are very much liked. The acting has been very bad. Victoria Pratt came out of place with another Cast, because she looks as much as possible and talent as an actress. Although it does not say much, it's one of the best performers I've ever seen from choreography. She seems to be good with age. Overall, this highly melodramatic movie is the best mediocre.
