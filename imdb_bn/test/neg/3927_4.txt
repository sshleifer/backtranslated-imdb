I'm a big fan of Jezel and not one of Patrick's. So I saw it in the course of seeing its performance and of course, it was nice. I do not think the director was adequate for the film because many bad choices were rebuilt: shot corners, block etc. If the director was trying to give it a "realistic" feeling, they failed and lost some good performance. It's about It is almost always felt that the camera was too stable, too far from acute facial reactions - and many times the dialogue was gradually created due to its interaction with the interplay of the functional characters. This is easily resolved by changing the cutaways or the camera angle. But I thought the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the idea that the scenes were shot more than once and the power from the actors ... was used.
