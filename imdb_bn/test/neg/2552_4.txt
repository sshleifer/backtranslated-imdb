First of all, "Mexican Wayneff" in Texas is not a Verubil movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is about the murder of the local villagers of small towns of Furlaf, Texas. I think the distributors named the original title so that it could make extra money or something. And I guess it really works because I bought this piece of piece, it seems so stupid. Anyhow the movie is no good. Actually it's bloody horror. But when I bought it, I did not expect anything else. It's a low-budget horror movie with a jolly monster. You should check this movie if you enjoy less budget horror with bad conversations, actors and some gore. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaadad <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst performances I have ever seen. The actor tries hard and it gets ridiculous at all. They do not say any line in almost normal way. They always say they are just tone about this completely wrong. It's almost stupid showing almost like a stupid parody. They look like single shots only once each and happy about it. The worst of them is a blonde girl who is supposed to play a bimbo. She is the worst of them all. I've never seen a bad actor like him (and I've seen Potterdale). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can not be a bimbo about her. I hate him <br /> <br /> Some shots in this movie were actually quite good. That shots of the day are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movies shoot at night when the whistle strikes and the light is very dark. Gore scenes are small and small, but really tropical and violent. The effect is really pleasing, but the way I like it. Fascinating looks beautiful, and it's easy to see that it's a guy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.
