Marilyn Deirech is like a great Konzar Perez, Joseph von Sternberg's "The Devil is a woman" temptation that frustrates all men for frustration. Her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she has a real star of her full-command command, her incandescent. But she is the only good thing in the movie, (she is so good that she keeps you watching this dress; if any other actress suspects she can do the same thing). <br /> <br /> The story is an unexpected hair follicle, (certainly the novel of Pierre Lewis was better), among which Dietrich's immortal monster Lionel Atuil and Caesar Romero destroyed the life of two friendships, which were along the border of the Pitrification. And this is a ugly looking movie for Von Sterberg, (probably kept on its rough ugly issues). On the other hand, Bunuwel thought it enough to emphasize the "deliberate vague object" its supernatural aspects, to throw two different actresses in the same land. Not a film director's best hour, and the Boonuel version can be a good movie, but it's a dramatic performance.
