Disgust Yes, it's just a deadly arrest in Macmartin or Washington Washington. In the film, the mother suddenly asks her little boy, until she finally wants to tell her what she wants to hear. Repeat court investigator and "therapist" pattern. This question is sexual harassment, a relentless repeated attack on her own path. <br /> <br /> Moviemakers throw a doctor over the physical evidence of abuse, perhaps to support the point of view of the film: two to four years old never "make up like this". Well, if they know that every adult is asking them. Frustration for those who know this kind of piece of support in this piece of unauthorized asking techniques seems to get a successful prosecution in real life makes it an exercise observer. <br /> <br /> (They have added special arrest events at the end of the "proof" of their case - there is no incident parallel to this mythical incident in real life. spoiler, but you will know it when you see it.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are tortured, sometimes by payroll providers. But to watch a movie that provokes playful, violent charges against many innocent people, I do not think - to see the rebuilding of innumerable children as well as the execution of the execution of the lives of the accused.

Rape of vulnerability? <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever been accused of child abuse, thanks to heaven, but my 12-bar-grandfather was accused of witchcraft and was killed for that. Those who are full of what they think are three hundred years ago, just as holy anger is just as dangerous. Such exciting spirits - "These allegations of Satan's misuse have spread throughout the country, there must be some!" "So tell the jury that!" - Just lay eggs on them. <br /> <br /> And whoever thought that less than 10 year old children should play this role in children under five? It is noteworthy to see their line giving; How terrible was this work? Apparently the moviemakers' commitment to fighting child abuse is not applicable to them. And child actor's parents are thinking? "Melinda" (strangely, at least in 2005, in the A & E network version, but I think it was Casey Freel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsal) was great. Pros or, though, they were very young to publish this material, very little to pay for it to work. In spite of the brutal exploitation of this real life, Emmy was nominated for the instruction "You Know Muffin Man" - which showed how insane things came back in 1989.
