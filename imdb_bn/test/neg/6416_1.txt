In a word, God is awful ... many plot holes .. Um, yeah ... who takes their child to dig the body in the middle of the night? And what is stolen skeleton with his wife? Why, the shrinking itself was knocked on the neck? And that's the whole dog thing .. I mean, really! Sparrow describes from the beginning that this mystery has completely destroyed for me. I mean, if he narrates the story then he could say clearly, so there is no scope to stop him. Where is the mystery? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect a plot hole in such a picture. But, for that reason I lost a lot of stories. What kind of fingerling name is? Or the tops? Why dig the wife body up? (Who's that?) Or go alone in that insane witch shelter? And where did all the candles come from? Why does the author have his PO box in the frequency book ??? I mean ... and the book goes to the bookstore and takes the wife to the unemployed ?? The way is very convenient ... Oh and Happy Birthday honey, here is a book about a serial killer .. What a wonderful gift! The book is 20 pages long, half empty, and makes it boring to read it. If he is really obsessed with this book, will he not read a shot at all? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How was he playing? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Is the person actually going to the bus to run the bus? It is not good if you are not suitable for biting it until the end of the drama. <br /> <br /> It looks like the committee wrote this article. I think that the first draft was probably nothing to do with the number 23. It seems like they needed a strange hook to ridicule the audience that some supernatural things are going on, in the end it does not seem to actually do anything. I mean, I was not expecting a godfather or anything, but everything about this movie was down and down. Apart from all the numerical staff, this film is really good, instead of some hackneydid she's SE7en knockoff. <br /> <br /> Horrible, weirdly ridiculous and otherwise the total sniper.
