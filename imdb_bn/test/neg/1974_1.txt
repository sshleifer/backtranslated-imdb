In the 1980's, this luncheon middle class classroom became a subject of hatred by Ben Elton, a new species of talented comedians. What kind of dirty do they deserve? Well Terry and June were never tricky, it was not a well-written story with different threads which intersect in conclusion. It was a show seen from your mom and dad and probably grandparents. They make chocolates instead of laughing, but they can never get annoyed by the show, so it was not a challenge to challenge them. <br /> <br /> A foot of the grave was introduced as it appeared in the first scene. Just another Terry and June to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some TVs have been repeated in a TV channel. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Terry and the comedy of TV to improve in June. It's hard to find kind words - Terry Scott made the best of poor scripts.
