Seeing this piece of nuts, you can find out why Leimis is driving on the left side of the road ... this film is a perfect non-brenner! The joke (if the correct word for it is ...) is mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and miss a fist-line. Save money and get drunk. You might probably enjoy enjoying this movie, perhaps!
