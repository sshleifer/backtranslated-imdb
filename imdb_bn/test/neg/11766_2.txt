Here and there are interesting pieces about Bruce Weber's preferences and dislikes. Perhaps if a professional editor put it together for biology, I would have been more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 on a movie festival in it. For an autobiography, almost nothing about Bruce Weber is not revealed, he likes to see photographs, shoot interesting people, especially teenagers, and listen to jazz. The director of "Krum" has produced many more interesting and integrated films.
