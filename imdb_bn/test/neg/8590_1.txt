I just got back from "AGS". After watching this, I'm convinced how important it is to write the film in a big way, Stone has not seen any NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The game Montage was almost invisible and 90% of the other shots of the movie were close-up. Is there anything in this movie that has not been brought to "North Dallas Foli"? <br /> <br /> Older star players ... check. Young hot shots .... check. Painkillers .... Check. Check out the owner who "do not drink it". Crazy off-field behavior .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Players of Dallas (such as December or January) at an outdoor stadium, yet people are sitting in tank-tops and shorts ! And what was with that light? Did they play at the Japanese Cubic Theater or at the sports stadium? <br /> <br /> The techniques shown in the game were ridiculous. It is the fourth and the inside of one of the "sharks" 30. Dallas increases to 35-31. Notice the frequency field. It will not only understand football-based, but then you will get a better final order where they can score and go for two-point conversion. Hell, the game w / extra point tie and the stone could make it even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> "Old time" football players were lame montages supposed to play as a tribute? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> and the script ... u More clips you can shake a stick .. oops, there is another one. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
