Normal effort, which achieves some success in adapting the story of the classic Odyssey piece of nostalgia periods of '30. During this time the adventurers escaped from the runaway, scouring about depression, preventing them from hurting the southern blast. <br /> <br /> The greatest power of this movie is the wonderful music soundtrack, it's just that in the era of the era, but the spiritual references that are the traditional run of the film. In addition to the value of the movie's voice, just plain fun to listen to the music. <br /> <br /> This image is inappropriate by the fact that the characters are not really desired. In a comedy, you need that element to make fun of them with their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, enthusiastic, meaningless relatives who really have no positive points. They are not imposing enough to make you hate them, so it is difficult to make their relationship with them. They are offered as shoes, but like those who put bridle and bridal makeup on the parados, they are not just funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired, these guys take on a "ODC," encountering various symbolic characters (some even mysterious). Everyone is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid." People are joking right and left, and as a result, no one is particularly attractive or interesting. The movie does not like its characters, and it does not let you like them. <br /> <br /> Riverside is whipping people with baptism, beautiful Siren, stealing cars, boxing, radio propaganda, stick; All the discrete fashion is throwing you. Some may laugh, others confuse or annoy you. Smile when I beat the snot out of a ridiculous guy especially the insulting lead character. But there was a much uninterrupted unused scene; An example: Some 30 'Dealing-type folk strafes the cow with a Tommy-gun. Comedy? As a symbol? No; Only selfless violence, which illustrates this story from the main source of intellectual nature. <br /> <br /> Other adaptations of Odyssey are better. If you're not a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But Buy Soundtrack CD; The music is great.
