Can i say It was a terrible movie to see. In general, I'm not generally critical of gay movies, because in most cases there is usually a low budget, but it leads me towards the wall. I mean, this gay movie happened? Did not learn anything from gay producer and director Gass Van Santos and Eng Lee? Just sitting through the whole movie was like sitting in the dentist's chair and finding my tooth's teeth. I used to pray for the moment where I feel any kind of connection to the letters, but it never happened. Most of the character performance was not very believable. This is one of the worst movie specialties for locally produced TV stations. I can not seem to disappoint you so much after seeing Tauri Spelling being one of the biggest fans of this film and the directors have done the last thing in "Last Days". It was definitely not worth the wait. Surely, some hours of my life I will never return and certainly will not buy it in DVD.
