Have I seen a bad movie? Not that I can not say that. This was kind. If the director is still alive: 1. He does not have to be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how do I want to spend my 2 dollars full $$ <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (I am a man) and I would like to give a papers when I open myself (seriously) before opening my uranium. <br /> <br /> 2. It has some familiar names (Caspar Van Deeven, Erica ElinkaÄ‡, Kulio). They do not help, and after this film their career goes officially. <br /> <br /> 3 The dialog I've ever heard is the worst. "I want to ejaculate on your bozonkas."? What kind of writer were they in this picture? Is he still using hook-on-phonics and mixed his letters to make these letters? Or is he trying to kill a director by some people? <br /> <br /> 4. Look back at this "film". Because I certify that you do not want to override it. <br /> <br /> 5. This "film" Helen Keller has to get up and walk from the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The film set looks like adult-size McDonald's playgrounds. I just waited for some time in this so-called "Dracula" movie to read in the ball hole. <br /> <br /> 7. Also, I liked them for 3000 years, they still have a headset with the wire to their face. There is no Bluetooth, no wireless handset, there is no chip in the brain, but in 1983, using the handset used by the telemarketing agency outside of the business (it's a great job set director, Real Professional. I hope you are currently unemployed and read this.) < br /> <br /> 8. I do not know what special effect was in charge, but I could do better with my VHS camcorder behind my home, whose battery was not there. <br /> <br /> 9 I had a devout Catholic before this "film". But after watching it, I know there is no God, because if there was, he did not allow the film to be produced. I am an atheist now <br /> <br /> 10. I'm honest I can not talk about the end. Last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> Even though people bother you, you are strange (or brave) but you smile so much that you will be out of this movie. Do not see this. It literally destroyed my life. Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Comment to the director: I hate you. After seeing this, I feel empty inside of you. My wife and children left me and hated me because I could not see or talk about it. I am on top of my work, my dignity, and all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or later (which does not look better than my new faith).
