Here spoiler: At the end of the movie, you die a little part. You'll spend vain searches for the missing pieces of your remaining life, but it's gone, it's gone. Night watch for your night in the neighborhood of your neighbors window. Friends and family will try to pinpoint when you turned into dead walking. You will have to answer them with some mumblings about their questions and concerns a blank valve and a runaway testicle. When AMC inevitably makes Tomts "month movies", then a series of mysterious murders in your city will be held. You wake up the next morning in the kitchen floor with the brain tastes in your mouth. Then you'll crawl in the living room and onto the couch. If you look at the wall, a little wet yourself and then will begin to laugh maniacally. Because once inside your dead, Jake Busey in a bang is actually fantastic fantastic fun.
