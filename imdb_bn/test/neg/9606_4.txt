I tried to give this opportunity, but it can not sit well with me. Although performance is not good, it is not written. Two oldest brothers, Derek and KC, are equally annoying; I suppose that we should be surrounded by the case, that's the hero, but I do not think he likes it all. Parents are often portrayed as speechless. Three small children are the most densely populated items; Leigh and Edwin sweetly match them and Marty is very cool. Plot lines have become a little distant and the whole compound is difficult to swallow in most cases - mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really trying hard to mix. Overall, I think it's thumb down-down.
