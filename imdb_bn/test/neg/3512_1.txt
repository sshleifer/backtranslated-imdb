This movie was awesome and ultimately surprised me why anyone went to make it. Now it was not bad at all, I studied the film and the film was very nicely integrated and there were very good movies with interesting corners in very good movies and excellent camera work. I hope I could meet again at school because it could create a good writing paper. But ........ After graduation in my graduation and most of my film's ugly losses, I realized that a movie should be the most entertaining, this film was long and annoying and I'm not sure when I finally reached it . It was a point that my time was worth. <br /> <br />
