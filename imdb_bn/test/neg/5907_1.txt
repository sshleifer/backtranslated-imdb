This movie is not funny at all, and I would imagine the Jewish people to be quite aggressive. (And I'm Jewish) Why? First of all, the whole film portrays the playwright Junker as a liar / cheater shadow business and police, when his son Gay, his daughter-in-law, and his niece are a prostitute. Then the indecent relationship between the family, his first daughter was with him and his son and then with his son to his son. Two cruel relations in the family. I am surprised that they have not added conspiracy to be mentally disabled in the family ... now, this really will be the ideal sub-human! (Lesbian, Lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Full annoying movie. I am surprised this image does not receive any response from a Jewish community.
