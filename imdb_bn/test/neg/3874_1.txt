This movie was potential. The script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark environment with themes like Suicide, Fathers, Apologies, and Chris - "Not going to go anywhere in 10 years". This is a significant contrast to the original Mag 7, which was luminous, ridiculous and even worse. <br /> <br /> This tone is a very interesting change, and if they improve the characters, then perhaps I'm <br /> <br /> <br /> but instead they are much more in the unreasonable (and ridiculous) battle scenes. Time wasted, editing badly together. At one stage you see a horse fall, and after 5 seconds you see the same scene again. But many will not notice that, because already two dozen horse travel (I'm not very excited), and then we're already stopped. <br /> <br /> which leads to my title. Review. This movie was widely cut due to animal cruelty, so there is a possibility (if you decide to see it) you will get under the water under the water. There is a bullfight where the bull bulls of bullocks, and encouraged cheering as a sudden crowd, an empty, empty empty only matador. The arm was good, maybe it was stupid, I was submerged. More likely, the scene was cut off. <br /> <br /> After a cock scene is seen, in the original version, before the crowds of the Mexicans rejoice, one of the birds was scared terribly. This was cut. But we still see enough to get very annoying. <br /> <br /> But the worst scenes are horse throws. One by one, you get the yanked foot of the horse, thousands of pounds sent onto his head. In one scene, a horse is thrown, and then it is squirming on the ground in paralyzed glue, an explosive right goes down in his neck. <br /> <br /> This photo was created in 1966 when Hollywood was just beginning to control animal cruelty on film. This is probably one of the last fixes where you can see it. So if the sort of stuff floats it Yer boat, check it out and you'll get a light thrill. But if not, you will be frustrated or flattened out of bored.
