"Tart" A good example of the old era, Jogi Bharar says: "If you do not know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else". Writer / director Christina Wei (in her first feature) has been able to make $ 3 million movies, which has ended somewhere else. "Tart" is a description of a character that can be associated with a logical person, a black comedy without any comedies, or a sex movie other than a special sex. <br /> <br /> Swain film in contrast to the criteria, "Tart" is actually a capable and experienced production designer employed. Two very nice shots are good enough to provide: Sain and Burton took a bubble bath together and the Swine scene in the park - "Alice in Wonderland" featuring an excellent mix of sculpture. The symbol included in this material supports the possibility of some visionary talents and wishes to create a quality film, despite the Wei (despite the absence of linear logic or tone). It is also possible that Wei is trying to coordinate the somewhat evocative "Metropolitan" and the campus classic "Cruel Intention", which also deals with the upper class of Manhattan. There are many camera shots that are made by windows and gates, still some tight shots of face and eyes. Emblem of the character and their motivation to indicate deliberate distances and secondly the former technique. "Tart" takes at least the edge of the camp camp, and it is advisable to go to that direction. At first, they tried to dump the visible swain in the trash. Then the whole thing (as Joab Gray played in the "cabaret" with the Jewish guerrillas, played the extreme role) as his father is Jewish. <br /> <br /> Reducing the appearance of Swine's acting strategy in his other movies (here's inserting chewing in here) but in "Tart" it actually shows the ability to stop itself. This is the best performance of his career. It is in the light of "Pumpkin", in "Girl" Volo provides some formula for her physical degradation from super intelligence. This transition was almost half complete when creating "Tart"; So go ravages at the time. <br /> <br /> It's nice to support Ms. Murta Burton ("Six Sections" I think the good girl) and Lacey Chabat's role. The rest of the cast is just awful, though some blame for it will go through the Weiwe script and the direction.
