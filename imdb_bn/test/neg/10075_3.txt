I was waiting for this movie since the last world came out. It does not disturb me that the Lost World was not primarily intellectual, and here, I was just waiting for a good giant movie. It's about "people eat dinosaurs." However, it was frustrating even at the level. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, not enough people could eat, and when I kept it secret that how many people could eat, it was not enough. Also, there was a lack of diversity in the dinosaur community, when there was almost "enough" dinosaurs. And like many dinosaurs, Spike-Back-and-Hei-a-Club-on-Layer-Ososaurs, they've just created caios and did not do much considering how cool they are. <br /> <br /> Start Speaker) Then there were petrodactyls. The statistics I've read put their body weight around 15 pounds, when the movie shows them 300 hours. Worse, they do not eat anyone, even throw them on top of the stone. There is no end to the end of the film, it was only a sudden credit. (Last speaker) I have seen that the version has lost 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they teach PeterDactiles to keep their long insects stolen in your pocket and get your $ 7. Rent the Kansas Series; At least you will not be disappointed.
