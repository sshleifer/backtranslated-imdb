The movie makers neglected to connect the points - that is, the sequence of events and preferences led by Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden from Charlie Wilson and Soviet Mujahideen, and finally, in 9/11. Finally, the filmmakers ignore the story behind us - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? - But in Afghanistan the Islamic extremists have expressed their disappointment in terms of the failure of expressing this support, strengthened the hands of the West-West, and today we have found a mess that was a major contributor (9/11, the terrorist network, in Afghanistan) Long ground war etc.). Because these fatalities are not made, the film thinks the viewer is sympathetic to his friendship. Wilson (Hey, see his latest projects on the Internet) instead saw him as a person whose actions were in contrast to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.
