The terrible "comedy" that is a beautiful, crazy female (live titler) "ridiculous" destroys the lives of three (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dylan hired an injured person (Michael Douglas) to kill him. What is comedy In 2001, sometimes made the worst comedy (Silverman, Sugar and Spice Reservations, Freddy Got Fingers, Tomato etc.). It's the worst one. Not one, repeat, it's not a fun moment. The trick is stupid, candid, smutty or real ill. There is also a strong hatred for women in these trash - the only major female character (Tyler) is used as a continuous sexual object. Also, extreme, bloody violence is finally cast. The only focusable moment is that in Rebecca McNantar, psychological and psychological two approaches - both psychology came together. Dylan, Goodman and Reusser hit the best career of all time - this is the only way to go. And the poor Tyler! Is she doing intelligent, gutsy independent films for this? And Douglas ???? What did he do when he agreed? A perfect piece of shit - can be avoided at all costs !!!!!!!!!!
