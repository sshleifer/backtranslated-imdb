I'm sorry, everyone thinks that this movie may be a great thing, I'm afraid to disappoint you. <br /> <br /> The map wanted to set up, completely destroyed by some common plots. So simple, the film is not finally sent down. I asked myself, what was not this plot, but the main character (played Mickey Rour), but I saw that the character was inappropriate - he is a professional killer or some criminal ghost brothers. But both can not go together, because the child tries to guide him, takes him to dangerous situations where no professional killer himself does not keep himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a good actor actor, but he played his character a bit irrelevant. I was not convinced of his acting, like it was trying to find out some personality he could not find. And he did not have to, his little crazy behavior was quite unclear. The only acting was great, one was Diane Lane. If not her, I will give 1 star to this movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see some good acting films and some interesting plots in the conclusion. And I blew it completely with my high expectations.
