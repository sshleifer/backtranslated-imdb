This is a movie that you see with a group of people. You will have good time. It's really bad, the shows are bad but without the quality of the showers. <br /> <br /> contains the best mix of bad actors, bad directors and bad scripts here. Possible that everything that can make a recreational evening can be wrong, you have here. The first tag is "A bunch of thirteen ..." these people are as many as my grandmother "teens". <br /> <br /> The director has zero sense of emptiness or excitement. The 30-year-old "teenager" is standing around and the "monster" comes out and when most of the attacks and monsters appear, this is mostly happening throughout the film. There is no mystery about this or the building up to something or something. It was even more like when you were chasing the kids with kids and just as the things you were going to do. And when I use the word "monster," I'm very angry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No doubt this script has been closed within a few days, there is no rewrite, and I can imagine how bad and badly formatted it is. It looked at the page because it was definitely written by an amateur without any ammunition. This is another example of bad things about this day and age: someone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is the best thing to do. It's as bad as you can get. There is no such person in leadership role in acting and the leadership is the best. He distributes every line in this monotonic method without any expression and you should be surprised that no part of this film can be a part of this movie, he does not know. When her girlfriend was killed she had to "cry", it was one of the funniest scenes I ever seen in a movie. It is very interesting to hear some people in this horrible dialogue. But when the black man said, "Tell him ... tell him ... I love him ..." Before his death scene, there was a huge smile in our group. Funny, fun things <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We can do it, guys! <br /> <br /> PS. This "movie" comment from someone in Virginia was a surprise (this is only in this film and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I said it before and I will say again: those who work in the movie should not be allowed to comment.
