I have seen this "latest" version of Macbeth and amazed by the strong acting and obvious effort, which wanted to make a low-budget historical piece into a completely surveillance movie. <br /> <br /> One note, the music was very fussy, and added nothing to the intensity of the film and opposed to a full orchestral score seems like someone on the keyboard and a bunch of samples. I think Paul Farrer needs to get his job together !!!
