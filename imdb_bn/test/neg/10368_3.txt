So I decided to watch the full puppet master series, and saw only 1-3 parts, which I think was all nice. They had a unique kiss, and a particular intelligence that I really appreciate. About a year ago, I even saw puppet master vs. Demonic toys, which were certainly bad, but still have a horrible guilty pleasure and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie I knew that it was in trouble. Chizzie Power Rangers-style Egyptian crane, who saw the ripple-style doll of the puppies through the pyramidal glass, came out straight from the left ground! The addition of this franchise in this story is all stupid! Suddenly there are a lot of new and random letters and plots of crystallized cry from our new three films. Writing the puppet master's writing for the first time, the authors once saw the Egyptian power of the Ranger's arch, the totem monsters, the annoying chaos, who can not work seriously (and they seem to be the bright scientist but never say something intelligent), and a lame "Decapitron" The head of the doll who can morph into the head of the toll of the toll. <br /> <br /> Another thing that frustrated me in this film was to completely ignore what had happened at the end. Part II, since the third was a prequel). Suddenly, the dolls returned to Badega Bay in again, in their case (minus the blade) returned, and Toulon is willing to help her pups again for some reason. (He believes in Elsa part II for her love). All of this is not explained ... and so, and throwing all these junk, I was not even happier. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of funny b movies. If you need to connoisseur I also collect laser discs of rare B films that I can find in DVDs, and so it takes me so much that it is one of the most painful movies of my life. I still love those dolls, roles, blades, tunnels, pins, jessars and everyone else, and instead of trying to fix something, they are stuck only but good, the series may still be alive and good health. It is said that although the review is not so big, I am really interested in checking puppet master retro, a lot of tribute to the original themes sounds like an interesting appeal.
