This image is very bad. Kevin Speacy is really a great actor, he's brilliant in El Confidential, American Beauty, Euphial Suspects, 7 etc. But it's really garbage, she did not come near any suitable Irish accent, she probably practiced it with Kate Hodson. Doing about Adam. The film is ridiculous and worse for the Irish people, it is quite annoying for several scenes. I think the producers have targeted this movie that target audiences (non-Europe) never heard or heard of 'General' or Martin Cahill and were fascinating in an interesting and entertaining story. Total crud !!
