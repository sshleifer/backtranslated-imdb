This pop-up fiction is a spin off. I thought that something would be good for some decent laughs Well it turns out that this movie is really terrible. The whole plot does not follow the Pump Fiction Plot. It turns into another movie like Forrest Gump and many more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but everything went away from me 90 minutes away. If you are planning to rent this movie, please do not waste it 90 minutes of your life. Rent this rental and go and find a movie that actually makes a sense. If you have a Plump Fixation 2, please do not go and rent a sigell. Just give a head for those who are there.
