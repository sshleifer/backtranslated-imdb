Such as a BS movie. This is not just some stupid anti-Russian propaganda, completely including BS Plot, in any way related to the book. <br /> <br /> It looks like the production team has more money for the movie order, they can not sell the movie. The plot of the film is a reference to recent recent incidents of Russian and other parts of Eastern Europe, but kept them in such a way that there is nothing to do with their reality. It seems that the film is an intelligent instrument that helps portray Russia as a place which is always possessed by evil people, which always dreams to kill anyone. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are hundreds of stupid mistakes using the USSR map instead of Russia, such as the crowd showing Ukrainian flags and commenting on Russian elections. <br /> There are also many bizarre episodes (i.e. red square in Moscow and in second second he plays a character in Sofia city of the Bulgarian city).
