It is probably preferable to hate a film rather than what it is, but I hope a filmmaker will make a movie about the men and women of the village village. Instead, locally (and those outside the area) and a young gay man are really focused on the predominantly offensive revolt (big news!) Of murder / torture. <br /> <br /> Many times dedicated to fools about AIDS, sin, hell, and distorted. Many times the spirited preacher has been encouraged to get the bible and gay people to deserve what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people who came to the small town gay bar, or those who oppose it. Also, the young man who was killed was not even from this town. <br /> <br /> The whole movie acts as a warning instead of celebrating, and it is very susceptible.
