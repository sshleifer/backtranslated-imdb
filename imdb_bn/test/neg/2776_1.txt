Khalid's Muslim country (fictional), his benevolent leader / dictator, Reid Headley Amir, died of cancer. Amir dies and a great plot is exposed. His body is covered in aluminum foil and a secret operation (population does not know about his death), made from his country of doctors (Nigarian) and Mohammad, for the execution of a risky brain. The surgery was disrespected. Running by Kate Taylor, who believes that there is no chance of failure and he has two supporters. One of them was about 3 feet high (Master Blaster actually handled Barter Town) and the other named the cow 7ft giant. What could be wrong? <br /> <br /> Am I forget about the death of Amir, the blond-Barbie wife, to mention the tragedy? Or do the people of Dr. Kent's female enslavement test and there is confusion about the greatness of mahima? How does a brain replace that take? There are many double dealing in this and people have died, but I will not lie to you anymore: the mission agrees. Last means justify If you can accept it, you do not have to waste 80 minutes. I hope enough warning. I do not say I warn you. If you want to keep an eye out, do not be alone and there are plenty of medicines. <br /> <br /> - Cellulite rehabilitation
