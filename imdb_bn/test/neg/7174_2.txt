It's a terrible rebuilding of a very good movie called "Up in the Air" starring Frankie Darrow, Montmoreland and Margie Reynolds. I was able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are the same, I have no idea why they do the movie again. I do not completely agree with the previous post that hates the song (the same is the same), originally singing the first rate, I'm not sure that Margie Reynolds actually singing herself, but not saying that the voice is usually added later, and the song Very well, a "B" movie is wonderful. See if you have the chance to come to the DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
