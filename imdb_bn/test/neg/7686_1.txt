I only saw the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally I think it's the worst movie ever made in recent years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that the 10 year old child wrote it. The act was very drunk with most unknown cast and especially the first half of the film's action sequences were so horrible that it was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the producers have achieved this film's film is ready for the budget but the production company can now apologize for it. <br /> <br /> Anyone can come across this movie in the upcoming future, I advise you to clean up this comedy.
