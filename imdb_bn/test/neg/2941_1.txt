I watched this movie at Blockbuster and thought it would not do anything else when it could be a good Sunday evening movie. So I used it, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my legs were well spent on nails to run on my legs. <br /> <br /> The image started nicely. Kinda is dark and mysterious. I was always enthralled with vampires and samurai movies as a kid. I think the combo will be really cool. The first battle scene was quite calm. I was excited for the rest of the movie. Then the movie took a serious nose dive. <br /> <br /> I realized it was a big hit earlier. I guess pair pairs because of the reason. I do not see it though. In the first 10 minutes, this movie was absolutely awesome. In this genre, so many movies are likely to be superb and it appears to be fatal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no concept in the role of Jackie Chan in this film. Whyyyyyyy? Full silliness. He probably made a few bucks off it. <br /> <br /> This movie is the only one cool thing they use, the sword. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
