For us, who is part of the original world of Ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. Ian Kirov was originally an exercise dancer, a gymnasium. At the time, Vialea Aasen Ballet Theater, was now an American ballet theater and a good dancer, but acting without Dem Judith Anderson was amateur and Chechen was completely top ... so embarrassing! I watched this movie at the age of 14 and at that time, I never was seen in the ballet, I was very impressed. However, after the later life, after completing my own career as a dancer - I bought the video tape of it, which was curious to know what was going on after so many years. I can not believe how Hollywood can be a bit naive about the balloter world. But it was made in the middle of 40 seconds before the red juice or the turning point, the second took the real picture of the ballet world. The entire actor of the specter is dead ... Ivan Kiev (not his real name) died at the age of 79. It was his only film, then a Chicago businessman kept him. So rumors spread.
