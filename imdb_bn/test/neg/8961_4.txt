The residents of the unexpected city came down to Le Tocque for a weekend. The stories combine, fight the characters, make friends, cheat on each other, have sex ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It should be sunny rather tedious and irritating. All characters are unfortunate or unpleasant or both, and ultimately, despite some extraordinary nature, this viewer is taking a little care about what's happening between them. <br /> <br /> is always a wonderful credit Rampoling, plus bouquet and Viard but that's it. And Dutronc looks like he overdone nips and tucks, if you ask me ...
