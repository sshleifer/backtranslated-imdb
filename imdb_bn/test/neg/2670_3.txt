Avoid this one! This is a terrible movie. So if it is very exciting? It's all just point killing. And the whole thing with Thorn and Michael's curse was probably the worst thing in the series! Why did they leave a mystery to Michael's story? He supposed to be a Boogman, is not part of some stupid cult !! Esse! Thank God for Halloween H20, which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They sucked all! But anyway, if you see this movie, please expect more than worthless kill and gore.
