Take a bad script, cast some lazy and cast a story of politically incorrect morality and what do you get? Something which is supposed to pass for visiting the quality family. <br /> <br /> The seven American singles Oregon, who traveled throughout the United States in the 19th century, hopes for a new life. The title of this movie is therefore seven children (three boys, three girls and one child whose sex I'm not sure). <br /> <br /> This story is open with the usual normal life of 19th. Century life on a farm somewhere in the middle. The eldest son John is a steady teenager, 'Lazy and nothing good' as his father constantly reminds him. On the right side of the batting we see that while its interesting sisters are string with their hair, there is a busy time for their practical joke while connecting it to a nearby canal. When the mule is removed, the poor girls are pushed out of the bed. John is caught by his dad and is immediately punished with a whip. <br /> <br /> Pass through a wagon train on the same day. It is tempting to join Pa as a new life promise to the wild, wild west. So family up their accessories and head off. <br /> <br /> Very soon the film seems weak and amateur. Below the acting grade, as if from a movie shown to school about pioneers. I can not blame the actors because the lines of this picture are stupid and very tragic sweet and hopeful. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I grabbed this movie when the channels sold on an annoying Saturday afternoon. At a Christian television station. Not my own religious mind, I have seen terribly that seven people gave moral statements that were not old but cruel attacks! If I was a good Christian, I expected that I had a good idea to complain about the trash airing on the television station. However, because I was a satirical, strange humorous fellow believer, I loved to sit back and laugh myself silly. <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, the proposal of proposal to go to Oregon to his wife as the father's role was established in the strict governor of the house. Her reaction was a heated "on my dead body." We hope to laugh, I think the film gets in front of the scene and the mother laughs laughing, because she drives Wagon through love. Oh, I think even the most fatal feminist should admit that at this time the father's best attitude was ideal, and when the conditions of living were difficult, someone could argue for the necessity of such instant governance, but the way I think this film is still Supports the idea. Nice message coming from a Christian television station. However, things get worse for the family, and the moral integrity of the film is even lower. An Indian (or Native American) sleeps fast while he is sleeping in an area. Like an ordinary savage, Indian people take clothes and accessories. Fortunately, Pa Paarbari kit karasanera foot, capable of killing some of the criminals as well as Indians. Kit Carson told John that his father is a real hero. <br /> <br /> Wagon train resident with family. Dutch Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray) He shared Pan's feelings about John, saying he was a vain Brat. Probably so, but he is the best thing about this film. Aldo Roy's doctor Baboon, who feels unable to bind himself, let a girl treat her alone for a broken leg. Gratefully, the young child did not cry at the tears of weeping, because the Dutch Dutch was not beside the bed. We constantly know that belittling a child growing up. Here is a movie that promotes the behavior. <br /> <br /> After food poisoning or some other development, I did not pay much attention, and he died. His death bed is made of great acting in the scene of the scene. Frankly, the man was not sick. <br /> <br /> <br /> The children left bound for themselves. And when the real adventure begins. This is done by slogging through Rapid, facing more Indians (though they are beautiful) and filled with snowy terrain, these children do it. And I was thinking, "There is a bunch of garbage!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there is nothing empty about this image, Priyiar's small budget is a shameful waste of time and humiliation of 'family' everywhere. I am surprised that 19 In 75, at the end of the feminist movement, and when the treatment of Native Americans was coming to focus, something like that could actually be made.
