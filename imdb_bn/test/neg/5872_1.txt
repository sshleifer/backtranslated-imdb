Above all, this movie is critically endangered, and my advice is to avoid it if you ever want to eat ice cream. I tried to see it because it seems to be fun, but it soon became quite annoying with ice cream made from body parts and amazing graphic effects. With a boy named Greg, it appears in an awkward assassination of an ice cream (Greg later became crazy and grew up as a title character), which seems to be a mass killer. There is no explanation for this killings, it creates the largest WTF moment in the whole film. Another, in less WTF moment, goes to Greg's comfortable aggression (shows malicious shoes), a woman speaks a different language because she is bound by the Holy Spirit (what I do not know about this with him), and events Olivia "Holy Shit It has been a bad thing in the career "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no good reasons to look at these. The only reason is for the tuna character, who has a shredded skin under her shirt, so that she sees a fatty kid. For some reason this hit me as the sunny. I just wanted to wait this night for more than just showing this picture, because there was no reason to use the actual fat for this role. Although I was asleep before the end, I was gathered from another review that the tuna had ended "weight". OK, so they did not actually have the budget to pull this off. Suggestion to the director: How can the character be created ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> If there is not enough likelihood of tuna, there is no other reason for this film to be accepted. If you are the favorite source of entertainment for ice cream, then look for "The Staff" instead.
