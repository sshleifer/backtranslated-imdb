The plot of this film is dangerously thin and only "star power" if we can call it with Joe Estevesz. I do not know what's worse. This movie has been created, or some of its people actually made good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video, you will be able to read them. Someone even saying that the actress / writer can be the leading lady of the 90's. Yes! And Joe Estevez may have more meaning than his brother Martin. Anyway you want to check it out however I highly recommend watching it's MTS version. At least you'll laugh a lot without crazy.
