"Death machines" takes a fairly consistent firmness for an action movie (an unscrupulous martial art killing machine sent to eliminate criminals) and it turns into an unwanted world. I have rarely adjusted such small budgets, bad acting and releasing the so-called script as the so-called "movie". It's easily the worst martial art / action-based movie I've seen in years, even "Ninja Holocaust" (which was at least in the view of some good energetic battles). <br /> <br /> The original "star" of the movie is white, "Death machine", (it is basically its car), so she is specially featured in much more than her two seas. She is well-shaped, and she is not looking bad, but she is rarely as an actor - Chuck Norris thinks "octagon", without any energy or emotion only. It is certainly a deliberate choice in part of actors and directors. But you have to be Arnold to stop this kind of thing, and this guy is not Arnold. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> How did "gang war" end? Mushfiq Asian women decided to kill her junkie killers? And what happened happened to his assistant dead and his wielding a Katana like a bullock stick? However, it is a completely outgoing bar that finds time in search of war, in which a sailor (well, he looked like a pop) destroyed the bar because the juke box did not work. It is related only to the rest of the film because in this process he was also the character of the movie "Hero", a Bartender / cart student who was the first Chief Executive of "Death Machine" (he cut his hands and killed his teacher). It's the hero and his girlfriend I've ever seen the most non-so-called "love scene". Segue does not give any idea - at the end of the bar-war, he is impressive on his impressive long body, and the next thing is that he is in "masked" shadow and sex love montage, which seems to come from a hallmark card. BTW, we do not see the crew again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see the killings detective and the showdown between its captains - the director and the screenplay did not actually see a movie scene inside the police station, but heard their second word. And really decided to include something without knowing how they work. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook of poor castings and community theater-level actors fluttering without ruthless direction. Three "death machines" come across as clods; The "hero" knows his line but can not carry the film, his character is a vulnerable risk; His girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; And all other minor parts are barely guardable. It creates a fairly poor movie - but there is more to drag the "dragon lady" into the underwater Stinker region than anyone else or something else. She looks ridiculous; Her small, inexperienced face is assumed by her ton-hair tropical wig, she wears a furry dress like her red silk dress, and she talks with a terrible mash-face that shouted "time required with a conversation trainer" . The poor lady - she was probably the way from her material, and as far as I know, a film did not appear again. <br /> <br /> Add a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never stops and does not play anything worthwhile or interesting; Hump ​​film stock and lighting; The ruthlessly fighting the choreography of hunger; And above all, lack of illiteracy and blocking and stage business ... ... and you have a crippled film. <br /> <br /> I found it as part of a 50 DVD DVD set, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to see. It was not worth it. Feh!
