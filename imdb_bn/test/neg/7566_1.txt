There have been many movies of American Dream And it's one of them. <br /> <br /> First, in technical terms, there are many mistakes. The audio was bad, I had difficulty understanding the dialogue here and there, and the position of the camera might be good. <br /> <br /> They really try to come up with a good movie, but for example, where they show part, how Jonathan is losing his dream, working very badly with girls, drugs and alcohol. Acting is very difficult and also from all characters of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, what should I say? /> <br /> If you have low expectations and you will be annoyed with bad weather, see it. If you go for a deep story with action, this is not your movie. <br /> <br /> I usually could not score a score of 1, but 4.5 for But I do not mention bad cut scenes with cheesy effects, because it's 1 bad audio, and using the camera.
