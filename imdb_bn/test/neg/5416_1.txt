It was so bad, I want God to give me life for two more hours and sit through it. <br /> <br /> First, the role was uniformly bad. There was absolutely no plot, unless "a dog's story with a man in the rain of rain instead of a dog and a skeleton's mask instead of a dog". <br /> <br /> The edit was everywhere and gradually the shot of "Gore" (using the red-colored syrup-spoon through the air, unconsciously in the lungs) becomes tasteless after tenth time, and becomes mad after hundreds of times. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rumer. He did some good work. It was not good. It was less than good. And by that, I mean sucked it. Hard <br /> <br /> For God, do not watch this movie.
