January-a conversation about how Michael Vincent was pleased to have led me to insanely visit the DTV entry of the 90's. In the 1950s, he shot an ice cream and became a Psycho Ice Creamman (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and the ice cream ends up. Bla, Bla, Bla. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Appstein (career as Paul Norman) created such a career in pornography and later it went straight. What do you get for killing all those killings that come off the screen. And a skinny kid welding a fat kid and getting him a fat suit. Just throw a fat kid! Also, there is a scene where Vincent strongly responded to a group of fleeing Luner around him. He was completely drunk and was afraid of his life or the filmmakers had his "Did I really reduce this?" Shame full. Despite having a low budget trash, David Knott, Olivia Hassie, David Warner and People's Court have written a few well-known names, including Doug Llewelin. How can you make an annoying slasher with that slope?
