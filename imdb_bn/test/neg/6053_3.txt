I did not hear anything about this project until I saw that it was going to be launched, so I saw it completely open mind. And, G, Cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . It's boring I do not mean it's good; I mean it's pretty bad - sometimes ridiculous, but mostly it's annoying. Its strong appeal comes from attractive people interested in attracting US network TVs, but it is not all lively and no material, and some bad bad TVs are not justified as backup characters. <br /> <br /> There are basic problems that Cast two can not overcome. First, the script * horror *. Yes, the change in Hercules's legendary storyline (which is certainly not a single single story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is uninterruptedly lazy and often with frequent mobile phones (and sometimes humble head gradually weird), with terrible pacing, bits taken here and there (And in many parts seemingly involved in various movies), and really horror dialogue. The dialogue is often helplessly bad, in fact, where you feel embarrassed for the actors. Apparently now type cast as second ban, Shane Astin, understood by another horrible line after another. There is no consistency in the tone or atmosphere, and there is little consensus on the plot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. Sometimes CGI is a decent bit, but mostly, again, you feel really embarrassed in favor of Cast. I have no idea what the budget was for this project, but it seems to be shaky than the "collision of Titans" or even "Hercules: Legendary journey" and does not compare very well with the old Lou Firino and Italians. 'Spaghetti' Hercules Cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Most people who do not have European accents try any type of fraud that is not only amateur and dated, but firstly these are not really understood: Actors are not better with the use of British accents. Everything. But terrible scripts and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing from the bat. <br /> <br /> Justified, "Hercules" was apparently called a four-hour minisier, but for this wind a three-hour TV movie I do not know what they are cutting, but edits make it worse. I do not think you can add "Harculus" by adding it, but that does not mean that the continuity is not damaged by network editing. There is no way but I want to see the US version, though.
