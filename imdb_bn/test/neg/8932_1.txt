I just wish to give it a lower grade of f! I did it 1 in the vote. I'm not categorizing it as a regular movie, but as a T & A film, and this is the worst, lamest, fierce and the most horrific film I've seen. Acting, story, and music are all terrible, not to mention that there is no nudity for T & A connisuer.it about a male cheerleader, and cheers of the audience are sitting through his many painful scenery. This bad 80's teen movie is the worst.
