This is one of the worst movies ever made - and I do not think it's too bad- it's a good idea. Eddie Murphy is an extraordinary humorous film, and how bad it is that the film almost killed his career. Writing and directionally disabled, set and staging as fantastic as the Brady Runner episode, and acting shows how bad a great cast can be if it does not have anything to do with them. If it is not for clothing - which is considered for the main part of the budget apart from the arrogance of Eddie Morphy - you will swear that this thing was gathered together by a group of high school teachers who were destroyed at Papermant Sánpapas together. Mind-boggling anyone could find any fun or entertaining way to find this fun. Perhaps this is the accidental spirit who is praised this stinker, rarely is not literate. But if your idea of ​​the Hillary shot Daley Reese with her "pink ankle shot", then above all, remove your drill cup and rent this movie.
