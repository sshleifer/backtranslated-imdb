"Problems children" was a good movie, but is it really a sequel qualification? I do not think so. The only release of the original film was Gilbert Gottfried, and he was not even good in this signature. <br /> <br /> I can not keep my finger true because this picture is bad. At the beginning, it was not funny. Even when I saw it as 9-year-old, I'm still not sympathetic to junior (Michael Oliver). His character came to me like, sticky, self-repugnant, and perhaps most important, rebel without a point. He appeared in the hatred of every woman that her father Ben (John Ritter) dates for the sole request of their hatred. This does not send a good message to anonymous parents (who give birth to half of the United States children on this day) when a woman decides to marry Ben (almost), a south elite who is deceptive and who hates <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it looks like the original SNL cast partner Lorraine Newman returns to the big screen, to save the movie. Areni. I was also curious to see that he was white white dubatant, whose name was Landa. More words like that African American woman's name <br /> <br /> I think the movie does not work, because you thought that the mushriks wanted to hate you, as well as hate those dramas you were not supposed to. John Rotor's character was supposed to be a good parent, who, in conformity with the obedient parent, tried to misread his child in a wrong way. Instead, he was not only like an intelligent parent but also a person who was frustrated to find a wife during the day, despite how well he knew the woman. Did I send a bad message to the parents of this divorced parent? <br /> <br /> In short, the mistakes that happened with this movie were among the others, Amy Yaseeb was unnecessary and unclear back to a completely different character, that the young woman was even more obscene than junior, the toilet was completely stunted for humor and even more More outrageous and old homophobic humor (dog craters were involved). The movie was just a mess, and if it is not already given it is not eligible for a DVD release. It will just rotate in VHS with all other bad, forgotten 90's comedy.
