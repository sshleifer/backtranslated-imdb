Diane Keaton is a kind actress. She is so annoying and dirty She is the same on the screen and off. I saw him in his interview with Allen DeGeneer and they acted similarly as they are in the movies. His stupid face expressions want me to change the channel. She has had several good movies, but they will be better off for someone else's pick for the part. Steve Martin added a lot to the movie. She works well and is an old favorite ruins. The ridiculous part of Martin Short Dances just adds more stupidity to the film. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both of them had to stop.
