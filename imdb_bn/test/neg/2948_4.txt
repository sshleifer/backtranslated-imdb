The movie Riv (Icon) and his assistant war starts with the same vampire. This scene is probably the best out of the whole movie. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is Chess, very unrealistic and a left vampire Slayer Ripoff. Finally, great time is wasted. <br /> <br /> Some moments such as the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular twin band Twin: Charlene and Jillian) are especially active in fighting a staffed teddy bear. The story too long, they can certainly bring something far more dangerous than a book called "The Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wang made the movie portable with their ridiculous role. However, good bits just last. Charlene and Jillian (from Twin) were never able to do good work, and you had to break into pieces and the role of "friendly but crafty vampire" unfortunately, was given to Edison Chan, a talented beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 4/10 -
