I am Sandra Bullock - one of my favorite actors, but it is a movie that should be paid beforehand for trash-canad. I understand that this is about 20 years old - but my dead grandmother can do better than these people. Be careful - it's not worth the $ 5.50 Walmart rack ... you know when it gets worse that it's not worth the value of some-sound quality terrible-terrible conversations, even no closed captioning to hear, and looks like it's $ 1.98 budget Was done. I thought Sandra was her first role to see how she was promoted as an actress-but she is very kind to using YIKES ...
