It was such a terrible movie, almost a comedy sketch of a comedy sketch. The budget was lower than a blockbuster, but it is still more than most. But this is where they decided to spend the full cost. Some actors are capable of at least, others feel like they have gone down the street. One of them is the main actor, so it is very bad that when I say something, he cringed (he speaks through the whole film). Then there are strange costume choices, in the beginning of the film, wearing all the characters 1930's clothes. They run a classic car, but the background is the modern day windmill, which is the state's gradual state status. And clothing and some settings are following the theme of this 30's film Nir. Then BAM runs a new assemble with the 24-inch Rims .... WTF Again, the same thing when a person has a chance for his rifle night, you close his eyesight. She is an MP 5 and strategic gear. The contrast position in an even unfamiliar is bright, and the H costs more than the rest of the whole movie. Camera shots / corners are very good, and the scenes show these places wildly. The manager has a keen eye for a well-shot single shot, but there is no idea how to do more. <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who should be shot for this photo ▼ <br /> <br /> Writer Director Casting Designer Clothing Clothing Designer <br /> <br /> Voices of the moon board should be tortured Death for monotonous nails ▼ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is not escaped.
