I try to like this movie I love Kevin Spacy and I knew Brad was another person from his role as "Big Brain On" in Paul Fiction. But I just do not care about letters. Kevin Spacy finds a prix through the whole movie and even finds some awesome things with him, I do not like him. Especially the end --- which hated me more. It was like watching a bad car debris. Spacey played a thorn well (he's all well), but other than him, I do not recommend it.
