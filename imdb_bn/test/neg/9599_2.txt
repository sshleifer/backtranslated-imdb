All right, I'm not saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The mission was a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. Computer does not tell you at every step of your mission, you can fold and explore. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing that is wrong with RL, what you do is scheduled and controlled by another time. I mean, do not you as a leader, how can you manage each mission? <br /> <br /> And speaking about the mission, why do they intersect the original triangle with complete reproach? Do not remember <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for this game when I hear that they will allow you to fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strike Back. I think a fan of this movie wanted to do this work. So, they give it to you. It's the stupid level of the game. You start flying in a consistent way with your pursuit of asteroids, and your whole-hearted relationship progresses further in the field while shooting. You must kill all of them to get ahead Hey, remember how much was on the field? None, they had poor piloting skills compared to all of them. I'd like to be able to get the asteroides coming to me, but instead I want to kill my self-target guns. <br /> <br /> It was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flying, everything is lazy. All except the A-Wing, probably the fastest fastest and most transferable ships. But, oh yes, is not Falcon Han? However ... <br /> <br /> You finally go to Ander War. Here's the final level, you get to destroy the star of death, the first instinct of everyone is to pick Falcon and be the leader. But, of course, you have reached there and want to find stereo predefined strategies like finding tie-bombers. Falcon is impossible, when you see a group, the flamematic is destroyed. The only way to pass this part is to pick A-Wing. After this you will have to destroy the star destroyer and that's a real stupid hole. This game assumes that you are the only one on behalf of the rebel alliance. You <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And here, you might think 'Yes! I'm going to destroy the star of death, again again, like the asteroid field, you will have to do some annoying things when narrowly crossing the tunnels of the upcoming ruins. Your goal is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the return of Jadir? This is very tragic because if you choose Falcon, you will die because you are not quite usable, but if you choose X-Wing, you have to lock and unlock your swells. So trying to kill bad kids or catch Londo, who does not know how to interferely. That's how this process is going on. <br /> <br /> At the bonus stage, it is not noticed that the level of each level is more frustrating. I was frustrated by the new three films, there was some frustration. Lucky for me, Smash Bros Melie is available. <br /> <br /> I hope they will bring something better with Yai and complete trilogy levels will be in full capacity. The first opportunity I'm going to sell this game is
