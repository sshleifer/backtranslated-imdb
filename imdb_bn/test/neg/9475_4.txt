Well, first off, twins are exactly the same. There is no other Gary (taller than Ashley Marie-Katte) and their lovers are not even French, they are bad because they wake up. Lamo Not too bad, not the best of them. I'm a big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, do not get me wrong. Storyline is OK and it's fun to see. This is not a movie that you get up again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were completely new to making their own films. Girls work like 13 years old but if you're a young visitor, it's a good movie. If you are not above 13 years old then do not watch a movie with your kids. Then it's okay. Best wishes MK + with your future movie!
