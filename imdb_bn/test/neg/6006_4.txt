This film was really poor. I went to some exciting hopes in the theater, and instead my "Next Plot Wrap" was given an opportunity to guess before. Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick cryon so that everyone can see. Nothing was really casual. In fact, even Gore's full suspense was met that it really added a lot. <br /> <br /> Additional intelligent cracking and talking to the shop in criminal scenes seems to be more dirty And where Lambert's character is struggling with the signal and its "investigator epiphany" reaches, the scene goes a long way in indicating the expected intelligence level from the audience. The most annoying aspect was the cinematography "X file" treatment: every building in the film, whether it was a predetermined building, or afternoon or a hospital, or a hospital, was in a visible light (without mentioning the lack of patients). ) In the hospital). I do not remember a single scene when someone flipped over a light switch. It was definitely beautiful. <br /> <br /> m Lambert is not really an Oscar-grade actor, so I think what this movie is worth to you. In the end, I've come to the conclusion that the only thing that made this movie more entertaining is to see it after watching "Warriors". Otherwise, you are an effort that is neutral and unreasonable, and there is nowhere near the equivalent film of "Lambs silence".
