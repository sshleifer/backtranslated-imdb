Perhaps Wayne's poorest film; At least the poorest, in which he had an acting role. It's just incredibly bad. Editing is particularly awful; It has really been revealed that the editor (if there were) literally stitched the pieces of film from the floor and stuck together. You will be seen to believe in opening. John Wayne has mentioned every time cringed! I know there are "B" movies - but there are "H" movies? If so, this is one example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan.
