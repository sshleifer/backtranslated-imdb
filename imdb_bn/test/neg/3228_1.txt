This is beyond stupid. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to the Nantucket for summer and find the situation in a completely insurmountable situation. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore co-star in this movie. The picture was in 1986, was the timber of Ashton Kutcher only? <br /> <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather died and his house was sold to the ruthless man and father and son. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. One of the highlights of stupidity is that one person says to another: "Have you ever noticed that people die when they die in alphabetical order?" <br /> <br /> I left my case.
