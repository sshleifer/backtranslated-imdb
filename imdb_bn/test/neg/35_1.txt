In India, which has compared Manitatnam, often compared to the prominent world filmmakers and known for being a genius in filmmaking, it has proved that he can see only the frames visual good, without providing enough food for thought. Free cinematic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> And some educated film singer can detect that his films do not have innovative impressive plots, there is no lasting effect, and mostly ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, which can be seen in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Overall, Maniratnam has confirmed my insufficiency for his film again. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who claim otherwise on this board. My suggestion: see some beautiful cinemas made around the globe.
