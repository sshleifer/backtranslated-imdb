Randy Bay Owers (John Wayne) came to the Half Way House to break the right path at the right time, and discovered a corpse of the corpse, one of them was about to send a message - Ed Rogers, owned by the agency. She was hidden behind the secret room hidden by the niece Sally (Alberta Von), where she was neglected during the murder. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Allon" was directed by Harry Fraser. He used a filming technique like his other movies here, where he quickly took the lead from one horse to another. It seems to be quite innovative in the 1930s Lone Star Westerns and it seems quite innovative. <br /> <br /> The Pre-Gabby is with George Hays, Sans Whistle, and for the first time I saw him as a villain. In fact, it took a double role to understand it was a dual role, as the huntbacked businessman "Matt the Mutate", communicated through pencil and paper, became a gang leader with only counter attacks with Marvin Black. Black gang was responsible for the murder of Huff Way House in an effort to strengthen Sally to sell Matt / Marvin. Another major player is here, Yakima Cantt as Spike's Black Henchman. Interestingly, Yakima illustrates another fraser / Wayne Oter's "Sir Black" villain, "Arizona Skice Nath". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, maneuvers as John Wain's character expose bad guys. In the end, he saved Selby Rogers's $ 30,000 to destroy the Half Way House, and saved the day, where he safely exchanged some dynamite rods for the loot. Greedy Marvin Black tried to open it with his six shooters, and the explosion was a perfect ending for villains. In his best "Aw Shucks" attitude, John Wayne spontaneously falls under the spell of Sally Rogers, and lazy, Randy rides alone!
