Not saying much. This Killjoy film has good cinematography and is looking more professional than the end. This does not mean that it is more professional word That horror film was a gangsters' killing a child and then scared by Voodoo Clown. I thought that the last guy played a seductive bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is the worst bad actor I've ever seen in any movie, and I've seen many movies. The last film came in the last 15 minutes, it was not quite short and the clown did not come in 40 minutes and it was only 65 minutes long !!! I give it a 2 because there are just some characters played from.
