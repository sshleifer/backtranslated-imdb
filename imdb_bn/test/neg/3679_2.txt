During Madrid, I was able to see the script's copy of this picture. How nice! Gallo It's amazing. He gives extremely unusual performance. In addition to Galois's talent, the film is never seen in my life, and it has made a very laughable outline. I'm also a wall-killer fan, so he has been the reason for such a great effort to watch this movie. Problem Val is really a scene. As the lead is his name in cast as my intelligence and the rest of the cast contempt. I only saw the director stardom in other movies. Both films are very low at the bottom but both of them have very vincent galo performance. If you are like a gay fan, I would see regardless of how bad this movie is. If you do not like Gallo then Zero has left the love.
