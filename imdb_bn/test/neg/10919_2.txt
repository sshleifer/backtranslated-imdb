I write it 10 minutes before the end of the film. I feel comfortable now, because unfortunately I know how this movie will end. <br /> <br /> Enough to enter a small town, wild dogs kill people. Great - Simple Plot For A Good Fun Camp 80s Awful <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that it really should not be adapted to the film, at least with the same plot Not. Why? Cause its annoying! The first 45 minutes tried to build the depth and depth of its main character. But it is too long (the film is half!) - unlike the letters and we never care for them, and it only creates zero mysteries. The simplest film (by plot and time) to compare it with the classic jaw. Everything that is done by the mouse, Cujo is wrong. The jaw made a real feeling of good character and fear. Do not cujo The jaw effectively creates a scary, ghostly villain in his shark. Cujo is going to become a dirty St. Bernard and running about jumping, and not much more. The jaw is breathtaking and unpredictable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> This image was rewritten for the big screen and it was a good director it could be good. But it was not. It was 90 minutes of my life wasted <br /> <br /> People here say this is one of the best King adaptations - I'm sorry that you can not be more wrong. The brain is one hundred times better, thinner 10 times better and even worse with cats twice! I think it's the worst! The only good thing is that the action scenes with the dog were real, although they were neutral. <br /> <br /> Movies are now over, and it does not get better. To avoid.
