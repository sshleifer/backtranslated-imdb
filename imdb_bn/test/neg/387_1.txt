This is probably at the bottom of the worst movie, which really took itself seriously. And not because of acting, because of being an actor, I have been told that Rickman and Stove will have to stay at their best, only after the original photography has to be wrapped, electro convulsive therapy needs to be escaped. In fact, as one of the 57 people released on the theater, I would say that I have never experienced a movie or a movie before the end of the movie, the credits are rolling, the house is running, and no one has left the seat. About five minutes after going to the house, people started coming out of their waist and I think many of us are thinking, OK, we got it, it was a joke, right? They will now see the real movie. Finally, after the users handed out the camouflage, we swore a secret oath that we were not there, we felt it was safe to leave, pray that we would not leave the auditorium. I have seen some bad films of my day (I have a cinematic love), but I am still bitter that I will never be able to recover my life within two or an hour, which I have lost over the closet land.
