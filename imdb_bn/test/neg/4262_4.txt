Amitabh and Zia Khan raised great prospects through their press conferences, though it was easy for critics, and fans, after all, this propagated Ram Gopal Varma Factory product is flowing in the face of all possibilities! Why, because Zia is so young and child, and children, criminals mixed, and uncertain. They did not know themselves, what they are saying, presses, tag lines, some love stories are not understood, or some such garbage! Why Title Title? Ramu must refresh the knowledge of Sanskrit, because Bidhu Vindo will study Mahabharata, tagging on line, another glorious flow of the year, Eklavya! Compared with the sweet heart, and the inevitability of Lolit, the so-called plot lines are supposed to be inspired by them. But sadly, Ramu is deeply deep in the heart of the elderly, and is making a serious effort to young people. The final index of cruelty is lolly pop sucking? And on the contrary, in childhood, on the feet of childhood, in childhood, the child gets shocked by the shocking smile after the ward in that role? This girl really wants to see her seductive game, poor victory, she loves her. Legs, that are very skinny enough, and putting that toe to the feet, works right down to the ominous pornography. It is beyond the understanding of anybody, how can a girl, coming in as a guest in some body home, so much Brazil, brash, and power? And why the stupid wife that played by Revithi, remarkably well, though vaguely scripted, and unreasonably characteristic, encourages her to dance with a young girl telling sexually her husband? The part of the winner, trying to achieve some refreshments in his nature's life, is very bullish. Because, apparently it seems that he is a happy, healthy living and a hobby of the resurrection. It blames Rio, big father and his young love, reminds him that Michael performed well on the Kine. Bacon looks extremely intimidated, and above all, where Kevin Spacy and Jeremy Irons seem to be unfortunate and handsome, so young children are attracted to older men compared to the weakness of the young age boys. Their age The only good thing about this movie is that green, wide land scapes, winding roads, and pleasant cinematography. No wonder, such a passion, drama, even curiosity, an amazing show of flashing sex, this shallow movie is not a surprise, it is flat on its face and wounds from the screen in the first week! Next time in the round, before copying any such theme from Hollywood, Ramu will have to do his homework, and Bachchan has to think twice! You can not fool all the time, Mr. Bachchan!
