Michael Caine has tried to make life bigger than a successful degree but there is nothing desired or interesting where the whole storyline and the characters around it. It was all very annoying and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, my favorite actor was no role. She was in vain. After a while Michael Kaye became somewhat boring and could not determine whether the film was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tried hard and well on her but I felt given direction and storyline given down to him. Do not waste your time. It starts well for the first 10 minutes and then it's about it. Die Hard Caine Fans is just a movie. Stay away from this one ...
