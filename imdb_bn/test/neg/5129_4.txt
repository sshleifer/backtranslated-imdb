Speaker, be careful! Flashdance, in my opinion, a fair movie. Some things confuse me in this (for example, Janny asks Alex, why is it so good to dance? Alex answers "about 25 years", does Alex think of 18 years?) And fascinated me with some things (I love spins!). Overall, though, it energized me. This movie is made, I was not even born. I really did not have experience of eighty (I was born in 85) and I would be surprised: sometimes Alex will take place somewhat, or dance himself, not really dance, just banging in things, tossing him head behind, and waving his arms - This is considered to be "dancing" back then? If it was, I'm sure I could not stand it. Spinse, flip, fluid movement was great, but some of it - my neighbor's child could do a good job! Also, if Alex is a cast on the day, will he not be tired after a hard day's work? When he does not go to work for nearly a week, will he not be released? Living in a warehouse - I can see it around, but not quite. It does not seem that he owns a welder, has his warehouse house, and is trying to go to the ballet. Nobody really makes sense of it. I do not have to be very judges considering my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Bells is very feminine to see me as a welder, I do not know. But in any other way, they could pick a good actress. The actor was fine. I even loved romance. You make your own decision. But the mine once rents and does not show it-it is not worth it.
