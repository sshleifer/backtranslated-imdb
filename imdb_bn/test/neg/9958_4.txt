Thankfully, you do not need to "learn a book" to understand where this thing is going ... obviously, a big hit in the world of poverty alike is Walif Man (which was created just a year ago), it always finds its other patent "crazy Doctor "role is seen as bright, vengeful psychological scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Louisiana Air, which I think is setting up a deep shop in its backyard, is planning a vengeance against Cameron, his former colleagues who insulted both and forced him to step down from his previous job. You see, wolfman creates an unstoppable army that they could come easily during the war, scoffed at his claim of being able to mix people with animals. Thankfully, Cameron found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections - a hawking, half-intelligence petro (Glen Strange) like a baby. The Petro was very surprised with what was happening, did not ask a lot of questions, and Doc dropped him under the table and shot him with what happened in his syringes. This is the result of time-deviation changes in people turning into a verb. Cameron drove him out of the palace using a secret passage, so you actually got a big guy (weird 6'5 ") that was equipped with a net made of a beard, hairy foot and a large set of plastic teeth. Seeing an eyewitness, the animal and the little girl died, the locals caught their rifles, and they were hunting for it. Organizes animals, Dr. Cameron, who can control the animal with whip and an easy way to reverse the impact, takes Petro to the big city and tries to stop the professor who makes a drug addict, and destroys his fame in this process. Cameron's girl hanging around the room, Lenoara (Ani Nagel), as well as a lover of Lonora's reporter Remy Tom (Johnny Dawns), whose first trend is to straight-track the prehistoric creatures! (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Many ways, overwhelming set, cinematography and Mike Ake-ups, as well as throwing a fairly bland support, it is watchable thanks to star George Zucco's histrionics. I have no formula why the downs got top billing; She shows half an hour and does not really have much to do with her, and she's doing all that impressive. It's all over Joker's show, and he is very loudly aloud, talking to himself while talking to his colleagues ("I'm not interested in your illusory speeches!") And temporarily moving the sanitie and moving out. From its performance as the unexpected WOLF MAN, its performance seems to be strange as his turn as Lenny across Lon Chaney Jr., from his turn, almost strange and gradually semi-pumped country pumpkin across Lane Chaney Jr. In no case, kinky and Zucco do a fairly good job playing off each other. My favorite part is that when Junker called her "Guinea Pig" in front of a colleague, when Petro just sat in hell and wandered very well. Fog swamp scene is some beautiful atmospheres.
