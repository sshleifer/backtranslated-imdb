I did not see this show that when I was young And I think I only saw 1 episode which I believe was about railroads because I liked the train and still do it. Even then I had a baby show on it. I've seen most Arthur. The song is very weird. And I think it is not that educational. They just sung some foolless nursery rhymes This is a stupid show, any adult is crazy! If you want to see some good children's shows then see something like Arthur, Mr. Rogers, or better P-Verlay Playhouse. The sesame street was annoying when I was small but even better than Barney. Believe me, this show is pretty much on the phone, other kids' shoogues are such a good one. I can see many reviews here that many people do not like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they will close this show soon.
