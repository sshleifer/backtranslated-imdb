In my constant search to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I put it on this little gem. It is pleasing through and through, especially if you do not know (as we do) that it is a semi-serial in another horror series <br /> <br /> Everybody complains about all the terrible blizzards that I do not bother to go into the plot (it was equivalent to the character "forwarding!" in the camera and their arm blurred), and in some odd storms of fate, the snow storm Ever happen. Budget problem, I'm guessing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shower with plenty of soap. I will accept it; I had trouble breathing at the point. <br /> <br /> The only real part of this movie, as it is seen, is that the real Slumberan Party genocide film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, driving a friend in a train or something is probably blurring and increased by the incredible use of stock footage. Arising out of perhaps the most fun psychoactive killer sources. I am happy that Slashar's friends have forgotten this fact until a flashback is required. Play <br /> <br />, do not walk, take it off and look at the sunshine. Of course, the continuity editor should be given a reward for all this, if not only trapped in that terrible snow storm.
