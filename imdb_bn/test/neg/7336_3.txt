First, let me mention the fact that despite its title («story», plural), there is only one turtle story. Not at the death of the ice or from the end, I am not sure that in one of the last scenes, his pips are seen lying on the table beside two cups. On DVD cover, TT has a reference. It claims that this movie relies on the attitude of Mim and silent death mainly to achieve its humorous effects and to give critical critique of her, the great Jacks Tate, «Trace Drill: Raphaeli!» («Very Fun: It's Tribute!»). Its 1950's French «modern» society. Of course «kitchen» is held in the 1950's and it offers bipartisan references some of the bureaucratic disobedience (rather vague) and some long moments are not called any words - but they are not really funny. What is all this short story is enough to make a «instant» movie in the kitchen »? It is being said that «kitchen» sometimes conflicts with false false of scientific research in contrast to the «truth». Human psychological emotions Generally speaking, the film gradually slowly and slowly gradually, slowly or slowly, gradually, slowly or steadily, hours or so. Actually, the last segment was - the last !!! - Attractive and moving. It may seem that it was a brief subject, less than an hour, unexpectedly expanded in 90 minutes. Now, set-up (a «scientific» observation about their kitchen singles behavior): Firstly it was very committed - to determine what would be most useful to come up with a new invention with coming out of their kitchen bachelors and charting out as a way. But this approach is very quick, only a principle, an «excuse» that introduces the real thing that has been fully developed in the end and which was an invaluable bond of loneliness and friendship. Grace! I honestly wanted to like that movie. Yes, my amazing little «narrations» - which was actually there and was so optimistic to hear something I had enjoyed - such as a nose hair burning (rather than using a cut cutter) to «invest» a lot «valuable» Black pepper stacked in a barn, contrary to the role (being observant of observation), a ready emitting face of a man Sounds from the program. And a sick horse is becoming half-hearted catastrophic catalyst, the relative importance of running right or left cars in Sweden and Norway (referring to the importance of ensuring its uniqueness to these distinct neighboring countries?). Am I the only person who did not fully enjoy this movie? Does this mean I'm wrong? Perhaps it was almost generally admired «subtle points», actually, for me was «very fine»? Perhaps ... My personal view of this movie can be diversely reflected in the film's significance - which could be the right to separate, to ensure its uniqueness, and to not follow the trend and societies in the dark? Each of us has the right to have separate personal opinion and to be the slave of the claim of the winner of the «dictator» claim: often we have other options that allow us to use each one of us while respecting the internal policy of the society. In short, it seems to me to be true - when the folks prefer to stay in his new friend Isak's house and help him with his farm work, leaving his job ends Fole (Ishq's «scientific observer»). ... and so, «Viv la différence», as French say!
