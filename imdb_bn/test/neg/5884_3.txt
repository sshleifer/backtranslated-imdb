The title is a mistake: The film depicts one year of so-called so-called "Divine Marquez". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened with guillotine: the calm joy of the state of terror Historically speaking, the background is rather sketchy: "Betrayed El It's Ray Max", failing to make a secular religion of Robespierrea, its downfall, a hell-bidding opportunity to show the ghastly machine of Doctor Gilton at workplace (full speed ). <br /> <br /> As long as Said is concerned, it is a neutral medieval matter: he is waiting with the other seniors in the former Nunuri, when compared to the gold cage, you compare it with, for example, the fate of Mary-antinet or scientist Lavoisier, and She exchanged ruthless conversations with a young virgin about death, love and other quarters. There are compulsory "brave" scenes but you have to be patient because it comes to the screen a long time ago. And anyway, in today's standard, can we call that amount? Saif Enfield's "D Sad", which enjoys one of IMDB's lowest ratings, was at least entertaining and more believable Marquis than Keirie Dulia's adult autovele. And it shows John Houston.
