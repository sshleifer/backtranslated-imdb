I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but if it does not have any purpose, improve yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> About Turkish in Germany. This is a very easy job, but if you are in Germany, like an intimate redneck (= the same as a Southern Hierarchy from a village, where virginity is often lost to farm animals), you will definitely fail in it and in life. I've heard and watched a lot of fun stories about minorities in Germany, but this "film" (this list is listed here, this is the shame of the next worst movie). The makers of this movie have met some years ago.
