This film was not well at all. I was able to catch it in a movie festival and did not appreciate the content that was forced to watch. After the death of the family (Gabriel Union) after the family died, a good shot about family death for re-connection. Filmmaker Billy de Williams, like Gabriel Union Brother Well, in fact, the Gabriel Union depicted a woman in her early years, which helped explain the girl as Billy de Williams's elder sister. Billy D. William's career was the worst performance of all time. She did not remember her line in a few scenes as she looked. She was an unlikely, rarely ever sympathetic character, who gave birth to a daughter when she married a white girl, who had already had a daughter with him. The two girls have grown up now and when they were with the girl (Lucy), she was trying to contact her, her other daughter did not want to do anything to her. Billy Dyer's character was so unfortunate that the only way he could fly to Paris for his funeral was to tell him that the funeral was over and his late sister had given him the responsibility to manage his papers. Why was he fooled? Because he does not like to attend the funeral. I know. You are asking, "But does not he want to join his sister's funeral?" Yes! He claims that he does not like to stay around the feeling of shared feeling among people dedicated to their respect. She does not want to do anything like that. Now we're guessing that a ** empathize with the hole? The rest of the film's performance was flat with flat characters. Director and editor could not consider pansing the film. Watch the flashbacks were painful. It was a bad film. However, it seems to be favorite in black film festivals; A movie that glorifies the dependence of African-American American Americans, so that they find love, even if it is a healthy relationship. When these lame stories are good at black film festivals, it makes questions about the trial of black film festivals. In these same festivals, the only film that won the prize was African American Culture and Educational Films of Black Films directed by Caucasian Managers. I'm not saying there is something wrong with white people to handle written stories for people of color. The problems of these movies are that they never interfere with both views, which generally movies actually speak to the public. These films are often the unilateral form of dialectics. These movies have failed to enforce the power of both sides that the film is revolving around. The authors and directors do not compose scenes and sequences that strengthen your final statement with the truth and power, as well as dispute with the power. These films always slant the argument What I'm saying is that these black film festivals are going on for people who judge a movie of pure content, which is my instruction, acting, cinematography, editing etc., or are they judging movies to reach the message of African American culture? Can we expect a film such as a movie as a constellation around "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sidways" movies? Is the movie being entertaining? When I mean entertainment, then I sit in the dark and look at the screen, will satisfy huge density and energy investment, meaningful emotional experience. Why can not these festivals praise movies that are not promoting their promoted messages? Why is this black film festival not able to accept such pictures which are well-known works that are brutally honest, telling the truth? "I believe there is no obligation to cure our social illnesses or to renew our belief in humanity, to the spirits of society, or even to express our inner publicity. We have the sole responsibility to tell the truth." - Robert McQueen Now that I totally agree. These same black film festivals have been named as "Hostels and Flowers" as if it were a horror movie stereotyping black. However, it is a honest film about a pim with a dream. Can not make a shrimp dream? I think the last time I saw that he was really a man. And they, pumps and prostitution are not just black communities in our society, but in the whole society? The "Black Hollywood" forces that believe that such films are Afro-Americans looking bad on others, as others do not know that there are pumps in the hood. True, as long as the African Americans of the film can accept the truth about themselves and do not dare to share it with the world, then there will be no scope for the world in our films. This picture was awful. The best thing was cinematography and Joe.
