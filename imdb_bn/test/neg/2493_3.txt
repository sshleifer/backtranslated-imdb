While I was sick, I saw on television this year ago (I do not know, I'm more satisfied with watching my TV while I'm ill), I'm guessing much more effort to use remote control. <Br /> <br /> From the movie I can think of - casting, acting, writing, direction, etc. - It was a good advice on every aspect. If this movie understood what was to work on Trinity, then I could have forgotten the historical error; But it's not. The scientist was trying to humanize, but they were inadequate and never crossed the curiosity. <br /> <br /> I did not know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project, but the film's screenplay was so cartoon that I was curious about the real personality. And I did. So I think this horror movie did very well. <br /> <br /> This is not a deep review, but FMBB is not worthy and it is not needed. You could enjoy it if you are a fan of bad movies
