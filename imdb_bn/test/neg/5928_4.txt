Sometimes I think the "Life Time" channel has a room somewhere in the office complex where the author hangs out, with a big wheel on the wall - the big six in the casino. There are many spots in the future where you earn even money and are less for a high amount, as long as a couple can pay a larger amount. <br /> <br /> But I see six wheeled wheels on the wheel of the wheel, the two of them appear in most, "The Psychotic Nebber" or "A hidden past or hidden or husband with both." Some of the "Lifetime" movies have a repetitive story line, and these two seem to be the most universal. <br /> <br /> The category "spouse ..." can be long lasting, but some people appear, or an incident occurs, reveals that the good wife once was a hooker, a couple long ago involved some painful work , Or any other in any other background is supposed to be different - etc .. Or, as this flashing, married among them the most cruel one of the marriages. <br /> <br /> One constant, husbands or other men in their style are usually clueless, empty, and finally there is no idea what is going on in the hell and the best program is too late (unless the male is harmful). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If referenced can be a harmful "neighbor" or whether it seems to be "wife", it always goes smoothly, successfully and easily they move slowly. Performances. They are busy with many tasks, feeling their needs, poses different poses, and cheating more than you can count - endlessly endless success with success. <br /> <br /> Here are the main actors, much like this channel movie, an old hand. I noticed that the film he played has the title "The Perfect Neighbor Bar". Finally, in this flutter, the revengeful "perfect wife" sends more people to her way of efficiency and ease than her experience. And Don Corleone's family may be able to "button man" capable. And I could not help but imagined that Jack Nicholson's Melvine Odd Character "Un Good Good It Gets" can give her anti-hero advice, in her huge drug problem, which helped her deal with emotion Composition
