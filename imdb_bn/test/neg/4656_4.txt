Like most of his contemporaries, "The Great Race" and "The Great Male to Flying Machines", I always associate this movie with my childhood, especially the New Year. On New Year's Day, when we talked about adults after my old age and lunch, the kids would watch TV where one of these three crazy nations would run continuously. For the only reason, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo or Bust" but I'm not afraid that the child is not the father of the man on this occasion. Which means that I can see all the faults clearly and when I was tempted to laugh at times, I really want to tell the truth that competitors will actually end the nation long ago. <br /> <br /> Certainly it has given birth to nationalism and women through its stereotyping, and I do not care more than one or two travels, sometimes light discrepancies which are occasionally seen. Even more, Cast, it does not sell enough film despite violent hamming. Tony Curtis seems to be turning into a television series "The Pursudus" to run his trial of "Yank Oberpard", he seemed too young to play young heroes, Terry Thomas is not very slow enough, Eric Sykes is a messy-mate When Lathri is wearing Gift Fraz as an exaggeration tuton, he is doing a fantastic camp comedy when you think he is the best villain of Gold Gare was. If there is something good in England, Susan Hampshire is at least one of the "bright young things", gamin and scripts like Pamp Flapper, fluttering in the Pitt and Doood chains, although the most striking is the most striking, though the "carrier-on" team may even continue "Khyber Pass" Go "so much better <br /> <br /> Director Anakin tries to publish everything "Golden silents", with crystal lashing, wrong identification capes, speed up camera shots, dramatic stunts and some light romances, but there is no real tension for such a famous nation. And anyway, at the end, the nation feels like another swiss. In fact, I want to give it another mark, if they were stuck in the alternative title "The Magistrift Man in the Jungle Olive", then the genuinely animated series "Wiki Races" made it even better.
