What was this I will see some scenes that were caught in my eyes, such as the 23 Bullshit where the drama was seen or counted number 23 everywhere, but was it the movie too? It was supposed to be labeled as a suspense movie and a mental thriller to cry loudly, I thought it could have a slight disastrous effect, but what did we get instead? We got something alive, such as the animal controlling man himself finds himself through the crisis of middle life and goes on a journey to freedom. Kinda like an old man flick if you ask me I was probably supposed to hired wild hogs, it would not make a difference. I mean we are crying, they should kill someone else that girl should be murdered. The number 23 number was added to the audience by adding Sparrow to the hero of that book. How will that our heads shaken? Shame the voters who have shown some goodness towards this annoying job, you call a movie and kudos to the most critically criticized critics in my reaction.
