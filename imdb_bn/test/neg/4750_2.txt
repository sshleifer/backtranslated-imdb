I'm sorry that this movie is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. One of the biggest disappointments in the history of the movie Giant Mill up will you think you will learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The secret falls into the same trap, the plot line is completely compelled, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be silent, and the action was replaced, and each monster shifts the heart of the original films away from the heart. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually the trailer that you are going through the film, realizing that almost every single death and really great shot in the movie have already been shown in the trailer, which can not be expressed slightly and excited about a little. I gave an extra star of movies to watch almost naked hot women. The film acted like a color-by-numeric monster source, which also happened that it did not cause any surprises because it has seen it once. The main failure with these two films is that the makers thought that setting up movies in our times would allow us to be interested in more stories that could happen one day. But what was the arcade game that created people in the Liberation War in the early part of the alien trilogy time line, something that allowed more suspension of disbelief. This is where you need to draw inspiration from future movies. Because to be honest, we all are afraid of childhood by seeing Allen kill the waitress, not only do it for us. Let the series take its roots back. Learn from the former masters and do not mess with a winning source trying to create a 'brave new vision', we like the root cause for a reason, we want to see it again. Finally, the end is true WTF moment of the whole movie, * Spliler * After a big measure, the survivors are attacked by special-Ops soldiers who justify their terrible actions by saying 'We were following the commands' and then started a dime and all the nice acting Started and Savaviors are turned on. Then survive the survival of a living survival in Heaven, after seeing the most wicked cliffhanger that you have ever seen, you left the movie (save the official dude) then you see all of the characters with a punch in the face of a punch that they reveal indicates a plot line There will be another movie which will impress an impressive channel to the original movie and its nose is tea That friend. So, in short, if you want to choose between this movie and want any other activity on the earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.
