If you see wild Rebel, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. If you are looking for a movie that relates to a motorcycle gang and explores the structure, Wild Rebels is a wrong movie. If you have a problem with the breakdown of American education system and teenage crime, Wild Rebels are wrong films. If you are looking for a movie that examines how rural police departments face a well-organized, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels are wrong films. But if you look for an unusual movie full of scenes after the scene of strange humor, horror acting, a paper thin plot and community theater style production value, but the exact movie on the wild ribble. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of a down-on-fortune stock-car driver named Wild Rebels Red Tilman (Steve Alimo). After a fire crash (Rod simply goes away from a completely unscathed despite having a cotton pants style jacket for cotton pants and protection), Rod decides to give it. Instead of fading through the rear departments in the south, without any future planning, he is the devil's Angels motorcycle gang (a gang of three cruel people who have ever sketched a leather jacket and a woman who seems to them). This group of Hollam sticks to the violence in a rural town in Florida by stealing newspaper from neighboring Mailbox. None of these dumb fools need to act as their driver during some of the big crimes planned by them. Apparently, these three Einsteins can drive vehicles with only two tires, not four. Therefore, they employ rods for bravery's credit that only one experienced stunt driver will be able to keep the car in the middle of a fork during low-speed chase. Finally, they hold a bank, enter the lower speed chase and sometimes enter the film and fight the greatest guns. I can go on forever, but you can get the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the word "so bad", but it seems that it describes wild rebels.
