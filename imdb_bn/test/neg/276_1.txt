People I like 11 of the ocean. <br /> <br /> A smart movie. Everyone had their own expert skills to reach the Grand Finale, because eleven letters were very important for the Higgs. <br /> <br /> What was the ocean in the world 12? What was the purpose of twelve people? I was supposed to be Jet-Jones but he was not really trying to work against a part of them and their whole film as he was not really part of the 11 ?? It was a bit annoying with a bit of bit like the story of Brad and Jet-Jones, which was thrown at the seats for some left to see the film. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was always a step forward in Benedict (Garcia). They are always able to outsmart him. What happened there? He catches up with them after a tip off and suddenly they are all wusses? The whole film can raise the amount of money they had stolen to return Benedict to the piece that they dragged 3 years ago. So the next movie they are going to develop courage and brain again and bring him back to give him the first hijst? Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image can only be achieved with a 5-minute matte suppression for Brad Pitt, Jeeta-Jones and Sweet Scene. <br /> <br /> Slow moving movie, the first one does not power. I've tried hard to choose it and I usually please very easy but I'm really frustrated. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! Twist - The whole movie was not needed because the original hadst been done before you saw it for the last two hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wait until it comes to TV or if you are the original fan since 2001, please do not see it.
