I saw it in the DVD Store a few weeks ago when I never heard of Dead Man's wife, and I thought I was blurred on an unmodified gem, because it had a wall-top in a truly unique land. Sadly, it was not ten or fifteen minutes in the movie that I realized it was a disaster epic. The first movie you can see is how horrible it is, it comes at the beginning, when your old salon has a bunch of darts that laugh like a bunch of hainas which is nearly five times longer. It's incredible how bad it is. And sadly, it's not good at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the movie cover box, the specialty of the Wall Killer has been played, perhaps you have a role in this movie You have to make a joke, but unfortunately its malicious role is to pay attention to a dead man's clash of semi-intelligent misappropriation and focus on the most neutral concept of Sheriff in a unique city seen in a movie. Yeche. He is acting by Boguslaw Linda, who is unable to cover his Polish accent or is unregistered, making it impossible that it immediately takes place in the extraordinary west of American. <br /> <br /> What is there in this border of Poland? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong position, but I can tell you that sheriff, as he is known in this movie, the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember in the movie. He has introduced a real funny scene where he is wearing a somber dark dress and faces a handkerchief in front of him. Before they hit him, he explained that each one could hit him once, and then, after the first round, everybody would hit him again, and if he could identify that those who throw pants, they will lose. What is this nonsense? I completely explain at a loss why a scene like this would never be in any movie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Sheriff is more beatiful and drunk and drunk and beaten, finally he shows nothing but occasionally, without stumbling on the screen and without mumbling ".in ??" You see, there are many conversations and preparations for a hanging, which are meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a city where two roadside faces face to face with each other in front of a wooden house facing a dirt road more than a road. I understand that it is a part of Poland that is considered acceptable enough to be like American Southwest, where there may not be a single character except the dead person. I have heard that Wall Kilmer took the role because he had conspired with the unique scene and by the minimal use of dialogue in relation to the reliability of the pictures on the timely interaction of the filmmaker Yuklansky's unique visual motions. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> I think that Killimar could not overcome the real satisfaction feeling that he would be able to overcome when he was given the role. Personally, I really could feel that if someone approaches me and lets hundreds of thousands of dollars to come and stay for a while, then I have reached several levels of success. I think he could not even read the script for this mess, because if he understood why he took the role, I made a total loss to understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> With the introduction of a human body, acting by Kilmer, seeking a reward. Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ridiculous love story involving many greatness involving a series of nude prostitution, alcoholic, sheriff and fool, stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is a wide and extraordinary lack of understanding of American customs. In one scene, a man cut half a cherry tomato and shook half of Kilmer's eyes (for that reason, I could not imagine), and then, a man gave a brief speech on the body of Kilmer, where he explained that he was " One of the men ", and then he returns to make his head loop with a snail. What bad condition <br /> <br /> Still not a believer? There is no reason to see it here. In one scene, Sheriff's eyes can be described as a red lipstick, except for a completely clean area around and the ashes around the neighborhood. A man hit his head and body very badly in the blood. In a puzzle, he cauterizes it with guns. Smart Finally, the sheriff seems to have a broken hand. While sitting in the bar, he kept a rope around his neck and used his good hand to pull the injured hand and use his good hand to pull the rope, instead of using his good hand, instead of using his hands, he was able to show his vibrating beer glass. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why does not he just use his good hand? I have no idea. That is, everything else in the film, like the title, does not make any sense. Love the summer Are you kidding me Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, there is something here for the IMDB's Guf page ?? <br /> <br /> Error made by characters (filmmakers are probably deliberately wrong): This movie was created. Haha
