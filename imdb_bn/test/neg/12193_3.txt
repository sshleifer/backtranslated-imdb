What could be a wonderful hostage film apparently disappeared visually as an indifferent director ... There were many instructions that the movie could take ... a vampire slash-festival was not one of these !!! Last 45 minutes Or the most ridiculous waste of film results. ... and sex machines ?? ... you are kidding me! Acting talent like Juliet Lewis and Harvey Keatel (not to mention George Clooney) have been completely destroyed in this non-cinematic movie. <br /> <br /> ... Robert Rodriguez, El Mariachi, known for violent, once in a while in Mexico, and for his other poor flicks including the recent sin city ... really put your attention to half the execution of half a half. .. which assures you that you are for a recreational period ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any concern, the madness starts ... parody and comedy have even a weak attempt. .. really exasperating !!
