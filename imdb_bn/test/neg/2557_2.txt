I could probably feel valuable that a photographer might be proud of a cast including Peter O'Woole, Susanah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Well, I was wrong. O'Toole and York both seemingly insensitive enthusiasm from end to end with overacting violence. I have seen it twice and still have no idea about what I have. I think O'Toole has played a Scottish Fortress Layard, who has water problems and likes to recover childhood games with his sister (York). She is crazy folding. But your guess is better than me. <br /> <br /> There is no freedom fighter in this picture. I can only assume that Cast and Director had blackmail making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a gifted cast and a waste of time during the director. Smiling.
