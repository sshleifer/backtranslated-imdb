Latvia's image begins right after WWI. Being a history teacher, I know that for many years the multinational army occupied most of Russia. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and soldiers were apparently there to protect the interests of their nation. However, some time they carried out missions or armed conflict with the Communist army, because the countries involved actually wanted to see so-called so-called "White" victories. However, White was deeply grouped - some wanted a return to a friend, some wanted a republic and wanted something in some. Due to these mixed targets and due to the lack of real commitment by foreign forces, the entire operation was destroyed and left only the USSR after one or two years. However, I do not know that German soldiers were involved. It makes me amazed because they just lost WWI and were not in the best shape to continue such an operation. <br /> <br /> This backdrop for this movie, but it was for Communist rich lady and her unfortunate love for the childhood friend who was in the German army. He repeatedly throws himself up but in every case he rebuffs him. So, he made these desires fertile by various factors. Although this sex is not a graphic, this and the underlying reason, it is not for the person as an adult film, and I will not show one to the young audience. <br /> <br /> This picture is interesting, as the overall film I saw as gray and secluded. If you are not an amazing patient or you really do not cross the German movies, I do not recommend it. I especially warn anyone that suffered depression, it is no doubt it will be worse. The simple fact is that there are many German movies where there is waiting to be seen - for example, most heads, DAS boots, headcountry whistles, Dior Wings or Ali, fears (among others).
