This simple horror movie tells the story of a father who used to kill the people using the stories of Edgar Allan Bo. Local police has robbed the case for several years, so the FBI has grabbed right now. The person knows exactly that, but apparently nobody could enter his house, because he is hanging out, running around his vinculum and torturing random locals. So FBI-Kuki is kidnapped, of which his father, a former chief investigator involved with local police. At the top of it off, Walkie College decided to smoke a bunch of kids out of camp and pack a pack of packs. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most overacted and sometimes underacted, Dead End Road has many infinitely silly point covers that reeks a low budget, custom-cum-friendship production.
