I did not read the original book or look at the previous movie, and actually did not know anything about the story of this film or the current film, I came with an open mind in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know, any comments on the movie have to be started, because the whole thing looks so confusing. It seems that there is a point in the film or a message or something, but it is completely unclear. <br /> <br /> The effects were excellent and very well tested. The concept was clearly set out to really well with time-out motivation. However, it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> All the time it seems to be the only supernatural connection with the search set at the beginning of the journey. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated incidents that do not really flow and the film seems to be isolated and lost. At one stage there was an amazing incident that the main story is not the moon's fate. <br /> <br /> When Hertadenz came to 802,701, the picture became very frustrating because he could not find any importance. About Eloi, and when it seems clear that there is something to find out, it's boring incentive. This is a big change from the past travel events and a wonderful change that suddenly seems like a completely new story. There should be an explanation for so many things that may happen, but there is no discovery. I really want to know what the picture has "got", which was to expose, but there is no benefit. It seems like reading a short story of what is happening in the book at the moment, it has been a very half-hearted effort of rendering in the film, but it has become so simplified and "low" that the meaning and context are completely lost. <br /> <br /> Just like we hope we'll find out where we are all last, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction and becomes stupid action film without any real action. At this point the director refrained from making any money in this film. Now countless important things happen without any explanation. Heart Disease failed to take an opportunity to return to the past for no reason and then suddenly lost all interest during the trip due to some reason. This picture suddenly disappeared when Hartdegan decided to stay with Eli. <br /> <br /> The film is very frustrating after a good start. Before arrival with Eloi, Hart was spending much more time in Disney's event. However, the worst part of the film is that I think this is the most important part: Setting up the situation with Eli. The entire point is completely missed, and this restrains the film undermines After that the film gets a lot of attention on the impact and action, and all the attempts to return to the meaning of the movie and the original direction seem to be forcibly and outside the place. With many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to lose and lose direction. However, Hartgegan has decided that he is no longer disturbed by travel time, not everyone is most impossible. Finally, the whole picture looked like a collection of uninterrupted events. Money and context were lost, though it was a hole in the hole, it was very clear. What was the reason for such a disappointment that there was obviously such a possibility: it was not by any bad film, it was so easy that it was so easy. The start was very committed, the time travel looked fantastic and it worked without being closed in the tensent, and the experience of the Hertogenes with Eli could have been so easy that some questions were asked for the right questions, and there was not a temptation like "dull down" and simplified . I just wanted to have a time machine so that I could travel back to time and made suggestions against mistakes made.
