These days, Readley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and he can earn huge amounts of money to manage movies - especially his films like Allen, Gloditr and Blayd Runner. So from this partial list of his credits, it's clear he's an extraordinary talent. However, if you look at this very early attempt when filming in school, you'll probably tell a difficult time that he was determined for greatness. Because it has some camera-work and style, though the film is frustrating and stupid. However, it was not meant for general releases and considering it was only a training ground, then I was settled to visit it charitablely - so score 4. 16 part of the movie cinema: European Shorts DVD. This DVD is 16 shorts. Most are not cool, although it is a head, copy shop, and a WASP man without it, it is a great movie for lovers of small films and valuable to purchase.
