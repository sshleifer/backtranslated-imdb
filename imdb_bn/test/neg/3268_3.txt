CaddyShack II is nothing compared to the original Caddyshack. But, there are valid reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfeld was supposed to be the umbrella of this movie but he did not like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he did not make the film. (2) It was a low budget, Bill Murray was promoted to Superstar status. Ted Night died in 1986, and the so-called "so-called S" (though it was Rodney all the way) in the first film of Chavez Chase could not be more than 5 minutes, because it would be too expensive to pay him. But you were Dan Ackroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Coed and Jackie Mason, all the options, none of whom did their best performances.
