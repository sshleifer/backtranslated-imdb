There is no real story that film wall looks more like a suitable movie in the play-documentary, so this piece may itself be a mockery. About three young Singaporean children (like the UK Chain) who play at school with atheists, run by gang, fight, humiliate people on the street, tattoos, and do not hang for doing anything. They are usually difficult to imagine themselves and challenging rap chats in the camera so often on the chants. Pictured in MTV style, fast-cut, crazy camera angles, tight close-ups and animation interludes. Compared to subtitles, conversation can be a crypearer in the original language of Mandarin and Hauian, and I have no doubt that contemporary Singapore references will spread to the western head as well as cultural and political perspectives unless you are familiar with Singapore. Such a teen movie can be the first in Singapore, but for example, it has been done and done before other western countries LaHain (1995).
