I really hate this film and the movie makers behind it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am about to make a tough film about youth and youth culture and to make honest films. An excellent example of 1 987's "River Edge" is a well-made teenage drama. However, what I learn is children, naughty and sensational visions that the makers of "2:37" accepted. <br /> <br /> This is a major example of which it raises many problems and still fails in an important case, the way to comment or even a way to reach a resolution between them. <br /> <br /> My other main problem with this photo, except the mystery of the complete theft of "elephant" of Gus Van Sant (Van Sant was not surprised) <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I heard that his motivation to "2:37" lie May be either based or not. Seeing low-grade results, this little surprise does not surprise me. This is a magnificent student film exercise that has no place in a movie or DVD. Pure and simple
