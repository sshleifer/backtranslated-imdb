I would appreciate it only a respect. It was innovative. Innovative means that this is not a good film, it can give you an idea of ​​what you can accept and apply to your own movies. <br /> <br /> Simple Plot .. Good .. Easy. I reached the point where they do not destroy the building, or I care about it. If I hear the girl's annoying smile once, I swear I will throw the DVD out of the window. And there are also heroes. They tried to make her sweetheart, but she was a malicious distorted! The girl's bra sniffing, when she is naked, sneezing in her eyes, when she sleeps, her bra keeps on her eyes, she keeps her bra on the naked doll (which she sleeps on her doll's sleep). Um) <br /> <br /> It is frustrating that even Morso ignites me. In the photo gallery on DVD, you can see how the picture has been faded and it has been kept in color (also digitally). The film looks much better without effects .. So they make it a good film only artist ... wow <br /> <br /> I think most of the people who like this image liked it because the chick was naked for 5-10 minutes. This is not compared to Delicatessen (many are trying to try). Delicatessen has the character you can get and .. These people just grunt and giggle here. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say lie to give a hint that the German Impressionistic film was similar to shake the old silence. One of the problems of most foreigners, especially artisans, is that focuses on creating artistic compositions and forgot about the 'place' of the scene. In the audience it does not really understand what is happening, because they do not get any idea of ​​the surrounding place. <br /> <br /> However, it's trash. Short film on DVD, Creep, a hackoo was a lot better.
