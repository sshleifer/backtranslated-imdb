This will be the most annoying film I've ever seen. I can tell about it only thanks to positive that it does not give me a look. We were surprised to be given a free display at the school and wondered when everyone in the audience would start fun. This piece of junk is a badly film, way too long film. It took 10 seconds to present the original idea about why the film was created. The only person who could be interested in this photo has lost their job and why they want to know. They might find interesting interviews. A different edit may have created an interesting documentary, but I suspect that the interviews shown were not involved in any way. As it is, it is only a tragedy, both see and be a part of it. Drop this image without any cost!
