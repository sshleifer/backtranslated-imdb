This movie is * better in the first part of the * <br /> <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 points. So let's find out some formulas and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... things do not matter because FBI friends are bad guys! Although it was a great twist ... it was almost a terrible turn. I immediately finished the film in 7-15 to 8 to 3 minutes and based on 10-15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else see why this bend is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it is bad because it does not have to do anything with the previous hours and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> These killers are in this movie about 5 minutes (like murderers) and two FBI agents are only in the last hour and 15 minutes in 15 minutes. <Br> <br /> We got it ... surveillance ... oh, the killers are scared. Which does not create any senses, because only the sequoaps are described in only limited terms. And watch the hours and twenty minutes of surveillance we are seeing 3 stories. The window got out because everyone died in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All of this eventually makes more humorous. Oh, they killed a group of FBI agents at the beginning ... What are the FBI agents sleeping together? All in the same room. Disguised by non-smokers and killed by those who know nothing about FBI agents? A police super policeman can not hit one by one pistol for 3 feet away, which can shoot several shots. I hate movies that try to remind you that it can be real when they give a strange jump, they think we believe. <br /> <br /> The other is about 10-15 minutes after the release of the movie, standing in the field and the murderers with the girls ...
