First of all, I would like to admit that the tea sand was not my cup of tea. This movie was definitely not targeted towards the public. Critics will enjoy seeing it. The campaign and campaign was quite confusing. <br /> <br /> I look forward to some dramatic things like Devdas. Claiming for the story and the duration, I found the film very slow. <br /> <br /> I am a mother tongue conspirator, and I'm sorry that I thought he was wrong. The role of the Blob Sand can be portrayed as a destructive, innocent and naive who needs an actress. Everyone else gave a good performance. Tagore's screenplay about the condition of human beings came in the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.
