Tycous is one of the worst movies I ever see directly in video images. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this product is not being displayed in the movie. Bid visual effects (horrific starters) Bad actors (I do not understand why this film looks like Dennis Hooper) and bad screen. My options: Armageddon or Twister. Sense for Tycus: Do not see this film.
