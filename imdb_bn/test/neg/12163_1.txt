All right, I think I've destroyed Spind, Explosive, and Stephen King stories (when they reach the 'screen'), there's just any sad moocost in us. I fully know that most of them are doing the weakest job. I hope it I plan it I humbly give it to you ... <br /> <br /> This time ... Geiebieja ... All right, so I think I saw this thing many years ago ..., okay. I thought it was pretty good ... wrong ... I'm saying (given in a soundful, annoying, roundout path :) I was not really trying to expect hobbies or much, but what was it, a mini series? I have only one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... how can u ..... You probably just pull things into minutes, just by the scene of the Fridin 'ENDLESS, full meaningful, and slow minded conversations? I mean, every block ** D scene shows how the two 'discoasing' they feel and behind and d ... and ... a ... gee i ... t double ** good a ... and ... About half an hour after that, I think about 1/2 of the running time (I did not check, sorry) I finally got completely annoyed! What happened after half an hour than the actual accident? The 'store' man was running away during many killings of eye doctors, news photographers, and many lots and intimidatory conversations. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I'm committed that I have no stopless stupid action; I like many movies where nothing happens, but at least when they talk and such meaningful things are being said and the letters are going deeper, thinking ... !!! ??? All right, I admit that the actors were not too bad among themselves (of course, except Stephen King): I like the man in the shop, I thought 'old' was both good. I liked the general and main female. It's just that if they could cut all the hour filler, all I'm saying is that. I mean, it's ready to be a Saif Fi thriller, sort of ..., all right? Do you know that when people fill the telephone call at the shop most of the time, they definitely receive the award, they are talking to God, who knows that the WHO is all psychic (for him) and acting as he can manage No ..Wtf !!! ??? The people are clearly shown as a cold blooded, effective killer. What was that about ??? So, multiply it by about 500, and this is basically half way through if I'm finished; It was either that hanging itself, I swear! I mean that there are other kings 'adaptations' that are lingers, but at least they have gone alone ...! Oh well, I probably think you can be the 'story' itself and do not remember the Crowd along and ultimately have the greatest and Divine patience to wait, maybe it might be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I honestly and humbly doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I often do not write these things, but this time I was not alone or could not sleep at night (as I did The time of the ceremony! :)
