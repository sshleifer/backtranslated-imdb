The 20th century Fox Road House 1948) is not just a silent noai, but it is an improbable stagnant bore of a movie. Unbelievable cardboard characters are written entirely by Edward Chodorov, which were produced, and have been wonderfully managed by Gene Negosco, from which one would expect much more. Idea lupinos playing a major role! Lupino, a woman who was able to become insane for sex appeal as a blood orange, is undergoing a tour here, part of a sexy bar-room torch singer in Ritter Hewarth. The handsome Colonel Wilde as his boyfriend is completely as a wood and is completely destroyed by genius Celeste Holm who is a little more than a bit of part of the role. Then we have Richard Weirdmark's most ridiculous written piece of the picture! When we first saw him, he was a nice man. The man runs a rich road house Then suddenly - and for that reason he was not cleaned enough - he became jealous of his manager (Wild) when he later told him to marry Lupino. You see Wyomdar wanted to marry himself but - 1) He never offered to him - 2) He had no relation (they are also things that are similar to a scene of love together) and - 3) Do not say to anyone (including lupino) ) He has received a marriage license. How nice! So how after a "trick", something that was achieved with the happiness of marriage, such as Loopino, is somebody's quotes. is not it? Well, when I hit the whole thing on the widget, I still feel sorry for the movie. From here, the character of Wmmark becomes oddly ridiculous! Losing its campaign so early in the proceedings is completely unbelievable and intolerable. He finally went towards the end, became completely annoyed and with a few Tommy Udo Schninger, he went to the gunman for the unfortunate Colonel Wald before throwing dust dust. <br /> <br /> And if it is not enough to mess a movie for you - the picture is marred with studio sets and a constant use of indoor extruders. There is no single outdoor shot in the whole movie! It has been added - 95% of the film takes place on the night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, there are additional "Widmark and Loopino a Fox" feature. Any such documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never in Fox or in a movie somewhere else! However, this feature is hosted by heavyweight heater such as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belmer, and many of these supernatural and cring-educative affair. All I can say is then I guess it must be. But until now the "Road House" was a forgotten and funeral and I stayed as far as I was concerned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Down to the Saga In In Ship" (1949) and colorful "Red Square of Montana" (1952) ).
