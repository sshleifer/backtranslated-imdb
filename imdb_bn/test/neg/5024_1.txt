May or may not have spoilers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is actually very overrated. Why? There are not any story lines, no plots, and the show only dragged ... and ... and ... because the plot has more side stories and fillers than the episodes of progress. And the fillers only repeat the same story repeatedly. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagom feels like a jewel sari, a worm / rusty / tempered giant thing pop, Inwaasha says "air-square", "Iron River Soil Stiller" etc., and kill the monster, they Jewelry gets sari, and then we repeat this scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> Besides repeating episodes, comedic devices have been repeated, and they are no longer funny. Waiting, they were not. Sexual harassment is not funny. Wiz series old teens, 16+ rates. I have no idea why it is so. Nothing is bad except for so-called funny sexual harassment, it is kind of counseling and it can arrest you nowadays. <br /> <br /> Now, we know that Inua is exaggerated. Video Games. They all sucked. Especially the mask game I played that at my friend's house. It was not something interesting. The game was slow, annoying, and it was like a 64-like graphics. In a magazine, it got 4/10 rating, saying ... "This role-playing game is slower than cocktail sticks compared to Michek." Then, all these stupid Inuyasha toys are in books, jobs, trading cards, stickers, and color. Colorful book! We thought Inua 16+! Maybe not ... But after being a member of the Inayasha group in MSN, almost half of the people were 10 to 13. I think Inausa is very young children since childhood. (I think a little bit edited on this show, it can be shown in Tuomani.) There are more than 40 manga volumes. I can only help but wonder how much of the forest has been spent for them to make them. Sorry ... <br /> <br /> then there are music. Music is so annoying We hear the same 5 songs in each episode. After 10 episodes, the music gets really annoying. In other animations, there is music to fit their mood and we often do not hear some songs. There are about 15 different Asha soundtracks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, because I'm Inausaar I was a fan. I feel ashamed of myself. I'd rather see Kim Possible or Pokemon. Sadly, there will be more romance between the two main plays than Yanuassa on both shows ...
