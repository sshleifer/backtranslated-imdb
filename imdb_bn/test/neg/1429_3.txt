Strongland (1998) D: John Pipal. Kevin Gaze, Elizabeth Penn, Brett Harrison, Robert Eldond, Tucker Smolwood, Emmy Smart, De Snyder (Twisted Bone), Amal Row The annoying scenes of torture are 'shining', a fascinating film about a dark psychotherapist, who thrives on thirteen people in the torture chamber through the Internet. Snider (rock band twisted sister of the 80s) played the horrible psychopath of Haribal Lecter, who was disappointed as a 'packing' victims' mother of the pay ena. Harleston (Woody Bhai) I delivered one of the worst police performers ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why this is the only screen to credit with the same compassionate performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is finally numbing, torture scenes are very graphic and gross, and the end just sucks.
