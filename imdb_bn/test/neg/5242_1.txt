Once I heard that the heroic poem of the greatest and oldest German was transformed into a movie, it often became a sight for me to see it. I never disappointed me to catch the first glints of his appearance. Our predictions with Lambert, our favorite highlander and allies, from grave rider, leading roles can be interesting, although some doubts come with life (an important female character of the boss) ... two hours ago I saw this movie. After I read the name of the director, my world was separated. I said - from that point, there was not much surprise. First and foremost, there is no relation to the film with the original Baufful, if we ignore some violent and meaningless stolen names. If they do not steal the name and it declares a new story, it may be considered as an F-Class verb with beautiful dress and visualization. This is just a crime! A legend and its ideology as well as an attack in common sense. All right, I'll be positive for a second ... except for the common electro-Goth atmosphere, there is good music. That was it for both positive part and this comment.
