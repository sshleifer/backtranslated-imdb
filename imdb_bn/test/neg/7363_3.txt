As the head of Canadian history, my first point is to say: Historical events are not correct! How can a producer do that? We saw Franklin in London in the year 175, but in 1755 he was not in exile! How can he pass that movie? The scene in London was very vague. Then for anyone reading the "Les Annesiones Canadians" story, there's your storyline. It's the story of La Coriveau, that "witch". Add a love story too and add a sad relationship between the mother and the girl's end. Sure, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then apparently it was set up in the city of Quebec, but it mostly shot in Forte de la Luisburg. Sure it's a historical site and it's right for time, but it was visible that this view was not set in Quebec City. Overall, if you are looking for a documentary in New France, Canda: A People's History, Canda and NEw get a real documentary in France's history. If you want a love story which can bring you tears, set up a story in an excellent forest, see the new France.
