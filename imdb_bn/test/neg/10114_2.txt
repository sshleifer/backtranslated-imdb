It's a shameful case. Here's an interesting idea, but it's completely lost in the 64-style composer's computer effect and the confusion of bad stories. Such a plot, a monster in soul, huntsman anxiety. This should be a fairly straightforward predator / predator type story, but the director and / or writer thinks how they should be guessed when they were shooting for nearly three days. The chief baddie thinks that he was wearing a cheap dirt maul masks, which they tried to disguise as CG colors flow. There is nothing to suggest here, even the title seems to be spreading in ambiguity.
