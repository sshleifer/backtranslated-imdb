Spike Milligan was the most fun person I ever saw, and had a huge impact on my life. <br /> <br /> This film is tall and terrible, and its memory does not have any credit. The script has been erased and the book has saved many lines from being intact (here traces jokes are not known). Performance of actors is not alone, an extraordinary cast, and Leader, Shane Hughes, distributes milligans' intellectual animosity in a tedious story, which completely misses the point. <br /> <br /> Gentle pensing is a killer good. Fars should accelerate toward the end. Googles often do the shows, the novel "Pukun" is explicitly done, but if there is anything in this film, you want to combine different elements in the final final way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1980, "Piccun" audio recording, McKenna with TP, Darmat Kelly, Norman Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes more fun than this whole movie I believe the LP has been moved to CDs, but do not know whether it is still in print. <br /> <br /> with Jim Dell and Arthur Loay there is a movie of "Adolf Hitler: My Party in the Down Downfall". It's also a messy mess, but it's more fun than this thing. <br /> <br /> It is possible that milligans are too radioactive for the screen of soul. Here are other critics involved in the humility and deliberate thoughts. This film virtually fumbles every opportunity and misses a chance of frustration.
