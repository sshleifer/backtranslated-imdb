I was lucky enough to increase the surfing in San Diego (not the world's largest wave, but it was childhood, I would tell you) and I saw the so-called Surfer Flux of my life. Now just after seeing North Shore for the first time, I can say that thank God, I have never seen this baby. If I saw it and mistakenly thought that it was the actual screenplay of the scene, I sold my board and got it completely, I do not know, accounting or something. <br /> <br /> Movies have much common with real surfing as GUN was a real military life. Terrible acting, bad music, cinematography is iffy good and oh what my Allah Laird Hanilton was thinking? How nice!!! Do not watch this movie !!! IT SUKS !!! If you want a real surf flick, see Riding Giant. Hell, see the surf's UP instead. Seriously Sucks Bad bad Bad looks bad Brah ;) <br /> <br /> PS: Will I change my delivery "WTF?!" Reasons WTF, apparently, we are supposed to whisper this site. Good luck! (Shahjah!); D.
