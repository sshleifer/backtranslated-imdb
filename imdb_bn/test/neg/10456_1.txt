I used to think that "the army of the dead" can not be worse, but the greed of greed seems to be the previous movie mentioned as "The Godfather"! Special effects are horribly (like the original Nintendo graphics look like the HTC makes). When it comes to acting, keep it like this, I went into a game with my 6-year-old nephew and gave the Oscar-worthy performance to actors and actresses for this de-list (and for this for it). . So basically, if the head and head of my head is again seen to see this movie or to be dumped with my left knife, then this is a difficult choice !! Do you know who needs two arms?
