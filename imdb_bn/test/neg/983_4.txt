This movie has been okay, in fact it's probably nice, if the directors separated the footage from the interview and the concert. "INTO THE VOID" is a great song, and I hate how it is cut in the best part to go to Oz Osborn, a cruel interview. That should have been in the end of the film, or in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to keep them and play the song, but the "Black Sibbath: The Last Supper" is hard to keep and just keep running because the music is constantly interrupted. Yet, this picture has some power; Concert footage, do not play it, it's nice. After a long break without the Oxburn, Black Sebastian returned to the stage and captured this film well: The Sabbath was originally thrown out by fans. Fans, of course, have a sweet advantage in the film because they are able to see the band, but of course, their DVD audience will not have to be associated with additional interviews. Jeb Bryan and Monica Hammiman director (director) to do this work in the film! Also, W. Smith is shy to edit the film in this way.
