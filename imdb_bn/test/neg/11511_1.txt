I do not have all these fun shows. I actually think it's worse than another terrible Disney Channel City-Cams. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Caddy, because he can not work. The jokes in this show are very weird, and it makes worse when only a little bit of acting talent (and I understand a little) Justin Bradley as Sadi Brother Hall. Jasmine Richards and Michael D. Asenzo decorated Sadie's friends. Really both stupid and just terrible actors. The two words that can truly describe this show are horrible corny. It is funny funny that only young girls think they are funny because their brain is still not developed. Now I have explained my hatred for acting and horrible humor, what's next? The show is a stupid concept in the whole premises. He changed again (so the scientist is not a ben-loving) and suddenly someone knows him? It's stupid. In short, I hate this show, but young girls who do not enjoy funny ideas will enjoy, so I guess they're going for what quality. Although as much as I can say, the first season is definitely better than the second. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My rating: Awful Show TV G 30 minutes
