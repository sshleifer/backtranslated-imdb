I do not easily understand that any fan, or just plain, anyone who is scared of this horrible, lazy, bad writing hate even remote. It's equally qualifying as a perfect tragedy that is so embarrassing below. The potential for this was huge, it could be great. That shame is that everyone who played talent, set, props, everyone else's luck was wasted that was nastily wasted by a script. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of strict production and quality control here. Like these hamie Hollywood movies (crazy crazy crazy earth, casino royale) where they are just merging each other and getting 'a great time', which is basically collecting a check to make no sense. <br /> <br /> There may be a good text to send in my sleep. Actually I have, though awake. I performed it with a bunch at high school at the age of 10 and with classmates. It was good, I look at it now and gags are funnier. Steven Moffat is a talent bum to you! What a waste, what a waste opportunity. I want to cry ...
