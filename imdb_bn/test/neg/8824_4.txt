It seems to be a modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Ecclestone, who was so awesome in "Shellov Grave" and (especially) "Jude" and Imon Walker, who came with so much intensity and spontaneity in his intense roles. On "oz." Someone will think of both their natural Shakespeare, but both actors misfire: Walker's Othello take part in a fairly cookie-cutoff, which does not have much of an impact on a whispery delivery; And Eccleston hams up unexpectedly as it's IGO, the role is almost winking at a dirty parody camera. Probably he eats eggs by his director, whose fleet method might have worked well with Elizabeth language, but this seems to be a quarrel, ugly choice for modern painting. And the plaques themselves are less frustrating than being easier ?? It seems that Andrew Davis has found the famous plot and even then wrote the first dialogue in his dialogue. All in all, a failure. 10 out of 4
