My daughter liked it but I was fierce, smoking a character from this movie. In movies like Bruce Willis, smokers who are not horrible to watch "product placement" actors - at least children's movies should be more considerable! I wonder: that was deliberate? What is the big tobacco "sponsor" film? What does the film prohibit smoking? At least for movies and children's films. My daughter liked it but I was fierce, smoking a character from this movie.
