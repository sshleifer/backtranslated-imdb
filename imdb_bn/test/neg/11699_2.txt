Maybe that's why I read the book Potter Strawb's wonderful book, but I was very frustrated to see this movie. In my opinion, filmmakers made the story interesting and unique and replaced it with the most popular Hollywood-style material. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great cast since it is very bad, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, and then essentially unknown Alice Krige. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the best. He apologizes to me during the closed credit.
