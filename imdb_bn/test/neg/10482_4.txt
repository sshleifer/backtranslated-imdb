Well, when I bought this flick, I'll start shooting this final B-movie, asteroid monkeys, and start killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, almost everything I hoped to do was, in fact, less than the 60-year-old Cinis movie budget. Acting was the worst thing I did, especially the girl playing the main role and playing the waitress that girl smiled me with my ass. <br /> <br /> Why do not you fall into the 'Night Frights' section so bad that it is good? Why some of the scenes were very long and annoying. For example, the scene was that police officers were finding pillars in the woods, only a few minutes of walking without this purpose. And then on the grand finale, people are waiting for a 5-minute monster and when the asteroid's monkey appears, it becomes wack'd at the end of the film in 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Yes, 'Night Fear' is annoying, but it got a couple of fun moments. I can recommend this movie to be like movies like 'Jantar, Things to Venus' or 'Curse of Creation.' <br /> <br /> I can give 'Night Draits' to 10 spaces in 10 spaces. <br /> <br /> - Rob Grusm-
