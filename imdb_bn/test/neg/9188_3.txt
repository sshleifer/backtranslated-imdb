This play was conceived as a salutation and respect for American professionalism in New York on September 11th. The story is called in a series of flashbacks, where firefighter Jack Morrison (Jockin Phoenix) crashed with a floating building floor and is only contacting Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) on the radio. Flashbacks basically show that how Jack is employed, Kennedy looks as a father figure, as a firehouse legend. Of course, today Jack's colleague firearms are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and ultimately, he lets them leave and he goes on to his funeral, where he is best admired, they know the firefighters. Also, as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick of TicTinator 2, Maurice Chestnut like Tommy Drake, Danny Gauquin as Billy Bark, Belhajar Geeti Ray Gauquin, and Tim Gini as Tony Karrigan. At the end of the film blazes I could pay attention and the characters could enjoy watching them, the rest were too stupid for my favorites. Enough!
