Jim Kerry Humor is a special brand and I personally think he is a great actor (for example, Eternal Sunshine). <br /> <br /> However, this film probably does not seem to be much more than Jim Carrey's car. If you think your style of comedy is fun, be aware of this directly, you will sit in front of this movie-face because there is nothing more to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Even if you want a career comedy, I'm not sure that you will find this picture funny. I went to see it on Saturday night at 10:30 am and the audience was ready to laugh. They giggle across the trailer, which was not particularly fun, but when it comes to movies, silence happens. I think it raised nearly five real laughs. <br /> <br /> The movie does not know what the problem wants to be. It can not make up his mind whether it is going for slapstick or serious. If it was stupid, it could be forgiven, but (I guess it is trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters). <br /> <br /> The film's strong position is up, and there was a lot of potential here. But this does not start up to almost half and remains widely unused. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first tragedy in 40 minutes after the couple's life gets worse. <br /> <br /> Four different groups came out of this movie when I was there, and my flatmate could not keep me away from the house (her girlfriend is just coming back from a month-long vacation!), I'm the same Have to work. And in my entire 25 years the movie is going on, I've already done it.
