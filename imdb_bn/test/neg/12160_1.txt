Today has seen this movie. Wondered how disappointed and Oscar can be a shortlist. The sadest thing is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> How can an actor, cruel and mighty emperor of Asiad be played with gangs-khan, warm and lovely eyes - all the scenes other than a scene? <br /> <br /> There are a lot of plot holes: he became emperor, there is nothing about him; He has spent 20 years in his childhood and mature age, he has nothing. We see money, energy, friends or ex-slaves outside the house. Click! He led the huge army without any reason for the next leadership leadership. <br /> <br /> 4. The sorcerer of Ganges-Khan was only interpreted by a wolf / god whom he had. <br /> <br /> 5. Does a man who loves his wife do not see him for years? <br /> <br /> 6. If you wander your horse through the enemy line, is it enough to win the battle of the sword? Ridley Scott knows that way? <br /> <br /> 7. After 20-30 years, why did not you see the mother of the old man? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (No one literally.) <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Really Cinemographer's work is good; Nature is outstanding - but the movie can not be created without the director and the script. Actually Ganges-Khan will play director in a second. <br /> <br /> please.
