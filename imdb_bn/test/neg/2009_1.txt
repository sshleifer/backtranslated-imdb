Hmm! Is this the worst movie ever? Well, for some cast it is shy to see them like a movie but if it does pay bills, why is the film good for it. Just as the signal does not have good effects for the movie, the music is fine for a cheaper movie. OK, the last credits are okay. Many <br /> <br /> to list, however, cast, acting, set, script, end ... .. what the hell, Drac .......... the worst drunk ever !, much more But all of them can not be disturbed down. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> What was it? "Seeing a kind is just to see how bad it is.
