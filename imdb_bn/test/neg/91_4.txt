Careful, my lover (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> Production: Movie Maker / RKO Radio Photo <br /> <br /> The Crusuli-Straining Thriller, Ur from the leading producer of Caller Young and Ida Lupino The filmmakers (with some patchwork on some unknown ones) <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan 'Danger' and 'Woman' in this entry in 'Eid Lupino' Female Dangers Style film. Ryan Haidad hates Wilton, a strictly harmful psychotic handman drifter (Nou, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Loupino is a solo war widow, Helen Gordon, who hired Howard to do some work around her house. Events that made Howard Helen caught in her house suddenly went away. <br /> <br /> Howard has a hidden secret, he can not reveal. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for her. To maintain it, that is. His employers have unhealthy habits in search of death and finding out. It is part of the film's problem. Howard's psychosocial nature is so extreme that in 1918, when the film was set up, it would be almost impossible to revolt until it was unelected from the city to the city. He could not remember what happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, socio-social tendencies are set by the smallest and most ordinary things (a young girl's flirt, the inadequacy of war, being rejected for her service). I do not know how he created it in Helen's interview. There are other possibilities. If you are locked in your house with crazy, still leave yourself alone for your own time, can not you find the way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan thinks this element is defeated. It seems like he's holding his hand. Her ticks and spamming and dementia have all of its series of coiled explosions, there are- that robotics think of them. At this moment in his career, he probably showed this character, some degree, ten times and it showed. We encourage people to express sympathy with Howard (I'm not) on the humanities shown, as he is being stopped in his tracks through song lyrics, and related to a group of unbiased children. Lupino was frazzled only and had to work in hardship, which he was able to do and more than make. <br /> <br /> The picture was a thing; What is the last solution to the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing and ineffectual end to a frustrating end. <br /> <br /> There was a repetitive motif of a little interest where the reflection of the camera Howard (in the mirror, water, Christmas tree decorations). It's going to run on its head, or point it out. Horner (Wiki 1953), who earned his fame in the production design, did a good job to think of the house as a prison. Credit is very, always working at the RKO Art Department at home. In the end, the principals' sub-standard work, each of which has many good films for their achievement. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out 4
