Please hear some good comments about this movie and awesome comments as awesome, but it's not. Clearly the screenplay wanted to make a scary horror movie, but at the same time youngsters wanted to do some teenage comedy injections for the target audience. Scares and comedy are very good movie results, same goes for Monster MAN I've seen my share I have seen good and terrible ones, but the crop of the released films on this day is so awesome that it inspires me to show. The acceptance of these days for such bad films really irritates me. Let's face it, in the 70's, 80s and 90s, they produce many curves, but they are also treated like this. Today they are regarded as "good entertainment". - Bocox!
