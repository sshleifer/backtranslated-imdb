Within the first few minutes, I began to take a critical view of this adaptation, but I end up as a dedicated Zen Austen fan ... However, this is not a program that I would not recommend to anyone unfamiliar with his work. It does not seem to be the book that judges, especially the entertainment of television's own rights. There was something about this adaptation of the lack of credibility - most of the costumes and even the actors did not really look and I became acting poor sometimes. There was no doubt that the actors were a very nice look, but it did not really provide enough variety to create memorable characters. It was very stable to be fully set in the same place and found the Fannie Return Home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. Best Actor was Black Ritson, who earned Edmund's fascination very well, and Crawford also acted effectively. I liked Billy Piper as the actress, but this role was not consistent with that, and in the 1999 version it was better acted by Frances O'Connor, who gave a lot of fine and credible performances overall. Jane Austen adaptation will always provide a love story for you to feel better, but unfortunately, I saw that it is the worst.
