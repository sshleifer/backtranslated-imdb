When I was a kid I saw this movie, and I thought it was terrible. Now I'm old, I found it as terrible. Universal could do better than this. They decided to make the most money they can only make out using all their monsters once. To me, that was a cheap shot. These characters were able to hold themselves in their own movies and the actor's choices were frustrating. Dracula will be the Carlos of Lagosi, Frankenstein, the monster. <br /> <br /> I think it was a Disney Scaloid Signal sequence several decades ago, and it was not appreciated. Umiversal started out with something great and original, and then they could pander public with schlock that is very clear in this film.
