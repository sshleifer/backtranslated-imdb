I think the film wants to think of Canaan movies, but unfortunately it is for those who have created it. You might think, the people of Canaan were quite calm ... this one is completely annoying and sucks. Story, who care? This will not help you reduce or decrease this movie because it really looks like a cheaper movie. Arnold, he does not look like this one belongs to me, why he agreed to play the role was beyond me. Probably probably for the money. I just love the giant in water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is just plain and easily terrible.
