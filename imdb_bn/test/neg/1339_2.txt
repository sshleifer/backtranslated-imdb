Last night I saw this movie. I usually do not do good or bad comments, as I think movies are like books that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, taste changes, so much so that. This movie was bad. Finally I thought, oh, this is my patience tested. How many women really hit "rock bottom" and lived like this and if I could just borrow some cash from mam and my fashion designing dreams could have survived - my lord, life will be big! I drove out my daughter for a wonderful chick-dated flickr (my favorite husband likes to watch movies together and I knew it would not be his thing), somewhat light and easy on the senses, but it was a bad movie. We were watching cute and interesting movies and this movie was not that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she held her own Bad Bad
