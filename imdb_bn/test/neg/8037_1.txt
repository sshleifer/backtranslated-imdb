I'll repeat - what a stupid scene. <br /> <br /> Is there anything new? I do not know who wrote it. But I believe this guy has seen all the Hollywood-teen-teenager movies ... all the scenes and dilouges you can see everywhere. Why are you making this movie? An adult like kids? They like gold car money ... and they are positive? They are lucky ... and certainly passion ... it can not be done. O young actors - wow :-). I like when the camera is centered on their beautiful face? What a shit ... 90% good kids movie this one! This is not a creative or fun movie. It's just nothing. <br /> <br /> d.
