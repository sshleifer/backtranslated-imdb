Where do I start? First off, the story sucks. Acting sucks, the effect sucks really, I guess I'll start with the story. The story of Comodo v. Cobra: No. 1, does not explain how or when Comodo and Cobra went there. Or that matter, how it was made. Acting: Awesome! It seems that the director dragged some people in the street right away (probably what he did). And at the end and of course, at least, the effects: they are very awesome that comodo looks not even like a comodo, just a dinosaur, which seems incredibly unreal. The water is not even moved when COBRA appears. All in all: Do not worry about terrible pieces of shit, even rent it.
