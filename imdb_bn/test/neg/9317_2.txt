Help! Again, Paul Scrador has ruined his own goals with brutal, pedantic tales. I rearranged a holiday so that I could see this "premiere of the world." What is wrong Why would Schrader even want to film an Exorcist? Bright intentions are good, but if I want 2-hour religious bubble, I'll visit my nephew's Sunday School. His father's marion struggle with faith, presented in his short days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an overwhelming movie needs more! The ridiculous, with a special effect, the continuous draggy representation, makes for a weird production. Who is this movie? I was not annoyed by seeing the version of Harlin, but at least they explicitly tried to supply some types of vicarral thrills. <br /> <br /> Exorcist series is quite strange. The first film was fantastic, but each signal was obsolete and uninterrupted. Why do they keep them ready? I think Schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. But why would we go?
