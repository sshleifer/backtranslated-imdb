"Again, we have a movie that packs 20 minutes of entertainment - the band sometimes includes funny songs - in the 90-minute package." Anyone older to remember, it's along with the first "Bill and Ted" without storyline lines. Think of Jack Black Guying for about 20 minutes if the movie is stupid enough, think about it and it sells its point of view. If you really love listening to Tennesses D because of their musical skills, then waste yourself and buy a soundtrack. Do not waste your time with this though. If you are looking for a good bad movie filled with a smile, you're still folding the wrong tree. No matter the strength of your shoots, you still have left instead you want to be popped into Grandma's Boy.
