I do not know how accurately Flint picture pictures are in this film, but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen as a fiction. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and in the page you think how he came from a scene later - you did not give the minimum information required to maintain some consistency and understand its current situation, and other characters' purposes behind Flin and some of its behaviors It's hard to understand. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> I said, /> <br /> Any character that comes to the surface of Flin and character, is a characteristic liar, joke, thief, robber, murderer, heroic fighter, gigolo and spirits, who do anything and Someone can take action to further their dreams, and since these, great opportunities are only available Miracle <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is not entertaining or satisfying in any way, and is not historically correct by all accounts, why also see it? Rub the salt into the wound, the DVD was the worst transfer I ever seen, it was not even Wide Screen or Dolby 5.1, it was wobble in awesome telescope and many more artworks have been collected dust and scratches anywhere that look like a film relie.
