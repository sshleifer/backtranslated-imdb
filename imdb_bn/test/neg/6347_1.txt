One of the worst movies I've ever seen is one. Absolutely ridiculous The story is bad. Animation is completely child and isolated. They are delighted to know how much of the Hologam's physics is wrong. OMG, I even believe that this picture has Disney label. Ish The actress is a bit beautiful, but there are many good movies with wonderful actresses that are so valuable to look at this. Final comment, bad film Do not bother to see it. If you are looking for movies to meet your kids, consider other alternatives like Nightly, Slow Incorporated or an Enchanted Story (Theater). Seriously
