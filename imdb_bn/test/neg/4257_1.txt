Good cinematography, good acting good direction ... can not justify a story and it is not acceptable to any society. Amitabh has often used the media to be able to sell this junk - if such an incident happens ... then what? If I want to ask him if something happens to your child or your grandson (daughter girl), what would you do? I think every parent should take special care before contacting your 60-year-old neighbor. These types of movies should be banned and discouraged otherwise you should be motivated in more frustrating cases. Such works are famous and punished villains in film. The story should be moral and should not be done by their work or their glory.
