Everything except the true story of Phoolan Devi is in this movie. Directors Shekhar Kapur's claims are that the film has created the whole film without completing Phoolan Devi together, whose life is considered to be based on this movie! Interference with the idea of ​​the story when meeting with the woman in the mutation! This film destroys the opportunity of sensitizing the society of the plight of the lower caste women in Indian society and portrays Phoolan Devi as a woman angry, whose sole motive is revenge. No wonder, this movie of Shehera Kapoor was successful in the West because it provided them with non-bollywood taste!
