As a continuous non-stop of the top explosive melody, this film is one of the worst action flickers ever produced, and absolutely incredible. The speed is continuously fever-thrown, and all actions and actors are gripped by total hysteria. It's totally unfamiliar, and a stain - no, a bloke - everyone involved in the carrier. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is impossible to take settings and events even remotely seriously. I can rate this cruelty only 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see deep impact, sensitive and thoroughly stimulated stimulation. Not everything is Armageddon.
