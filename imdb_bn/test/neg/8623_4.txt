George Sluijer's own - higher - restoration of the film is a waste of time all the time. Even why was it trying? Catherine Sutherland starred Jeff Herrmin, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, whose screen contains a small amount of time) was abducted from a service station in Barney Casinos (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney has been portrayed as someone who would not believe in one month of Sunday - he's like Frankenstein's Monroe, but without the sympathy, the bridge's acting is totally awkward. Interesting new love spells his character with the help of Rita Baker (Nancy Trevis) when Satherland comes a little more. <br /> <br /> This version of 'Vanishing' has a clear need of filling a big problem with Hollywood viewers to avoid the obscene ending of the original film. Here the end is compelling and incredible, which is happy, and the story is completely destroyed. However, this time it has been harmed, as Jeff Bridge makes a bad smile to the bad guys.
