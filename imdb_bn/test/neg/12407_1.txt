Disclaimer: During my initiative in foreign movies, I have taken the views of different types of films that have expanded various trends for nominations for some of the nominations, performances, drama, comedy, and romance. In this way, I enjoyed the psychic, popcorn fun of dramatic, critical tone and action films. With a wide array of Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies under my belt, I'm confident of acknowledging the bright spots in the film for being appreciative and complementary. Unfortunately, there is nothing to know about the time ashes. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To get started, this overrated swords epic show the most notorious "Slideshow" verb summary, which is a very cheap and unfortunate action dance form. One has to easily show a series of pictures of the living face, the sword, the legs and / or arms, and then the dead body. Bravissimo! You now have a verb sequence for the time ashes. The problem is not just by its poor quality, but the view is so chaotic and controversial that there is no idea that the audience has no idea. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this movie is irrelevant, it tells viewers that they love someone or are actually developing and instead of showing anything on the screen, hate anyone, which makes all characters generic and colorless, to the viewer Completely indifferent. Indeed, the story itself introduces the character of a very catastrophic character, very quickly through many plot devices. Plot complexity can be used very conveniently (ie, a story of two sisters) in movies, but the ashes of the time period become exploitative trash when it is not as easy as a simple plot for any good reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this entire film works like a series of smokycrackers to fill its deficits. Horrible action is covered by danceography "Slideshow" technique and chaotic camera movement. Evolving character is covered by letters characterized by how they are feeling. And an incredible story is confused by the viewer confused by the confusion. <br /> <br /> If this was not bad enough then this movie was very annoying, it seemed like more than 150 minutes instead of 95. <BR> <br /> Ratings = Given a very low 0/5 star.
