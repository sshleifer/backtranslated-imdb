I read all the plays of Shakespeare, saw most of their production and even played and managed some. I do not think Shakespeare's "traditional" fashion should definitely work, but I hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Nudity is invalid and unnecessary. Shakespeare's intention is far away from what I believe. Some of the conversations are unknown, and those elements, like songs and dances, do not add any meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with the director's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I buy this movie DVD to waste perfectly well means
