Even for the unpredictable love of the first two movies of franchisees and for the role of Max, I remove any biased prejudice, I will not only be able to make waste of this cartoon space <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br> The passion of director George Millar for franchise This awesome score coincides with the movie's cartoon, it seems that the creators do not know what this third [and gratitude] is to do with cash money for installments. Of course the stents are {clear} to be expected, and must be able to draw a barbaric desert landscape by quoting from what Miller did before. Yet, he has definitely staged this idea with new ideas because the general glory of the petrol tanker has been copied here, instead of using only the train !! <br /> <br /> It's just a very poor show that looks like an aspiring rotation of the mid-1980s; But now when it is seen together with three movies, when Thunderdome was caught just in the mix of comedy and imaginative action, its director was disappointed and lost his director. And the fact is that in relation to this order, any slants did not work alone. I give the movie 3/10 for the continuation of a true Thunderdome War, although Stunt men deserve a very low credit here. But for the third time I have tried to like this picture, and undoubtedly as glutton I punished, I will not try again.
