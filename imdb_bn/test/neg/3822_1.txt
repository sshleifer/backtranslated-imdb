Only in the first 5 minutes of opening a horror film that contain Robert England (Freddy Kruger!), He will be killed with suspicion only after the assassination. <br /> <br /> As Tony Todd (Kandiman!) is a swimsuit guide (his James Earle Jones's voice is hysterical by way of Impress, I did not know he was trying to be funny but I had to smile at it). Sadly, his role was more than 5 minutes long. More reason for doubt and quite accurately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (A K.A. Harmony of Bufi and Angel, I saw him going to see him but he got half naked!), Marcus Token Black Guy (Another Movie) Comedy is playing the role that is not really needed in horror films until it is considered a fool. <br /> <br /> The man who shot Gonzo with Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother and goddess stomach) and Greg) Shapiro, two beautiful girls, When they take "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", then two lead men's letters meet some other people and keep shining and leave the boat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not come back from hitting the farm by the axis!) Once the old guy is attacked, despite his gun tension and a very clear shot, it takes more than 30 minutes to actually start a shot at a guy who is hacking an old man apart from another. Is he a fool 29 seconds long! Not really one in terms of plot (I'm sorry, as a plot, not sorted, sorry) and pacing is really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Manage tour guide slice? Once Mistri left for himself to look for Ben. I said to myself, it was only after I was dead (I was fine but you can not see it). <br /> <br /> Movie Maker? Do not waste gasoline by burning the rain, okay? Idiot! Evidently Marcus was dead after two close friends in the graveyard, and Ben was hit by a spike on the leg but he found a boat after the Victor was imposed on the speaker. <br /> <br /> Some invisible water, she is trying to save her, she suddenly pulled into Viktor's boat and cried out and the movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> Yes, all right. There is no source of Ben's death (he seems to be missing an arm), and there is no source for Marybeth to survive and what has happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible ending and it's no doubt that my verbal attack film maker was removed from the review last. So much for the freedom of speech, Ah?
