After eating and after digesting "Human Poke Chop", I was forced and forced to tell the potential audience that this product is no silence and low nutritional value. <br /> <br /> The nature of this movie, the following will be more careful than a review. This is for the first time that I want to have the button "i-d-to-to-rate-in-movie" - imdb, because the only reaction to this annoying piece of trash is stacy and indifference. Every possible rating will be unjustified for all other items listed here, however, "10" does not answer any questions, "1" may refer to some readers, in a case where "it is so bad that it's really bad and that's the cave!" "5" is unhappy too, people may think that it's okay and if it is not good then if you want to get some lean fun ... it's not God, it's not even a "10", a sho Does not mean a 5, it is nothing but a black hole, an Embry acquired by an effective job. I bought 3 DVDs in this region, which bought at least and cheap photo quality (7 rupees !!!), I purchased it mainly because of positive and committed reviews posted under my own entry. Oh boy, I was exposed. This movie is neither frustrating, nor despicable nor inefficient ... nor is it ridiculous, it does not feel too serious to be frustrated, but it is still not serious enough to be a comic. A really unpassionate, amateur effort. The only sequence of military dismasturization is that when two glazing thugs put ugly dogs in a bag and bamboo against a brick wall ... but such a cruel courtyard only executes poor executions. The following image of Tilett Scene is unrealistic and non-filmless, without any idea, for suffering or humiliation - look like Marche-Melo pictured! At the end of a 85-minute lounang, there is a slaughter scene where three men (three sets of DVDs set up in the front cover), equipped with three plastic renotacates, begin to settle the female body. I am reminded of "American Psycho" and "Shelve Grove", now worth seeing for these flickers and for the true masterpieces. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> zhi ren rou tea shao bao "(Human Poker Chops) It came from 1992 and has no reason - I'm compared to Henry: Portrait of Serial Killer. In the same year, the same movie "Raven Toff Do Fu Song" ("MySeI In Secret", a different film crew called "MySeI in Secret") tells the same story, it is a competing production type. It is available as a Region 3 DVD and is regarded as the most "Peng Shi Ji Tsang Jin Tian Liang". I can add a few more words on special effects ... any special effects ?! ... ... have some cut off essays, they seem terrible - in the wrong sense - perhaps "made in Hong Kong". <Br> <br /> I hope that it can be helpful to share this information with you ... make your meal happy!
