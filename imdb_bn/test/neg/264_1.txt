Oh, when the film came out, critics panned themselves for praising their son-in-law Paul Screder (taxi driver's author). They never saw the qualities I've seen in this movie, so to see if I have seen it again. Mishima is very selfish. It is a chilly, unreleased film that a writer works in living / chilly-free culture. Flat responses do not hold your attention because they are emotionally irrational and radioactive. And the rest are just horrified ... soldiers sing songs about manhood, they pledge themselves, itching for purity, praise of the sword, etc. <br /> <br /> It must definitely win you are learning that you landed Philip Glass; But then you have to get him something. The glasses score does not give a whit a difference from its other work, or it does not provide any available value available in the film. Any effect or effect in 2010 (Caret, Autofocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Harst, American Gigolo) should be clear to anyone by snatching his career on the job. He can cut pieces into pieces and kill the speed of any other movie. Schrader lousy, has made a resume full of amateur movies.
