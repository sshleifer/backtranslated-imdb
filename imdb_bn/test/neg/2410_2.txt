I do not really know what to expect from "future killings", but I'm sure it will be even better than me. I knew the ratings were bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but careful the illustration of the DVD cover exceeded the cool and I could not prevent that. For a very long (very long, indeed) time, this image raises the impression of an unauthorized series with fans of long, obscene and obnoxious fraternity. Five mega-darcs, one of them is similar to a proper young clone of Jim Carry, who may want to be strictly a member of a broken house but their final initiation may be just a bit dumb far-fetched and dangerous. They are excluded with the outbreak of a fierce gang war with provocative marks drawing on their faces from the city center. It does not take much time before encountering Splatters, it is a half-man and half-machine warrior, who leads a gang that I have never been able to find out who or what was. Did they have a government exam? Cyborgs? Imagine the Terminator from a Remote future? Anybody thinking "Future-kills" is a spoofed amateur spot, which comes with a scene other than any other logical connection or description. The plot encourages the vital elements of classical classics of great films such as "Warriors", "Escapes from New York" and "The Terminator", but the final result is a great science-fi monstrosity. Clothing and special effects are quite unfortunate and inexpensive and void nudity to load a truck. Acting is terrible, but I want to blame the cast members instead of crushing conversations. Despite the very cold DVD-cover art, to avoid all costs. Resist it!
