Dreadful "Beverly Hillsbill" is the perfect Double Bail for this equally violent, Lam Brained comedy, "Sona in law". The daughter Rebecca goes to the wild California to be admitted to the college, only to be attacked by lifestyle. 'Resident Advisor' "Crawl" helps him sit, and soon two good friends are there. Beck decides to increase the "crawl" vaccine for Thanksgiving, apparently with the result of "fish outside the water" <br /> <br /> The only other comic angle is Steve Rush (The Perfect Creator) here is a sex. This is he bludgeons with us, but no benefit. Both ridiculous aspects frustrantly fail and you know that when the film "hires" the crab "Harvester" composite and the Gem pays his name in the field, the film is growing. <br /> <br /> The film gets dramatically smaller, and misfiring personal consultation from "crawls". Among them Paulie Shore and Karla Gagino lead some smiles, but some other, although the rest are only sheets. The problem is almost impossible to choose "crawl", and you can think of yourself why Rebecca wants to spend a moment with her. However, if you are a fan of the intelligent comedy then "gold in law" is properly identified. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - TV.
