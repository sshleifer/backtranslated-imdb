*** This comment may have spoilers *** Alert: These are spoilers I have some beautiful hair films on my day. And since I can see about 80 films a year, standing there to watch. I want to say that in 80 movies I saw in the theater, maybe 5 is really good, 15 or 20 are not cool, 40 or 50 is OK, and then 5 or 10 is terrible. Here in the world itself one section falls. This is one of the most anticipated, harsh, disgusting movies I have ever seen. It is loaded with unlikely characters, after school-specific types of things and there are enough lungs that can create an old look like young and American beauty. And I'm not being unfair. This is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rich man, a poor girl, a poor man and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all the people in his city. Are you still warm and unclear? Let me continue. One day, the rich graduate town enters the city with his new graduation and his father is bought for him and he insults the diner's pretty daughter, often with his long boyfriend, and then he surrounds him and destroys a little. The diner that he works. So he is sentenced to a summer in a small summer where he and the lover have to fix the diner together. This work does not allow us to see Chris Klein with a shirt so we can understand why the diner girl falls for her. She has abs !!! Oh and he's rich! And .... He is the biggest quarrel with no respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is not a rebel that is a rebel !! He is impure to everyone in the city, he does not want to be friends with anyone who is trying to make him better and he works like a wealthy brat. But Laily Somoski still falls for her. There is no reason for why he does so, he just does. Oh, forgive me, okay I forgot to mention that he liked the same poet. Well if it is not wet, I do not know what will happen. Here are some of the expected moments in the world that I have ever hid in the film. To get some popcorn, there was a point reading the graffiti on the bathroom wall leaving the theater and I said, what was going to happen in the next 10 minutes was right for my motherhood. After my return, she just smiled and said, I was okay, even when I said that there will be a dance scene. And yet, the disease that he suddenly contracted to cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient has died slowly? They lose weight, lose their hair, their brain starts to rotate. This is not a beautiful picture. Sobieski glows after pregnancy like cancer she is pregnant. What humiliation of people who have seen love have died from this disease gradually. And how do you deal with falling in the field of knee cancer? <br /> <br /> Now I have realized that I have seen many movies and it causes my terrorism to run very often but it is ridiculous. This image or Chris Klein was not a matter of choice. He is a jolt, he is unpleasant and he once tried to make peace with someone around him. This is not just a bad movie here in the world, it's a irresponsible one. It has got 4.2 on the IMDB voting chart, and it is very high. It's embarrassing for screen writing and anyone who has given them such green light, they do not lose their jobs, but they do not have to promise to take a step closer to a script. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and that's being generous. This film should show in the film school how to write and not manage a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really want to do something and your preferences are cleaning a farm full of cow feeding or seeing it, clean the film, beef meat. It will smell well and you will feel like you did something good with your two hours.
