It was funny that this movie was so bad! For a while I thought I was seeing a parody of bad movies (a la "for your consideration"). At last the "Cliffhanger" scene was smile until my heart hit. The script was horrible enough, but Shan Young's dreadful performance - especially when he explains the full details (complete with flashbacks) during hanging a complete blind - it really worth the value to show a bad movie! Actually the fake shot reminds me of an Ed Wood movie in this scene. I still can not believe how this thing is made. First of all, how can a bad script get green light? How do the star actors get connected? Did they have low points in their careers? Question, question.
