Although this film is gradually slow, dream-like, almost speed of memory and an interesting, although perhaps it is not quite perfect, but the criminal investigation practices and practices of the staff of the rural French Constabulary, I can conclude, it is impossible to recommend it. I think this movie is simply a set piece for a person's progress - director, a guess - hate with satire. Of course, human sexuality can be the moment of their rebellion in all its forms, do not deny! But to properly spend this kind of selection, this film works in every celebration, offering a distorted sensitivity at workplace. In short, if you sympathize with homo-romance, look at the masked and herxemeselic lovemaking illustration and female form in a disgusting and depressed light - this film is for you. I did not, and it was not.
