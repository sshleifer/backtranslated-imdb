I agree that this movie I've seen is not the best, but I was the real dose brother of the actors portrayed by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. As an actor, he was a wonderful singer. Based on their famous split, the film played a good role in the part of professional actors. Many films made during this time frame enjoyed the popularity of the big bands. For most of the time, movies were not good because musicians are not acting with actors. Most of the movies did not see the audience Tommy or Jimmy Dorsi playing; They went for the plot and music. I was not the most of Dorsi's fan ever, but today the music is good. <br /> <br /> I will comment on the previous post about mom and pop dorses acting actor and their accent will be considered highly by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sarah Allgood were originally Irish actors, both of whom were born in Dublin. Mrs. Shields is Smith Man and Miss Algude Rev. As a playboy Mrs. Mahahan can remember as cheap as a dozen.
