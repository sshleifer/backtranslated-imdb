Yes, it's a pure trash. It can be interesting for people who prefer an experimental movie for me (like me), see low lows and do nothing for about two hours, but when you realize that you've actually paid for it, it's very painful. Most likely, this is one of the entire movies, which you love to see completely naked and regardless. A few decades ago, I have accepted it for its shock value, decades before the trainings and PL fiction.
