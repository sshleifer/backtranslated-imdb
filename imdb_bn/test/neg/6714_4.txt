"The Foreigner" is a story of foreign conspiracy with Sigal in the center as a deep cover operator, everyone has a package that wants to get it. Movie maps (fire fights, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts etc) and many more stories that boast, reluctant and full flawless fillers Looking to see more like Seagal, a pig's strap, what seems to be functional and gratuitous, these immersive flick expressionsless and annoying by the manders when exposed to no power of performance. Wherever "The Glimmer Man" or "Down Under Fire" Sigal Flix dives a nose and the continuity of that trend is "foreign". Nothing is seen except the deadly Sigal devotees. (C)
