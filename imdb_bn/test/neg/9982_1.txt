As a semi-film buff, I heard this infamous movie long ago. I have heard that it was originally about $ 15 million in the worst case of Roman Emperor Caligula, which was done with hard-core pornography. Was it what hit me that it was an obscene movie, but it was the great Thespian like Peter O'Toole, John Gilgood, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren !!? A week ago I saw a documentary about the history channel of Caligula and the film returned to my head and finally my curiosity became the best, I hired the DVD in a stupid way and saw it more foolishly. <br /> <br /> In the first 30 minutes I was looking at sex acts and especially the violence that would earn an NC-17 according to today's standards. A person who had stopped the track of urinary tract was really needed to have a view and then wine should be in it and his stomach should be spent with the sword (in all graphic details). And a scene where a guy gets his D *** cut and feed dogs (again very graphic detail) .... and scratches these surfaces. For those who like this picture, the argument seems to be that this is the only film that portrays pagan Rome and its many images. Actually, this film is actually what it is, merely absorption. From beginning to end you see nothing but endless pain, and persecution and every kind of violence and strange behavior is imaginable (Sodomery, rape, nicophilia, it has never stopped). There is no insight on Kaligula itself, which inspires him to be crazy, his fierce childhood, which makes him an adult as an adult. This is not a historical movie, it's stale. Even the obscenity of this movie has become frustrating, and when I was not gagging I was simply impossible to bored. After the end of time I was depressed, did not feel much like eating and this film makes it impossible, it could actually stop sexuality. <br /> <br /> When these great actors thought what they thought was in this. Pornography was portrayed after the main shooting was completed (I explain how much of this screen is a shopping quality and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors know what they were getting. At the right opening it is called "Pentas Magazine and Bob Guccien Presentation". And the famous actors are actually repulsive in the scene and themselves in that scene to take part. Apparently, director Tintro Bras wanted his name to be completely removed in the whole film, such as the scriptwriter (of all the people). Even John Gilgood and Peter Otto were begging people when they were not open at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Movie quality is terrible to spend this money. Everything is underlined and pink, as the film was released before it was swim in a swim and when you see enough scenes that are actually in focus. The word is heavily dubbed, most of the music is weird and performing God horror. <br /> <br /> However, I brought this movie on my own. My suggestion ... do not look at this, do not look at it, do not look at it ...... tomorrow night I'm going to see something light ... like dead!
