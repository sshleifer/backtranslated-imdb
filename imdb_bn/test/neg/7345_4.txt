This story is about a man in the business of lack of faith soon, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is looking at a case where another priest suspects murder. The priest denies him guilty, but at the same time he can not discuss the matter for privacy reasons. Write Daniel Clemens who starts playing on the forehead ... <br /> <br /> Although this plot is not ridiculous, everything else. Let's start with visual, cinematography soft, it shows more like a TV-series than a movie. Camera angles are annoying, in fact, there is not a single memorable camera angle in the whole movie. The publisher of the details has no interesting closeups. And scene transfers, well, there's not much to say about them, they are not all smooth, there seems to be no connection in the scene than the actual plot. All right, they used a transformation with two scenes in music, but there was no attractive visual transformation in the movie, scene time was dissolved, there was no visible connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The visual part can be forgiven if the annoying film will give something else. Unfortunately the film only played compulsory wood with no punch and offered prejudice dialogue. The film is suffering from audio problems, the term has been reduced several times in the movie, such as microphones are too far away. <br /> <br /> I did not predict the film's solution. It could be because the movie never gave me a chance or it could be because of the presentation, which was so annoying I never tried to find it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
