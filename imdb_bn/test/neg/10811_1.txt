When I walk to this "film" (walk) that was how I was. I could not leave because it was a movie festival and the movie was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trap <br /> <br /> The small part of the original photo tries to bind the movie and most of the bad acting is satisfied with the big screen. The girl stood out in a bad sense - a stand-out performance. <br /> <br /> Thag cinematography was a terrible, diverse framing and I saw some strange light. <br /> <br /> For stock footage ... First good ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this picture? Why do I accept its existence? Please do not see it. Make some useful with two hours of your life and some paint dry up.
