What a frustrating movie. A small southern city is flowing with the possibility of exploring the hidden possibilities under interactive relationships and complex underlabs of the underlabs, which is already known to have read anything by a cursor McClellar. This is not anyone. Instead, the author cutesy twinkles, settled for cheap warm fuzzies and snake melodrama. The thing looks like a TV to create and it was directed without any special difference, but it is hard to imagine what anyone can do to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect though, this cast has many capable and attractive actors, they try most to make the best of everything and what can it do - well, there is no other word for this - drill . A tragic waste of talent, especially great stocked channing.
