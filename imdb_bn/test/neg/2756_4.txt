I saw the MST 3K version of this movie and it is a bad film - but it's not as bad as the low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the film has some production value and it is apparently an appropriate editor (in contrast to real horror movies). The initial problem of this movie was not an interesting character. The main character, Marav, is so much fun, that he really asks about all his bad things. And she is not too smart, or she will be figured out to stay away from the conniving girl Betty. And more than Marav, his father, who is drunk, is nothing but drunk. Although the highlight of the film is at the end of the hayst sequence, it is very poorly executed, but there is absolutely no need to add any excitement to the film. At least this movie is made for a very funny MST3K episode, like Mike and 'Boats It's a great job to make it fun.
