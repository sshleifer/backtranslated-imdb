Yes, this film has a girl named Jessica, which is all evil and also gives birth on the trees to humans (well she only causes the fall of the tree, but she says everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents people to the room but offers something else on the way to entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil man. Eventually, they do not know this thing until the owner of the farm opens the box on the head. The head can do whatever he can find and use his power to find objects in search of his body. This movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays a very bad game here. Everyone in this flashlight will get your nerve at least once.
