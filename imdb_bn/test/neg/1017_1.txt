Director and actress Fabio Barto received a peculiar academy nominee for his last film and Catrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto is one of the worst movies of all time. His adaptation of the novel Reiaci Doos is ridiculous. Think of me how poorer Brazilians speak fishermen in perfect English? They do in the picture. There is not a screenplay, it's a beautiful place, and very long video clips with many erotic scenes with Moskovis and Hanstridge.
