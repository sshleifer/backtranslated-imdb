Rita Hayworth Rusty played a Brooklyn nightclub dancer, who specializes in reviving the cheesecake chorus; He led the national fashion magazine to run himself in Dhaka, but due to the success of his upcoming success with lonely (including romantic offers), he bit the gene kelly. Technicolor Cotton candy's tired pieces, amazing musical sketches (two of which are the most irrepressible flashbacks in the 1890s), Howeir portrays his own grandmother). Kelly, as always, works well with dance but false sincerity; When he is serious, he is helpless, and the rest of the time he is flying over the adrenaline. The scripts do not provide a good line to a lead, supporter Phil Silver and Eve Arden. * **** to 1/2
