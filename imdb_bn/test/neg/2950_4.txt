First seen 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dry-Leon Leonard): Fair Adventure Movie based on the novel by writer Mormick Dick Fame, Herman Melville. The captain of a ship in this movie who stole eyes from God's sculpture of a native tribe (which was very rare black pearl) and kept it hidden somewhere that only knew before leaving Tiv. He became very ill and was on a secret trip to return to the island for the rescue of pearls, others (like his daughter) thought he was treating the local pharmacist again. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip - returning to God's eyes. The stupid part is that the pearls were very close to the statue, and at this time the natives played their clans in the eyes of their God (due to all their problems). Alongside the path, we are treated with the nature of a small water against the nature of an octopus (for some reason) with a local octopus war (I think Herman Melville knows everything about this). Once they go to the island, the captain dies, but his daughter leaves pearl somewhere, but he also receives the curse of illness. One of the bad people found that God is where and the girl guarantees to go there and steal behind her release, but at this time good boys find out what is happening and the war takes place. I will not tell you the war or the end result, if you want to find out I'll leave it. As I said earlier, the film was right, but the effect of a few silly things that I have already mentioned has been reduced. I wonder if you got a bit of new "Pirates of the Caribbean" - hmm ?? Black pearl, a damn (I wonder ??) Well, it does not matter, those components are not for a very good movie in this field or another. It seems that they will learn that they are text, but as soon as I am converted into money in that new movie, I am not sure. Well good
