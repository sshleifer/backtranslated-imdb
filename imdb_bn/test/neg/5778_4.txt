(There are Spoilers) This Slasher film with the generalization of God and God taking Sutterille almost the story around God moved out of the deserted city. After receiving a letter map and gold nugget from his brother Jared, Shadracht Smith, Cleier and her husband, Nick Brampton, Carey Bradak and Shane Hines, four friends and surgical gold-propellers Alex and Tori, Steve Weststelle and go to the village together. Sangie, and Headen and Rox Anne, Rick Majeske and Elina grab their claim. It was later found that Jered had misunderstood a long forgotten gold mine, who revived the infamous Jeremiah Stone, the Vernon Wells revival, and resumed the reign of his terror with him. Stone, or 49er, about the most ridicules slasher / killer in the history of motion pictures. It seems like the stone was buried in coal for several years. Almost the entire cast local servant Annie Nellie (Karen Black), who was also a victim of Stone's Eve (Alexandra Ford) Stone, is still telling the survivors that if they do not return on the gold back, they will return to the dungeon mines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the filmmakers did not show their true fear. In one scene when he ran away all the people of Annie Nellie's house, instead of fleeing, the ghost forced the mine to lose his right hand; Stone spent the rest of the movie with his "stamp" attached to a mining's film. <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, the film "Miners Mascasser" also recognizes the famous actor John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and the Old Man Priekard. Passable Stuff But there is nothing special about the film which is burning in the fire with a full gold mine. The audience gives an indication by the "Minor Genocide" makers that the end of this stupid atrocity is nowhere near and the possible answer can very well be revived in the near future, God helps all of us!
