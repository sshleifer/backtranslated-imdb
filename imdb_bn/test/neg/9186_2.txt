"Wagon's East" was a big disappointment for me. But the most tragic thing in this movie is that it turned the role of John Caddy's last film (he died before the shooting ended). There are some smiles all over this western bird, and a comedy that does not cut it. If you want to see an insulting mistake of western films, the answer is clear. Mel Brooks' classic "See Saddles Burning". Or if you want to see candy on better ingredients, see "Summer Rent", "Spaceball" or "Uncle Buck" (only a few names). These three movies (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor is about us. Unfortunately, "Wagons Eastern" is not. What a shame! <br /> * * (four out)
