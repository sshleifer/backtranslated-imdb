There is no reason to see this image. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons First up, acting is awful. Very rarely a line that is not wrong - but it is surprisingly surprising, that the actors have to face congratulations on the annoyance, stupidity, and repetition of the conversation. It is widely written. One of the most annoying things about scripts is that the authors only tell a way to talk to their characters after a certain point and repeat the most important words in their previous line of characters. <br /> </ br> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In these movies you usually know what bad people are and what they are after. (All the best guys usually stop bad guys.) "I'll rule the Universe with X in my Xperia X!" A good "Mahahahah!" I'm the one in the first step of a cheap SF plot) But in this turkey? - You tell me <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> I understand that our "Heroes" is a group of deadly murderers of the past who have been sent to the funy dozen type missions. They were sent by a fascist unity state to stop them. The rise of unanimousness in the new history, and a war that killed 30 billion people and does not leave the earth a dead planet (We know this because before the start of the program many screen-related The situation is reporting, what you are saying and what it is. This is a hint that producers It seems that their target audience will be, as it is described and displayed on the screen - just a lot to read to prevent viewers from imposing their brain tax.) So we are supposed to be rooting for here? I think we love our heroes during the load shedding For peace, and understanding, I have convinced me to believe in a few ways to travel - but this is one Does not work as a pressure, because we have shown that he is a decent (God) man <br /> <br /> I think the makers are aiming to go somewhat deeper than the normal complexity in this film but they will ultimately have an average shit A few dozen or more of the films are incomplete mess with the holes and logical inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The first credits were beautiful.
