The term "annoying" is often thrown when referring to how bad a low-budget horror movie might be, or not. I have seen many B movies. Many terrible, horriblely inactive B-movies. Some hundred bucks have something to do with production value. Dishonesty, lazy acting, bad continuity, and embarrassing budget really makes a movie undesirable? There will be no way to doubt yes. Perhaps most of the matrices are huge fans. Well, I hate big budget movies, so I do not say. Bad sometimes can be fun (blood-frick), sometimes even mind-blowing (troll2), but annoying will always be unwanted ... Hey, like blood-stained kids, which reminds me, I'm writing a review for this pillar Ah, yes, anyway. It is one of the many British British director Andy Millington's sleeping options. This one is based on Swine Tod ... Great Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages it "Butcher". Hey, it's pretty funny, I said ... sorry, I'm getting confused. It's not that easy. Second thought, I will make it easy. No gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlike, annoying people being innate conversations. That's the bloody Butcher. Oh yeah, and kill a sailor, and something else about meat pies or something else. I do not know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For some more efficacy from Andy Millington, I have seen only one, The Rats are coming, Waywolves is here Yes, you heard me. But how do we forget this Milligan people together, and go to the camp with a sick girl or a tinkeeper. Whatever you decide, blood chestnuts are probably more than any other version of this lazy story. And that, B-movie fans, really saying something. 2/10
