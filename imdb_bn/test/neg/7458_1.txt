Everything about this movie is bad. Everything Harmful 80's Haircuts Wicked mustaches. Wicked action and battle scenes where you can actually see that even the opponents do not hit each other. Bad, Bad, Bad 80's Music Frequent views by people A bad guy with a silver plastic arm and silly hair. Stupid dialogue The acting is nonexistant. Everything looks pretty cheap This movie even exits "9 from the External Plan" and its stupendous poorness. <br /> <br /> This is not "funny", it's very bad.
