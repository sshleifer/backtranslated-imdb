I did not review anything here for a while, but because of the tragedy of entertainment from this garbage, my thinking had to be taken forward. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Unfortunately, this is not true, since the movie started suddenly, a ridiculous shootout, which was so poor, I thought it was a habit, and two half, otherwise known as blue chatting boys beside school. </ br> <br /> One of these statues was Daniel Beldwin, who did not just act in it, but actually carried out the trash and his brothers could not work differently for Toffee. He did not have his own here, because every of his trained chips were involved in the school. Thankfully, for me, I only saw one hour of this masterpiece, as the DVD would not work, and perhaps it was produced by the same fool who produced it. So if you do not have anything to do, then paint the paint dry, but it's a boring look and it's ideal to get rid of an unwanted guest.
