If there was an EPA for the film, then this movie would get their most sincere approval. If we all reuse our "staff" in this degree, we will never refrain from any work. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie when I saw Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace. At least Lukas did not reuse his old footage. <br /> <br /> This is a ugly. But it's a pretty ugly. Stunning in spots (when I liked the baby said "rock stone"). And, if you like blasts (even recycled ones) you will get your admission. <br /> <br /> Actually, for a clear "no budget" movie, it makes it fairly well. The acting is weak, but there is a small character here and there. The story is predictable, but will lead you in any way. <br /> <br /> This is such a "everyone pursues children", which will probably appeal to most young viewers. I gave 2 of these 10. <br /> <br /> I've digged my old VHS copy of this photo. I do not think it's a DVD.
