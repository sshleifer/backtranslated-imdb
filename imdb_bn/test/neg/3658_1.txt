This "movie" will give me a nightmare, I will wake up in sweat and cry out, "I did not make this picture, please do not blame me!" I honestly think it was more entertaining to see a fatty person feeding cow's meat at the base of his mother for one or two hours rather than seeing this bad guard. I realized that the money was tight but they thought that they did not put it in any thought, plot or effort. This film requires a warning: "For the love of God, please do not pay the local GC to the theater section." In another note it is the most short character I ever seen, and I have seen movies with Hitler in them. So take my advice till the end, when you think of renting it, pop up a few hundred adolescents and let it sleep.
