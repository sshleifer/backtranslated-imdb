The horror films are a big fan and always manage to handle some of the pictures well, but this film does not hold my interest or attention. After the death of his wife a few years ago, this story surrounds a father and his daughter and a girlfriend. These people have faced a terrible situation in their closed city, and all senior citizens of this city are involved in this massacre and almost kill them. This picture reminds me of a movie called "Colonel's Child" because it really involves children who are being presented to the devil and his terrorists A lot of screaming, a quarrel and a toy tank that completely destroyed the entire family of puppets that killed their station wagons and dolls.
