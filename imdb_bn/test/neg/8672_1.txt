Please ... if anyone gets the chance to read it before watching the movie, but it can be said, but refrain from it ... Do not waste your time !!!! I had seen this movie after the book was completed and was very disappointed ... the main character is basically a new made fanny, because he did not show any similarity to any book ... he was so lively and cheerful ... if the author wanted to set it in One thing was that he was very shy, intro character .... please !!!!! The most important part of the story, which is supposed to end in hopes, is not taken into account and the rest are made !!! I think someone can make time to read a little bit of the actual novel or to do nothing just by using time.
