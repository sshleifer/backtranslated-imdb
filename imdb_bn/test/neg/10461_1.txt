I agree with all the comments posted so far: This film was a waste of time and energy for the audience and those who made it. The awesome CGI, the terrible scripts, the stupid plot and hey, Alabama setting but it looks like California. But the worst thing is to have a native American angle on it, which can drag into every stereotype you can think of, mainly the smoker, the fierce fighters, the people talking about the downturn ("do not do this thing!"), The native American pipe thin air Playing etc. It only shows my lack of respect and understanding that I am tearing my hair. Native Americans, with no relatives, were expelled from Windows by this trash. So while closing, I would say this film is a crime for everyone.
