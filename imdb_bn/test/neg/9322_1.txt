Do not make mistakes, I love most of the movies in Paul Screeder, so I was very excited to be presenting Paris's French cinema on "Rolling Thunder" screening on December 17, 2004. The wonderful movie was Exxistist, and for this most people were there (I was also). When the film ends, the score ends, so p. Shadow's King of Return of the Return of the References and I have forgotten any movie (Conn??). Since, that was finalized without the movie. Some happy people (probably 200) said to write about the film on the Internet or in the magazine because it poses a risk to the selection of the film festival of cancer. Then came the film, then realized that the film can not be selected for the festival due to its quality: In my life, never felt the feeling of irrationality in the audience, because people are smiling simply to be skeptical in misery. I could not believe how low the light sleeper, mixima, blue collar and the affilation writer were. <br /> <br /> Forced to be forced, stupid, black and white moral, awful FXs, worst, sometimes taking Christians from Schrader, even suspenseful, annoying as hell (intended to pun) and all the uncertain! Do not miss some good position but sad-missed or at least the initial hope! In the end, I was 100 times more satisfied with Schlader's writing Rolling Thunder and wish me 2 hours earlier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Billy Crowford Casting, the poor guy does his best job, but where you expect Doing it He is now part of a small club in the wrong cutting mistakes! I got the movie 1/5 because I did not leave the room, but I should have.
