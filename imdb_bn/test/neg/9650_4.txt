This movie is embarrassing, especially Andreas Wajdah is an amateur but not a professional director. But this movie is unable to provide anything you could expect. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm Polish, so I can tell all background stories because I read books. But how can you tell that there is even a battle from this movie - the masses are moving ahead, some soldiers screaming ... Is it really World War II or soldiers on vacation? <br /> <br /> acting and dialogue - poor, sadly poor. Emmusici, D. Santa, M. Komoroska, W. Kovalsky, the actors fit their role, while the rest (Polish) throwing is out of place (most notably M. Ostajewekka, one of the main characters, which is an unfortunate choice). 99% of conversations are not called, they are kept there, there is no problem working with actors and considering the strange thing to say. <br /> <br /> And it leads us to the most frustrating. Problem - you can not feel it. Everything is so dramatic, artificial. There is no real life, there is no sense in it. There are many real footage from WWII and guess that the element is a lot stronger, dramatic, than what it did. <br /> <br /> I can see only one positive despite the historical mistake. (Just like the initials ZRR: it was created for the promotion of 1945, please Polish to polish ZRRS, and now there was ZRR, but there was no ZSRR in 1940!) Fortunately, it was done by the killing of Cetin. Soviet (yes, it is a fact, not some controversial Gossip). Great, two hours for a 5-10 minute view. <br /> <br /> Anyway - time and potential waste. This gravitational tragedy will take place in 1939 (just shown), not declaring war by the Polish authorities against the Soviet Union (sold here!), Soon to keep the army in prisons, live here in harmful conditions (not shown here), hope And the fear comes next (barely shown), and then ... cleansing. Handing over to the Germans - Soviet Polish is destroying the nation, whose goal is to form the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately they have been successful, and the results are still visible for this day.
