I just finished watching this movie and basically it did not waste time with little or no rental reasons. I do not understand where all the positive reviews come from - the animation is incognito and unpaid, the plot does not give any idea from any point of view and it does not have any idea of ​​the trick or mystery trying to pass it off as a playful and suspenseful film itself. I have never read the book so I can not say that the film was not trustworthy, but like most movie adaptations, it is very difficult to crack as much information as possible in a short period of time. The result is a misleading and unreasonable story that does not really allow you to understand or relate the letters, or indeed, some things. Overall, I was completely isolated from letters and at the point where I could not care about what happened to them, and the only way that this animation can be considered beautiful is if your normal quality animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
