I wanted to love this picture very badly ... I really did. But it was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and was fascinated by the story. Actually it remains one of my favorite books all the time. In an impressive and emotional sense, there was a profound depth in comparison to this film. It has been cared about you characters In contrast to the completely poor characterization of the young girl in the film, it draws a complete picture on the phoebe. <br /> <br /> While showing her promising and some * commitment to her growing career, Jordan Brewster was so flat and empty that there were scripts in this performance. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was both a physical and logistically, a terrible choice for Wolf's role. What a weird looking couple The Wolf was more of a dark brooding character, and more physically alluring, like he was in the book. What's more, the chemistry between two actors was painfully bound. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, deserves highly appreciated for its performance. He took an unlikely medieval script and gave life to his character, a real spirit. She is simply superb and treat her carefully as a hippie to make her very credible. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-movie section, this is an awesome translation, almost as bad as the message of Kevin Castner with Bottle. But I did not start it ... <br /> <br /> I am not very strict in my criticism, but I was so disappointed here, because I really cared about the story and wanted to see it all right. Do not give it ... <br /> <br />
