Super-Man Dean Kahn played the super thief's Highest Hooper Hoopper. He can steal any company for a break and for the right price. Unfortunately his latest theory has made him upstairs, among which someone has set a fire to hide his own efforts to steal the product. Now the thief considers everyone in the building as a rescue worker. Unfortunately other thieves are still building and FBI. And CIA Waiting for Max outside <br /> <br /> The picture is very portable. Dean Kain has done a lot with a funny actor and more advanced ingredients but here he is saddled with a weak script and beautiful poor side.
