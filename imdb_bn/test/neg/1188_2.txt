As a huge fan of the three TV series, I would like to know that Lozi is going to the big screen. In my early moments, I was skeptical about the possible success of the concept, and the authors would be able to maintain higher intelligence, jokes and horrors that reveal the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately my fears were not unclear, and the film was a big disappointment. I struggle to understand other comments on this site. Obviously people are entitled to get their opinions, but the people I have seen with it all agree with me, and they are big fans like me. <br /> <br /> There is lack of acting fidelity, but they are very good even when not at their best, they are still extremely watchable. The main problem was plots - and scripts. There were a few smiles, but not enough, hatred is just a few moments, but not enough. The worst feeling was to feel empty when walking outside the movie. So very rarely I felt so foolish by a film and so it is unsupported to discuss with others. <br /> <br /> I write this league as a warning to other league fans - it's going to see a wide range of opinions before this movie. If you love the league then you can firmly believe that they have not completely hated their movements in the film. If you can not convince yourself about this, you are one of the most obvious talent in your mind which illustrates the example of a TV series. <br /> <br /> Lozi in the movie? More like logs (Or little brown fish).
