This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It is difficult to follow what is happening because a letter does not give much sense in any sense. Some major disasters happen every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "verb" sequences are all interesting. The film is a two-hour "throwing" scene associated with scenes sharing common actors only. This movie does not have enough amount of humor as a good "bad" film.
