"Love and the human residue" is clearly written, clearly acting, one of the clearly staged flicks, which is so obvious that its excitement and exemption from fabrication is beyond me. Not worthy of explanation, this amateur flick tries to cram every unusual sexual preilction in a film with every clever line, absence of concern for each misanthropic overtone, piece fits. In short, sensationalistic pain without sensation ... which leaves quite a lot of nothing just nuts.
