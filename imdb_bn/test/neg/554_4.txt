I'm really sad that I made the first bad review for this movie ever ... I could stand watching this movie, and the movies I saw were the second movie. .. a downgrade. First open water, there was no point at all. There is no mention of Daniel in the next Karate Kid (please make me wrong, please.), And the last line came as a shock. It was, "should fight ... win." Then the birds were flying around the bird and the pans playing the flute, and I oh, was good. All right, so this next part will take some time. And then turn off the credit screen. <br /> <br /> GeeZ MAN !! Hopefully, I do not have to be reviewed again in a bad movie, I'm sorry for those of you who love the next Karate, I really am ...
