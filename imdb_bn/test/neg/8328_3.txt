"Tragic Hero" is a movie that is mostly trying to imitate classic godfather movies, which focuses on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. Also, it is part of the two part series as The Godfather (still). However, this film does not come near the level of those classic movies, and in fact, other triad thrillers in Meliassa have bad associations than the liberation war. <br /> <br /> One reason played. Except for the exception of Chou Yun Fat, the acting is usually top and unbelievable. The actors seem to have fun because of actors' inability to easily maintain any seriousness. As a result, we have not found this movie really emotionally or intensively because we do not particularly care about what is happening to these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is its lack of focus. The narrative tries to include various story elements in the film, but it lacks the realization of parts of the film and any real feeling of coresence. The viewers who are watching the work sometimes get lost in the audience, can not know what the motivation of character is. <br /> <br /> The gunfight is going on in the final result of the movie, but again we do not take care of the characters, we do not care who or who dies; This scene is losing its intensity and mystery. The set of other pieces of work is hypocritical instead of nature, it is very controlled instead of being freely flowing. This is not strictly recommended for average film and general movies. Visitors ... Only the hard-core style enthusiasts and fans of Chu Yun Fat should be considered for viewing this movie.
