I seem to have been a minority in this, but I think it's a true story of scholarship, narrow and generally unpleasant. Acting was not bad at all, but the characters seem to be a little more than the capitalist (bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he is not unreasonably bad, maybe a resolution may end.) Of course, I liked the movie I was with, so maybe you would like it. But I do not.
