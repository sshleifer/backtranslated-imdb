Movies like this give a bad name to the independent movie! This is simply an annoying set of vingettes, with no formation. I would not be surprised if the script is completely throwing stones. If you want to see a good stoner comedy then see "half baked". This is not a prize winner, but at least it made me laugh. The film was probably made in a micro budget. Each view is either in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location. The writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, but I ignored the budget of the film (as in the case of Edward Burns films), but obviously this is not the case in this case. <br /> <br /> I said, "From bronze tail" to Robert Denarro, "There is nothing worse than anything lost in the world on talent." Cast everyone is talented. Louis Wilson, Alicia Wight, Britain Murphy, Jeremy Siesto - all talented actors! And they all have a lot of good movies. The actors pay all of them, but they can not go far enough with such a lam script. The only scene in Jack Black's cameo was interesting, where he sang a song about being in the jungle. And of course, at the beginning was a short strip club scene, which I think is interesting. <br /> <br /> The characters are deprecated and the story rarely exists. Many movies horror, but at least you understand their motive. What was the purpose of "Bonwatter"? The world will never know <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
