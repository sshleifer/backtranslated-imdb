It seems to be going somewhere, it quickly moves the original characters into extraordinary stupid three-ring circus, which permanently destroy any stability of the letter. I'm a huge collector of stoner movies, but this is one thing I will not consider a valid addition. Bong Water trash from the deepest area of ​​Dumpster, and I will not be caught dead on this with my style. I'm pretty sure this movie was created by a partnership for drug free americans. If you are a Jack Black fan, then I would say that you can think of 5 minute movies right because Jack has inherited his singing for the Black Readings. I could not really say enough bad things about this movie.
