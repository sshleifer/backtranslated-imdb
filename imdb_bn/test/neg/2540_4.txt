Among the films of the 1930s, Jimmy Ciney's film was Warner Brothers / First National, but not in the small studio. Because it was a "poverty line" studio, your production costs are less than what you can use to watch with Cagan films. Plus, the plot I saw is the weird one. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good man in this case - the fight for the law. It's not all unusual because Cagney often plays legal - like an OSS leader (ancestor of CIA), a FBI agent. But, it was really impossible to make him an investigator for the Weight and Measurement Bureau - in particular, sometimes, he did the same thing as the movie G-Men! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, The word was terrible and scratchy and the prints looked very white and there were a lot of swollen film and gaps.
