I saw this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well established, I think. What was this movie? Night? Season? Players? What? It was everywhere all the time. There was no pressure on this (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to throw a curse and throw things) but an actor Brian Denhey came to give up melancholy rage and to give an outrageous excitement. Cheap shots like McGivier's episode. Compare this Thanksgiving main course with Hobbs, to show how Donkey Cinemas "In America Only" sports biopsics, worts and how to do all. Notice that ESPN has proclaimed Hell outside and then it was not shown again?
