The movie is an adaptation of a Japanese story by respected writer Yuko Mishima. It does not easily translate Brits and Americans into a believable story. <br /> <br /> The story is going on slowly, especially in the part where Miles and Christopheran are separated and the director is admitted with a clipped shot. Shipwaves cut through the waves, and fill the small route line on the map, when their letters are heard on overvise. The film has become so weak that I've fast-forwarded in sex and masturbation scenes, although long, although it is not really passionate or lover. During the film, during the extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles, the wife later divorced him after Kristoferson when the film became notorious. I think they enjoyed sex scenes, but it's not the same for the viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters here. Unlike the frustrated widow of the sexes, the little children are despicable. Kristofferson is tragic enough, but although he does not have the skills to bring a lot of roles, we probably do not want to get involved very much with him, considering his extreme fate. <br /> <br /> For a little child, after the death of his father he falls down with a bad guy, and they help him to do something bad against a person who enters his mother's life. Now it's a really bad crowd. They just do not smoke in the store and smoke, nosireebib. They slip a micky into a cat and divide it. This gory detail is shown. But of course, this practice only so they can do the same thing Kristofferson <br /> <br /> So the movie comes mostly slowly, relates to any characters, and when something happens it is uninterrupted morbid. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie you see in the end is about to end. <br /> <br /> If you can retain the Japanese and cultural context, then all this can be understood. It stands, it's just unreal. <br /> <br />
