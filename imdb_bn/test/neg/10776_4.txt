I seem to disagree with many people here. But I did not really find this movie as incognito because I have claimed the reviews I have read. It was not a suspicious story and the background of the partition provided the opportunity for an epic. However, the movie was a disappointment. Especially for Neon who saw 'Godre'. Despite the lead led by Sunny Deol and unwanted songs, I must say that the two of the gad well are good. The story is virtually the same. The partition can create a depth of its character, as well as the scenes that were supposed to have any effect. Seeing the Christian Crookes pronouncement and the little picture, which was not easy work in itself. Characters do not seem just too real. Not that I'm criticized acting by leadership. It just did not work. The atmosphere was well painted, but the cinema really lacked the substance. I'm not going to die the hard Rambo fan, but saw some action cod movies, or saw some character development. It all seemed like a washer to finish. And the last only added to the audience's dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> nonetheles, I certainly had a good effort in it at least strangers. And if u do not see Gadar, you even feel like it.
