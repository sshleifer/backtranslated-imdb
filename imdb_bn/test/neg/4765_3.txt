Bob Clampett's 'Hip Cats' is a remarkable one for the cartoon that is actually the first color lone tune (actually Lonnie tunes were black and white when Mary Melodie was in color). A singer, a dance cats' attempts to try a dog to catch a lady and a cat, the most clamate short cuts in 'hip cats' have a lack of trademark strength and speed. To be fair, Clampett is not a great deal to work with. Warren Foster's scripts are slimly scratched with gold and other cartoons, the clampet does not handle it with 'hip cats'. This is often the clampet that you can not make any other cartoon mistake and it is usually true but 'hip cats' is an exception. Clampett has a flashing talent, such as a chat scene that cat dogs ask off "Hey, you're following me". When the dog is sure that the cat is simply "oh" and hurriedly hurried. Unfortunately, the show has such brightness here. Those who point out, 'hip cats' are a bitter disappointment. We have closed all day and this was clearly one of Clampett's!
