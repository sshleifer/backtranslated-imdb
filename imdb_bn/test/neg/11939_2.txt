I'm not going to waste my time with deeper analysis, I just want to say that Catherine Zeta-Jones has made a mistake in playing the lead role of this foolless bokchandra, the tragic pain of the film's absol There is no reason to try to find out the positive aspects of this movie, because it is totally poor, and the most tragic thing is that Jet-Jones has been dragged into the clich√©s so disrespectfully that there is no scope for it, even 1% of its talent is being shown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
