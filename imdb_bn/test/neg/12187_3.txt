After all the promotion, I heard about Jane Austen's novels and the various versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the movie itself. I was expecting a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all, I publish my review about my older movies, especially mysteries and plays, but like female-based movies. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit at the top, but in this era films it is very common. June was as well as Allison Joe but I found out every sister to find the cat and run the structure. There was no surprise or overly dramatic moments. I hate to write negative reviews, but the movie left me too cold. It has always been my intention to read books, but after that it seems impossible. The storyline of the only warmth was the old gentleman and the younger sister, which is otherwise a very bright spot of experience of frustrating viewing. Again this movie has others to love, I am not just one of them.
