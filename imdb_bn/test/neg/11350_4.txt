Start a Chinese gang attack and the other gang wipes out at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the winning family was killed in the proponent process. Strangely, and for a clear reason, the gang urges a volunteer to blame genocide and leave it until the police decides to stop the investigation. Now how is a man responsible for 50 deaths outside me, so sending this person seems silly, but that is the plot Later, when this guy comes home, betrayal and scamming happened - about one hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop killing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a lot of things for China's martial arts, then you'll probably skip this movie, it's really not a non-stop action and is not really about the development of a plot or character - even compared to other martial arts movies. . I will assume that 80-90% of film battle scenes - an endless and rationally created battle scene using a knife. Again and again, the scene of war! If you want a movie that is counting on a body that may fall in hundreds of chains, pushing people, kicking and tearing, this is a film for you. At the end of this problem, there was no one left to die and the film really lost my interest !! It's not deep, but if you just want to see excitement and action, then this picture is for you! <br /> <br /> However, this movie is set in contemporary times, and no one is ultimately thinking of shooting the hero. And, when they finally make a logical thing, it is too late and the effort is really really hair! Such logical flaws and lady's suicide (why ???) makes it a "Close Your Brain" movie genre.
