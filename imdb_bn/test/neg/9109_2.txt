** May be spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Finish this movie with one word: Bad. Two words? Really bad. Why do I think now? Let me tell you the details. <br/> <br /> Gutenberg leads a special-ops group, of which four people have been employed to recover a deadly virus after the abductor was stolen from a lab. They do this by attacking the air force in the middle and after some battles the virus is back again. However, Gutenberg is suspected of having a terrorist because his name knew him. After the debate of the party members, unknown persons attacked and everyone doubted that everyone was involved. After the decision, they can not rely on their boss, they steal the virus again and try to find potential attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory it is a plot that can work in a low budget movie that aims to promote only TV. However, the plot was compromised and destroyed in different accounts of the movie. Firstly, the plot is completely predetermined and it's not fun to tell how the film will end after three minutes. Secondly. Acting is really bad, or the actress is instructed to act as Dummy. There are many emotions, changes in facial expressions, etc. I was particularly disappointed in Gutenberg that I can believe that much more can be done, but the failure to become a fairly action-hero is completely failing. In addition, although I am not an expert on this matter in any way, I fully believe that I can pick up five strangers and prepare them for a week to form a good secret-ups team. Stupid and unexpectedly things seem to be a theme in movies as soon as possible. Go for these good guys, bad guys and as well as for the sake. Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants of the film, if any. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen on my hand and I did not break quickly. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to end this fact, but tell me that this film is an anticipated plot, has bad acting and they seem to be amateurs whatever. Sorry, can not be any better than that. Do not watch this movie, it's not funny it's funny. 2/10
