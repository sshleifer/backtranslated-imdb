For the 1983 Stefan King book it was a bumper year, made it on the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone, and Kujo were released within a few months of each other. While choosing the fa√ßade of Dead Zone, both Christine and Kuujo were quite bad and it is a close thing that is less than two. If I push for the answer, then I will say the least - the least - the weakest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Doon Trenton Hugh-Kelly) Hanging by a thread. She has had an affair with a local worker, and is now living on her whether she is leaving her husband or not. The young Thad Trenton (Danny Pinto), the son of Donna and Vik, dragged into the marital heart, and a beautiful dirty-kid with long lasting phobia, which often leads to serious panic attacks. Donna and Tad go to a nearby mechanical 'yard for repairing the car to repair the car, but as they reach a suspension of their car splutters. When they discovered that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) was not there, the discovery became worse (it was brutally killed by his pet dog), a large St. Bernard that was recently bred and infected. A rabbit bat. ) Soon, the dogs are stuck in their car and trying to get inside the car to scrape two reckless hunters. The weather is swelteringly hot; The living soul does not know they are there; The car will not start; And the dogs seriously ask their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cuzo can be a genuinely thrilling thriller, but it does not really click on the gear. I read the book and it is quite frustrating - of course for the King - so it is very amazing that the movie version is so low. On the printed page, the king was able to produce at least breathtaking levels, but the film has been threatened by critics that St. Bernard is not only very scary. The "visual" of the film medium continues to be a reminder that Kuujo St. Bernard In the book, it was possible to forget. In the book, Kujo sometimes guesses the rumor of a monster. Even with less than a half-hour running time, Kujo is a tired and patient-boring experience, sometimes unaware of funny and certainly not as suspicious as he is. They even finished the book cruelly endlessly and replaced it with the conclusion that "all good is finished" so that the audience can go home in a pleasant mood !!! The wheel below this one as another inferior king adaptation.
