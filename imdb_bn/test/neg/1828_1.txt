Anatomie was a German-made movie and subtitles. It was too much and boring. If it was supposed to be a horror movie, it had unfortunately failed for me. The actors are looking more like they wanted somewhere else by climbing them. The film work was okay but we should have given more attention to the terrible Ballet scripts. I have not given anything to watch the video and I still feel cheated. Read a book and save your money.
