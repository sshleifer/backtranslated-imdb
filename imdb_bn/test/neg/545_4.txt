Attractive Apollo's basic story idea is wonderful - two very unhappy women decide to collect their funds for one month to rent Italian Villas. To defray costs, they come along with two strangers. This holiday makes both relationships interesting before and before - especially, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their viewpoint. Unfortunately, this good idea is completely destroyed by two important performance, which destroys this movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in this photo, which makes him feel ridiculous. His "Do-Aid" expression and empty straits really surprise you if it is not a zombie movie or he can be just a fool! And to make it worse, Reginald Owen has played a character that is so objectionable and bombardy that I was very close to closing the film - he was terrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one critic gave this movie a 10 - which is very hard to understand. Sure, this movie has a nice environment and a good plot, but these two strange stupid acting can not be ignored to reduce the rest of the film. Sorry, but this image was hurt for rebuilding!
