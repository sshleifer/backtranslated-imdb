This is one of the weird things on TV. It is known as the Leatherbridge, which is said to be a weirdly underwater Midlands gorgeous, which seems to be the lowest place in the country. There is no visible worker or client, there is no student university, no criminal police station, and doctors have surgery in comparison to patients. The lines of the story are horrific - each episode revolves around a wonderful medical problem that works by various types of braise extras that can never work and for some reason the doctors always resolve their problems and travel around the house. Its pure comedy is extremely entertaining for the price, but I can not believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. He was crazy.
