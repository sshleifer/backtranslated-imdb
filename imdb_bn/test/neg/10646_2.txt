XXII century merchant name (Bruce Rams) commanders is a space station, which he personally designed. It can be predicted that a special force is sent to bring back the expensive station and keep the merchant in custody.

During the interrogation, he revealed that he must end, which he started or otherwise he would be immersed in the blood. He was reminded of his heritage to satisfy his detained officers, the box and why he was here Why is the place ... <br /> <br /> The helireser was originally the same movie, which was fast as a Hilandar. Some will be ignored and forgotten, so it will not affect many of the heliers.
