This film earns for writing 3 lounies, poor technical capabilities and continuity issues. Some people gave this movie 10 - and maybe it's okay if you score it for its fun factor. However, technically it is an idle movie serial from start to finish, produced by three-rate authors, actors and crew. This was true of almost all cereals because it was specially used as entertainment for children's goals. And there's nothing wrong with it, but "high art" is not it !! The spy smas gets less score than the average score compared to other serials because it is even less consistent with its consistency - even for serials. A "cliff hanger" was common for the serial - for example, a moment at the end of the episode that seems to have killed a good person, but if the next episode survives miraculously, then it survives. But, in this film, it's much hokier and ridiculous. You will literally see the hero die in the last episode, but later, they shot the scene again and in reality he did not die (though they obviously saw him buying the farm in the last one)! Spinner Smith seems to have died again and again, but in the next phase, he shows from one angle and he can avoid death in any way - even if he falls in the 1500 feet of the river, it can not be bogged down. <Br /> <br /> This movie is not for its quality, but for a good smile or learn what was going on in the film on Saturday morning decades ago.
