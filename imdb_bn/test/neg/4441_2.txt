The previous review was quite a lot on the goal, which was not this image of Altman. I did not see it after its original release, but I have never been sad like this theater because I spent two hours feeling the theater. If some boring community tried to use a scientific-version of the movie Theater Engmer Bergman, it could be closed like this. I might not let myself give Altman a "1" something, but perhaps it was a career nadir which was something extraordinary high and low. I went out, but I could not have been paid as a critically acclaimed film. (The next time you think that movie critics would jealous.)
