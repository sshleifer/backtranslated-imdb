After sitting through the trainer of the first Dark Harvest film, I could not live alone enough. I had to increase the level of my pain when I saw a sign (or rather I was believed as a seagull). It should have been a good thing without having any relation with the Dark Harvest. We were not afraid of any of these killers, instead we were walking around a chicken, for example, "girls!" And "Can you hear me?" sometimes. Plus we got two (four if you included two girls, the director wanted the same effect as the pair of The Shining), the overwhelming little girls who can not work. And there will be cherry jewel cop on this mess. I was supposed to know this movie is going to be terrible when the dog got a opening credit. How can I watch this movie, I never know
