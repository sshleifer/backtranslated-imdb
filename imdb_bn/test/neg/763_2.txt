A scientifically engineered super dog who was considered as a reply to Petite Criminal, was a kiss to CHOMPS. <br /> <br /> I was ever sitting in Champs, or was walking or running. Or run, then walk, then sit ... and then again go back and stretch, and then walk, and then K-tail to hit the Dutch mess. And sometimes it was all the answer to Daily Jumbo. But most of them are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> I'm saying: In the Celebrity Death match, Champs Beaglesworth could not be taken out.
