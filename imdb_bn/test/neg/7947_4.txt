I'm sure these guys will love a lot. The only woman shown to be a "ball" (unfortunately hungry) is shown, talking, and like a man, the other two women are portrayed as sex objects with one thing in their mind-gender / sex. Their sole character and skills (Iris) in gender - or those little little princess who are freaked out as those immunity they negate any energy and professional authority (Doc) before all hell breaks out. Only the power of Iris finally resulted in some consultation results from a strong strong man. In addition to my negative intestinal reaction as a feminist, I have to offer a camera work - and Ethan Huq is very cool in the very first scene. After that, his performance loses vapor. The empty entertainment for a brain wants to take it easy. At least the film avoids the good / bad duality of the criminal mind.
