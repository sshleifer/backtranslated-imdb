There are some holes in this movie's "plot" through which you can run a huge truck, but I think that it is not always the first priority for horror. Two elderly sisters of rural England have been sitting in their brothers home for more than 30 years. Now, he escaped and started a killing incident focusing on a close militant nearby. 'We think we were good only for them' are they repeating? Amazingly ?? All the army officers love this woman and do not doubt their sincerity, even though their five died. I do not know what the mysterious mystery is? Or tiring! In this case, this picture reminds me of 'arsenic and old lace'. Among the black comedy classics, two half-mad brothers and sisters are also the mother of their stupid younger brother, but they kill there. The old women of 'The Bust In The Cellar' are not as crazy though. 'Horror' is very amateur and cheaper in this first 70 movie, but there are some good attempts to create excitement. Good Ol 'is a lot more' old-woman 'about the day, though and it's rarely something you find in a horror movie with such an interesting title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by the classic film buff, is one of the sisters playing. He gave the Queen of England a picture of the legendary Iral Flin Sassbalker film, Sage Hawk.
