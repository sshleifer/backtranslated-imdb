It looks like "screaming" in the movie "Skinner List." Tarantino and Weinstein will be considered more carefully before giving their product names. Green light is a POS. Like this, regardless of involvement in friendship, just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to keep away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any work. A vanity project that goes to the south "Hell Ride" usually allows chefs to chew the good artists ... At least when the camera is not focused on the bishops' weak efforts to steal every scene. (Which is almost every scene!) The final three words in my "Hell Ride" include Stink, Stank, Stuttgart.
