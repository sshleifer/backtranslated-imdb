This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it - acting, direction, script, cinematography - awesome Alien (a man in Sparky suit) claims from a nearby universe; One author called "galaxy" but did not get annoyed to get the dictionary to check his terms. A good title for the film "It came from Plot of Plot Contrivances". The plot is too much silly and almost nonexistent. All witchcraft macawfs have been given that support a deadly series of unlicensed restrictions to remove bare plots. No thoughts of passage time are ignored. Now after the next few days, then left! Suddenly, there are only a few hours left for zero hours. Help yourself and miss this movie. You need to stupider yourself to visit it. The finishing is particularly stupid, and someone "Ta-Da !!!!" Was supposed to be accompanied by going! As the scriptwriter pulls just something random out of his butt. I think the real alien plot has got so bad that you can get cancer to watch this movie. If you can laugh for the last 10 minutes ("Enemy of Liberty" - honestly) you can get bored but you'll get annoyed.
