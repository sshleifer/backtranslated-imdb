Platinum and many others born on June 4th call them "left-wing campaign film". Now it's my turn to take a political shot in a movie. To me, this film is very much applicable to some religious beliefs and its political views. <br /> <br /> Acting and writing was somewhat cool like my choice. Mel Gibson likes to play in this illogical fierce film and it proves it to the other with his partner Randall Wallace simultaneously. This garbage prototypical was "All about my family, I love them," or "Tell Roni before praying," hello goes to bed. "This was a lot more loaded with reloaded lines that I felt as if my vomiting Gibson's wife is going to do her laundry and what is to be kept in this "any color" washing machine In the middle of the mid-sixties, he was trapped in a rock that was not visible to racism around him. Another scene is that Gibson's daughter asks him what the war is and the scene is shot on such a trivial matter. <br /> <br / > The direction has shown it perfectly. Countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers' prayers. I'm fine with showing once or twice    কিন্তু কিছুক্ষণ পর আমি ভাবছি সিনেমা যদি আমার মাথায় কিছু ঠেকানোর চেষ্টা করছে। তার শ্রেষ্ঠ ঘন্টা আমেরিকান পতাকা সঙ্গে কত দৃশ্য melodramatic সঙ্গীত উপর গুলি করা হয়। পরিচালক মনে করেন যে আমরা ভিয়েতনামে কিছুটা জিততে পেরেছি। কি ঠিক তাদের জিতেছে। The painting is the worst, visible slow scenes see the American flag in wide spectrum of scenes. I love America but these movies seem to glorify what we do. It may seem like a gem, and perhaps it is, but I can not bear it when a movie which is not religious is not so patriotic that they will agree on the bad things in their country. To me, this movie has limited mind and many aspects are limited. Let me tell it if your Christian is not your fault. I do not think God or Jesus wants to kill people. The movie was objectionable to me. Initially this movie was countless of countless clichés and exaggerated scenes, but then when I was trying to tell or did not say it was really frustrating to see it. I guess it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope someone will not accept this comment aggressively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism, but some narrow psychological people who have both passed this way and have surpassed others. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Even the complete metal jacket was a good illustration I had absolutely hated. I have read a quote in the context that it is said in context that the true patriot government or country does not go with what it does, but when it is wrong, the question is asked. A genuine patriotic country loves to see bad things too.
