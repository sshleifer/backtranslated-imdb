With the use of such "orthopedic projection" (awful soul) outside the body, leading to horrible deaths (moving backwards towards the broken vertebrae and broken limbs) with such power, the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, which is as Karen Black (.. ) With another "unique" character, which is influenced by a commercial director, such as Paul Sharp (Winston Reckart), who is married to her. And tired due to the unfinished career. Actually, he is dying and needs his body, his soul is probably harmful to his wife and son (.. his son's "special friend" who is talking to him in things, even toxic at one point). An Intelligence, Kauffman (John Novak) investigates abnormal homicides about those killed by rogue souls, Paul links uncovers John's death and death through him. Soon both understand that people must stop or they just go to other people's hosts. Paul does not know that his new secretary, Johns Boyik, was both old intellectuals, his intelligent projection documentary known as Wangering Soul. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (my bloody Valentine) has created a strange atmosphere with this movie that is in a rather vicious circle. It seems that Paul's son can look at the soul in the form of "blue man", transforming the child into a vicious behavior. Despite the black, star treatment, rarely stopped taking advantage of her face, which can create the heir of her character's heresy. Instead, he has shot from a distance, his voice is dubbed, and he never establishes himself with the right danger, which I have the opportunity to remember. For some reason, despite the curiosity (.. odd), the concept of strange projection creates the soul to kill the man, sometimes the film never stops. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-Ish" and light (.. and words), while occasionally moody and effective, quite quite annoying. As story mules along the pacing, there is a problem, also. Cast rather rather cruel, especially Rekert lead, its performance is best, uncertain. It does not help that some characters (except Paul's wife), we can be less aware and really what hurts. Paul himself is not the most favorite person in the world. He can be quite difficult and Moody, for his unfulfilled career, such behavior The reason. Black should have been a more prominent figure in the film, but Paul and Kaufman have been in the background most of the time while talking to the dialogue, but rarely they get the chance to have fun with our hegraphics, which is shameful.
