Not a terrible movie - my 10 year old boy likes it, and he must be a target population, so I think they hit the spot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the world was a little odd - unity, duties, and fate. Do I think that word just a bit fascist? Especially luck What about freedom, equality, justice, etc? <br /> <br /> Oh well, it will sell Lego. Dull type for a movie, but is not bad for a 74-minute ad. May be much worse.
