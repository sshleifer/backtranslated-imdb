I was forced to read this sad "love story" in a German 24-year-old POW and a 12-year-old Jew. He has written "political correctness". This type of movie "Spirit" likes to be a horse-free, but the "bad" Americans do not allow it because it is needed. Well the German soldier and his summer book have "bad" good news for Americans. Why !!! The horses where God is given by us and Americans can use good if needed a horse. Likewise, the Germans tried to kill Americans, but this book seems right! Casting is absolutely awful !!!!!!!!!!! She is a Hispanic Hispanic, a white child, and a small sister, "Sheryl Tempel". Acting is very bad, serious part comedy! Conclusion-bad movies, bad books, but both have different finishes, do not read or see one!
