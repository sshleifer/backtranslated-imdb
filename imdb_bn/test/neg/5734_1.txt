In the mid-1970s, my NYC was suitable. The building has finally signed up for the cable TV and the Showtime (instead of HBO) is the only premium channel that offers to show recent movies. A writer of nature and nighttime, I soon discovered that the channel showed the film late in the night and I had never heard it until morning - most of them were American independent films and foreign movies that were never released, a US theater was released. Thanks to many of the celebrated "star" artists and respected directors and showtimes, I first discovered movies (and other showtime customers) and had no chance to see them again. Most of these cinematical mangals were really "dogs" but were often so bad that they were ridiculously ridiculous. One night, the shottime opens a small Italian made Monkey called "RedNeck" (illustrated in 1972, giving limited European versions in 1973). Although the film was never released in the United States, the MPA rating was listed as 'R'. Since the director was Sylvio Narizanano (the director who made his name with the glorious "Girl Girl"), and three Mood Mark ("Oliver") was Lester, Fabio Técio and Teli Savalas, so I decided to try it. And I watched myself nail nail in my TV screen for incredible 89 minutes. I remember that Savalas and test star acted two criminals, a former mad dog, who, in a stomach-chicken scene, slid his trailer under a cliff, sent a German family to their death, thereby falling into the desert below. So far, so bad. Then, outside of nowhere, testi ("excellent" as a psycho) and Lester (in the film's making of 14) can be seen, both nude, in the male's house, sneaking kidnapping test when the kid peeks over the body, and closes the naked butt of poor test. ! The whole film was distraught by me (and, when I thought in the '70's ​​early in the year) as an astonishing member of the film industry and a card-bearing liberal (I have been against today's censorship). Anything seen in the movie 'Muktir Yuga' - it has an untitled version of Alman's "The Cold Day in the Park", it is pruned for an 'R' rating till a real jaw-dropper and spell out Altman's career to finish She did not bring anything like "M * A * S * H"), I still wonder if anyone other than me ever saw "Redneck" and I was shocked. Filmmakers and movie-based listeners are being hijacked by the defective filmmakers sincerely since the beginning. But a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester), when he started to start a difficult deal from an adult adult actor (and I'm sure his film offers have been frustrating like "Redneck") ... Mr. Narizzano, You should be hanging on your head of shame. (Incidentally, soon I will come to friendship with the actors, in the future of the narrative Appeared to the desired effort, they despised both.
