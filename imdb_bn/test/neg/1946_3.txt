The movie was an interesting surprise. Somewhat psychologically shaking. And the Hollywood film can only end in a ruthless manner to promote homosexuality and / or other sexuality promotions. This could end with a "payoff", but there were other purposes behind the pen. Closing my mouth is slang that mud in your mouth after you've seen the whole movie. Frustrated, "gifted Mr. Ripley". Yes sure, I'm just another puritan. This gay content tarnished the whole film. If I did not positively judge the film for the sake of an artist or entertainer, its only purpose was a political motivational campaign, which is more for it.
