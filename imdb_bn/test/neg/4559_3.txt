Ugghhh !!! It's just like the pre-code that can misread the viewers that movies in this period are frustrating - and they are not - it's just horrible to watch this special movie. Poor because the film tries hard to be "hip" and "adult", it is frustratingly old, dust and hockey which I was smashed in film or asleep !! It's a unique combination, say at least. <br /> <br /> So, why did I hate it so much? Well, this film is incredibly lazy, but there is no style in it and the film is frustrating, but there is a lack of frustration and takes a lot of humorousness to be credible. The film starts with a clinch - the heart of a heart of gold. Dorothy McLeill is a prostitute and she accidentally kills a man! Shortly after her escape, she met an old boyfriend, who strongly advised her to marry (she could not understand her profession). Seeing the natural goodness of this man, he determines to change his life and save the wild life. It is difficult when he hides on a mythical Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for the return of his people, there is nothing to do and the place is trapped with super-horny and totally unexpected men. In reality this part of the movie is so low, that the audience can have a hard time concentrating. Men in the island have been so prevalent in McLeil's presence that they seem to be on the rape stage forever - they might be annoyed because the girl is not the only daughter. Actually, I've been very tired of all this scenario - just a lot of eyes rolling and tongue-joking to think of something other than a bad eye. And looking at all these ugly horns, it was just boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, it gets worse. The man she thought she saw on this little island (what they were?) And she also tried to rape her. However, he will not be dissuaded and he finished shooting for saving his new inventory. When the jury of the island was deported, he went back to the court and in a false accusation - telling him that he wanted to kill him and that he is innocent because he knows that he is imprisoned for his imprisonment of the imprisoned prison prison. road. He has gunned him in prison for capturing himself, he has entered the court and says that it seems to be guilty that he is truly stupid. Why did not he just tell the boggling plan? It seems that he has to admit his killing but to kill someone so that people think you are virgin? Therefore, to avoid minor prison sentences (and, again, the threat of rape), he does not consider telling the court that he is trying to force him into sexual compromise (the jailer has promised to rape him when he is locked up) And, before taking him to the gallows (to avoid rape), boyfriend shows time to send him time and to make a credit roll. <br /> <br /> Lots of impossible situations and coincidences- Coming So often that movie is just stupid. Combining this with all sexual neutrality, it creates a bad and lazy mess of a movie that only appeals to the deadliest fans of pre-coded films. All others, careful, very sticky and silly from the beginning to the beginning!
