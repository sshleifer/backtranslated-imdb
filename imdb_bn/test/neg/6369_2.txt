I recently went to the movie theater to see the new Bridge (2007) edition of Bridge to Terrorism. Later, I went to the library to see again without paying back the old version again. I am definitely disappointed! After I died Leslie found out the old version of "Daddy knows, but I have terrible acting and corny lines along with dummy, including a lot of hurt" inside. It was done terribly and casting was not very good in my opinion. I saw in wonder when they were surprised to wonder that this is it. The story is great but believe that spend the money and see the new version, if you see the old, you will never be able to enjoy the true magic of Tbilisi.
