Mexicans of Texas are located in the small border city of Weilolf Furlh, where Ana (Erica Faye) lives, her best friend, Rosee (Martin Hughes), and a Mexican lover named Miguel (Gabriel Guetierz) who is determined to track an animal that has been terrorized by the city, animals and Some of their friends were killed along with friends. Local Mexican legends are silly, an evil creature from myths and legends. ARM, I'm struggling now because there will not be anything more ... <br /> <br /> Written and operated by Scott Magnis I'm not going to hit Bush here and can easily say that Mexico's Way Weilph is terrible in Texas. The script only mentions the word Wewolf once and the rest of the time is mentioned in the cave, I suspect that it is not really like a waiverfluff flick. 'Verulph' animals are more terrible than most barbarian dogs, and look like dogs, there is no reference to anyone who changes the moon during the full moon, and it actually attacks some events, there is no transformation scene, and ultimately it changes back into anyone Is not killed either. To be honest from the title, there is nothing here to dictate the WeiWolf movie, and even the title is a rope off of the American WayWolf (1981), which is very popular in London. This is the type of home scrap that I personally consider the horror genre being a victim of the murder, Don of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween, 1978) or Friday 13th (1980), which is made in the Shoe String budget It was probably the Blair Witch Project (1999), but in recent years and the Mexican Waywolf of Texas has the chance to be considered completely classical. The character is horrific and something happened around them, the conversation is rubbish, penning is terrible, the story has been damaged and almost sent me to sleep, and the film is completely crap, I am sorry but I do not know <br /> <br /> Director Magnis will do some of these observable There is nothing to do, this kind of annoying hand camera contains type cinematography which can easily cause headache Six and rapid blinking, "and you do not miss the 'Edit in equal measure, which is just fed up and irritates. It's not terrible, there's no nudity, no tension or atmosphere, and special effects are awful. The giant really looks poor and it's no wonder that Magnies put it in shadows or spend it very quickly in its scene, you never see it better. There is virtually no color in the film, it is almost black or rich desert sand orange, which makes it worse in the eyes. Gore has some fake holes (hug and you miss them!), Some bloody wounds and an isolated arm, a big deal. <br /> <br /> I have accepted the budget with an estimated budget of $ 300,000 but I refuse to accept such filthy filmmakers; they have very low budget flickr to reduce their budgets. The whole thing has a movie movie look, it has no styling and its attention and softening. The act gets worse even though you probably already knew it. <br /> <br /> Weinolf of Mexico's Texas probably thinks of hiring / shopping / viewing some people because they mistakenly think that it is a series of John Landes classic paragraphs. It certainly is not, and it's not even a proper wyroof flick. This is not fooled to be fooled and I am disturbed that being made at home like amateur shit / money is lost.
