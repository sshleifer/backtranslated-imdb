I have given a possible 10 out of three. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> /> <br /> Kelly Pope plays Sarah Novak, a young student of the entire college, who has been inspired by a game of disguise, which takes him to the Subway Tunnels under the suburbs - even an armed man will have to go. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many curiosity in this picture - a strange classmate who is apparently making Sir crazy, who is a terrific shopkeeper who runs some of the off-of-the-wall in the wall, seems to be behind a Gatoro In the mud, a brutalist slowly, hanging around the senior store, and a woman named Emily Gray, who returned to prison. <br /> <br /> Sarah's father is managing an Emily Gray's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown 12 year old boy. Emily was kept in a mental hospital for 5 years, and due to some cock she allowed him to come out again, although it is clear that he is still suffering from a hazard. <br /> <br /> The only explanation that Emily has ever given to her is crime: I have never sinned. <br /> <br /> It is all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, do not expect to get a better explanation, because no.
