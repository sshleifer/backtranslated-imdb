This picture may be great, but it's the consolation and joy of the Bill Forces, the whole Rufof. One of the sweetest films I've ever seen before C and J became diabetic. <br /> <br /> If you like it, all right, but understand that everything in this movie is a direct rip off. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can often recommend anything by Forsyth - Local Hero, Gregorian Girl, The Sync Failing. I rented something good tonight. There is a young local Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he left some really crappy Hollywood films after making treatment. Sad
