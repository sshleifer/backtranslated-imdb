Imagine a exploitative remix of Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Place the story on some Caribbean islands where drug dealers have come up with rules and revolutions. And the black woman has become stoic from the hagi beer women and the white woman has become a water heart and you have got black mama, white mama. <br /> <br /> In the terrible day of the drive-in theater this item must have had a big old hit. Seventh all the hot buttons are pushing this one. Although both of them fill their clothes better and receive few holes from the audience's men, no one can forget Palm Grey and Margaret Markov for Simony Pot√≠rea and Toni Curtis. All right, Hell Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pama prisoner, where guardians and wardens look naturally to new fish. A wealthy girl from Margaret State who has taken 'revolution', although Pam's key female girl is serving local Drugs Kingpin and she is tired and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's fellow revolutionaries were taking women from prison to town on their bus, but they escaped. Both of them have different agendas, but like Sid and Tony they are not agreeing whose agenda comes first. Police, drug dealers, and revolutionaries are looking for these two obsolete disciplined friends for some interesting periods. <br /> <br /> You do not have any misconceptions about the head of the revolutionaries. Markwood's Canadian partner's name is Ernesto Filippino actor Jaldi Joshornac. The whole mess was shot in the Philippines, who started their own film industry. <br /> <br /> The Philippines has a great location to recommend all the black mamas. But if you're a fan of really bad absorption flicks, it's one for you.
