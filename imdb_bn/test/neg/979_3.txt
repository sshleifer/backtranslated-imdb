I wonder what happened to this movie: people studying at the studios, drinking gin-tonic, perhaps a joint, and one of them thought that if it is wonderful, then find a film that will bridge the gap in generation It was very far like Ariichi Bunker and Mick Zagor. Both college-boy rebels and their parents will be equally attractive - probably due to various reasons, but still ticket tickets. Interested in hippies? Asia, philosophy, peace, and wild set and costume. Are their parents interested? Musical, eye candy, a feeling-good script, and nostalgia. Very well, then, "Lost Hari√±o", the old classic, as a musical, paints. Do not miss it, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon by James Hilton, perhaps less than a classic, but not bad novel. In broad terms, he presented a peaceful society near Sangbi-La, "Valley of Blue Moon", a peaceful society near Tibet, who lived peacefully happy villagers, who served <i> very </ i> chronological beggars in the temple. Each Gilgal island-like plates (such as WWI, an evangelist, etc., an experienced) infiltrated into Heaven - with each their own spin on each situation - what each conspiracy presented with an expression of love to live in heaven, or try to come back to the tumult of thirteenth century . Considering its own terms and conditions, this gentle, pop-light fluff, which represents Hilton's own conservative British outlook in "Oriental", which is known as foreign and fortune cookie. As a respected guest of the monks, the castles are forbidden to leave the Valley, but do not pressure the work or prayer (no monks do more than themselves), treat them politically, and provide easy, luxurious accommodation - which I want to escape? In this Middle American world of heaven, monks are both civilized and knowledgeable, climate warm, food is abundant and delicious, villagers do not change beautiful nontenthes and nothing changes. Nuns are pure, but encouraging to look beautiful and even flirtatious (one of the most ridiculous misconceptions of the tantric sex given to me). Even their religion is not atrocity: it has been expressed as one of the best mix of Christianity and Buddhism, but there is little to humiliate any Stunkhish fundamentalist or strange man to know something about Tibet (which was very small number at the beginning of thirty) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was surprising to focus on the entrepreneurial character / character of the capa film; And maybe if Steven Spielberg roams it, it can fly. As the seventh Hollywood producer in the morning, the adventure ended very quickly, and the updated version of the character was very impressive, which impressed a lot. The classic B & D sketch, deprived of the proposed qualities, is similar to a white and pale blue de luxe beauty spa, and at least some beggars dresses tried for historical accuracy, most of the rest of the prisoners seemed to see that in the morning the massage with some holes of golf And the way of the fano bath Perhaps Stefan Sondheim could recover the story of some characters; it was very real clash in response to each character; Only five years later, Brian N.O had a calm atmosphere in one; Instead, Bart Bechach and Hal David were given the task of writing songs, which were matched with tunes like Muzak, which sometimes wrote new era songs. Quite naturally, each song calls for a dance number, which is completely forgotten from completely annoying-to-range, as well as scripts, which do not have the value of one line of quotes. <br /> <br /> This movie was the logo - everything from posters to dog planning to promote this movie, and that's the hello that I actually went out and bought the SANTA album. Almost the only good thing I can say is that after almost 30 years, it has had a great effect on me to write this review completely - in the next month I read at Aldus Huxley, bought a copy of the Baroda Theodol, and so learned about the real Tibetan culture.
