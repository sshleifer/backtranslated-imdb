This is the worst movie I ever seen. The story line is a joke, the effects are not terrible, the sound of cinematography film does not fit, the conversation is chessy, and the actors do well to take rest. People just do not work that way in real life situations. My question is: who will give such funding? <br /> <br /> This movie starts where there is a mine mining failure in the failure to protect them from any mine. Later, we join some of the villagers who wander around their bikes in forests. One guy falls and breaks his legs or something. Firearms come to help them Meanwhile, someone started the fire. Some more bicycle stunts. Blah blah blah <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
