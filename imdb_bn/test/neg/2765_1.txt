The fellow silent fans, do not be deceived, it's a stinker ... badly portrayed, bad acting and nothing here ... There is nothing here to find yet another solid B-movie from Sonata of the 40s and 50s for the film buff. Classic. I tried it based on IMDB's relatively high rating. There is no accounting for taste, but I could not find anything to recommend this movie to other IMDB members. It looks like a movie and it seems that you have been deceived by an x ​​minute minute that it took the movie for its grateful death. Allan lad has almost forgery in the DVD / tape cover, he is less than two minutes in the camera and almost no dialogue! This is not a gun for these people ... this is a classic of the studio's strange feeling without a kid in a budget ... We all make great inquiries ... the Ganges, Inc. To save you time. / Paper bullets ... it's shy!
