The Paranod Park is Alex, the 16-year-old Scatter who caused death by security forces in the face of the threat. In Alex, the film deals with little problems such as the divorce of his parents and sexual intercourse of his girlfriend Jennifer (who is currently seen in Gospel Girl) when he is consumed by crime. I saw an elephant so far from Gus Van Sant, elephants, and I can assure you that he keeps all his behavior while doing this. Again he has exceeded the deadline. Once upon a time, he used to shoot strange techniques like never ending human shots ... maybe you love this filming technique, I do not know if I do not. Plots feel unhappy with me ... It's easy to search for almost a long time. My feeling (similar to elephants) is that Gass Van Sant tries very hard to create an "artistic" film, which reduces the film itself to the substance. Given Neveen was quite bad like Alex, there is a difference in isolated or isolated and like a robot. If you are a fan of Van Saints see it, otherwise avoid it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
