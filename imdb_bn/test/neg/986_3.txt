The best part of this movie in Sicily is the first, I think. Cree Dio shows a good talent for photography and the movie starts appealing to be wonderful. The rest of the story is annoying. Curries persistently focuses on stereotypical situations and letters, trying to disseminate noreelistic consultation and video-music techniques, Fellinian spiritual memories and a very annoying and complete off-sound soundtrack, which leads the whole thing to the last, which is very short for you Cut Actually, it's a real overdated movie and a real overset director of the series.
