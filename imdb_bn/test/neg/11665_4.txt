It was more than a women's romance-soap-suspense movie that I expected ... it's just an exciting thriller. Yes, the suspension was final 20 minutes, but the previous 75 was a little tedious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Note: <br /> <br /> The story is so. I'm not as bad as bad, but I'm sure it will not be seen again, and the film was confusing behind the VHS descriptor.
