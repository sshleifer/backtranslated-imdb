A Haest Film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Lawrence Fishburn ... Great sound on paper? I think, when someone made the green green for the production of this movie, the last product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is neutral, active, and for a movie that only 88 minutes seem tensioned. I could have cut my life and was sure that there was something better than me ... to look somewhere dry in some color? <br /> <br /> I'm a huge fan of Gene Reno, but in the world what was he thinking when he signed this up? There are a lot more action films around ... let's see one of them and forget this movie.
