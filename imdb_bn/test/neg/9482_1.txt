Ok i saw this movie. Someone needs me stick. Why would the Olsen pair insist on world issues for this persecution torture? The Olsen Twin was another movie on a foreign trip, met some cute boys, looked beautiful and everyone dived on them. This aspect, the development of the plot, the acting. I do not know in the United States, but it is considered too stupid to ride a bike that was seen 10 minutes ago in my country. Although I'm sure now that these girls will never learn to work, I really hope that one day we will see a movie, even a little plasebel plot.
