Low-budget sculptor Herschelle Gordon Lewis has reached a new people (even for her), "The Gore Gore Girl", "Film" (Snyder), and has all its technical trademarks: poorly recorded words, poor light and it's gorgeous. It is tolerable, even somewhat charming, if at least one interesting plot ("blood source", in its ridiculous majesty, is a wonderful example) but "girls" total graduation Completely unlikely pompass-ass personal investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Cress) was appointed by the reporter of a newspaper to find out who was killed in an out-of-the-box stripper (you will be convicted that this person long before the case was removed). As before, the appeal is not the plot, the creative method of blood pressure (a girl's fancy is tender with a wooden garment) and the instant skin sparks ... but it is not enough to make the upper material of Tedium above.
