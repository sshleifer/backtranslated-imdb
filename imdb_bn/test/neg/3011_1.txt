One of the VIP keys on the horrible TV shows only that you can see and view this station. These exhibitions are terrible, which are demanding real players to compete against each other (they are contesting each episode) in stupid games where they try to talk to girls, get the number of girls and compete with them. . The judges claim four other people who are experts, but they feel like a huge de-bag like the contestants. The show is not funny and not even interesting, it is simply annoying to see these annoying observers that they are a great player (I talk more about four judges than the competition). The show I saw did not even have anything interesting and the show is definitely rigged. Do you really think they invited these people to the club, to sign their liberation war and to bring them with their tapes while playing the same stupid games? It is not only stupid, it is probably even tape in the daytime. Some people have written about how they knew about someone who was shocked and it was all fake, it is not a fake program and even fun with the actors. One of the worst shows I've ever seen
