This movie was not the best ... but there were some good actors in it. In Washington, Washington was as good as the homeless guy, Guy Terry was as good as his helpless brother, Ice was ridiculous like narcotics and surprisingly ... actress Tamy Roman was good as a movie judge. I do not even know it was her and I'm a mortal hard world fan. He was totally credible. I hope this movie will not stop the development of these actors. I know that Eseiaya has kept this film a long way, with the success of Gray's Anatomy, the success of the NYT Special Unit and Tommy Roman sexual love and secret issues (UPN's new soap opera) have played a repetitive role. I do not feel bad for other actors because bad actors are bad actors.
