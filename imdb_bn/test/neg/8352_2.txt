Comparison of the original series is inevitable. Because of the partnerships of the producers in the 1960s, Diana Rig abandoned the main show, and MacChen probably expressed regret for such a fan - there is no statement about how the show can run otherwise. Linda Thorson was just like a replacement and her episodes still retain the quality and aspects of Rig Magic - there was only a lack of rig / Mccini chemistry. New Avengers should have been left on the roof - Mccini, a boring pandi, and who is this guy Gabt? Also, there was humor and poor - I only saw a couple of episodes, because what I saw was all there, but I think I got the idea. Try it as soon as possible and it is almost impossible to resurrect an old shot as a new format or movie.
