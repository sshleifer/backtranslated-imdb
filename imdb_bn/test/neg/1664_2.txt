Linda Arvidsson (as Jenny) and Harry Sollert (like Frank) are romantic characters while her father Charles Inesley is walking; Damn, he's from the house. Follow the sorter. Discovered, he goes to his balcony and wants to run away from him. Mrs Arvidson convinces, and goes to the pack. Then, the thief George Jievard came to hide the place. Although he did not get much in the way of looting, did Jeevard want to use Arvidson trunk to escape from the police? <br /> <br /> A converged comedy. Note, the balcony shows the scene, the Solter closes the camera, so Goffvard can go home by walking around the house. And, Arvidson travels very light, because nothing is seen in his heavy trunk; Perhaps she just wanted to pull up the Beau Saltter? Director Dr. Griffith, Robert Harron, and Florence Lawrence are extraordinary additions. <br /> <br /> ** A disastrous selection (8/7/08) Griffith ~ George Gevart, Linda Avidson, Harry Sollter
