I agree with many of you that this image was rather annoying and dull. I found the main character and scene that disliking the following actor / actress. The camera work itself was pleasing. Random shots and shaky film scenes make me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make my time in observation of the 1999 campaign and hope that it will be spontaneous with sensitivity and sensitivity; Emma; Being Jen; And Pride and Prejudice I have to watch a few people alongside this movie, but I believe they work in great taste. The music was also outside the film, and this year I saw another show reminding me. It is called a show from hex and bbc. I came across it on Web one night. I liked the first season, but the second season was dry and the thin air thing that should stay with the clouds. I found Henry's main male character in this movie. Perhaps I just do not like his or her trick his way. Well, if I was not going to mute it, I would not recommend this film to anyone and they wanted to stay in the fashion or the house at that time. Again I will look at the 1999 edition and hope it's a good thing and Jane Austen has some judgment in her writing.
