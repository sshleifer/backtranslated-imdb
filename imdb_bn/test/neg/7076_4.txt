I'm working on a video store so I found this free - thank God, I paid for it, my review would be less forgiving. Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (the geeky girl takes bloody revenge) is not all original, "Keri" has many parallelism (except for a practical practical joke in a harmless way, a beautiful girl who is sorry for her , Copper and bad family background). I still think it's a fun idea for trash teen horn fix. Unfortunately, they do not take much advantage of the possibilities they have here, and rather emphasize all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked the actress you played. She looked very good (when she was hot) and her catley lines were fun ("She did not come to call. She ** ** King Patrick!"). <br /> <br /> did not work! The whole wicca thing was silly. I usually like the reasonable explanation (he could plot his whole thing with one of his teachers or boys to take revenge). There were many logical volts and Gore really felt bad (when the boy is cutting his ears and his tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> The whole idea was not bound for Oscar buzz, but I think they Has destroyed the comedic and suspicious powers. It was good but good to good!
