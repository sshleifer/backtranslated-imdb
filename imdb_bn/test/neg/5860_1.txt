Despite the potentially impressive premises, Series 7 is a weak attempt to attack reality television. At the door of its basement production price, there is a painter within 10 minutes, the overall tune of the film is confused. Several critics have attacked filming, but I think the real problem is to make the film a French. This joke is not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it does not go jail with the overall tune of the film. Indeed, manufacturers may actually be more firm or at least more attractive for the actual serial TV-coloring yet open edits, fur hair effects, clearing camera motors. Instead of series 7 deaths and game shows Mandarrs through the already frustrated world. You can just imagine the director slapping himself behind behind for clear statements
