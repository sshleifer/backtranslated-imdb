How does a movie become a biblical epic? Just quoting some letters from the Bible and using some names from the Bible for your character? The only thing in the Bible about this epic was the character's name. Oh, I almost forgot about 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheva. King Weird told his remaining story? It certainly was not from the Bible. It was utter and stupid meaningless. If you want to read about the kingdom of Solomon as King of Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will also come to Adonijah at 1 Kings 1 and 2 nights. Shiva queen (King Solomon, who did not see King Solomon for nearly 20 years or more, which was later after Adonijah and Joab, dead), 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. Solomon's first thing is that his daughter is in solidarity with Pharaoh. Yes <br /> <br /> King Solomon was involved with worshiping false gods and that's why the kingdom was divided after his death, or the temple was destroyed by the temple. Also, I think Solomon was too busy to get married, and 700 women supplied the temple to false deities and forced 300 concubes to fight in Egypt, leaving alone a dead brother. <br /> <br /> I said this movie was unacceptable. If you do not want to use the story in the Bible, then say something else. It can be easily called Romeo and Juliet or Sid and Nancy. <br /> <br />
