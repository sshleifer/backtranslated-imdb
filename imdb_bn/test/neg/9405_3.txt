Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers made me so enthusiastic that I actually went to the weekend, which I never did. I lacked to say I was very frustrated. The story is so highly probable and it is frustrating to be frustrated. I really feel the problem of the movie and Matt McCaughney. First of all, I'm not MM Hacker, I thought that he was awesome in both Fire and Lone Star states. I enjoyed his performance in the movie without seeing him with his shirt off 3-4 times. Yes, we all found that he is a handsome person with a beautiful body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago that he came to this scene in Time to Kill. 3-4 times a pound of iron pumping like a sweat crazy movie is shown to her with her shirt is completely unnecessary. I think one time has been enough. They will not surprise me in the unnecessary scenes of girls and the wives are willing to tag their significant other, no women would like to see a movie about gambling, if not ...... enough for her, let's get her role. I think his performance was very compulsory and he does not seem very comfortable. I was supposed to be this impressive bishop of his character, but his line was corny and greasy. He was referring several times and the misleading lines several times! In short, I did not like his character although I was supposed to. Accent, off his shirt, corny line up, weak sales pitch. His character as Brandon or Jonathan was much more than just a device. Passino and Assange were cool, but that 'no surprise. Fun to see as Piven Arie .... Oops I mean Jerry. I was just too commercial in this movie and weighed together. It is insulting that they can take a great story and throw it on strap material trying to create a box office success. 1. Cool story of the applicant 2. Female hockey for female women Hollywood actors (Make sure there are numerous scenes with weight lifting shirts) 3. Al Pacino 4 great lecture scenes and 25 fantastic ones. Each character has a thousand dollars suit Wear and will be a very dark arrow 4. Jeremy Piven Piven to play the same character in Entourage and Old School 4 4. Armand Assante throws to seal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent welding are unnecessary <br /> <br /> It will be enough for most people, but not me! Anyone agree with me, this is your question. This movie will be even better if: suedberger b as Brandon instead of MD. Directed by de Capri or Ed Norton. <br /> <br /> I'm probably thinking of selling this film and will be part of the minority. During the hugging of the pacino, when I embraced the stomach, I realized that the woman next to me was crying when I realized. This movie will ensure one thing in financial success. The public gets what the public wants, gets coplah of big budget.
