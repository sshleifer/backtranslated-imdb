AVP2 is a terrible movie. The conversation was in vain, the act was unfortunate, it was not really a storyline and you can not really say that it's going for half the time due to consistency flaws and plot holes. <br /> <br /> But! You will love it anyway Because it is beyond the bounds of pride, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They also killed children, strangers and unborn children in this movie. You're sitting there, "Oh my God, it's annoying" and the hunter and the alien who marvels in the hospital, 'the sexy chick who always makes it alive' makes you amazed. Like the film industry, it is said, "We know that we were the first Alien V. Proditar movie we were, so we're doing it again, but this time we get help from psychotherapies with a clear imagination" It is predictable, Neutral and down vain .... But after you see it it will be thought about for some time.
