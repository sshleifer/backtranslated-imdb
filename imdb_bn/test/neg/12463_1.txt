I only thought that I had a good idea to stop this movie early, when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> I gave it a suspicion and waited for it to do better. <br /> <br /> I do not make the same mistake. There is nothing to do with the movie titled <br /> <br />. There is nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. Acting consists of a guy who wants to be a John Cusack, but it can not pull off. A girl trying to lead a lead claire dines Sadly, he could not pull that off. They love, even though God only knows why. And finally I hope they will kill each other, so I can believe that none of these kids will bite the world again.
