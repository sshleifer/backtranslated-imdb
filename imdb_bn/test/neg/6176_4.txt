After the success of The Wrestler's Cyclone (see my review), Mickey Roberts made the video directly in the title "Gem". Every copy was hired for months and I even heard some good buzz around. After several months, I grabbed it on a movie network and sat down to see it. First of all ... one of the movie locations (Walpole Island) is a place I regularly visited as children because we were very close to the reserve. Cool huh? That's about where the coolness ended with these buds I mean, the story is about to play four and even if the side is bad enough, the performance is just awful and some really damaged star power and Mickey $% # * *! Rov has played a native Canadian / American hit man?!? What did they think of the name of the Lord ?? He is not even like a native blood, and his efforts in the generic native accent seem to be more ridiculous to him. They could go anywhere with this story ... they could appoint a local actor, or change Raukek's character, how white people raised by a parent? Instead they created a complete and joke joke in Killshot. <br /> <br /> If you have caught Mickey Rourke "Kill" in Killshot, I use that term timeless. The Oscars won performance was fair enough, although I did not like Rouke much. This shows and I'm sure for my dislike. He is disturbed, he is constantly annoyed and is trying to play his negative role in the humiliating border. He makes a decent cold bloody killer, but then the story is completely behind the story that does not explore its parts. Diane Lane, though well-respected in Hollywood, is capable of doing another perfect performance. He has his moments but overall he usually does not stop the performance of any one. But when he looks like he's going to be great, it's even more frustrating. Thomas Jane plays his talented husband. I always deserve a big career than Jane. I think he's got his blood action star. All said and the Killshot done its performance is not really bad. He did not take things far enough and he is hard and almost heroic in a way. He and Lane have good chemistry but he did not get much in the way of his character. I have no idea why Rosario Dawson did this) and B was a character. Her character was absolutely vain and plots or stories had no point that any point she would give as equal as bad. I rarely see an incredibly supportive character. The only released character and performance in this movie is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been accused of being a tiny killer, who wants to contact Raukek's team with Hit-Man. Gordon-Leviot is really crazy and entertaining and his character is actually involved. If this image was completely about him, it was a ruin. He literally stores this from the curve. Her performance is almost valuable to watch this drivel. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominated director ... who is waiting? Yes Oscar nominated director John Maden (I think football coach could do a better job) Help this mess. I did not actually see Shakespeare in love, but I received it that received critical acclaim and it surprised me because the direction of the film and the characters were very terrible. Screenplay writer Hossein Amini did something that I did not recognize but apparently next Jack Ryan has been nominated for writing the film, and after this mess, why can I wonder why they want him? I understand it based on a novel and I really hope the novel world over this mess. Hit-Man and his partner and a passionate character in the zodiac, and they try their luck. Unfortunately, unless you're a fan of Rourke or love Joseph Gordon-Levitt, there is no reason to keep yourself through this pain. I've experienced it for you and still feel pain. 4/10
