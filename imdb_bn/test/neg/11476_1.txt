Five of the child scouts gathered together after a few years for camping. They had escaped the criminals in this most strange supposed comedy as well as nude their childhood. Most Cast Content does not seem really concerned about phone content and at least movies. The writers were so lazy that the names of characters are mostly in the case of names of actors who play them respectively. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old really fast. Even late great character actor, Brian James can not save this stinker. (Although he did not make himself completely embarrassed in some of the actresses in this movie) I was very relaxed, there were very few things that laugh and even misunderstood. Shocking <br /> <br /> My grade: F.
