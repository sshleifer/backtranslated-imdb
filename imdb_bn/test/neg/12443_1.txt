A mother of my mom brought me this movie. A guy in a rental recommends it. But in fact, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I did not expect much from this film, but it was not a good story, it was not even funny and it was stupid. I was looking forward to seeing Christine Lynch in this movie because I love step by step. Even he had a huge disappointment. The story was completely unreal. A member of the group has died (he is not dead, later he woke up), the house appears to be in a bomb blast and there are 2 people who have 3 hours to manage everything. But then there's a homosexual, the police come ... There is total mess in the end and boys have survived aloud and everything is 15 minutes ??? Come, be at least realistic. Money waste Really ...
