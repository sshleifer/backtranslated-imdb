Otherwise, the whole custom looks like a bunch of amateur The irony is that when watching the movie, the first screen of the film says that all the characters in this movie are fantastic and that there is any match with anyone that is completely coincidental, which is a soft lie because all the relevance is very clear and they are very purposeful. I can not only view the philosophy but for the purpose of separating the beautiful works of philosophy and visiting the visitor's court.
