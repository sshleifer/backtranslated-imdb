A clever overall story / location for a story. Respectful of actions Children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain had a nice change but had been good. "I love you" challenged you more than "Make Me Complete" but at least Van DeMe has a chance to show some tenderness. One of Van Damme's best movies.
