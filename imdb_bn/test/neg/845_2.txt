In 4 words, Captain Carrollley was "fully protected" with Mandolin's book. The novel provided enough character background to understand the characters and individual challenges needed to overcome; Script Writer chose to ignore details. To ignore them (primarily as buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, until the educated by a socialist rebel, the role of the priest on the subject of disability, bomb experts Corelli and finally his dire death counseling), stories and characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I was going through. Attractive cinematography, great actors do not make a film; There are stories.
