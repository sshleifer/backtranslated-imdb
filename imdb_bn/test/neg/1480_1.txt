This is really one of the worst movies of my life. Queen Stigger, who plays as an ornamental grandfather, is expecting Charlie, in a completely impressive mode, that she is more sparkling, her performance is better (cue buzzer word). Rod Steigerer is one of the last legendary films and to see him in this movie (though the last one is the second worst movie I've ever seen) is really frustrating. From the unexpected side to the bad story, it becomes foolish to make it clear that the only reason for the film's production was that the last name of the producer ended in Deluerientes. The only good thing about this movie is that it's very bad, it's really violent. Find out the Flashback scene where the rod is where the superarmer-loud wig and a big black cock smile. He will be released only from his anticipated film, America's creditable film, Uber-Producer Kevin Arbort and will release good taste in everyone's mouth.
