I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and David Zucker was the director. I saw her previous "naked gun" (both parts), aircraft and top secret!, And I liked, at least I had a good time and laughed. I'm not saying that I mentioned the master piece of movie, but was right. I do not remember any other stupid movie than this. How the industry deteriorates the industry, it's incredible. If some studios spend money to create this terrible image, such history does not become more common in this day. This is a clear reflection of an unreal civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are made to make common symbols fun. There's no good I say about this film. If you are planning to rent it or buy it, do not waste your money or your time, no matter what to avoid. Even if you are a fan of actors, it's not worth it. In fact it could be a good example of what a director should avoid. I will not see the movie again. (He's planning to point out the fourth sign of the scary movie, imagine that!). Poorly Awful, terrifying.
