What an atrocity I do not claim to be a total verimimititude from a movie, but "Killing Joe" is so stupid in plot and screenplay that I myself completely (smallest) wincing through the film of ninety minutes. Readers of these reviews have now found the plot: Joe, a girl calling for love for American security zards, is an employee of the bank who will help lure at the top level of a good bet. <<br /> <br /> Spreads its credibility from getting to the movie. Z and Joe's magic night is incredibly awesome, and Joe's claims may feel the orgasm of life's life that shows the scriptwriter's linking teenage imagination over any on-screen chemistry. Zed's complete indifference when his friend Eric throws a joke from the hotel room, does not set the stage for his strong solid solidarity. <br /> <br /> In both cases, Eric's Bohmenian band - a small life of drug addicts. Small crimes - the city is ready for their big hight one night. Here Roger Everi's main goal is to prove that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread strongly believes in us (by constant repetition) that Eric really is really glad to see his old friend Z. Really glad. Eric's devil-service, the maximum brightness and affection for Z-even not even remotely trustworthy - for example, check out his squirt abstraction while discovering a dead cat in his apartment building. The development of characters that will accompany us in the rest of the picture is a discreet. <br /> <br /> Heist is a disaster - Understandable, the plan is ridiculous and criminals are completely amateur This is where Avili continues to pay tribute to Quintin Tarantino, his statue that he can be more violent than violence. In fact, though, he is more annoying than annoying. To increase the tension, there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe. This was boring in video games, and now it's annoying. <br /> <br /> While Jockey is held hostage, he will play an important role in spite of our expectation, he is just beautiful. Or more precisely, Avary failed to do anything with her. He literally lived in the last five minutes, broke hostage and saved gratitude, but still suffered the consequences of his crime, Zad still fears. Why does not he remember his involvement in crime - or why he gives an enmity about him - it is impossible to say Finally, he found that he was more modest than the other team. <br /> <br /> Throughout the world, tearing off the dialogue and fooling This is mostly in the French language. As a local speaker, I can certify that it does not ring even the remote truth. Eric's sweet-sour lecture, with the rapid change of the people's pride, quickly becomes charming and scary, but instead it is simply swallowed. Meanwhile, his horror-cat partners are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Erich is shot in a ridiculous example of excessive power, we all can withstand the relief: like the prisoners of the bank, we will soon be free from this unfortunate kindness.
