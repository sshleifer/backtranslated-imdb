Actually, the son of the mask laughs me a few times ... Most cartoon jokes which makes Buns Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. CGI is very impressive and this movie is widely used. For example, Garfield does not have a difference for CGI, but I will vote on it the same. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which was not bad for a kid's movie. Yes, this is a kidney movie ... and so should behave in this way. Jamie Kennedy's role is not very good. His efforts to work "crazy" is not very good and poorly played poor. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole thing without complaint. At least I was able to sit through this. <br /> <br /> This image is not worse than ** disguise ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 few smiles for CGI
