Victor Lace does not become a major star. She is well known for her role in character after her primary lead. But he was very handsome and a nice actor. <br /> <br /> In this romantic adventure romance, she shares her love scene with Loreta Young. Their kisses look very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborn is also a standout here. She plays a woman with a fame. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The print that I have seen is not clear. But such a rare movie is that joy! And they, in some observable conditions, are still intact. This is nothing really special. However, if anyone wants to get away with the title of the same era of his era film, some may find some superb films.
