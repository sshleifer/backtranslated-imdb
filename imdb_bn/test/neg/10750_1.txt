Some people thought it was fun because they liked the political issues discussed in this piece. However, I have become so tired of the two-party system of my country that I can not promote the promotion of both parties. I was expecting for a scary show, but got "cute" zombies and favorable bull brap. I see my horror films scared. This was not even trying to be awesome. Also, in his films there is no sense of his political / cultural satirical romero ... it was a vague, fantasy story which was hard for me in my stomach (wrong reason). On the bright side, if you hate Bush ... you'll love it (I do not accept hatred or bush with this statement)
