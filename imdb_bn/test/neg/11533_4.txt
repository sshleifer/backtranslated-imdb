This movie was viewed by hundreds of users for any reason because they were friends with the crew because friends with friends were friends, or were unsure fans of Lance Henriquesen or Lorenzo Lama. I personally follow "Lancer's religion", so despite the title, I became frustrated, it's just the name. The rich criminal Newcastle playing, a pleasure to see Lance, but his screen always goes to the beginning of the film. Newcastle set up a 747 hijst that includes a set of ketchum (lamas) and forgotten characters. The biggest shock of this audience was that the East-Hazest scenes were not bad at all. Abhira Mala, who played acting in each grade actress, acting on a grade school, was acting honest around, and a line really did not bother me, except for some objectionable and confusing. <br /> <br /> But once the hijst happens, the movie falls asleep. Their plan is simply the most ridiculous thing that has never been caught in movies, but it has been dragged for a long time. This is not a very deep movie, and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so annoying that I am almost noon noon. One particular sequence is that we are hardly able to perform each letter repeatedly to perform the same work, especially through the clock. The movie name is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from far away - it's leakage in the extreme and final stage. It probably works if it's a genuine personality of a person, but let's ask you to just go to the live video of the Showtime Extreme, just to ask in a video. <br /> <br /> Thank you, there are a number of smiles, deliberate and unintended (Lorenzo Lama, probably a disguised master who makes some of the incredibly awful situations) and Lance comes back to the end of the film for a short time. This is a bad movie, and probably I did not want to tell myself, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen so far away. It will not be too high on the Henriksen movie list, because she has some real gems with most of the screen time and the film has lost a lot of vapor after the start of the hit, but the best thing I can say is that the Rapid Exchange is the one that I have seen before the last two films It was a mainstream hostage and a lot of scary crashes - and it was better than both.
