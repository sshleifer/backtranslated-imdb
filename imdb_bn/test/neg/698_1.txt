I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of my worst movies I've ever seen bad to see. Although about 25 percent of the visitors wandered through the theater (and completely left) in the theater, I was stupid enough to stop it. The main problems in this story (there were many to list all) You have to do two things with this type of movie ... One, fearing the murderers (since they kept him for twenty minutes in film) and you must give that person Whose life is risky (tank girl) enough character development that you really care about him Will. I could not lose the track of the girl, I gave him such little insight that he was just a silent face and when I thought that he was part of the story, I really did not take care of what happened to him. Though the visuals were attractive in the manner of the LSD Flashback, they often did not give any knowledge and it should be a text that can not create scenes for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menus for another example) Finally, anyone knows or with the women in that field Looking on the sky and kneeling? Ridiculous
