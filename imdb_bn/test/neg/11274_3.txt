Thank God I have fast forward I think this is a movie about an emergence and collapse of a movie. Whatever: It's a stupid clich√©. It does not make any difference. This guy, Javier Bardem, who created buildings or anything. It does not matter. He is handsome, this Javier's Bardem. Who care? I think there is a car debris but I saw this fast forward, so ... who care? Car debacle and handsome hero who struggled back from them, smell like a melodrama. Javier likes someone, but he instead marries Maria de Madeiris. He is gloriously a poet, with a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has a verbal interface with which Meribel Vardu, who washes his volvo for some reason. If you think of Marble Vardu, washing her hands will be sexy to the volta. No he's not It's a boring story about a bunch of people who are not interested in me. Javier, Mariebell, and Maria have a threesome: how boring. These pictures are annoying. I think this may be a little bit (Spanish) film in Spanish: The rise and expected fall of a small man who is successful against discrimination. Let me clear it: this is a high-grade melody or perhaps a soap opera. It's not worth your time, without smile.
