The ugly female-the-cell-block flick, under the midnight film barrels, combines the sweet slab with the girls' in-the-shower clich√©s. Linda Blair sent an innocent person to jail (we were involved in running some people with his hand) We had a tough time in the Big House, with some of the worst characters of Ras Rashera's side. Blair is constantly punched, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. The conversation is hateful across four character-word, and the membrane offered no up to the barrage of its violence and stupidity. Yet, some viewers see it as the camp's classic, although probably its tongue is not enough enough in the cheek. * ****
