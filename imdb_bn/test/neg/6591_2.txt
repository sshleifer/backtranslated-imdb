This movie was portrayed in my city and I was very familiar with the minor roles "actor". Most of them had a local school girl and even when it was painted, we all still knew what it was like. It was interesting though it was interesting. Nightclub, pizza shop, etc. It was not present in most places, "World Premiere" was held in The Acron Civic Theater and we all laughed deeply about how insane everyone was. I personally believe it made the worst movie but it brought back many favorite memories for me. Watch this movie with a word of advice ... Enjoy it for ... low budget, poorly prepared, carpet flick.
