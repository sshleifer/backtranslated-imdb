The criticism on this flick has been pretty much pretty pretty accurate. It's an hour and half of the waste, followed by a bunch of very beautiful high schoolgirls and cry about life. Magic is about twenty minutes, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. Our actress is treated like an ass piece, and seems to be perfectly happy with their position. The main character, ipsmith, is the boy walking the poster boy for any pop culture clothing store. You can not relate to them, only you can understand hell. The story itself raises itself and ultimately reaches the final battle, it is not more than a volleyball match that does not take long enough to get raped with OC from this trash script.
