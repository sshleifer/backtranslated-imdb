This year I will be the worst movie I saw .. and I see many cables. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are thrown to you without just a step, a start or a scene ending. This is only random idiots which screams in some plane .. "Special effects" (Spielberg laughs off his ass) Horrible, yellow eye content lenses are beautiful though. I can not tolerate the administration that I finish it. The scene where the great scientist was living for life in the Bennet engine was too much for me .. I'm sorry for my bad english I am from Romania and this is my first post. I had to sign up to comment on this movie because I can not believe that it was a movie released in 2007.
