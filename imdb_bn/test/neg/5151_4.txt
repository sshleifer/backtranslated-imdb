No, it's just a cheap 1940s serial Cape uses the best name. If you are a comic book fan, you will be disappointed. They basically changed the character. There is no shield, no left, no war with the Nazis, there is no wings beside his mask, and most importantly: Captain America is now a district attorney and no other GI. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dick Pius Cell Captain America? Do not look too closely when he changes in his costume. It is very obvious that he was not in the best physical shape while making this serial (can you say flavby?). It is very clear that Stunt Man is performing most of the tasks here. Almost every chapter has a compulsory fist fight that is shot and just takes place in the same way. Villain is rather soft and although he uses a vowel (Scarab), he does not wear any kind of camouflage. The story is repetitive and very easy. Impact is ridiculous and average of actions. On the plus side we d. At As an assistant of Sexy Lorne Gray and good captain, a primary chapter gets to run a cool looking motorcycle. Overall, but nothing special.
