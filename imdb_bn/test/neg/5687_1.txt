I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it but I expect a good bad movie. Oh well, enjoying endless sand trudging fun, fun camel taste (well, actually eggplant) was fun and acting strange grimacing I think it was almost five actors. The DVD needed a director's commentary so that I could find out what he was thinking ... or if he had all. I can not believe that they actually went to England, in Austria and in any of the pictures ... wherever it might be. It has been good if they have managed to get her nude. Best line of movies? "He waits for his upgrade." "Yes, still waiting". Now that was fun! If someone has more than 3 dialogs (outside the statement .... first shot) then I will look at it again.
