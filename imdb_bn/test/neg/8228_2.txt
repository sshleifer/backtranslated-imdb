I used to pick this photo. This movie was on my "Must See" list, because people talked about it being "boring" and in VHS box many quotes from people saying "weird" and "you can get genocide of texas chainsaw" and line like that. But, sorry guys, I was frustrated at the big time. The idea is interesting, but the script is adopted in such a manner that the evolution of each character is created wrong and people actually work on the most cruel movies of the film. <br /> <br /> This can be any other advantage of plots otherwise. I could not believe how some people unnecessarily had the order "where he should find him." There are few important moments to please Gore's fan, but they are so little that we do not have time to reach them. If Luther is a singer, then filmmakers must definitely go to the food chain.
