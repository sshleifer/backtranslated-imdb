Most of the comments in this movie are positive, so I thought I would try and solve the balance. I wonder what I'm coming out of this movie. I know now and still consider it to be a poor movie. It seems very transparent that I discounted a dream order at least. I was fascinated that there was a free ticket to my movie or I wanted to get back my money. Film critics and critics love this film, which only makes me realize that many of them can enjoy a more intelligent sound than a viewer can enjoy. 8+ rating This movie is so confusing. In 20 years, this picture will not compare with real greats like The Godfather. The film has received good performance from both sides but it is not enough to save the film. (Not lesbian scene!)
