After watching the TV commercials of this movie, I hoped a lot of fun in my local movie. In the end it's the longest one I've ever spent the 90mins. Wog Boy really failed to provide a story line enough to keep my interest and expected and sometimes tasteless joke did not fill this void. <br /> <br /> A scene where two 'Wog boys' dominated their local nightclub dancer so influenced me. The only character that was valuable to watch was 'Nathan', starring Stephen Curry of The Castle, giving some of his smiles to the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A word for this flicker is boring. Save yourself time and watch TV commercial only because it shows only laughs.
