Sorry, this was a harmful excuse for a movie. A plot line was like a hole so that it was similar to a chest in Swiss cheese and block, which seemed to me completely interconnected inter-personal relationships. Of course Karlil and Lee Miller, who I could swear, was in love. In most cases like Tyler and Miller, it was completely disrespectful, just like the rest of the picture. Although the last product was unremarkable and fun. All the wrong reasons, the production prices were high and some were worthy of recognition. But unfortunately the last result was garbage ... .. What was everyone thinking ... ..? They should definitely have to fill on this one ..
