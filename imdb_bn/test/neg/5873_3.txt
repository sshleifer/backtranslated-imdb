I bought this movie at a movie store Months ago, I talked about my friend when we were talking about the fascinating movie. Once I saw the cassette, I knew it was me. I saw it on that night. I could say it's going to be very fat and cheaply done. . . Does it have created me? I popped it up and I smiled the whole way through. I could recognize Gregory (Ice Cream Man), but I could not recognize his name and I saw him where I could not remember him. Later, while watching Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was featured in additional because he was the brother of Ron Howard (Opi Taylor). I saw the credit and I gasped I looked at my mother, who was watching, said, "That ice cream!" She gasped too. This movie is great, but only for laughter and criticism. This is the perfect example of a hungry horror flick. If you feel like having a fun fun in low budget movies, rent this video.
