The actors were not credible, the stories were really weak, total SAP, and completely expected. Depardieu is really frustrated. It was shameful that they did not pay much attention to the Canadian war effort to achieve independence. We saw this love story a long time ago, only good actor! For the last 15 minutes we had to wait for a little bit of the drama! The soundtrack was completely annoying. The underscores hit you on the head with sensitivity. But really above. The only thing we can get is that they let Indians speak their language. And we found comparatively realistic, cinematography in the Indian village.
