This was first published in 1978 when I saw Greek tickets. I found it very annoying. I think it was not better than any other trip except for one thing: For the first time in my life, I realized why it would be better to be rich. Seeing the visible scenes of Aristotle Onassis Yacht and my first real eye in the rich and famous life style opened my eyes. To explain Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I do not think of sex scenes. This time I found the lovemaking session with the movie being seen since the big screen and this time it was memorable. Maybe because I was small and single back, it was no big deal.
