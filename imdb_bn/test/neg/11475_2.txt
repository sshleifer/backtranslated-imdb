This movie is not one of the movies you get bored and crazy because it thinks its own ass and it's not completely funny. It's just not interested in this movie. Any real joke that makes you impressive, you only see it for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this very budget DVD and I'm happy because it does not cost much. This is not a movie that is so bad that you can see it while being drunk with friends and get a good goggle. I did not hate anything like I hate some movies, but it's rather annoying and is not worth the investment at any time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
