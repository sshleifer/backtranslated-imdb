When I say bad, I mean less recreational. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera strategies from the last Zumba Bloodbath, which makes the film less tolerable. The last film did not have any special camera effect, where we treated it with shiny cam and slowly switching between black and white. Also, despite the fact that these zombies are barely of this one, this is called zombie Bloodbath. The film began in 1945, where some satans kill a violent thief and think of him as terrible. Back in modern times, some kids have a car problem and go to a house, the same house where the satanist murdered happened. Some people try to rape children (or some), and they bring fearful Borrower back to life, who come back with some dead bodies and now speaks like a dude crowd. Mr. Sheet integrates the language and reduces violence. If you want to watch the bad movie, check it out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / **** 96 minutes There are no rates, violence and language.
