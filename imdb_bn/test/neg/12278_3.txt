Tony Curtis and Home Homer both black and white with a visible white trim canvas shoes before swim before and after the tank swim. Young big legs must be very difficult. If the actual Marine mission was to wear boots. In the first scene they took their leggin's off before starting their small trip out to find the farmers. When they dug the fox hole, Tony and Skip booted the battlefield, then entered LÃ¡vizo and Curtis Framer, and his daughter Tony wearing "tennis shoes" but hey turned black. The film was in real story but was it really necessary?
