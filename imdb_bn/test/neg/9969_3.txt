Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, as part of the Chicago Undergraduate Film Festival, there was a distinct dissatisfaction with Mr. Van Bobble in an exhibition of The Manson Family movie in three Pine in Chicago. Here's what I say about it After all, the film is a clear fraud in every Kenneth Rug, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam, which I have ever seen. Second, after the show, in the short question hour session Mr. Van Bowball immediately said that he did not contact any member of the true Mansion family or Charlie himself, he was a liar and said he did not want to do anything to them. This movie saw it in his living room on TV and on the basis of his (Van Bebelle) news (and I got direct ideas from the autobiography and book Helter Scullette which was directly mixed with the story). So in my question there was a second DB, I asked him whether he was trying to present outside, MTV, sexual medicines and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true facts. This question is now clearly closed by the Slideshare Director, who has started to shout "You **************************************************************************************** > However, I did not even think how ridiculous until the day after reading the tagline for this film, "You've heard the story of the story passed ... now the story is heard by Mansion family. "Forgive me, if this guy does not even talk to the family and believes that he does not want to do anything, how can he tell the story of God's name? I've never heard this ridiculous statement! The film is definitely sexually explicit The drug and rock n Roll was catered to the audience that it was no small problem to attract small, gradually illuminated theater, and more definitely sex drugs and hail The 'Roll' n Roll was spawned by the mind who did not even see his own film for every 10 minutes to get more beer for the actors or to shout some of Rocky Horacec's call line. This film is a genre of facts (which helps in shaping most of the world in America and nowadays By doing this), you can achieve a bit more than the picture. Perhaps a slash / comic book Ras / Rap shallow person dreams of a visual fantasy. <<Br /> <br /> The film was certainly very impressive to see. The soundtrack was refreshing because it contains samples of his line of work Charlie's family album. The edit was excellent and sticky to imitate the annoying uncertainty of modern music videos. Among these films, Mativis catalogs are more well-suited than underground movie festivals, or than an intellectual observer's mind than catalogs. I think I have been wearing the audience's clothes and watching behavior (perhaps the best part of the experience) like Midnight Rocky Harare. Without the exception of Charlie, the kest was very good, he looked more like a stone-borne Donjon and Dragon enthusiast from the actual role he portrayed. The film depicts it through energy, throwing out ten things, and being very physically about it does not always consist of slow, neutral and intimate representation. <br /> <br /> All the films originally declare itself as Sadi (or perhaps it's Linda), "You can write a bunch of books ** or create a bunch of ** movies ** etc. "In case of point. Even "based on the real story" is a disclaimer, which is the foundation of the story of a content that is below the world under this psychedelic rubbish hip that creates the world. All you have to do is to really separate the truth, or indeed, maybe you can avoid it together and read a book instead. <br /> <br /> I can say that I got a free beer after the end of this film so I was happy, but I am not very happy that I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket so that the question of the manager is f *** up close Called to do. Peace be upon
