I appreciate trying to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the movie has been completed in such a way that most people will not be able to sit through it. When this incident happened in Estonia, the film was relevant to me, but it was written very scary and failed to draw attention that did not know anything about it. Music preferences do not flow well with the movie, it seems that someone has turned on the CD player in the background to keep an actor in "mood". Acting ... Well, what is acting? Jurjen Prokov and Donald Swiechland, the only person to perform, although Prokopo seems uncomfortable in this role. In addition to improving the relationship between Eric West Mark (Jurgen Prokov) and Julia Reuter (Grey Skakchi), it is also good to see the remains of a train. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to test their "sincere moments". This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message (can be a documentary!) And trying to create a better movie. It's a failure and someone else who says here, if they try to promote it then it makes me amazed. Indeed, as living in Estonia I was offended by this tragic effort. This tragedy is more than just a domestic low-budget ghost scam. This can be much more!
