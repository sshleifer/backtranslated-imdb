Now, I love the old skifee movie, as the worst guy. And I realize that a budget is a budget. That said, as bad as the dinosaur Planet can get a bad movie. There is no actor in the item, and only one interesting woman who killed them after two minutes of swimming. Unused celluloid pills literally have no valuable quality. The only thing not to waste was the paper ... screen game should be longer than four pages. Definitely no one talks this point to WROTE. I am constantly surprised that such a movie has been created, much less released. I just glad to see this time wasted I do not pay. It's 75 minutes of my life I will not get back.
