This film creates a sensation when it is released. I saw it and was thrilling. Impressed in beautiful, generally young, nude women's passionate style, we knew so much from director Hamiltons Photography. His photo never becomes obscene and this is also true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was desperately frustrated. Soft core in a very slowly visible scene, with some vestle on all the lenses, is actually all there. There is no real story, the character contains beautiful and nicely zero body, but they are not real animals with a spirit. Nothing actually happens. Hamilton is photographing to take pictures rather than a picture. And this gets so annoying after a while. The second time I did not even see the whole, because I fell asleep. That remains the best composition: it's a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted! <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
