Probably taking a chance to see whether a really good WWI film slipped my notice - this is not. John Philip's laws and Don Stroud are tough for both their acting and miscast for their role. Dialogue is stupid or non-existent; The flying sequence is ok but quite repetitive. The film should not have been made more than the awesome "Blue Max". Look at James Pepper, James Mason and UML Endre in BM and why this film is one of the best war movies ever and it is not. Recently DVD Reichtofen and Brown have been released as some of the great 'lost classics' in the 70's, I bought it again after the day I bought it. Do not waste your time or $.
