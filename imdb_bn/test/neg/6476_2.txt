I was 12 when I saw the original movie (I live in Italy and the Italian title "FBI, Operation Cats!") Was a fun movie and not just for kids. This terrible restoration is kinda even for 5 years old! Disney does not know how to destroy their reputation and memory of a beautiful movie and I just can not believe it. Even the original song title song (both the original version and the vibrant Italian version) is very nice and makes the story mood. The title song is worse than the movie in this remake. Dean Jones was very nice to watch, even if he was only for a cam appearance, he was regular in the old Disney movie. I can not see anything else righteous in this remade movie.
