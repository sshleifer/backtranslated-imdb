I saw this photo at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005. <br /> <br /> compared to this movie, compared to Sideway in the EIFF program - which I liked - so I was looking forward to this movie. I liked the Garden State, Napoleonic Dynamite etc ... so I have some recent experience with a little strange American indie movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that the Puffy chair does not compare comparatively to any movie. <br /> <br /> I am sitting for 35 minutes, waiting for something funny, malicious, insightful or even gently interesting. It was not - and shiny video cams made me sick - so I went away. <br /> <br /> I have ever thrown out this second film (the first was "Shoosi") which is a little disappointing. I probably could not waste the time for the boring photo of annoying effects - but within 35 minutes, nothing reminds me that I will lose some. <br /> <br /> frustrated
