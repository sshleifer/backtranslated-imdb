Rather than suspicious plate tectonics, Japan begins to slip under the sea. It has been initially foretold that the country will take about 40 years to drown, but a rogue scientist can produce more suspicious science and take less than 1 year! The government thinks that he is a crack, but the evidence soon begins to carry out his theory. <br /> <br /> This big budget disaster follows a formula set by Hollywood movies at the end of the 90's (I think no one has seen them) on the scale of disaster and tragedy, humanity (good Japanese) soul outlook and Encourage in strong work, and proves the power of love or something like that. That is, it is na√Øve in psychology like its geology ... we all know that half of the population will be victims of rape and they will think that the police think they are back and the other half will be scared and will be useless. <br /> <br /> The film has some great effects, but it is not a study or expensive that it is a contemporary Hollywood production. At least because of the lack of nationalist, ridiculous and self-consciousness, it's like a Hollywood movie, but it's probably going to be worse. The warrior hot summer chick is one of them ... but she is not too bad, so little hot. <br /> <br /> The picture was much longer than 132 minutes, and it got worse and worse as it progressed towards a conclusion which was the danger of puking to me. I care little about halfway through Japan or Japan has shrunk, and eventually I try to think about ways to speed up this process. However, it has special effects, and Kao Shiva is still quite hot, so I sincerely give it ... 3/10.
