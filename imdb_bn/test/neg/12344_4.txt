The film begins to show interest to a boy who is interested in a teenage girl of her own age. The horrific husband of Cleveland is seen to have died in the crash and is ready to go to Rome and sing as a deco. Matthew objects but come along. But this time, he is in a mock cocaine with the young girl again. Her superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is fast moving. He does not know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags in search of a plot. Klebberg is playing a false role and while managing the image, Bartolooki may have his head on the moon. The moon has great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. I'm probably too generous with 4 *.
