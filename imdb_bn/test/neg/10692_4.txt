I was waiting to see the mastermind's documentary self-abstraction behind the Bondoq Sants, one of the most annoying and vain movies I have ever seen. But "overnight" makers - the masters of the question (former?) - to learn how to make films. By observing various disrespectful comments, obscenity in the phone, and enjoying its alcohol, actually, Mr. Duffy sees it as a doll. But in the first light, why did the man get the contract, his creative process or perspective does not reveal any insight on what - even on what is the case of Boduk Sants? How difficult is it to see Patrick Soze? This strange institutional strategy that is caught by our hateful heroes? Since the film does not try to answer this question in a consistent way, it does not end in the Deep-Doo to tell about Hollywood. So who care?
