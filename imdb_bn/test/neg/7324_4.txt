I like Kevin Bacon and Kathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good. There was not a liking character in the film, and the plot almost existed. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Masterson is a great actress, but she does not just pull the "hard girl" character. (He had the same problem with his character on the second day of Christmas.) Perhaps he would avoid these letters, especially those who stop playing with an overwhelming female child. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rachel Wood was unclear. Her character was an intelligent, simple and straightforward, and no young actress could give any positive feeling to Hariyat. <br /> <br /> For the sake of full disclosure, I could not even see this picture. My time is enough to waste twenty-five minutes.
