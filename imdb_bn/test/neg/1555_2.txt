First of all, I make it clear that I'm a big fan of bad scientists, especially when it comes to huge, city-stomping monsters. But it's so fantastic that I do not want to be bad. They obviously did not pay enough money in the budget by jumping on the subjects (the only phenomenon that we wanted to point to the size of the lap girl, a large novelty pencil, which is available at Spencer's gifts for around 15 paise) also did not make the decision to spend for the idea or plot. The monsters are okay, in my opinion, but it does not have enough interaction with the backgrounds, as there is not enough destruction for most fans of the genre. The general rules of monster giant films are: If you do not have to destroy many fake-looking buildings, you should have wrestling with more fake-looking monsters. This movie is not there. I can not make my final complaint about the film without ending the film, but the origin of the giant is enough, and the system is available to get rid of, not just water. Even as most of these movies. leave it.
