"Tart" is a generous effort to create movies that revolve around the thirteenth child of Manhattan and all the usual natural preppie stuff ... sex, medicine, and classical music are almost entirely without stories, focus, or purpose. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes, when he does another way of working on Swan's long list of dogs. Nothing works in this movie, and Wayne should be considered to get the real job. Not recommended for anyone. For pu! Esse! (D)
