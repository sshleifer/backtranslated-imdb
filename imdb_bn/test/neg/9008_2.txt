Four years ago, mystery science theater 3000 had the pleasure to see it. I must admit it should be done badly as some other science fiction / horror movies. The plot revolves around an astronaut who came back inside the alien embryo. Now the plot is quite weird, well if you can even call a plot (A space in a building and a place to run an old pickup truck is showing a fun program!) I would admit I was terrible by today's standard (and 20 years ago) ... but 43 years ago I saw myself and this movie Being impressive by. This is not even the worst of the attacks of Neptune men, Manos: the fate or future war. <br /> <br />
