I really hope this movie is very good, maybe my expectations were a bit higher, but in reality I love Jude Nelson. Indeed, he is the only reason to watch this movie, and in fact his role is not so big. The main highlight of this movie is the Raunchy Sexual Scenes and the Boring Dialogue. If this is highlighted, I am sure that what kind of movie is your best idea about it. There was a reason to make it for television movies. If you do not do any good work or waste money on video rentals on Friday night, just check it out. Save your time and hire breakfast clubs!
