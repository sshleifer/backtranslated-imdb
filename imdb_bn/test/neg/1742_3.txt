I thought it was weird and just lazy, not scary. I have seen some Japanese horror films, rigu and juan and love them; But this movie was a disappointment. It does not even explain anything about the curse. I just did not see any fear ... it was not scary to me. All the time, I was looking forward to discovering the secret secret of curse and waiting to see why it was happening. If it is an ancient curse, why did not it happen before Shuichi's father? And never told us what happened to our father. I'm not saying any of our money or argument behind this curse and then it ended. I was very frustrated.
