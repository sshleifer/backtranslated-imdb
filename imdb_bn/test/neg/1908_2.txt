One word I would all say ... SUCCS !!!! The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it was Josh Hartnet and he was cool. Klein guys should beat that ass ... fools fool and brainless At the end of this movie you will not be able to stand up to Klein and you really do not care about what's happening on the lace. Hartnet was the only good thing about it.
