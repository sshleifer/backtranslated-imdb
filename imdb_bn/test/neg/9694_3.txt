Sorry for that But if you have seen this "epic", then of course you know about the inappropriate disregard for the Bible's actual reading. Now, I'm not on the next line for Sineathood, but I know basically. And basically this was. God wanted to erase all of the world because he believed that he was lost at a point of exchange. He chose to protect Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family due to their uncorrupted ways. During the flood of the rest of the earth, Noah built a ship with the command to keep God, his family, and each of the animals in the house. Those are the basics. In this movie, you are roaming around the sea like other people's crazy and pirates. But I thought that nobody was wiped out. I guess the NBC executives have not been in the church. There are other flaws, I'm saying, but the average joe is, I have no idea of ​​them. Sorry Before coming back to film it was wrong, before acting stunk, but some effects were good, I would give it. But overall, I saw a good and more tasteless presentation of the story as a little view of Simpsons. God helped NBC officials come to the judgment day. 3/10
