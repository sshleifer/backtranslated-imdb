Umberto Lenzi hits the new low with this recycled trash. Janet Agren is a lady who is looking for her absent sister It shows that a gymnasium of sister New Gene is part of the religion of Jones, Jones. He conducted a scrapbook guide to help Robert Karman get the culture compound located in the forest. This is another (!) Cannabal film, and I probably liked it if Lenji did not pad this movie with scenes of his superior "Deep River Man". I mean, every cannon scene has been taken directly from the movie, which I guess makes it credible as Al Edson. I felt ripped off. *** Speaker *** 1/2 star and for that dildo scene.
