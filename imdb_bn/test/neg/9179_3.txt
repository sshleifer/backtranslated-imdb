Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top Blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrak, one of two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a picture with these two people for the first time! Now imagine that the best movie might be made with these two people for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision" Of course, this film was created in 1997 and both of them were past their heads, but this does not mean that they do not have anything to do with them - they only need good writing and instruction help. They did not get here. Rothrak has been able to throw a few kicks at the end, but this image is so violent that you probably will not wake up to see them. (*)
