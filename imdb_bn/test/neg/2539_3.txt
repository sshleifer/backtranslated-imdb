On the way back from London I saw that Man of Man; Apparently Air Canada has a crap movie policy. Perhaps this is not the best way to begin reviewing the film. Amanda Binis plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends her two brothers to get a team in a boarding school across junior. Even if you check your mind at the door (what you want to do in 6-hour flight), the story is impossible and ridiculous. There are a number of comedies, mostly in the comedian's David Cross policy, but complex love polygon does not really inspire emotion, though it is cleverly mixed (with intelligent proximity). The finishing left just as ridiculous as the psychologist. If I was a 12-year-old girl I really enjoyed it.
