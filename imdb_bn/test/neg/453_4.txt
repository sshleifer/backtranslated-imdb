While I was still a huge fan of Dr. Hu's Sirius, I started to see this new series and became very frustrated. <br /> <br /> The children under 15 years of age or younger will probably enjoy the best and potential new fans who have not seen the original series, but this series of original series fans will lose most of the creations created in the original series. Thank you so much for thanking me, David Tenant, how thankful I was to be like a doctor at the first Christmas in the first half of Elastienes. <br /> <br /> I would recommend only those who have not seen too much. Since the original series, people under the age of 15 and being very disappointed with the fans, everyone will only enjoy the sunny and dreaded words about Russell. Davis is one of our favorite TV shows.
