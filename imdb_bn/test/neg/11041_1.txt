***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Traged <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> It is the epic violence, its live octopus, and it is an incomplete story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Now the story may seem to start immediately after the start of the story, but once it is seen in the Bloated and Miraculous Blood Festival, it develops into a bitter blood torch and a forced film. <br /> <br /> It should be equal to the mean of the instruction and the South Korean thriller should not be of any value. Old-fashioned acting scenes are similar to soft humor and a bad writing script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not clear to everyone, but its scope and vision is not even more clear than the gray axis of fog . <br /> <br /> * Tragic
