Master Harrar: SoundSet is set in Seattle where Larry Pearce works as a computer software call center manager, after losing her six-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Eliya) to heart heart, she has seen that she has a very sensitive hearing. Larry is listening to everything ten times, people typing on the computer keyboard, people walking around the house, people tapping on the feet on the floor, taping the tube, and finally even the breathless people become helpless to Larry, because they constantly bombard the mind. Eventually, Larry decides that he has enough and if he can not stop crying, he probably can stop listening to them with the help of a big meat clever. <br /> <br /> This Canadian American co-production was written and directed by Brad Anderson from the episode 4 of Season 2 of the General Hit-and-Masters Masters of Horror TV series. I think the sound was like a certain miss. This script was based on a short story based on Mike Odyscall, and now I am really surprised by the very positive comments on IMMb, I want to work hard to get started at the beginning. It's a horror film and it looks like some bizarre-feeling dramas for the last 5 minutes to actually do some work in Howard Burger, Gregory Nicatoro and KNB influences. Larry has this weird vague ability to raise the sound and noise from the beginning, so this episode ends with 55 minutes of the same repetitive build, which comes late to finish, though it is a secondary end. Although it is running very slowly and it is well written, it does not mean to be a heavy theme and I am a little skeptical that what does it mean to appeal? <br /> <br /> Director Anderson is OK but he repeats the same thing, for the last 5 minutes, the whole thing has a drop of blood. There is no fear, no fear or tension, and there is absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically it is very good, has good production value and it does not seem to be an affordable TV show. The acting is very good and it's a shame that the story is somewhat limited. <br /> <br /> It seems like one of the worst masters of Horror Partition, many people like it and it's right, but it's definitely not for me. Horn is another master, another disappointment.
