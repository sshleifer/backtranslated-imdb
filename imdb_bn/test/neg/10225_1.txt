Hold a rocky story from Steve Gutenberg and insert. What i say else This is really bad because you expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Gutenberg) and Ana Montgormier have tried to transform a group of vain, inexperienced kids into a winning football team. The struggle for struggle to maintain any type of interest in this movie, reducing originality and direction from offset. Despite my reservation about Gottenenberg's acting ability, I can safely say that the rival team's coach is actually worse than Gottenenberg. I think it's already unimaginable. This story is about the so-called 'film'
