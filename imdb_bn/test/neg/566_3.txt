I like the first 15 minutes, and I like some of the tribunal's conversations - which proved to be the best showcase for the acting method of the director's advance method - but this film is finally frustrated. Even when fully seen as a metaphor for seduction / oppressive mobility in the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and trustworthiness and eventually hopes to look at my watch. The obvious ending will already happen. <br /> <br /> and for the record: Despite the reverse rumors, this movie was never banned in the United States (I can not comment on the rumors of censorship in the UK, but I am suspicious). Hollywood has refused to distribute it after its initial film festival, and I do not wish to believe the Nixon government to have some impact on this decision; However, it has never been seen on American television that it is rather a conscious and advertiser-driven fashion reflection instead of this medium's advertisement. For the present, you can get your own copy delivered by your DVD to your door through Amazon in a few days.
