This was the only movie I've ever witnessed most sad. This name was not just a completely wrong name - since the picture is not related to Pirenah - but the act is really empty and barbaric in attempting to make Palalake a plot. You will not be able to help when you watch this movie, but while spending enough time to spend each and every awkward second question and stop it Unfortunately I wait until the end of my case. That's two hours of my life that I can not reclaim.
