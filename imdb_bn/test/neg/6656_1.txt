I did not see Ishta, but I was unhappy with Kevin Coster's postman, it's bad. Probably the bad piece of trash I've ever seen, and you look at my review for Moulin Rouge? That's saying something. Bad plot, the role was poor and even spoiled (though yes, Michael Keaton I've seen in some bad movies), and more than half of this movie has no value for anyone in the brain. Do not see if you have graded 4th Grade because you will see it insulting your intelligence.
