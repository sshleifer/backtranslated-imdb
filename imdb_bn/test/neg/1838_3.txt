I was looking forward to this movie because everyone was talking about it as a horror film, and finally as a European. So, my expectations were higher. It starts with a good calm / shock sequence but it lets you down in the following scenes, where the plot begins with the acting and the motivation of the characters / life itself is more than 'made for TV' drama. Well publish. <br /> <br /> About the horror of the movie, it is certainly a good idea and another different topic, but all the scenes are 'seen' kind of before. <br /> <br /> Overall, the idea of ​​this film was that it was a good idea, which was less than a medieval story, bad acting and a tolerant plot hole. <br /> <br />
