Would anyone please explain why someone wants to create a "British non-violent" crime film in the entire United States? The sound of this film is bloody horror! But with full performance, which is afraid to lose a match to set up a wooden shield. <br /> <br /> What kind of hatred, disgraceful, discipline? Even in non-narrative films there are some characters that you feel or want to feel, even if they are frustrating and destroyed; At least they have some modesty, some have understood that what they have done is wrong, or a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and they are stuck with its liability in any way. <br /> <br /> This is not a stanky stew. These characters betray each other, cheating themselves and the audience. Also, remember that they are living a little less - OK, there is nothing wrong with this - except they are living in luxury. For a film supposed to be about cruel small thieves, here's the principle - ennui. It's all very docile and drool, doncha know very well. So let's tear off some people or kill them, and move on to a luxurious hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> All this mess is somewhat chopped under the iceberg: boring unusual pensing; The expected 'action' sequence is not there; Disable and incoherent set design; Made-for-Bad TV Cameras-Work & Editing; Forgotten scores; And the complete lack of any imagination or innovation of production and direction. <br /> <br /> Completely unwanted, completely unbelievable, unlike, and less dedicated movie observers (or mockhostists), are completely unwanted. <br /> <br /> I want to say something other bad about this painting film, but they will not print them here. Not saying, you might find it more useful with your time than watching this movie - really something.
