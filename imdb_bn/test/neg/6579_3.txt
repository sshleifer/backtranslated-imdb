I can not see the point. It is ponderous. Animated people find strange (uncanny valley). Scene for very little purpose and go on and on. The plot should be padded with skeleton and lots of nonsensical, screaming roller coaster sides, as planned for an amusement park park based on the Disney or Spieberg film. The characters are most annoying and unlike. Some of them show that they are important to add to the climatic scene. They do not. They just disappeared with no permanent effect. Some do not believe in Santa Claus, as it will be kidnapped on the train on Christmas day before. That sums up quite a lot of it.
