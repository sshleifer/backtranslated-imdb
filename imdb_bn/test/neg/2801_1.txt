This is probably the worst worst. I am a big fan of the scary film industry and I can believe that this film is allowed to be created. The acting was young and the story was completely stupid. The camera work was a child. It seems that a view is outside of a shop. It can be seen in the night and you can see the moon, yet all the letters have welding shadows on the wall. It was seen that there was no street light. One character is lost at one stage, but after being removed from the post, it is revived. Come on !!! It seemed like I saw a middle school game. I keep the letters character letters and the mouth of their family members off the mouth "Hi Mom" I can only give it two positive comments ... it's over and it's good to laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!!!
