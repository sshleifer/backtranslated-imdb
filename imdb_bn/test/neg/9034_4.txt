Marked for Death (1990) spent more time in action sequences than working on his performances. Following his first two fascinating efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), the third Steven Sigal film makes the concept clear: Anyone who opposes it seems stupid; Bad people look good to him Just <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Van Dam <br /> <br /> <br /> Marked for death, dragging a variety of types into the sigal style and stumbling across the absorption. This film has graphic violence, cows and nudity loads that do not seem to be there without any reason, which can not distinguish between a story story and those who can enter thrills without rhythms or causes. And for this incompleteness as a producer of "Mark for Dying", he deserves some real blame. <br /> <br /> Segal has played retired DEA agent John Hatcher to come to Chicago, where his family is being attacked by the Jamaican street gang, who surrounded his sister, and the film proves that the guns in the crossfire of Daniel of Harris (Daniel Harris) When it is not fast Hatcher became crazy, and she decided to take her old friend, Max (Keith David), a teacher in a school gym, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican police officer. <br /> <br /> Naturally declared hatchery war. On the main bad guy, a horrible-locked Jamaican Voodoo priest, called Scruples (Basil Wallace), is a nickname that apparently means "overacting harmful". <br /> <br /> It is almost unbelievable to remove members of the Saggang gang: he surrounds the eyes of a man, breaks his back, and breaks numerous weapons and limbs. <br /> <br /> All the logic windows are thrown out for this movie- - through the glass. Why does here and friends not be guilty of damaging such property or do the bodies count? How did they detect the automatic weapons cache from Illinois to Jamaica? There is Clint Eastwood Stoogism about Segal, which once enjoyed the fans, and despite three different characters, he starred in many films, wearing each dresses and a ponytail in Oriental Black Snowbra. One of my problems with some Seagull films is that the main characters seem to be in serious danger and because they are star, certainly no one else can glove on it. <<br /> <br /> Most of all exchangeable, plot lines and action sequences of Leader's Leaders. Siegel, a dog wearing firefighters, or a lover, is always the Sigal, which his fans just want. Actually, the similarity of these movies is that if I wanted, I could take an old review, change my name and take it correctly in new movies. That's really not that really that ...
