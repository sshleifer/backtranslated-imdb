Well, everyone is near me, but I think Gibson's Hamlet was the most horrifying presentation I've ever seen ... such as a papers bag inspired and inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie was that I hope it will be better or weirdly funny. There is no luck. <br /> <br /> There is no disrespect for supporting or for stereoing of Jeffery, but nothing can create anything for the main character's rebellion. I have portrayed Hamlet as an animated lion like a romantic poet, etc., as a fighter tiger soldier. But IMHO this screenplay was lacking in lots of intelligent only with the most vulnerable ham.
