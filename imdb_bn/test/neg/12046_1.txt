I went to see the movie theater and thought that the money would be at least modestly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed was when Robin Williams got upset in the car under the mountain, and finally when he seems to have died. Glenn Close was overwhelming, and probably does not look like a parent's old age. Like a garpe, a mother could take her children into the children's and family divisions. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his glazed donut modest gentle look are very sweet and funny for me. He can play two roles: funny person or sad, sad, good heartfelt victim. See Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and its so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance Put them all into a long mini series together. Glenn off always a cold fish. Remember deadly attraction? Even your worst days even if you have an affair with him? Do you find any surprise between him and Michael Douglas? Have you ever warmed up any screen off the glen ?? John Lathgo was the only interesting role. This day was on that day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transcexual was at least fun. The garp is made for all of them who love watching movies about the sick, unusual, unusual people, and then they demand it nice and deep.
