What is the end of the game: Casparov and the device entered the souls of Gary Kasparov during the 1997 IBS Deep Blue competition. You are becoming more paranoid and he has been increasingly adopting, because in the second game, Deep Blue created a step that seemed too much for the former concept of chess computer. Caspov thought then, and still is that IBM betrayed. <br /> <br /> The game seems to be neutral, but it is clear that the director is deceived by IBM. However, they do not provide any evidence to support fraud claims, but security around the computer's house is only to keep IBM hidden on computer at the actual price of the demand for security of IMB, and Kasperov claims that the computer does not play. A computer usually has at one stage at two games of the game. In the game, Caspov played a game that was designed to make use of the computer, in a situation where a previous computer chess program received Pan, which caused the computer's last loss. Deep Blue did not take the bit, and Kaspovov was so gusty that the computer started playing like a man that he did not even see that he could draw Deep Blue and resign. That game made him so convinced that he could not recover, and after 3,4, and 5 draws, he lost 6 games. <br /> <br /> Whether all the questions that came to be cheated by IBM are the single step in the game, where Deep Blue took the step that any person would create, even then, they spread to the computer. A chess player from IBM's Programming Team, explained in the Joel Benjamin Documentary, a chess player that they knew that chess computers have always spread in that situation, and as a result, many times and programming programs use Deep Blue so that it is not wrong to do other computer keys. If you believe Benjamin's firm beliefs, the case is clear, IBM did not fraud. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved away and did not mention IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, he liked spending among Sachin's shots for the hacking of the 19th century, and Deep Blue's shots noted that Deep Blue really controlled a man as well as bypassing him. Because of the understanding of programming, IBM's explanation makes perfect sense - if you know what you are doing, then it will not be difficult to do something in code, so that if and in such a manner and conditions are reached then do so and so - in other words, what to do on a computer, if any Under circumstances, Kaspovo creates a situation that occurs on Game2. It's not a fraud, it's a good job for programming a chess computer. Finally, it is very clear that the Director thinks that IBM has been fraudulently and IBM comments about the stock repeatedly increased 15% Deep Blue wins the day that IBM cheated on its stock price pumps (Kaspov even though IBM and Deep Blue compared to Enron). However, both chess and computer science have lots of external opinions, that Deep Blue has won fair and square and Kaspov has lost because he simply could not find his outlook as the "old machine" of computers and found it. A machine that does not seem so stupid after all. I just want the director to see our alternative opinions. <br /> <br />
