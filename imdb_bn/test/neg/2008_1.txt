Well it's about 1,000 years in the future and we finally broke the huge distance between the galaxies !! But sadly, we still use bullets to shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other, and get high stones, stones, wars ... common stereoctural urban black men are still getting a short end of the stick! Babies like Black Black Rubber Pants are in close quarters with Captain and crew from Beiwach shares. The sick people are still in need of movement on wheels, implants, or robotic foot movements. Dracula still looks and works gay. I want to go ... briefly, this action was shot on a common science-based low budget supporter, actor and no actual special effects. In the beginning, the middle, and the end was unfortunate. I have now to stop and shoot myself, there is no left to live for.
