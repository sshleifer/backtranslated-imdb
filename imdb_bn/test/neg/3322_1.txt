I'm not too interested in writing reviews about films I do not think deserve a mention. However, in an attempt to appear as a writer and film critic, I think it is important to publish my thoughts when I do not like a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's two stars in Hollywood's biggest heavyweight, stylish aesthetics of the film and Gothic Mais N captured the viewers. Although it was a matter of style by way of substance, but it was something that worked in spite of its glasses (I was never an enamler with the Vampire General). <br /> <br /> Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone a long way. If it is most likely asked to appear on a cache, both will be roamed with laughter. They saw the final result when they were laughing harder. It is mentioned in "Queen of the Dead" * P * Hollywood can earn money at a low cost and expect an average soundtrack and a massive marketing campaign from 13 to 17 years of age to save faster. <BR> <br /> This picture can not be claimed from the beginning. Lestat, now playing "shooting fish", played by Brit Stewart Townsend, has awakened from the sound of his dark grave ... you guessed, nu-metal He bothers some misleading pop musicians and joins their band that he only arrives at night, his skin is burning with the sun and all the time of day ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jesse (Margarayu Mourou), an unusual studying student (probably Vampire Studies 101?), Lestat actually said he tried to find out what he did. He is going for him (to do something with his strange past), but Rani Aksa (Aleya), a vampire monster queen who has little competition with returning from underward to earn Lestat as her chosen king. <Br/> <br /> This photo is spontaneous spontaneity, but his camp tone keeps some room for his humorous humor. Anyone who looks good like this movie will be happy to see more movies! Townsend watching is enjoyable. He knows that the role is absolutely at the top and he tries his best to walk tightly between hamming and serious acting. Late Alia: Unfortunately, the title role is terrible. She has a short screentime, and she does not make full use of what she does. Poor makeup and special effects does not help; Occasionally he seems to be speaking through a Voiczox. <br /> <br /> This film is going live directly on the video until the death of Aliyah last year. With the possibility of people watching his final film, Warner Bras released it for general publications. Otherwise, this was one of the movies in the video shops, but you can say that it is going to be terrible. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that such films will continue to be created. Wander around the teen rom-complexe or kiss that style with movies like "No Another Tiny Movie". If Hollywood has a market to exploit, then it needs to be done. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie is not a movie. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie then they will follow it. It's business. But what is my biggest concern is that people will actively go to the movies and pay for it! I think it is the biggest reason for the world film: the first of the film industry and the second in entertainment, or is it one of the ways? The only people who can decide that the audience is If you like and are confused by good movies, then clean up this turkey.
