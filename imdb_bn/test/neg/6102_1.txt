It is clear that the director, the writer and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or practicing people. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene where the Rubbish baths of women, when a naked woman bathe, then she puts her hand on the head of a woman. There and his blessing. These laws are full of narcotics, in this scenario there are only a few broken laws: Modesi, there is a woman, when a woman will not enter the bathroom of Rabindranath. <br /> <br /> Indirect contact, a Robi <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, conventional bathing laws require the whole body to contact the bath water directly; This means that someone can not contact the bather, certainly not pushing them down! <br /> <br /> There was more to the scene, just as 13 times was like dunking (the idea that came from?) The rest of the movie was a total mistake. It can be scary ignorance!
