I have seen a few moments behind the first few episodes and felt that I can not take it anymore. The awesome looking war scenery I've ever seen in my life is the worst. About one-third of each episode dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "mighty" war. I know that the continuation of the struggle of the era is not good to compare with today's standards, but it is ridiculous. They do not even try to look realistic. Flash Gordon, who rarely looks like a warrior, uses his drunken pace and bare fist to find four or five with knives, guns and other weapons. Give me a break There is also a scene where he works a bit like water. Basically there are similar scenes for every episode. In the rest of the episode, I do not remember anything else. It's basically seen out what I've got like the years of science fiction about 70 years ago.
