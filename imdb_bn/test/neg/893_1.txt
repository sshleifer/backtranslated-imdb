I did not see the first three, but I know they're even better ... trash It's about a kid who is a kid. How nice. Amazing word (sarcasm) So what NOOO! It starts with a child lying in bed and she is awake to her mother. Therefore, the child pretends to be sick, so he will not have to go to school. He went to his uncle's house and surrounded some people and shot a group. I do not smile at all times while watching this trash. I can not imagine that someone sat down and wrote down the conversation "Man, disc! @ # $ Worship is big, no!" Makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I saw this idea that it might be bad, but usually it looks good to me watching a bad movie because it gives me some fun to do. This just hate me. Two Thomas down!
