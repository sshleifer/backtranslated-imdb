Sagege's guns (video title) is a dirty cheaper, barrel spaghetti west of the west, where a massacre survivor killed his brother and left him dead, caught by them in a town controlled by his broken boss. <br /> <br /> Despite a lot of violence, it leads to both negative character and almost neutral and colorless with no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> Lead actor Robert Woods lives with his name. Wood and uncharismatic performance that fails to produce any warmth or sympathy. In other words, the spectators are not really the main reason that he is the hero. <br /> <br /> The worst scenario (in my opinion) is an annoying dance scene where a female heavy and terrific song unsexy German accent. This is the worst scene of Blazing Saddles and the worst scene here!
