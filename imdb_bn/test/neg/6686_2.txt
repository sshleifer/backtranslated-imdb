There were many campaigns in this movie and it seemed to be great in advertising. Sad, bring it to 2, bring it to the original original 3's unexpected glory. There is shameless stereotyping across the film. The lines given by the actors were humiliating for all the nations involved in the film. Haden Pantyee's performance and cheerleading had both sub-surfaces. There were several scenes because the scenes (lines, plots, etc.) were so stupid because I was embarrassed for Cast. My recommendation to a future makers is that you have to hire a cheerleader in the movie and teach them to work because Cast "acting" was terrible and the lack of cheerleading was making them completely vain in the film. Just great character: Kirresha
