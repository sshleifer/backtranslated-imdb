I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I was 20 years old and there were many ways for me in this movie. I could not imagine to take a child in this movie, teenager, or (especially) this movie. It was crude and objectionable. I was completely confused by its PG-13 ratings and the preview that I saw it. I've basically seen a preview for Nickelodeon, and I thought it was pretty (probably I do not remember the exact preview). Plus, Drake Bell (the main character of the film) is on Nikkeodian television show which targets Preeten and young teenagers. I do not really think that the content of the movie was as risky. Before I went about it should be researched more about it. However, I'm hopeful that parents can see their kids before reading this film because it has Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie, your kids or teenagers. The rating should have been there. There are lots of sexual references, drug references and annoying events throughout the film. Examples: Drake Bale is attacked by sexually related animals, several scenes that hold the breasts of the male, make a lot of abuse, Drake Bell vanilla frosting (or something like that) uses a bong to smoke, in which people knock, hit and hit. . Movies, and an elderly lady and her dogs get scattered. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was generally demeaning really for women. The film was created by a person who created the Dairy Movie series, so that you have to say something there. Please note that these types of movies can give wrong ideas to all types of sex, drugs and violence of children and adolescents. Most children and adolescents can not distinguish between fool or joke and reality. <br /> <br /> There are my humor. I also know that the humor that was in this movie was the norm of his style. But I find the possibility of watching kids and teenagers watching this movie. <br /> <br /> For the overall quality of the film, I do not think it was original or fun. It pulled in part and some of the humor was just bound and painful. Acting was not bad, considering how bad the script was. If you are an adult or an adult looking for a fun movie, leave it or rent it.
