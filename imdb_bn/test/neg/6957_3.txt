First off, this movie leaves you according to a lazy mood. You do not know what to think. While killing his son, you do not feel bad about the character of Kinesh (which was mostly due to bad editing). The scripts were very soft. No matter the circumstances as you watch them. Soundtrack, or lack there (if it was not good enough to even remember) it does not help a bit. The performance of this movie is only wonder undercurrency. It was not better than Caine if there was par. If Sarkis had killed him, perhaps the story would have been better. Because of quite a bit you do not feel any kind of release in climax. I just feel the lack of feeling, if I think. Basically this movie is widely lacking to draw. Leave the isolated audience across the whole thing.
