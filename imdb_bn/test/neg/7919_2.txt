I think this is a frustrating series. I miss many old characters (King Gatere, Anne Marie, etc.), and I do not like it that the letters of the original voice also do not return the letters. Charlie lost many personalities, and the first of the Claves was not half worse than Carroll Red. If you are a great Adjust fan like me, it's valuable to see how the story is going, but do not rely on 5 stars in your book.
