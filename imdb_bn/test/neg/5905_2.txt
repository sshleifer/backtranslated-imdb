The film began with the main character of the hospital ward, in which two orderls were present. The unconscious main character heard a voice that the orders are gay Orderly kiss I saw this in a DVD version and I suspect that this is supposed to be funny ?? This is called "comedy" in the DVD case, and it is going on in the end. If I had seen it in movie theater, I would probably laugh at the audience part because it is so funny ?? And because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. It's interesting to think about what's funny and what not, though, this movie unfortunately delivers the arguments about not only what it does. <br /> <br /> Some interesting people can create bright brains, people like Ernst LÃ¼bitz, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks prove this to be true. But you have to know ?? Mechanics ", I think Director and co-writer Danny Levi is not bothered about that mechanics, he thinks that some things are simply funny, actually two orders kiss on a person in gay and coma. Do not make mistakes, some people Can be funny, Danny Levi is not for me, no matter what. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that I can not see any reason the original oak I did not understand why two brothers of West Germany, a former Jewish Jew, a third-class carbon copy of First Eddie Felson in East Germany disrespected each other, they are both blue characters, and their children are interwoven with sexual attraction. Thinking (well, one is now a lesbian but with her cousin, the girl's daughter But even this cruel relationship? If they are some embarrassing - just come as an excuse, because the authors can not bring any good things. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad, it really feels good to the Udo Semel Although he reminded me that a former Chancellor, Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) is more than a respected Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not really bad, but perhaps the Levitie has to be stopped for film management, which could leave script writing to someone else. Now I have heard that he did a comedy about Hitler. Hey, brother!
