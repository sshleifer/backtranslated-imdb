How Jackie Chan films are bigger than the needs. For example, to be honest, no claim? This Jackie Chan has such a name in him, I suspect he does not even know, and he is a race driver. For example, he drives 10 miles per hour and then the footage gets brighter, so I can do all the stunts myself. Jackie Chan, who is trying to assassinate a bad guy during the general elections, is a nation, we can finally see how cruel this production is. The fight for the moon, especially in the casino scene, but when we talk about special effects, dear Lord. And all this happen in the nation? Stupid And here it is not safe for the driver, there is also no concrete wall around. And do not start it on any kind of horror story, I mean, it's Hong Kong, perhaps it was written in a gun fight directed by eight-year-olds, but still, what a mess. I liked Chan as the next guy, probably I saw "Rush Hour", but his agent's disabled cousin would really take good care of his project.
