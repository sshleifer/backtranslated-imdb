Trading on the success of the 1975 hit, this film is a cheap story of a plantation where Masa falls down with the slave woman, and Mrs also falls short with the big black stud and Messa's son. Actually, it is going down so much that I really do not know why someone is concerned about wearing clothes. So, if you want to see that white women are surrounded by their naked bodies, or you like a movie with tits with every five minutes exhibit, then this one is for you. There is a funny / sad story here, but it does not interfere in running on all hot sweaty sex planting so that it comes at the very end.
