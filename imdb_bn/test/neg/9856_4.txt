This episode is distorted. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the episodes of "Next Generation" and "Viagra" in the last few years and now I see "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Until this episode. I saw on the horrible screen of destruction of character and entertainment. It's like an attempt at slapstick. <br /> <br /> It does not make characters but throw them on a limb - and leave the audience gasping. This is nothing to create the series. <br /> <br /> Why is it allowed to go in the air? What was it written? What was the instruction? Was it the producer? We probably do not know. <br /> <br /> But bad bad apple I do not think bad. I say that it is only one hope.
