At my home a matinee on Saturday. I went with an old friend (about 12) and let my mom let me go because she thinks that the film will be right (rating G). I was assaulted by a shocking denial to make strong music, the image of Stornz, no plot and no ideas. We'll go through half because we're tired, frustrated, and our ears got hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a revival theater after 22 years. My opinion has changed - it even works! Basically I was still in everything to hate about it and the film was very 60 ... and has been badly dated. I got all the little jokes ... very bad they were not funny. The constant change in tone got quickly annoying and there is absolutely nothing to get a firm firm. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavily on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, SUCK (and I like them) all the Munkey songs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Only for the former Hypiper ... or you threw stones. I give this 1.
