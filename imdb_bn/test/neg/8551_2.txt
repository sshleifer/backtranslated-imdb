A lot of actors have a multitude of good cinema roles in their soul. Some, a boxing fight. Others, probably a couple <br /> <br /> Then there's Linda Blair. "King of ghosts". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />, "Oh boy: Oscar for best actress, I'm here!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just like other women in prison, they used for cheap in the 70's, this is actually a name that you can recognize. John Vernon has played Deen ... I mean, Warden (What did he say to the contractor with a hot tub in his office?), Stella Stevens pop up, even Henry Silva and Luisa Moritz have shown how bad it is for the job. <br /> <br /> And especially, for our heroine, Sibin Danning, both of the elderly captives who go towards poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil acts as sybil and everything is perfect Sybil. Forget about what a terrible movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> About <br /> <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and another for trying to pass Linda Blair as a gender symbol. Whatever may have possessed them (it?)?
