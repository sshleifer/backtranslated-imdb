What can be said about a movie like three weeks for two weeks? Nijjil's hero of Japan begins with an identity crisis (save a Shinobi), which joins the United States (a slave named Sam), in a maritime western activity (a French / Japanese Native American named Julie), the victim hunts the gold of the pirate , And then return to Japan in a war of war. The film does not have any sources where it is running; I modeled each scene after the last movie of the director he watched. If you are going to watch this movie, then I propose to rent a subtitle so that you and your colleagues can openly discuss how to talk to the movie talking to the movie openly. The director was watching the film while making the film - Finale Gayes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Gunies, Tinj Mutant Ninja Kurtop, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments -. /> Interest notes - Fear of the most fearful inspirational lines. About 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the movie, the lead character only enjoys an American villain, and to finish the pain, a head of the VC, such as the hero has declared, "Let's go back to Japan", and that sorrow continues in another week.
