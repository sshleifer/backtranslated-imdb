It's a fair movie, good for watching one off. This plot works well for such a picture, which is an amazing act of acting, which is slightly better than normal for this type of flick. <br /> <br /> 'Special' effect 'Sunny - unconvincingly wobbling on a transparent monster and a blatantly polystyrene / papier mache hand cable on a bit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
