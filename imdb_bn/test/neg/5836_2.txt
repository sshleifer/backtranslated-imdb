Terrible movie Just terrible This film is about something worse than the bad women in the movie prison. Then it's going to be a B-movie version of Alien. In this case B-movie means meaningless lingerie and lingerie added. Oh and many other footage similar to the same company as used in the other two films by the same company (including women in prison schtick). The only thing to save this movie from 1/10 is that I actually saw more bad movies. Many, and not many, but bad.
