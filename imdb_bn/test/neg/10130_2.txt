Disney Channel shows kids younger than posts. It suits them well It's not funny, the years that I've seen are more stereotypes than the actors, and everything about this show bothers you and rolls your eyes. Why you want to know? This show is not just airtime waste, "actress" Selom Gomez looks like a pig. Jack T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. The character of David Henry will be visited by a strip club and it will be lost. Also, the show's author is inappropriate. In one episode, the security forces are called "sir" by one character and each is referred to as a woman. <br /> <br /> Hello? It is called proofreading and editing. For a while, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone promoted the new "Fourth Bloody Saga" campaign? Disney wanted their own version of Harry Potter thing in their tile-to-win. Except for one million times the laser. Weaverry Place Movie Wizards ?? Think about it for a minute. The family goes on vacation and wants freedom from the parents of the 16-year-old daughter. The same plot from proud family movie, etc ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How many years? Silen Gomez before showing her tits? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows all the cones .. Hack Writer .. Hack Show ... Today's young man's mind and pattern ...
