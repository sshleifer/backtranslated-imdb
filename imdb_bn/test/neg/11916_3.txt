I used to read through the reviews for the past six hours and I do not know how to laugh or cry. ADJL Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly Adaddarents, on the other hand, there is no way that the secret witch is world-wide, which is too close. Also, there is no way ADJL is animated. Anime has many drawing styles (and some say, as Plot and Japanese origin), ADJL is not an anime in any way, so it does not say and if you are looking for something like Enemy, on the other hand, like Tin Titans and Avatar <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ADJL usually. It's just like other Disney shows. The child of a proud protagonist who knows everything that he thinks and is not bothered to listen to bigger people, and does the same mistake. Best friends sidekicks Repeat plot with a hint of a curve And siblings compete. Can they ever create a character whose brain has and is not full? Children can not respect their father? They do not think anything different with the plot? Could they not get along with siblings and hate each other? ADJL is very generic, because your bad guys are defeated and come back again and have full hatred, there is no background for their hatred. Come on, you'll think that anyone at least 30 years old will be able to become 13 years old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To watch ADJL, it looks like watching anything else on TV on this day. And again. Nothing special, new design characters and a small concept that has been used repeatedly.
