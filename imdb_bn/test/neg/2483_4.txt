This show was a promising start in contrast to 'Ocean 11', but it was developed in a shallow display of T & A. In fact, according to my younger brother, only good part of the show <br /> <br /> The first season was the best, it was a new and interesting thing to fly away soon after. The only freedom fighter of this event is James, the other actor's lack of light. The lack of character depth and they seem incredibly selfish and generally non-preferred people. To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like a casino windwell" In my opinion, the way of fertility, the beauch was a good way, and more realistic.
