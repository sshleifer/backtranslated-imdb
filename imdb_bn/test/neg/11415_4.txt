The original scene of Rodrigo García "Nine Lives" comes when Cassi Spassak is hiding in a hotel room where he is having a relationship with Eden Quinn, finds a nature document on television, quinn notes the contest of these things - the display footage is edited in a scene, The predators and preys are thrown together to capture at one moment - all actually connect b Visible to: emphasize the connection. Nine short characters that make up this movie occasionally spread to each other in the story, but none of them really could connect. To prepare for a violent clash with her disgraceful father, a woman was later seen working in the hospital room where another woman was preparing for a maltetmeter. A man who went to the old friend of a supermarket and saw how his life should be hosted later, his present wife, the dinner party for a sad couple García keeps some of his letters in front of each other, but the next story is not really the same as before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, surprisingly, was ignored "his A," was a short story structure and overlapping character, but they were few and there was more room for them to breathe and grow. The rogue premises of "Nine Lives", which each of the nine stories has been taken singly, in real time, sometimes does not allow the film to build any real dramatic tension or momentum. This is a fairly visible ugly movie. Internal shots are often annoying and difficult to see, other scenes - especially one where a girl goes back to the room to talk to her unusual parents - is boring by the camera-work. It seems to have a reputable history of managing Garcia's third film and television, the aspect of this film is rather surprisingly amateur. Like fellow filmmaker-child-great-great Rebecca Miller, Garcia (Gabriel Garcia Marquez's son) often gives attention to the writings and character of his films for the frustration of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The personal scene is touching and even affected. I like to kiss Jason Issue, Robin Wright Pane's pregnant belly kiss. And Joe Muntaga lamented his wife lovingly as soon as she fell pre-surgery. And Cassi Spesk has stolen some happy moments from his life and returned with his daughter's phone call to Aden Quinn. But the film seems to be more like an exercise than the real drama ("the things you can only look at and look at"). We are just watching people work.
