It defiantly fares a DVD movie. I'm a big fan of cast members but storytelling does not really hold me. Do not expect "Oh brother where you art" in a shape or shape In my opinion the most interesting part is when the hero of war explains what will happen in Argon. It looks like they were trying to copy the expressions of funny words from Cloney "Oh brother where are you art", but you can say that they are trying for it. John Krasinski was a bright spot and was tough all over. Rene Zeljger plays the role of an initiative journalist who wants to do for the story. Overall it is a movie worth watching at home.
