This movie is so bad But its so bad that I was laughing off my ass. For people who love movies, do not watch this. I recommend for those who like good and bad movies. Story line shaky, scripts scary, acting medieval horrible. Soundtrack across the movie was corny but I loved it. Cool Capsfeed was a plus. Haha "If it can be bleeding, it can die." Fight scene crack me up I think they spend more time than any other seo, in most cases the war scene was quite clear. I often feel that if this film was good then it was not for f / x ... It was still a scrapbook. Eyes things were corny. And how the chick was eating the stomach in the kitchen, where they could do something to actually eat something or at least put more of the fake blood on its face. And the lighthouse blast disappointed me. I could get the terrible computer synthesized stuff instead of the real fire. And the end was so expected, although they were actually surprised what I actually did though, what they could do. So overall. ID tells this Crappie movie as far as a classic go. Below 5
