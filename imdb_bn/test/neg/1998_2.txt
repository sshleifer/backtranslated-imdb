I usually like the cache of his movies, the real credit for the Starship Troppers. But this video hired the cover of the SS OOOO box. In my local video, people rented it to its (PRAAPAS) bug as the vampire's hopes, and instead they rebuilt a bad lone channel. It was a great possibility, and it fell flat too. Hopefully I could have written a good story line and screen play. Why is it in every science fiction film, they (cast) continually refers to a solar system as a galaxy? Is this script writer or writer not awake in the science class? This is my pet, but a single star with a solar system, a galaxy has several clusters of the solar system. It is referred to as a can of six caps in a can of coke. It even makes the word dumber.
