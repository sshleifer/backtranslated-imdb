The DVD version published by the crash movie was done very badly. The mastering engineer became drunk, was not asleep nor even in the house. It seems that it has been composed by almost a tenth generation copy and almost half the film, audio synchronization disappears. The dialog audio is behind 10 or 15 seconds. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, save your money. In 1973, I think of seeing this movie in the theater. Also, under the title "When Takewoondo Strikes", the VHS copy of this movie looks good from the DVD, but the rest of the minute's movie is "missing". Where is the original camera negative?
