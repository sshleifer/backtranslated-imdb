Well, some people might see a bitch assassin assassinated by a trashy rubber and a PVC dressed killer. If you want it, and you wear a cloak, point your teeth and think that the name of Lilith Silver is great, you will see a fine movie. <br /> <br /> If like most people, killer dressed assassin, cracking rubber with huge cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you smile, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so much that I almost cried. Frustrating acting, conversation and plot can be dead and loving, it can help to make a good fool, than Dracula ... <br /> <br /> It tries to be quiet and complete, and it is all successful to do. The scene is ridiculous. Even the lead-on lesbian scene is funny (how did they * boot up fast? * They were preserved here * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good films. If you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall on it, check it out .... It's not good, it's just bad.
