I hired this movie today ... ever bad movies. It was a total waste of time and a terrific story. Acting was terrible, especially by the "Psi" actress. He was ridiculous, so ridiculous. I can not say that stupid reason that he was not playing his bad or only in the first place of character. I could not even get my mind covered on how terrible and near-near this whole movie was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Move to the right! It's a waste of time and money. Hack, if someone gives me money, then I will not download this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it does not deserve a "1" too. I want to give it a "0"!
