Alexander Ripley wrote a terrific series in Margaret Mitchell's Masterpiece book published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sell their rights and allow for a huge amount of money to write junk book more than Alexandre Ripley's Barber Courtland's romance novels. I was a great fan of Margaret Mitchell's book and Fake Factor of Alexander Replay was written for cash only for money. <br /> <br /> Although I always admired the talent played by Joan Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really terrible film. The scripts are horrific and full of clich√©s. Bell Watling as Anne Margaret's Cameo was so terrible that I wanted to snatch him. <br /> <br /> The only profitable thing in this movie is San Bienne, who is a sexy, French villain - Lord Fenton. The performance of San Biena illustrates the lines of "The Man You Love to Hat" and an unsafe sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But in the first half of the movie Shan Bieni, you will have to suffer painting with an incredibly long boring script with an incredibly long 6-hour film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money in this movie, unless you're a fan of hard season and see its amazing performance.
