I ripped off with this purchase seriously. Other posters thoroughly cover the failure of this poor poor film. My DVD that I bought was credited with a credit card credit of 1978 Piranah Poster Art in front of the film 'Direction directed by Crave Dante'. Etc. I was really frustrated to find the disc's wrong movie. I'm actually a fan of lots of bad movies. Always have something funny or some of them have some of the most soft. This is not the picture! I'm actually going to spend $ 3 dollars to return these two dollars DVDs for the principle of the thing. Blatant lies packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. All at no redeeming reason. BORING !!! It's not even worth checking out to see how bad it is. Seriously
