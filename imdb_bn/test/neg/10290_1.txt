I'm not sure who recommended me to surveillance, but I think I think: "Fat Guys at Movies." The person said, they were amazed at how big they were and they were one of the ghost / annoying movies. (If I'm imitating and doing it only by memory, so if I forgive me, I'm misquoted.) Anytime, I decided to visit it. So to see the one of the most terrible, anticipated and stupid movies I've ever seen, take full blame for my own wrong idea. Strangely, I suspect that I've never said a movie "stupid" but it seems to be the first word that seems to be almost a third, and finally I was in my mind. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Unbelievable firmness and reaction, incredibly dead brain characters (writers or actors may blame, or I'll blame them both) and extremely bad acting. I believe Bill Polman as the President of the United States rather than FBI agents. (Of course, there is a reason for this, and I will partly go into it.) And if you can not mark the so-called "packing" in the first 5 minutes, turn it off, then you must have delayed the theater or watch it late. I went home. Do not worry, five minutes after the "Twist" will say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But there is more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt police like blow tires for their own pleasure. Maybe maybe more? Oh, yes, there is a family, probably not, but there are four people, one boy, one daughter and one adult couple. The girl says that seeing the dead people in six sense she sees things with much less convincing beliefs. I have to be more than what I have mentioned! That makes a movie interesting! There may be many supplements that may not be / could be the way! Okay, then I'll continue. Our FBI agents have fooled me which makes me laugh Firstly, the dealer's Audi suddenly called a robbery by buying a pair of robbery robbery. A wonderful person's policeman who has definitely kept for comic relief, who is always fighting angry / suspicious police. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Iranside who did not just take his performance, he rarely read it. <br /> <br /> This work is not anymore. They all are called attendance or flashbacks, and believe me, you lose all the ideas of care after starting the first of many sub-slots. In addition, the reaction is that this is some of the worst of all of these letters. I think I mention most of the police, but mainly the girl who has not lost or lost her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid stupid movie is frustrating. It is very important as its interventionist, he said, it was not until his exposure was confined to the Giuseppe's stories. And what's with the title? Surveillance? Oh i understand it It is because it used only 1/50 sub-slot in the film interview. Since it is so random, it can also be called COP car, bullet or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrible mess.
