Curiosity and terrorists represent the President representing the hostility of the 'hospital' Paddy Chefski's brand of ridicule, which spreads in disguise as mockery. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Hamdard director Arthur Hiler, this ridiculous script is visually ugly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> C. The only wonderful act, he was born to play, 'The Hospital' was a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ironically, Scott's performance makes a discovery of visitors. His magnetism keeps them watchful when they close the VCR more proficiently and cleans the clutches, look at the clouds, or see the replay of 'Biaoch'. <br /> <br /> Of course, anyone who has invested emotionally and set-up _ Modern medicine has apparently gone amok _, will be deceived by helpless pay, where Chanskyi says that system works are just fine, so leave your carping. <br /> <br /> The first half of this film is an entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. Before it was cleared, Chafsky gave Scott some good lines as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in. <br /> <br /> Cats, alcoholics, cruel, Scott's Dr. Herbert Buck, who knows him well, isolate them, and he has silk to keep them alienated. Chifsky's worldwide, of course, hippies make a magnet for the half-aged dog. <br /> <br /> Rig Struggle in adjective, long-haired, long eccentric, brilliance and almost all-down Diana 'girl' part! The British rig is miscast as a south-west free spirit, but no other actress will strive alongside as well. It is good to have some good waste discharges, the rig can not cross a script that is not interested in any character except the bark, or a visit beyond the great philosophy. <br /> <br /> For the fans of George C. Scott, this is another star turn and price observer. For black comedy fans, please turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For somebody else, do not bother.
