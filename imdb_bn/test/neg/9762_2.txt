I loved the novel because I always wanted to watch the movie, but I was warned because I heard that the film was a stinker. It's about Fouls wrote this script and I could follow it even after the fact that I read the novel thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is effective - jering, junking, and completely inappropriate - at an attempt to break the movie mystery or mood. I suspect the director must be very guilty, even Michael Kain was terrible in that and he has already done a great job in ALFIE a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The "mystery" book is not well translated on the screen. I would like to see someone restoring this one.
