This film had all the elements of a great adventure film, but it disagreed at almost every stage. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore in the cast list is usually a sign that it is not going to be anything more than the medieval period, because Moore has always played a role and she can not work. But this film was also Ian Holme and Lee Marvin, and based on Wilbur Smith's book, so I thought, I saw the DVD to sell in the door box when I give it a chance ... <br /> <br /> This is a Was wrong. Suddenly the soundtrack has decreased in the middle of the roll. The scene showed a horrific thought in the sea with a German crew. This bad edit was a sign of things to come, but the horrific scenes were interesting enough to see me. Special effects were good, and the crew wore proper uniforms and spoke German, indicating director at least to give historical attention to the attention. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I was watching, and then Moore appeared and my dreams were confirmed. Bad acting, closed lines, clearted cinematography and cheap humor ... But worst, the light-hearted thought of the film is a great effort to mix serious plays and tragedies. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The picture suddenly disappears and gets worse at the beginning ?? In the middle of a relay.
