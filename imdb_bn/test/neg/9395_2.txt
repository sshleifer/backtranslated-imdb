This movie was completely irrational, uncertain and dissatisfied. Apart from some wonderful shots in Italy, there is nothing to suggest this movie. Naturally, Hollywood has suddenly grabbed the wrong conclusion from existence - the person you meet with _next_, you are sleeping after knowing for a few hours, _he_ of course, Mr. Wright must be. For comedy, there is something in the film, but I can not see that someone could possibly label it romantic _moddy because almost three-quarters of the movie is frustrating! My recommendation? Leave it in the theater, wait until the DVD comes out, then leave it there too. I want someone to give me two hours back to waste this bitch, drivel, drops watching.
