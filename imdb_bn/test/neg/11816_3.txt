Most of the headlines let you know what you got. This is a grade-C hello but I was not optimistic. The low budget 1972 action movie was clearly illustrated in the Philippine film, but a story from the exploitant film expert Eddie Romero, originally from Jonathan Demem ("Lambs Silence" and "Philadelphia"), but some anonymous third world countries. Hooker and short-time drug dealer Danielle playing, played the first half of the Blacksploion Superstar Palm Grey's title role, and the long forgotten Margaret Markov is a political revolutionary like the other half, Karen Brent, Patty Hart, with whom her fellow-colleagues overthrow the tyrannical local government Be done Naturally discriminatory to each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they unknowingly wear bright yellow mini-scars as uniforms. Running by an orbital warden and lecherous maternity, the prison is a long shower scene and some half-hearted cat is an excuse for the war, because Lee and Karen are pressed against one another. Of course, they escaped but La "The Different Ones" hugged together and continued the kittens until they attacked some of the nuns to steal their habits. Meanwhile, various groups of helpless men are usually looking for the leucolic drug lord Lee who stole $ 40 from him, but rather looking for a revolving revolutionary Karen, and the unfinished police (who humiliated the drug owner for their secret disclosure Tolerates). Not saying, everything finally comes to head but most of the Filipino women do not have the nude before, a dog worn by Karen's children's panties, and the worst of the 1970s (most of a beer-rebel revolutionary, a direct face of Header Hart). Rather there is a sad end, but it is indeed tragic that how many of the possible black comedy were missed in this laughable boring exercise. Sadly, due to the frustration of Greyhair this frustration, his character is not allowed to do much beyond dealing with "Jim", when Markov is an amorous blonde who is trying to be credible with me faithfully. Since no one shows any talent for acting, the rest is not just a notice, balding, in addition to Sid Haggay in the bug-eye, who uses his mental psycho like a drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an additional.
