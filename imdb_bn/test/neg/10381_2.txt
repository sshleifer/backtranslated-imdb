Blackwater Valley Exxis is a movie about a stranger young girl. Do you have any plots to describe? Emily Rose's Exorcist and Exorcism Two Awesome Films Classic (IMO) Blackwater Valley Exxisity (BEV) is not. Not by a long shot. Exorcist could not be as a terrible as it is a low budget copy. From the beginning to the end it felt like a "Made for Saifai Channel". This is a film that will be hijacked and ridiculed in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or similar shows). <br /> <br /> Make-up and impact was absolutely ridiculous. The acting was terrible bad. There was not a single performance that did not roll my eyes or giggling. Oh, probably for Jeffrey (re-animator) for Combos as Sheriff. The script was not terrible but it was certainly not something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the film seems to have been given more attention to those who are asleep, who are with the monster in another room. Oh, I learned something from this movie. Apparently if your teenage girl is possessed by a demon, then all you have to do is lock in their room. Come on. And if your daughter does not think too much then do not worry too much, because of this it talks in funny voices, eat rabbits, tries to lower you and keeps fog machines on their beds. There is nothing to worry about who else. Obviously he was with a low budget de-list dancer. <br /> <br /> There was no terrible work done by crucified sexual intercourse, painful body distortion, and even a bounty like A-list demons. <Br /> <br /> Completely ludicrous movie. There is even a discounted rental price. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2.
