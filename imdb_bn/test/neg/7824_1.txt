This picture was terrible. I thought it's okay but it has become worse and worse. The scenes seem to be heading from other safe predictive rom-less at the beginning, but it disappears at the time of reaching home. There is no depth between the templates and the only person who is trustworthy near to any other place was Tom, even though he was so confused, after a while he bothered me. The dialogue is ridiculous and the film's structure is almost completely unincorporated. In a humiliating endeavor, the author / director introduces a new character or event in almost every view, which makes it very confusing to keep track of what is happening, which is realistic. The plot is just an excuse for the movie: the guy likes the girl, the girl knows the girl, destroys the house, the girl gets the girl sitting in the house. Complete waste of time.
