Do not believe in betrayal. If you have high expectations or have expected any degree of this DVD, you might be disappointed. Even humorous and gifted Steve Carroll can not save this poorly written, excessive long stupid spy flick. Purists (fans of original TV series), this movie carries a little similar to the original characters and effects. Agent 99 and Maxwell (excluding their names) are not just the same characters. The original has different isolated references, but it is not enough to convince the fan that it is more than a bad shadow of the TV version. Do not be disappointed with those who are not familiar with the original TV series, but you will get annoyed. There are also several cheap Hollywood political shots (really a kind and usually so for a select year). We left after the first hour and was not alone. Some are left after 20 minutes.
