I bought a DVD from a big bin for $ 4.99, thinking I would share some documentary pearls which would actually show the broad footage of the Karakoram mountain and especially the K2. Fast-forwarding through the film, I reached the climatic scene, where the mountains captured Mount Weddington at the height of 13,260 feet in the coastal region of Canada. One of the few boozos made to climb K2 is clearly no idea how the actual mountain looks like - should be assured by its friend and ascendant partner that he has told a partner he can not bring to his companion the mountain. In a film courtroom, it has been said that 27 or more people have lost their lives in 2, you might think that the quarrel over the question has taken a minute or two hours for a few basic events, but the shirt seems like a preparation for this scale, Reinhold Messner When good enough, its bottom. To be honest, I did not see the whole thing. What I saw made me cringe. They say that what you pay for. At $ 4.99, I got leaked.
