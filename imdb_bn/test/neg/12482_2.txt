It's just awesome. I spent watching this dreck at 80 minutes per second regret. I think it is supposed to be a comedy, but I do not think many smiles, except for some hilarious inconsistencies and relentless glaring errors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . That's the whole plot, and that's all that really happened. When Lustar secretly started making a phone call from an unknown unknown person, then the plot is trying to plot his taunts about his secret, but it is so badly implemented, you can not really understand what's going on. The continuous continuation of the death of Lester's rich widows is quite brutal, but apparently decorated as a comedy. One sequence is a woman bludgeoned with a wooden poles and then shoved into an oven. It is also very cruelly portrayed, but it is played against blaring the Big Band Waltz music, with face to face Lester and comedy throughout the whole. Another viewer killed the hunter when he continued singing Sriram Opera ... you have to believe it! Actually - you will not see it, actually I strongly recommend you avoid this flow. He did not know what Phooli wearing a hat, and there was no evidence of any fliers seen in his earlier career. One sequence is particularly annoying to me: When the publisher Lester suddenly realized that she had no shade. Falasi can not remember any visible representation of this incident on the screen, so at this moment she is the only actor, shadow and all actors! And thus hit the whole corner completely. Then there was zero budget for his effects, or he did not take enough care to think of any way to show it. Anyway, this whole project will give you a taste of how lame. I did not even understand most movies, and certainly there was nothing on the screen to show half time. Even the end was flat as a pancake. A real bud
