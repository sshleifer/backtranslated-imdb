Outside of Poland, many people did not have the opportunity to get acquainted with the great writing of the orrade Sapkosky. He is very popular for his fiction short story in Poland (I believe that none of them have ever translated it into English!). To make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of Sapkowski's book - a travel monster slayer, a man of extraordinary strenght and skill: he is quite beautiful in the cool guy in your favorite technician style. Unfortunately, nobody will illustrate this after watching the movie. The movie 'WizzyMin' is a collection of only random scenes, which contain other characters from Widzamin and Sapkosky's writings, but not exactly the dramatic movements of plot and origin. Some scenes in the movie show attractive nude women that did not add any quality to the event. The movie gets worse and worse every minute and even does not meet the requirements of 'it really bad' section. If you're really into fantasdy and want to know something about wiedzmin, instead of reading the book.
