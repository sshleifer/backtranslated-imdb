I'll start by accepting the willingness to really enjoy the movie (military or other) played. I am a man But this drake was awful. I saw it for free, showtime or hbo and still I pay too much money. This was a prolonged period of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1, because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How does 5 or 6 of 52 give me a rating of 5 to 6 in my brain. Until they cast or crew all the families. It may be, this movie was so bad that many people survived ....... and thus, were very annoying. <br /> <br /> I repeat the sorry but 10 lines seem to be the lowest, which basically boils down to a warning ......... others expect to save 2 hour black holes, representing this movie. Believe me, look at a blank wall, they will be more action.
