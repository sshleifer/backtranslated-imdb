Hope to have a real disappointment floating with Sandra Bullock. The story starts right there. Her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. So he must rebuild his life. Here it might be gotten a storyline interesting or created, but you become bored with it. Justin who started moving back with her father and Harry Connick Jr. started hitting on her. Both are not real chemistry, yet you should have assumed that Justin has fallen in love with you. The movie ends in a way that you would like it to be, but you have not finished it like any other. They started well with this movie and could make some look for it, but instead it is a movie that you want to miss.
