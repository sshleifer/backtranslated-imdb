Do people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be amazed? It's not worth it for a moment. Many elements can easily scare people from the movie ... and it's not dinosaur! Tea Leni ... I think he's a great actress, but I'm sorry that he reached the bottom line at this time. I wonder if I can wake up a voice while shooting the movie .... Laura Darn ... she is okay, but why might not be more attentive in this movie, perhaps Sam can exchange smart dialogs with blue. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you heard something called facial expressions? Facebook, passion ..." She has been working hard on her! Sam Blue, no big deal Soundtrack ... that can change the record, or you're tired. My congratulations William H. He goes to Messi, who is a bad actor who has never seen a bad role .... Unfortunately he can not save the movie and can not even create dinosaurs for good computer creation.
