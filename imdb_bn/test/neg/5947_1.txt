Tom Seleck plays a missing son in a missing son "Pop" Don Amche and Tired Mother Anne Jackson, who creates his intuition (a guess) and after accepting his mobile home in Amber; Meanwhile, Selek's job is defeated by the FBI, his assets are frozen, his wife and children leave him, and his abusive sister and his brats come to stay there. Shining brilliant comedy-of-isles, old dorking dome in Amek, outside of reality contact. Perhaps a serious first draft (with amuck scenes like walking tricks with two children) was added to a second or third version of a silencer (scalp, bumped, pirated, and finally a toe and a losing lab!). However, it is a painful experience, and Sleigh's father suddenly makes a little sense of dedication; She hobbles around and howls in pain, but Mash maintains her heart. Mash this movie. * ****
