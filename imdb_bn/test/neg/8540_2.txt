Good old Jesse Franco! If you are looking for sleaze, shameless absorption and undemanding 200% gratuitousness, the director is always reliable choice. Jess has once again crossed herself with this completely trashy piece of jungle "adventure" once again. Let's face it, this film is an excuse to take an unusual warm (and under-age) actress Katzza Bierat closer to helplessness. This is actually a boring cause because the 16-year-old girl had to roam around a movie and nude in front of the whole cruise, and in particular the eyes of Frank was distorted! And it was not the first time, because both of them had already made "Linda". However, only if you are surprised: Yes, "Kilimanjaro's Diamond" is a plot, though it is very impossible. The opening is a plane on a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child, an African tribe crashed into cancer. I say vegetarian because they sometimes try not to consume the human body at one stage of the film. The absurd Scott declared herself a great White Leader and the girl started becoming beautiful and willingly white goddess. A few years later, a campaign has reached the middle of the jungle to return to civilization? Even more important - stolen some of the tribe's legendary diamond. It can be a compulsory and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco can not be clearly annoyed. Why the jungle chase series or bloody cannibalistic programs shot when you can easily keep your camera sitting in a tree with a hot young chick? Most jungle settings are easily portrayed in some garden, and there are lots of narrowly edited National Geographic wildlife footage to fill the gap in the gap. Behind the DVD, Tarzan describes "Diamond of Kilimanjaro" as an impressive, feminist and adult-oriented version. Yes, they put the sentence there because Katzza Beanert's character used to go from one tree to another using it several times.
