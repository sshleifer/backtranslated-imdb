Imagine: A high school. It is not without boarding school, and children around the kids. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And kids play all the thin, white, and gorgeous, exceptional tokens minor or fat kid "Kinky" outcast. And there are no reasonable rules, such as their co-habitation, nearby nuclear weapons, coffee stand, a sushi bar and a complimentary laptop for the student. Here is the story: A girl, Joe Brooks, PCA, all the former boys attend school. Absolutely perfect in perfect way, he wants to be smart, beautiful, slim, athlete, creative, and a perfectionist. Almost all the children want him, and every girl wants to be his friend. He came in for advice, everyone who saved the day with an easy-to-do plan and is simply wonderful. Something very bad makes her favorite. <br /> <br /> Can we believe that if we do not even come close to the fulfillment of Joe, we are bad people? Shows, nothing is his fault, and if someone is contrary to him, they are portrayed as bad guy (Logan). He may be a blurred, but at least he thinks of himself for some kind of brain that instead of agreeing with the princess itself for himself. <br /> <br /> His loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, average stupid ass, a secret crusher on it, Michael, Token Black guy (and the only actor on the set), Lola, an actress actress and annexic, snub airhead , Quinn, trick, and Logan, who have a soft side of rich corrosive. Yes, this program mainly publishes stereotype. <br /> <br /> But what are the harms to me, they all try to pretend normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while working on their own, even though they already go to a very well-established Boarding Boarding School and many more teenagers get better things that can afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, have hardly homework, and suntan almost every day. Wow, they have it hard! Any other problem? I'm very nice, rich, and stress free! I suppose Zoey 101 (what's for 101, anyway?) Nick's effort to actually try to portray teenagers. They did not like it, without catching a glimpse of reality, and the kids decided to give life like an ass on the mountains. <br /> <br /> However, the least set is beautiful.
