I was loving and series from Australia, I did not expect much from the American version of Kim and Kim, but I would see the first episode to see if it was really bad. Well, what to say. This is not something special. Selma Blair was just as Kim and actually had some good lines, though Molly Shannon did not speak well. The good thing about Jane Turner's talk is that when he talks to all his funny accent (like when he is called Umer or Knows), he sounds like his usual approach, but when Shannon goes on to pronounce it, he is acting and being the same as Turner Try And the show really missed Sharon or something to do to laugh at someone else, because Kal and Craig characters in this version are not really funny. <br /> <br /> So far the first episode has been broadcast and it is not obviously the standard of the Aussie version, though it was a separate name with a different name than the television show, it is not comparable to the Aussie version but it is probably better see you. But if you do not do anything else on Sunday night (or America Thursday night), you can not do much harm to see it, or if you're getting it, then some better versions of Australia.
