Although hypothetical and fabricated, do not have a bad movie. It is entertainment, which all hope to do Van Damme. The universal "Twin" device is reused (such as Van Van Damme's large number), but it is not annoying for fans of long time. Natasha is gorgeous and worth watching. Action is decent, but interesting but exciting for Van Damme. I can not suggest Van Damme fans and even those who do not think but do not think a action film with a good looking lead couple. Russian mobis is a great concept and topical for the day. Obviously, not his best film, but it means the worst.
