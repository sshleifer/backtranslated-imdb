The female cast of this movie is superb: your Linda Blair (excellent maturity), Julie Strain (who does not get too much talking lines - this is a good thing), Rochelle Swanisson (equally as a sweet innocent girl or an evil relative girl), Tony Naples and the most beautiful IMO among them, only the stunning Christian Ducati (how to lead a fool Larry poindeksatara, to qualify for the women's involvement in any sexual repealed). However, outside of the scope of this beautiful look and in some cases gifted women, the film can not offer a little. The plot is distracted and really is not going to last 15 minutes or so; And when Wynorski finally managed to create some mysteries, a ridiculous "fat" came to the end and destroyed everything.
