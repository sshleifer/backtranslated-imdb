In the case of the notorious and irrelevant movies I have always found this horrible curiosity. I've always enjoyed very bad-it's good flicks, you're seeing someone who really likes fast-filled kids' flats like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I saw it, and it turns out that all the critics are right about this one. It's a big flop, but unlike many flops, it's not enjoyable at any level, even for fun. It's just a boring cringe-fest through all the other way through the way. <br /> <br /> I have been warned. I could not hear. I'm a fool <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, do not waste time and money on this piece of trash.
