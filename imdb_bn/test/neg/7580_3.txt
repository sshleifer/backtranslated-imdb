I decided to watch this movie because it is referred to as "the greatest movie of all time", so what I hope. Unfortunately, what I found was not a terrible moment in the movie (and I'm a person who hangs very easily). The movie was nothing but a terrible clich√© and every time there was a jump-moment, it was incredibly obvious. The sources of this movie are music and diverse scenes that actually shot well (when it is finished, it opens the door and you see Tune in the image and when it comes back you see the ghost on its shoulders). Overall, this film really does not add anything new to the J-harr style and often lacks creativity and fear.
