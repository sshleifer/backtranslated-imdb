This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English It's the goal of young viewers going to English-language multiplexes. Basic Plot is similar to DDLL. Activated low average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they are drawing a wrong picture and are setting a bad example for young people. The tanika was taken from the bottle, or shot in about 5-6 times the movie. The director acknowledges even an alcoholic and does not have a drinking problem. He only worn a bikini through the movie, whether he works at a beach or at the wedding. The heroine of this movie seems to be doing this work, it seems that the youth feel acceptable to this behavior. <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra is starring Shah Rukh Khan's DDLJ role in Shah Rukh Khan About the gender parity of the movie. But instead of doing the right thing to do right, equality should not be about making the same mistake. In movies, if men are shown as a chronological connovance, this does not mean women should be treated the same way. <br /> <br /> While the film is made in a light-hearted funny attitude, it promotes many wrong social ideas. The name of the promotion, the "funny" part of the movie has no effect. Even in Canada, women do not wear such clothes, or they behave in movies. It is certainly not an image of Indian society or even Canadian society. Perhaps they have to give a denial at the beginning, "All the characters and events in the film do not reflect the fantasy and cinematography of the cities and the real culture of the country." The only good thing in this movie is length, 1.5 hours, thank God.
