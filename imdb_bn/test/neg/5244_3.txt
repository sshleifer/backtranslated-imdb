Another B-movie mainly for CGI-influenced, industrial soundtracks and some medieval imagery based teens. It is an abstract that the legend of the bauhulul is used unknowingly in this way. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I must admit that he is becoming worse as an actor and his film. If you are only a teenager, rent it.
