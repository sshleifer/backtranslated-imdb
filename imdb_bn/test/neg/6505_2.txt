OK, so it came back in 1993. Directed by Robert Eskov and written in writing by John Miglis, it is supposed to be based on the real story. Someone who believes hard to believe can be so stupid and true blind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, Tracy came to him like Polan, a little sex girl as a way to win his daughter. <br /> <br /> Come, phone sex, even the old cap of the 90's. Nobody can believe that the old line will fall for it. But Mr. Mathons began to buy it. And it costs a lot. The most difficult scenario was when he finally threw a demat from his apartment, keeping all his junky on the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then it was not to change the stupid lock. This trite movie was enough when I was. Dame wanted to try me on me so I could get the satisfaction of asking him to raise. <br /> <br /> I can give this brown one out of 100. So bad that I thought. It was there. I guess you can blame the actors. But they were terrible. They actually tried to play this with a straight face?
