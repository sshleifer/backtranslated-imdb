Emerald takes up the poor plot and stupid scripts throw down this show, along with trying to do well in the crew show show, who can save this paved, overheaded idiotic nonsense, playing Enmell Legacy as a TV chef from even food channels to Emilie Lawsuits, Robert Urech badly played the role of It was lost and sadly it was his last one-day (RIP), <br /> <br /> This was the worst show of 2001. And its worst series will be on the list <br /> <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for the emergence of Emergirl to make this sitcom, he even feels himself a stank. It's hard to believe that they did the same producer of women design that this mess did. <br /> <br /> TV review: 1 star
