This movie is a science f√ºr flip "Dopelgunar" (Contrary to our Earth's astronaut Sun, 'Counter Earth' crashes and in contrast to the Proletarian Vows of the Cold War of the world) and tried to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sinks without any traces, and the TV is probably good for it. <br /> <br /> Everybody here is perfectly suitable for 'Made for TV' here. Cameron Mitchell turns to his usual tough performance. Glenn Carbit (who is considered to be a poor man as John Saxon) who plays a bizarre person, whose existence creates a threat to the world for establishing 'world order' around the world. <br /> <br /> But with less budget and less power and incompatible script and set design and lack of any real imagination in cinematography, this sai-fi fighter is firmly equipped with launch pad. I will give an example: In the original template of this pilot ("Doplangarar"), the astronauts lost control of their landing vehicle in the thunderstorm, and their ship crashed into the really scary sequence (their ship is not clear to fly again). . Then two cosmonauts remain vulnerable to smoke due to smoking and live in the middle of their car, only through the load speaker, they are defeated by defeating face-to-face people. <br /> <br /> When the astronauts sit in their seats, "thunderbolt" sounds gradually slowly and steadily slowly and slowly Slow down. Even camera or set vibration). I saw episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Hourter Limits", which made more effort to set the mood and setting than the TV made for this TV. <br /> <br /> And that means, what is wrong with "Space in Strong"? No budget, no time, no imagination ... just makes the token gesture and hopes the future of sci-fi fan boys will be expected in the world. Sorry, guys, it does not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure all of them have just finished this work and gone and never thought without listing their CV. And that's what you will be, visitors. If you think, press, you once watched a TV movie called "Strong In Space" but it did not have any lasting effect on you and you can not think much about it.
