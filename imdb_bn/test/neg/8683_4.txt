In this Silly Symphony, he meets his cousin in the country's mouse town. Two glasses short explored in a small table. Animation is fine, where there is a lack of short-comedic humor. Perhaps I saw this "Dinner Table Adventure" among many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although this came first, I did not find it enjoyable.
