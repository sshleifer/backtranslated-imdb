The only reason I saw this movie for the second time was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl who was playing opposite Katie Holes. His name is Marisa Kauflan. Never heard before. He is amazing Impressive With an animated face, and a cute body, he was extremely watchable ... he got real, "Poianality" ... with Grace Kelly with joint exuberance more than a passing vibe. I think she is the Irish of Gene Pool, (my favorite female DNA), so she makes sense that she will be like the most beautiful Irish American. The film is not worth the mark, the classic beauty of Katie Holes meat. But Marisa Kaflan follows with your eyes. When the film was made in 1999, he was about 25 years old. It reminds me of another silly, worthless movie, of which only the beautiful girl is released. Seeing Jennifer Connie's first "career opportunity" was. Or "Griz II" for the first time I saw Michelle Pfeffer.
