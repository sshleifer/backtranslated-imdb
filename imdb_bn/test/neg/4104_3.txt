I do not want to look like a loot, but at one time the sudden death of butterflies by the tourists has changed so much in the timeline, how could that butterfly be burned by a piroclastic bomb? Still the volcanic eruption? And, how can the passengers pass on the same time, and they can not meet them before and after those who were in the same minute? It looks like a large number of people standing in front of the dinosaur Charging. <br /> <br /> Although I can take the idea of ​​time wave, I am seriously convinced that only a few changes will occur in the wave. As the wave crossed, the changes that took place, that happened once in the passage of the wave. So, the city's concept starts to be high with the jungle. And why all the jungle? The city's location was still in latitude and longitude and the plant was suitable for its geographical location on Earth. <br /> <br /> and an endless list of other unreasonable grief. <Br /> <br /> Wowahahah! This flock is a peculiar modest production value and a strange combination of complete ridiculous plot holes and incidental errors. <br /> <br /> Very bad. The idea of ​​an extraordinary story that was confused with stupid science. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on the production and even strapplepled provoidrad do not bother to see whether it is sort of something in the real sense?
