From 1835 to 1836, the Texas Revolution, which was followed earlier and immediately, has been featured in this 3-hour television movie, whose only release is Steven F. Offer light and tribute to Austin. Known as "the father of Texas", whose life story was prolonged by legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the "Santa Anna Anna Quarterly" storyline and the weak attempts to demonstrate a Mexican perspective with a fabulous Hispanic character, which show stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with a low budget battle scene such as Alamamo and San Jacinto, this film is recommended only for buffalers in real history who do not come from Mexico. His credits, the correct appearance of the Mexican uniform and romantic subconscious (other love triangle) does not take much time to screen. Overall, this film depicts the violent isolation movement by the Anglo-Saxon ethnic minority of Texas, which the General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna, considered "Napoleonic of the West" as a positive and revolutionary against so-called so-called Mexican oppression.
