To be ridiculous this movie will be a good word to describe. However, this film is not worthy of anything good for any reason, instead I will use the terrible word of God. <br /> <br /> The army centers on the courage of a bunch of eco-warriors to investigate hateful deeds. A semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget becomes faster. Michael Perer (a real actor! But Pinocchio was really a real son ...) Threw a bunch of fools out of this mind's hideous and gullible hunting scene. There are some vague attempts in shadow science that can explain the presence of the giant reptile, but it ensures the performance of the audience as well. <br /> <br /> If the viewer does not insult enough viewers, the features of what I say in the movie are "guns of never-ending guns". I have never seen Mikey Parat or his female side-kick change clip during the whole movie, but I can report positively that they can stop at least 40 rounds of any scene in which they need to burn their weapon. Forty rounds do not look like many, but we're talking about standard handguns here. I have 15 round clips, top. And remember, they never change the clips, nor even bear any extra barca. <br /> <br /> It's like a mobile phone, which removes movies in the eternal fire of celluloid and hell. Third rate CGI works a little to help and the actress is the best sunny, otherwise you will start to cry. Some of the guesses of why the scientist has sparked this mood. <br /> <br /> My suggestion .... Give it a broad day ... a very wide variety!
