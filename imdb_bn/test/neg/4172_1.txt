Apparently it was a prize winner. Apparently someone kept a gun against his head and was forced to nominate Mike's name: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> never made. Screening and editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls lost in a Karnafild and sank by someone who could smile under his rubber mask. The little girls fled their parents to their hero, then fled from him, Dr. The movie's hero father lost his track within a few minutes of this visit. <br /> <br /> The girls were not clearly trained actors, and they had no general idea. They were so annoying and so infantile to the movie, it's not even remote comedic. I got up as soon as I got up and cried again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
