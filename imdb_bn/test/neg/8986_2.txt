The story is a psychological woman, Tory, who has returned to her hometown, and has begun to resurrect her past childhood childhood (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that his friend was the first of a string of murder that was still happening. Can his psychological powers solve the crime and prevent ongoing murder? <br /> <br /> You do not really have to find out, O my God! This was so much worse! I know that fans of Nora Roberts will uphold the film and give 10 tons. Then the rest of us will see the IMDB score of 6 and in fact it seems that the movie is valuable. But it will not be fooled. The finishing was predictable, starring TERRIBLE (even me do not start about * the accents * y'all *) and the story was trite. Just remember ... you were warned!
