Let me get this straight: <br /> <br /> <br /> "Hotshot plastic surgeon loses the patient on a operating table by opening a book out of his mouth, and in about 24 hours, he is in love with a recently-separated bed and breakfast guest, I met him because of strong advice. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Move over "Notebook", there is a new baby in the city. <br /> <br /> Where to start Well, what is the depth of this relationship? I think we can establish the foundation of this uninterrupted love safely in the following stages: <br /> <br /> 1. Flexible delicious exchanges on a bite of salad. 2. Drink lots of Jack Daniels; Play basketball with the old foods. Give glib to each other and unwanted advice in your painful life. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Dedicate your life to each other through the airport. <br /> <br /> I noticed George Cullaf's "The Hairball" and "West Canada's West Project" on his bandit. "Stay in your habit" will be very harsh? Enough said. I think the stories of most love make us cry, or smile or even hope that most agree. But because of the fact that they are able to do it, in the story story, we really started to take care of the characters we see on the screen. To take care of us, these characters will have to spend time developing ... their lives, their history, why we are seeing them now. Wolf does not seem to "waste our time" with such a low level, and rather than providing two-minute background information about each character, before interacting with one of our two actors together. We all respect, but we can take care less for two characters. <br /> <br /> For one brief moment Richard Cere said that he was not expecting to hear his problems and he invited him to dinner, the viewer sees two glimmer - a start - something special between these two characters. But instead of enjoying the desire of the wonderful, unexpected joy, "what will happen next," and instead of enjoying slavery, we are bowed down in love relationships between two people. <br /> <br />> Let's face it. We've all heard one liners of sugar in romantic films. But in "Casablanca" or Nicholson's "Something Got the", a bit of reduction of bogurt is because our hearts and minds have been taken to the sky and dragged through the clay and are back with these letters and giving lines, Deeply involved, we do not even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolf does not allow us to love or even play our plays, all of us are given sandwich sandwiches and some of the audience's snickers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The chase is very literally here." Each welding is delivered by our carter, loudly to the director Volume's viewers. Telling viewers are surprised: "Mom, it's a romance of Richard Gere. Just buy it. "<br /> <br /> The complexity of this character - or the relationship - that the film's development fails to defeat our heart harmoniously. When Cerber's character dies, I felt that I saw the news of such a person What I will not forget or watching a woman 'eights rowing race during the Beijing Olympics, only care. <br /> <br /> Epic failed.
