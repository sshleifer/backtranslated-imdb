I have been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the very beginning. The most scary things about them are shown in love and innocence and camaraderie. Kermit was a role model to deep thinking and solving problems. A spiritual character, yet sweet and trustworthy so. All other letters were a little brighter, but respected to each other's differences showed how different types of things can be together together. <br /> <br /> The following movies have a slightly different camp. Yet this "This is a very muppet Christmas movie" Jim Henson will be cutting in his grave. These characters are completely horny, nasty, selfish, and rewritten from Chess. <br /> <br /> can be illustrated to God as a fancy corporate head, with a sheer leak. Angels like shameless, non-spiritual corporate employees, and the film was so bad that I had to stop to see me. I bought it for my big nephew, but thankfully I see what I see as a child. <br /> <br /> This movie is a trash bin, and no socially released content or charm. <br /> <br /> <br /> The shameful, those characters are written back and Jim Henson has gone from the main heart-centered, socially aware version. This is a terrible disaster of a great heartwarming person who no longer has to defend its creation.
