I am sitting in the house in the morning, suddenly my brother saw that I have ever seen a stupid movie. Considering this was not the intensity of 70's and special effects, this movie just about defining the definition of shit. Stupid monsters, stupid story lines, and stupid setting made this the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad that I could not even finish it, I made it in a certain way, then went ahead to see how long I could hang myself with a rope around my neck. (I'm just kidding) Awesome movie
