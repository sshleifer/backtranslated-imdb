Firstly, I think casting and acting was nice. Problem story Basically there is no cost to tell a story here and in this way there is no movie here. Larry Macmartry loses the dosage and I can not blame the original, although it probably did not require the cylues. He called Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Melencomp is supposed to be a native singer, but I sing a song about the song, it's an old Buck oven song. The movie makes a great deal out of chicken farming. The character of Melencomp has a good wife, and it's totally stupid to be disconnected from her. Completely stupid event with sliding cage riding. Maybe people make fun of it in some parts of the country, but I have never heard of it.
