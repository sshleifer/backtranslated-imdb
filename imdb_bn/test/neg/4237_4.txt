It was mostly in the context of the film, although despite the novelty of the model being sold to high-end furniture, it does not have anything for this movie. The letter is on the cardboard. The dialog is so painstakingly scripted, it's hard to sit on, and if I have a joke in the movie, then I miss them. Marilyn Monroe walks into the wall because she does not want to wear glasses, completely incredible and fun. Grable's stupidity is also very ham-fisted to be believed. Babel's gold digging is so strong, it's boring to hear. Why would anyone want to sit through this is beyond me.
