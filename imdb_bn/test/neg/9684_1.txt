How Offensive! Those who liked this movie probably could not open a Bible. I can imagine those who can imagine in NBC, "Well, let's make a movie to make those pagan Christians happy, but if we do not have any real or exact chronological sequence, they will never know the difference. " Well, they were wrong. Anyone involved with this persecution found this church to find a church and condemned this repression for their involvement in persecution. I just gave this movie 1 because I could not give it 0.
