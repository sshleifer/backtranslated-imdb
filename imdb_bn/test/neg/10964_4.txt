The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral outbreak has turned the population into a meat-eating jumbo. Those who have become "hunters" on the left. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is not the worst zombie movie. The worst is "Zombiez" and the notorious "Jumbo Lake". <br /> <br /> I think, the idea of ​​"quick and endive" was very good, only weakly executed. Considering the budget to work with them, this movie looks very good. All I was not bothered while watching it. Special effects were strong, though once they used to use CGI (fat jumped the head), but everything else (Gore, Hat) was rather good. Acting is awful even though. Our main man looks like Clint Eastwood, the other "actor" is not significant. As far as the plot goes away, they do not work enough to develop the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: acting, low budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this flicker is 4/10 from me. People are not as bad as they say. Imagine a Zombie Western, then watch this movie.
