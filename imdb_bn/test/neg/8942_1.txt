Oh, my God, I lost, now I know this man that this man is pointless and posted on JA 13th August, 2006 (Posting No. 881): What a terrible experience. It stole a video camera like a bunch of 3rd grade, since 1995 borrowed some old editing software and played a joke on each other.

The story was very difficult to follow. Fantastic artistic camera angles are cut off from the story and the whole time has created a wonderful experience among themselves. Although acting was ridiculous too amateur. The idea is OK, I guess. Possibly next time, the producers should raise some capital and hire real professionals and try again. I must say that I am very ill and sick and think that making movies like this is easy. It is not easy ... This fact is lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can create a good product. I think eventually they will learn how hard I am so annoyed.
