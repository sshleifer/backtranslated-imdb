Well, I have noticed that IMDB has not given any plot information ... because it is impossible to do it without being annoying ... because this film is ... ... very confusing! I saw it because I'm a great fan of Chris Naught, whom I personally met and he is a great man ... but if I can meet him again, he will not have the ability to ask him something terrible. He has played a former child generation, who is now a bright doctor who spent time running with his car on small children and with the aim of suppressing them ... it is not a "spoiler", because it is all made very clear from the beginning ... enough sick ?? Oh, it gets better ... her barbarian sister, who fails to die on her latest victim, threatens to raise her from sex ... even Clive Barker could not write such harmful things. . Please, if you want to see some of his genius Chris Noth, renting "Teddy Roosevelt and The Ropidars"
