Nothing but the director's youthful imagination comes to life. This film plays the director / actor kissing the youngest girl, which otherwise would not give him the day, but there is nothing more than an excuse for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not fool by 'X' rating, no nudity and short notice.
