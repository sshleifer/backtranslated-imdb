This is not a good movie. This is a reunion of the English film 'The Hit'. But it's original humiliation. It is a film that you might expect from a lady director credited with managing the film "Hero of the Year", "King Babu", "Coolie No 1", "Hero No 1", ... <br /> < Some changes from the main theme "Hit" have been taken so that the Indian audience can apply, but the story and the screenplay are not quite credible. Also Salman Khan and Govinda poor are starring from the main role. It seems that their skirts need minimal enthusiasm to express them in their chests. I do not consider this ridiculous and all comic. What is the manager thinking? Viewers need to bear in Govinda's over-acting field. It was simply intolerable. I suggest viewers to see it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> I think it's great to see the audience "Hit" in the English film "Hit".
