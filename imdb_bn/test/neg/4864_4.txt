Very rarely I saw an action / suspense movie boring. Action scenes are not exciting, the story line is not something special and some of the actors are bad without acting. Charlie Shane (Platoon, Major League) starred as White House Chief of Staff, who got herself through a conspiracy that wants him and more people to die. Donald Sotherland (A Time to Kill, Falen) played a friend who told him what he can do and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante Peak) is a reporter who is involved in the situation. OK as Charlie Shane Starr, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who is a good actor. Linda Hamilton gives a poor performance. With a bad movie, if it gets better then I really like it, but this movie is a lot of sugar with some ridiculous elements.
