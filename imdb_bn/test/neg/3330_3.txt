After the earthquake, a team of 7 gold projectors will glance at a mining excavator recently. Of course, they do not pay attention to local legends that there are some people and people are being killed. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flare has followed a little ritual and I'm not sure why (if it does not blur it). I'll admit the last half hour to be quite entertaining, but there are hours of pure torture. Walking and talking a lot and our title's oddity does not appear until 45 minutes. Even the additional co-author Chris Huntley admitted that it acknowledged the ineffable sin of being boring. I will forgive them if I work hard, but this group has graduated from the USC so I hope they should be an exploitative film exploiting. However, I said, the last half an hour is quiet, because the three surviving stop speeds with the giant and score like a cool John Carter. I wanted to see more giant, but it's literally on screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> If the movie is not the best, then code red dvd has given this great attention. You gave an audio comment by interview and director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Savici and co-writer Huntley. The story is very interesting and inspirational (a cave set is built on the backyard of a house) about how the film was made. Savvy and Huntley's USC student shorts are even more interesting, which are really better than feature production. Huntle is a beautiful talented artist and it is embarrassing that he did not go anywhere else. Sawiki has had a visible impact and a camera person has worked endlessly in Hollywood. VHS is a legend of dark film and I am sure that it is even better. However, you still get the scenes where the only image is the five helmet lights that surround the blackout. Say safe, real my bloody valentine is still a "awful film set in a mine" champ.
