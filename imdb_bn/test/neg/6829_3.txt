So tell you, you are a producer, you have some money and you've got Richard Gear and Bruce Willis, now all you need is a script ... but why bother? See, this movie is really awesome, it's a good film, but the cast has done its best to play these characters, they can not just play. Now, there is no plot in this film, rather, there is something that tries to pass as a plot: There is a Hit Human (Willis) that is dangerous and sophisticated (in fact it is none of them, but some of the other characters from the dialogue, you This is supposed to get the impression), so this hit-man is in a mission to kill someone, now there is a former Iraqi prisoner, who is very good and beautiful and Uba preferred (gear) of the FBI, who has been released from prison, he will help them. So the FBI is "investigating" to find out this Hitman now, there is a series of unlikely information in the investigation - just like some random person lost his wallet and someone bought his car using his name - which is always right on money Since there is no real plot and the script is so vague, you can not hope to develop or pull a real character, instead of creating them through the story, they simply add some disconnected drama music that gives you signals that something very dramatic is going on, Instead of creating dramatic .. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is this is a very bad movie and a complete groom Jacob scored his incredibly high level. Throw - and this is exactly where the producer is counting.
