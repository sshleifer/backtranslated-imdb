The guys were the most interesting things in the entire movie. Girls were tall and unhappy, I mean, they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, production studio ownership, and can not smell this bombs away? For getting the kind of responsibility, I really do not understand the punishment ..., they sent it to Paris, from which far away so-called live with a stern grandfather, with Paris having an important permanent position. I really can not think of what he really is, so who really care? The details do not help, girls are sent to Paris to learn something. So what can they learn when they meet two French boys and use them to show them that they want to meet their boys in school? Pre-teen movie, misleading all teenagers and the ability to stay away from parents in Paris or in a faraway country? I really do not like olsens, they did not really remove Michelle's image from the house ... if you do not see it then you were lucky since the beginning. (FF)
