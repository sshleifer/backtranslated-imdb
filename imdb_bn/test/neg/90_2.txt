The only reason that this film is not voted on 1 (horror) is that both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan are fantastic. Ida lupino, who, as usual, becomes increasingly annoyed because she tries to get rid of crazy ways. Robert Ryan is awesome as a terrifying stranger, whose character is managed only by his disturbed mind, the next change from one minute to the next. Suddenly easy and cruel, suddenly he became clever and threatened. Mrs. Lupino's character was more dangerous than the house that she lived and whoever came with her own stupidity. She could not get out of her own house: the window was not open, locked both front and back doors and unlocked from inside a key. If you try, you can not create a bad trap. She does not even take warning of having an extra key. He did not even know when he was coming out of his own basement to help his neighbors, or when his prisoner was locked. I do not know her husband was killed in a war, but during World War II, her home furnishings, style of clothes, especially the children and the repair company of the telephone company are clearly immune. I recommend watching this movie only to look weird what you can find.
