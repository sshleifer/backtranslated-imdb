I'm a boran fan, but this is his controversial, least successful film. The comedy was not in its strong suit, and here its effort to screw Furce is done clumsily. Yet, it is almost valued for the talent of Bulerman: it is one of Uma Thurman's first acting roles and she is always interested in seeing. (In a sad note, Borman wrote this script with his daughter Tiless, who died a few years ago.)
