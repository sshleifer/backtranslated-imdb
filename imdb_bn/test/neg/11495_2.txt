I just saw the DVD icon and despite a great book, the movie is a weak layer from it. Those who are responsible for writing should be exiled to Siberia. Why they enjoy the great story with all the C-film theorems which are completely irrelevant to the story Completely out of me <br /> <br /> Still, the creator of the film and the creator is able to do anything from it. Finally the film was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> You can create a suitable movie to show who can do this. I'm sure that the crowd will become a rallying for such a best composition novel, not a cheap C movie.
