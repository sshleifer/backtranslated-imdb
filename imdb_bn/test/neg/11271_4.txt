Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps one of the most well-known series in his home country for his Japanese underground films, with whom the film shares several features. Violence and political conspiracy Shogun's samurai and warfare both honor and the theme of the theme, except for humanity, and both are characteristic of a lead character that challenges its loyalty by fraud. Both movies have a large number of characters that seem to be of little purpose but can die and do so little work for their development, but when their deaths come, they have very little effect. This film has other errors as well. Makeup, clothing, and sound design are misleadingly poor, and battle scenes were worse than other low-quality samurai films (Seven Samurai comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Sunny Chiba Shogun starred in the role of Soni Chiba in Samurai, the master of this nonsense who walks through the film, is particularly heartfelt. What a guy; She even got to wear an eye patch. If you were hoping to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; His appearance is a little more than a cam, and when it seems that his character can do something interesting, he gets better. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The overall power of the movie is its story, which is more understandable than those gangster movies and challenges to attract good and bad traditions. Two brothers are challenging for their recently departed father's throne, who got some help on his way. At first, it seems that we have to face some of the characters, which can not be more clearly and bad; After all, there are confirmed brothers of big brother stammers and a birthday, a villain. Finally, it becomes clear that in the fight for the victor-taking power, there is no hero and fame, only the victors and the losers.
