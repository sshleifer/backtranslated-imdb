The iPad has averaged 4.7 pounds on iPod.com, and it is astonishing that Steve Belderson is copying this website. But really it is said that the Pep Squad is a weakly fabulous "black" "comedy" (a word of both the quotation marks for the reason). It is a film related to an acting film (Cherry, Beth's mother), which is a neutral performance (Betty and Julie's boyfriend). A movie where you can follow twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and can not be noticed. A movie full of glossy silence and nudity shots that you wonder, "the director thinks it's funny or cute?" Most of the letters are so thin and poorly developed that the film has become quite unpredictable, but it is probably not intended. Papa squads can not determine which comedy, drama, or mockery (Patriotic songs, I can get it ...). The film failed because of the seriousness of the murder concept (this promo queen) for a school position exceeding the line of frustration (failing to mention the flawed burn shots and drive-shoots, bad attempts to dispute and intensify), and fails as a comedy , All forcibly and kinky jokes (big butt mama, "foxy" black principal, and badness by original cast Bay delivered excessive cussing). The documentary "Wemgogo: Making Making Anywhere" only makes the film more interesting, praising ... the father of director and director ... hmmm Do not have a black comedy, or something for that matter. I guess I must wait in Kansas.
