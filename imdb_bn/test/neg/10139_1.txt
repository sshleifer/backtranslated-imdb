Reba, without a doubt, is one of the worst "comedy" series ever. I'm surprised, how people write good comments in "Reba" ... you see "friends", "married weitah", "frieser", if you smile at it, you can not laugh at fool business and ridiculous singing Trying to make its way into the comedy and there is probably no chance. The actors / actresses in Rebecca are okay, so I think it's bad for them to get annoyed with the least funny person (Reba) in their so-called comedy shows. Collectively, I recommend this TV show how low comedy can get and you can laugh that
