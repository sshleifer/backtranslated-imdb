Do not know what this image wants to be: Is it fun to act in general? Is it ironic? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? This is one of the really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Lori Peeta is boring. I said there, everyone is thinking about. It is so bad that she is such a terrible actress (Root 666, Bates Mattel), but she does not qualify as a moderate B-movie actress. Her graduation voice, strange behavior, and poor comic timing, give this movie a start-up to the end, until you just want to keep your head in a chaos and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Take care of yourself and avoid it. You will be glad you
