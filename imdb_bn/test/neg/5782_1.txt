This movie is absolutely terrible ... Definitely a bull *** *** Story and even worse acting. Very bad Charlie Shane is involved in something like this because he's a good actor and really good movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are 'A-Tim' shot and then flips with a little firefight under the Hood. <br /> <br /> Of course the enemies are portrayed as total stupid and as soon as they may die they may die- -Die Americans of evil <br /> <br> If you do not have a Bradide film, do not spend 113 minutes of your life in this trash. Instead, select 'Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now'.
