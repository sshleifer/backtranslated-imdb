After the search of the Ichod Crane ?? Acting by Johnny Depp, this is the only burning point of the film dreary ?? Approximately random and horrible killings in the heart of the mysteries surrounding a tearless helmet raid in a suburb, the story deliberately plays out as an attempt to be expected unexpectedly.
