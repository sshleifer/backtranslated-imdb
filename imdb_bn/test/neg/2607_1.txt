How nice. After watching this movie, you will know why there is no trait of American youth's intelligence and contribution to the welfare of society, but to make themselves more effective. <br /> <br /> The most fantastic people of two fantasy people in the number of Jacques, who lacked any kind of talent or brain (especially left Margaret and Steve-O) to do something themselves, and the reputation of fame was a loss to their life. There are such fools as being there. A guy's horse semen drink? Just flat hateful. A man is acting as a "bet" for fishing and sharks through his cheeks? It is not a humor, it is a proof of institutionalization of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was not optimistic about mankind coming out of the theater.
