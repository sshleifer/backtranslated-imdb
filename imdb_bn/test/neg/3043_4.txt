This movie was potential to be a good little high school thriller. Instead, we got a bore festival about babysitting a whiny, spoiled brat. The problem was a lot of unnecessary things. Fighting with boyfriend, killing random friends. It was clear they were just killing time. The main character was bland and reluctant. Camellar Bell had no emotion during this movie. She was just there. Another problem was that the killer was not threatened. Children survive, so it is clear that they will keep Jill alive. This only got four reasons because the last 10 minutes (when the killer is gone) is really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
