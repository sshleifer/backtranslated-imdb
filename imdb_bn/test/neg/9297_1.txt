Comedy? In the 6 sessions of Alahhollics Anonymous (I have closed it at any time) An ugly corpse present is so funny about the alcoholic observer? Grunts and mumbles and drunk slurrings set by a harmful script. Another reviewer serving with Hollywood religious "God Will Save You You" redemption drill lashings, mentioned T-Leon's "Sassy Dialogue" - I have seen this annoying film in an hour and I have not seen any smile yet - actually my 80 year old grandmother There is more fun than the tea's character. Tea faces more than Stonis and shows less emotions than the romance - actually a surprise if she is not addicted to anything - maybe her face is so woody? Protect yourself from killing yourself with annoying from these pictures.
