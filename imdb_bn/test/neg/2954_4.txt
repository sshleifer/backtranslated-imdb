The most famous thing in this movie is that Garbo spoke in the first movie. In addition to this milestone (if you want to call it), it is a movie that does not cross Kraky Melodrama, Garbo tries best for not being asleep. <br /> <br /> Gretta is proud to return to her father after 15 years in this plot. His father, who is a captain in the band, is very happy to see him, though he is batting a bit. She falls into love with a grizzled sea soon, that is also something that, if you want, is holding her back. However, two folks do not particularly like each other and hit Garbo soon to come, when they reveal the Big B secret, which disrupts the situation, we do not have any surprises, if you read the video box (You're not MGM !!) Garbo is nothing more than a weapon in this movie, she works and flames her arms about flailing, and gets quick grating. Lead two men OK. Probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress Mary Dressler, who plays the drunk captain's even drunk girlfriend. What a performance! The tagline was not very bad, "Dessler talks!"
