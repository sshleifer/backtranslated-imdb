I've seen the movie for the last 10 years, and I must say that I never felt bad, I felt like watching this extraordinary big movie, it was very bad. There were songs and songs. Anyone will see this movie The director spoke English in English which is so dirty. The Germans do not speak English. And there was a white girl in a scene, who asked Hemesk for autographs. (Obv that she would pay her some money) in the promotion they have shown ready for riots. But I can say that there was only one scene where Himesh could laugh for some reason. Hansika is very good. She is like an angel. But only 16 years old is very young. If you have a lot of time and do not know what to do then you will see the waste of this movie or its meaning
