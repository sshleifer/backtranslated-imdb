This is a kind of poor production that makes me wonder how a movie studio can take a little bit to illuminate the first light. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I'm going to put it in the plot and say that it is about a bunch of people trapped under the water and killing many fake faces. <br /> <br /> Let me go in more detail. This is so terrible about the flick. First of all, acting is simply horror. Jack Scholia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, this is a credit that is enough to earn enough. Support performance is not really any good. And with actor Louise Lorenzo, that guy, who cooked Francisco. She is not a sci-fi horror film, she feels a high impressive voice and a pronoun which is appropriate for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Special effects even worse Animals range from kinky eels to monster starfish and "maximum". The effects will be seen in Muppette movies that you can see and I do not believe that I have to further strengthen this problem. <br /> <br /> Director J. Made I'm sure Ed enjoys infinite breeding in the wood structure, but I do not even think it good. What he does is fierce, especially camerawork. People can not manage the movie, it has everything. <br /> <br /> These four final films, which were under water, and surely began to look for skills compared with Leviathan and Deep Star Six (their two bad films). Both ways, just stick with the bird.
