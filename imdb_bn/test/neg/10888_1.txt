This film must be ranked with "God welcomed" and "The Heater" and "Dream Catcher" with firmness for God. You've got the most annoying heroin in the history of Gore who sobbing most of his time and spends crying and shrieking - The most awesome rest stall of all time to put toilet clothes in the toilet ever. It is not explained why he spent so much time in this terrible bathroom from hell. Even when the natural killer truck driver is trying to kill him, he refuses to leave the crash. When the motorcycle police comes to rescue him, the killer truck driver walk on his forehead and the heroine just shows. Instead of grabbing guns for protection, he threw the poor slab in the frog and locked the door. Then the police ordered him to blow out his brain due to the pain. He is doing so - while crying and sobbing and keening - and behind his head behind. Then - the police are still alive, tell him to kill him again because he is still suffering. He said that when the whole part of his head is on the floor. Shouting, the heroine kicked him again. The film continues, and in no way does it have any meaning. The heroine is very weird that you really want to close her first closeup to the killer. I have seen this impressive Saifai channel so that I do not have any cost to see it, but I still see that no movie can end badly so much, more than that.
