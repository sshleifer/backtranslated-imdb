There was no idea about this movie, but based on the fact that John LageuZamo was present in it, we decided to see it. Well, it will not be the most wise decision. In fact, as another commentary on this forum, it says, we feel embarrassed for the actors participating in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not terrible in any way, it does not understand in any sense. The result of William Baldwin's highest performance does not help the situation. John LeGuZamo is a talented actor who has qualified. The film seems to be a fundamental problem that started with a good intention to create a small comedy, and the public's charges went out of the way. The result is an uneven film
