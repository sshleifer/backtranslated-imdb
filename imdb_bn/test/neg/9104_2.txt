This movie was so bad at such levels. The author was awesome, so even the best actors could not make this movie visible. It was embarrassing because they had some good actors in this movie. If I saw a police academy movie then you know that Steve Gutenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a bigger difference than the characters I saw him playing before, so it was a plus. And I think Steve Gutenberg was very hot in this movie. With or without shirts you can not deny that it has a great body! Look very sexy Like the look of the 5-inch shadow, it looks dangerous to him. In one part of the movie, he is lying on the bed without a shirt and I have to say that I have tried to be happy and tried to get his mind back! So honestly I want to imagine this movie again!
