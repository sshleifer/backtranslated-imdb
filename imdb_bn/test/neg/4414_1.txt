Large, eccentric, griming trunk "Pacific Atoll" (suspiciously like the southern ca ...) masks the fake "natives", revisits havoc and revenge. In contrast to the stupid stops of "NV VS The Night Morris", Tabanga is actually an adult man-tree. Well, two days have passed: Muskils have sparked the Mirak ... ... any crow, it does not come from Hell, but from the grave of a fake native, Kemo (Greg Palmer, "The Laos of Mora Tau"), who Murder by the native guards for hanging with terrible American scientists. Scientists said. Includes William Arnold (Todd Andrews, "Han Mm High", "Apps of Planet of Benin") and Professor Clark (John McCann, "The Battle of the Black Beast"). Linda Watkins ("The Paint Trap"), as the overwhelming Mrs Kilgore, makes a clear fake "cocoon" accent to roam the castle. Actually throw a star !! Any coke, because of his dirty, empty wife, Corey, Suzanne Ridweyi ("Love A-Poppin"), who played the amateur, helped him set up, Kimo declared his revenge on him and all his adultes. Then, Dopi American scientists evicted the tree, brought life back to "in the name of science" and all of them would be able to adjust to the island equivalent, killing all those who made mistakes. Of course, we all know that the evil monsters carry fair slaves, so the brave women scientist of Tanganga. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and she's knocked down. A good shot with wine-alley, Rimington, captures a knife in Tabanga, and it quickly falls into the death. This ridiculous stupid cowncept is one of the cheesy howlers all the time. Tabanga Movie is the slowest brain in history, right there with "Robot Monster vs. Angemme Mami" and "Crying Terror", with a cast on the slow carpet demon. Barking bark bark barking bark barking, wood performance, and sad aspects are all points that are much worse than the onion fertilizer bite There are mooore barks. This piece of wood chips was cut from the long-time editor-director-director Dan Milner, which quickly disappeared quickly after the film. You made it from Gucci to Murco first: "It is a compost classic!" : ??
