This is one of the religious horror films, which does not explain why 10,000 times stronger than "good" forces. We have received a devotional worship here which is: 1) "man-made man" (such as "star tray"), 2) killing young children with dolls, 3) transferring one soul from one group to another, 4) telepathic distance from a greater distance, and 5) Builds tough car-crashes, in which the selected people become spaghetti and others (children, in this case) survive. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "good" ": 1) can lie around helplessly, 2) Stand up oddly, 3) panic, 4) ridiculous smile, 5) waste time without doing anything, 6) Time to read the comics Burying with dozens of people, and 7) It's too late <br /> <br /> In every religious horror film, I must remember that the world of this movie lives by God and by Satan.I must also assume that the devil is 1,000,000 times More than Until the film has a world record similar to that of hell, in other words, the priests of this film knew anything? The priests of this movie could have done it, it can be assumed that some of his studies have books - nothing else - these books For reading. At the first sight of violence, this priest became violent, then fiercely laughing, only a big panic attack Ne is over. So this is supposed to be contributing to the war devil? Ridiculous. Every great religious horror film "good", which is the ability of some (less than or less) equipped with supernatural powers, or at least "evil" some concrete knowledge about the war. In that sense this movie is quite stupid. Like the main priest of religion (!) Martin's cast to play! Deadly Martin has very little fear or fear within a devil-style leadership. I mean, it does not have to be Christopher Lee or Langhela, but have they found a less funny look? Why do couples go back to their car after driving? After a "friendly" face with the people of the city, no simple person could go back; They should just have gone The man in his girlfriend (and visitors) explains "what the side knows".
