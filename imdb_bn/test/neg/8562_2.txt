Noon is a revenge film that kills very hard nuns by the trash charge of his stolen trailer and comes back many years later even when adults go to their old school. The story line is predictable in spades and it will no longer keep no surprises as the wind winds its way to the end. It's a running and a screamer of a movie with an average script and screenplay below. Special effects have low credibility and almost zero credibility for the final battle. Yet, if you have some mysteries and acting jewels in this past look. If you want stupid cookie cutter screamers, you like this, otherwise you should pass.
