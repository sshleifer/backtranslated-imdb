I did not like this movie for many reasons - very annoying! They were thinking about how they would look in the future, but I was very unhappy with this. There was very little action. Although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visual was very creative. Whenever this movie pops on the TV, I want to change the station early. Because it's not a bad movie, just because I know what I'm doing to see it - complete and total annoyance. It was a movie when I was young, but I would never go to science fiction ... because it was not real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic I do not understand the movie half anyway.
