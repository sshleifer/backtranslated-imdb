I do not know, but the film I saw is very similar to other movies. Ring, i, dark water, they all like me Do not make me wrong, it's beautifully made, beautiful camera work, great graphics, but that story is very common .. very common In the end, this is the score that creates doubts, you know: screams, rumbles. The characters of the film are not responding very naturally, running very slowly, they are surprised to see anything. I know some people who love this type of movie, and if you do that as a good movie, I think it does not hurt to see it. But if you have not seen and liked the movie described above, I would not recommend to bother you.
