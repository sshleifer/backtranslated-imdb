When the headline of the word "gift" is found by a famous title, it is usually immediately remnantable. For some reason, people who are able to create good industries do not seem able to see it among others. However, I have always been willing to pay a second installment of the Demon Trilogy. One thing, for the soundtrack, it's absolutely dead. Most American directors dedicated small animals to the soundtracks of Demos to build a genius. For others, well, two words: Asia Argentina (Of course, he was 11 years old when he was making this film, and a few years away from his sudden decision, he will write his acting style at the beginning of Helen Mirren: steamy appearance and small costumes.) Alongside, Lamberto Bava is one of the most remarkable horror novels of Italy's most remarkable dynasty. Known as Giulo (he was the son of Mario Bawah, who discovered the genre in the 60's). And the real dementia must certainly be seen for fans of eighty thousand B-horror movies. So this could be bad, right? Well, bad. Geologists continue their attacks on Italian media, because the film is raised at the modern Italian height, where many people are going about their lives, they have their television in their background. They are all watching a combination news report / meter video of some kind of investigative reporter trying to prove the first type of movie incident (which does not seem to be the frame of time that takes more than a couple of days). Through extra disabilities to focus through natural horror movies, journalists lead a giant to revive, and he comes from the TV screen to start the new screen. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's that bad. The only thing that can be good about the film is the soundtrack (when you like Smiths, The Cottle, Jean-Jezebel, etc.) are stunning. It comes from Simon Boswell's keyboard, who got his start as part of the Argentine dynasty and since then has been able to acquire such films as the London of Illusiones and Hackers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are planning to rent heavily, but it is certainly not near the real fun anywhere. The surprisingly high rise of Kroneberg's amazingly up-awful Rome, the Shiver (the generous ones came from inside), is a whole lot better.
