Well, if I'm in a rented shop and someone asks me whether the movie is worth three bucks for the rent, I will not have to say. The plot was impossible. I came to the conclusion that Kaneu Reeves can not work. She can, sometimes, be painful (though my wife thinks she is cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is generally great) was a little disappointing as even broke broke. Plus, beside the plot (because it is conveyed) are unpredictable. Cameron Dia was good.
