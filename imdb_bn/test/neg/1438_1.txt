Oh ... this movie really sucks ... 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Story: A psychopathic internet hunter lures between the stalks and the torturous trap of young men and women ... It goes as such, the kidnapped people, they find him, he becomes a changed man and is redeemed again worldwide. , Goes back to his old ways and starts torture again. The story is stupid, it is impossible. Characters stupid, they are impossible ... or very few ways to top. It got some violent imagery, and if you have a stomach in your week you will just want to stay away ... but again, if you do not have belly in the week but you want to stay away ... Fool. <br /> <br /> Cast: De Snyder, Kevin Gage ... If you are the hard fan of the twisted sister and De Schneider's body, it can be interesting to you, because he is a writer and star. This image. His performance is ridiculously bad, and you can say that he is the God who wrote horrible script. Kevin Gage ... Well they said that he saw many other movies that I saw, but I do not remember him from any of them ... and you do not remember him from ... two sad, make the film ... they do not think you like it ... they just make it ... <br /> <br /> One to five scale: 1 It's bad ... it's very bad. ..It is so bad that this movie should come to play Russian Roulette with a clip loading pistol ...
