Ed Zieen: Plenfeld's slaughter was placed in Plainfield, a small American town in Wisconsin in 1957, where Lone Ed Jein (Why the Skull) lives on the farm after his mother and brother's death. There is a large number of robberies to bury the local police and some of the ugliness going on in connection with the suspected suspected Su-Layton (Sia Cole) local Burma. Ed fierce sex workers, who kidnap girls and kill them, will police find the truth when saving the daughter of Erica (Adrian Frantz) Sheriff (Timothy Oman)? <br /> <br /> This infamous serial killer directed and produced by Michael Feifer was an attempt to base a horror film around true incidents surrounding Ed Gein and turned into fantastic shit. The real life Ed Gin was convicted of only two murders and died in 1984, but he was inspired by several films including the Chanso Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000), in Texas. Perhaps this recent recent addition is the worst gen film ever. Although Ed Gin did not have any real truth in this film, Jeanne did not have any associates, none of her investigating officers were related to the investigating officer, none of them was in disaster, although the name changed to Zain's name as other people, two women pictured here The incidents of kidnappings and murders have actually happened in four years, but in this movie it happened within a few days and it Here for the implementation of the gene is shown as a big muscle man he was a scrawny, thin, old, and it was quite short. As the true drama Ed Gene: Planefeld's bush is worthless and pure entertainment as it is not good with a deadly slow and it feels, the character is all boring and when he does not kill anyone, the gene shows or walks around and it is very dull. There is no doubt because we know who the killer is and until it gets caught until it is only a tedious wait. There is no real effort to get the mind of the gene, and sometimes there is no motivation for the craftsman to mislead his dominating soil. <br /> <br /> There is not much more here, there is a view with a woman, hanging on a meat-hook, closing a jin's foot really looks badly edited scenes, physical organs and shoulders, along with blood, alongside blood, but some bloody There is not much to be excited about here. The image was processed mostly to bleach the color because it is sometimes black and not white. I personally think that lack of color can emanate through it. <br /> <br /> With the estimated budget of $ 1,500,000, I can not really see where the money went from where the very forgotten produce went. Although this set in Wisconsin was crafted in California. Why Hooder did not see all the wrong, just from the physical perspective, Hudder Geoan for the role of Jane, and he played very firmly in the cameras facing a very stupid camera. br /> <br /> Ed gene: Planefeld BUCHCHER shit and it's as simple and straightforward. Since it is a total drama or pure absorption entertainment it is a total tripe from the beginning to end with nothing to suggest.
