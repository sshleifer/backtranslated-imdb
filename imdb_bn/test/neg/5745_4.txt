Slayer is a stupid vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot. Special oops teams were sent to South America in search of bloody natives. A real elderly who is good at their leader. Pampars are attacking villages, there is an environmental curve, because of the greedy corporations and farmers, their rain forests and wild animals of wild animals are disappearing. The damage to the war and so much blood they do not bother to stop throwing the whole film. It seems they are sleeping in bloody clothes and boiled in blood. Cast each member bring their own talent, it does not click as a film at all. The effect was right, without the vampire hanging from the building on the cable. You are looking for many blood and violence, this is for you.
