I gave 10 possible 2 stars. <br /> <br /> I did not understand what it was - and discovered that it was apparently some of African musicians - because people could sing for a few minutes. <<br /> <br /> No rhyme of any song, most of them are not smart enough, and they all have the same tone of existence - if you can call it "tune". <br /> <br> Carmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, which I have ever seen with the longest brides. [Actress thinks she probably did some modeling.] <br /> <br /> The film opens up women in prisons, although they are not like any prison I've ever seen or heard - whatever they want in prison - and having a party It seems. <br /> <br /> Carmen has some dramatic dance, and the female warden of the prison, Angelique, [a super-beautiful woman] is clearly interested in harmful. He and Carmen dance together. Later Karenen went to Warden's house and they love - unfortunately the view is not detailed and very small, although there are some nudity. <br /> <br /> Carmen then escapes from prison and later we see his dance in front of another group, where a man named Lamin, probably a colonel, was never clear who he was, who he was. He dislikes Carmen's seductive dance, and a young woman who is a dancer among two women. <br /> <br /> The story follows [as] becomes worse then. <br /> <br /> <br /> Prison can be involved with prisoners or thieves. <br /> <br /> <br /> More dance, and Angelique's visions are obviously frustrating. <br /> <br /> On the way this film is about to end, and I endured intense contractions to finish it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
