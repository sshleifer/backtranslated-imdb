A Volcano Volcano sounds in the subway of the LLA sounds like a beautiful plot for a disaster film. While this one is big, time is missed. The movie seems unwelcome, it is a story that is hard to follow or to believe and the acting was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with a lot of comments that Li Jones is just good about the opinion of the people. In some special cases the main. This one, he is heading the emergency office. Being the head of this office is a good idea to naturally bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Shiny thinking Walking in the tunnels that Anne Heche estimates to be touch walls and 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes ok In addition to bad acting those real flaws are often seen as shameless as Armageddon. The only good point of this movie is Ben Affleck to make things worse. Avoid all costs to this movie.
