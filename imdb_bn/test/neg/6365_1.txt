When I heard that the movie was released and the theme was about it, I felt very strange. But when I saw it was the biggest fraud in my life. Technically speaking, the word is poor, you can tell people's conversations, which were rebuilt in the studio, which were badly earned in the final mix. Secondly, photography is medium, some parts of the film show some soldiers, including the night watch goggles, and how the movie-graphographer illuminated everything in the form of "dark nights", as if they were on the actual military base with lights, the light of the moon used in any reference, my God ! Thir but at least, most ac tings are really poor, it's not completely credible, a soldier's wife's roll, its performance it's very poor. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment, jury shame, who chose to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
