This was the first movie of the 70-year-old woman-in-prison film. This film was incredibly violent, many were tortured in torture. The film takes place in the Philippines, which looks like an awesome ugly country. There is no doubt that the producers used this facility for their advantage, which stressed the horrific situation in the prisoners. <br /> <br /> Blackplanion Movie Rani Pam Greyer acted in this movie. He plays blossom, a fake woman who puts the miserable women in jail, trampled up charges Her boyfriend, played by Sid Hague, tried to rescue Blossom. He and Blossom were part of a political guerrilla group, and Blossom's prison was corrupted by the Filipino government. <br /> <br /> Stand in Palm Grey and Sid Hague, otherwise unsuitable cast. The film itself, gives too much importance to the violence against the prisoners. Their detainees only use them as their duplicate objects. Got this quick annoying. This movie can use more interesting plot-lines and benefits. This is not one of Roger Corman's good pictures. Movies in many prisons of this female were almost the best. I'd suggest Big Bird Cage, only fans of Palm Grey.
