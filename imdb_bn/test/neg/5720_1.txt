I think the trailer for off this infamous weak spin in Canaan. I saw movies later in the year and laugh at my head. Unintentionally! Poor Brigatier Nilsson Cobra and Red Gold had no chance of his career. The plot of the film is this: Sonja (Brigitte Nilsson) is a member of a group of female fighters who were killed by an evil queen Guernen (Sandhal Bergman). The female fighters stole the queen Graden to protect the protecting force and used it to destroy every city passed by him. Sonja went in search of Quine Graden and later asked whether Graden killed his parents. In his quest, he unwittingly joined Kalidar (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a proud prince named Turn (Arnie Reyes Jr.) and his rebel idiot slave, Falcon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go on a quest for Queen Gedren and Orb. The acting sub par and the action scene are soso. I mean bridgette Nilsson looks so emotionally remote. Anyone who has lost his female comrades as well as his entire family, Sona does not seem to see all. Arnold plays the role of his usual stoic and Arnie Reyes Jr. ... What was the boring graduation in this movie! Feminist Friend Falcon was more personal than this person. The action scenes are the only release moments in the film, but sometimes they are flat. The scene where they fight the mechanical sea creatures smile until my urine. The dialog goes too. Like this, the screenplayer thinks that nobody is going to take the film seriously, so he gave everyone the opportunity to work through a stupid line. If you like your epic movie extra cam, I can only recommend this movie to you. Do not bother anyone else.
