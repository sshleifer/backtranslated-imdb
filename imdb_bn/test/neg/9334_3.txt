In the 1950s, the film and other films with religious overturns such as The Rob, Kow Wadis and Samson and Dillilah, unfortunately do not portray all Jews or any other Jewish or Christian as morally unclean and harmful. Focus is the only Bible related story that the Bible ignores the world outside. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from Pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. <br /> <br /> Any movie that promotes "True God", gives it a brief shift to freedom of religion. Films neglected the lack of religious freedom of ancient Jews, it has made a fertile role for religious extremism. Most religious films of the 1950s ignored the wounds of independence that took place after Christians took political power in the 4th century.
