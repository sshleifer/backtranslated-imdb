** Possible Spoilers ** From DreamWorks and Director Peter Chan, 'The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a beautiful, beautiful village on the outskirts of New England, where the single mother Helen (Kate Capo) is a diverse, small bookstore owner. One day in the work, Helen has come across an anonymous letter (titled 'Love letter'), which is lodged anyway under a reading couch cushion. After reading a miracle in him, he believes that it was written to him, deliberately placed in sack to find him, and, for his own sake, he knows the identity of his secret devotee. Curiously, Helen released her letter, where her employee, Jeanette (Ellen DeGeneres) found it, believed that it would be for her, and of course, thinks that she knows who wrote it. The situation then took him a young man named Tom Everett Scott, who thinks Helen wrote a letter to him. And before it all sort out, you can only imagine those delightful situations involved; And I imagine, because of how the movie is playing, the audience gets more than that. This romantic comedy has two distinct areas that have failed miserably: it's not just very romantic and it's not funny; And it's a strong combination that effectively fills the film's opening credits. Once the setting and main character (Helen) is established, it does not basically go anywhere for the next ninety minutes. You finally wrote the letter, and to whom, find time you could care less. Tom Seleck, Bleth Danner, Julian Nicholson, Gloria Stewart and Geraldine McEwan scored the goal of the net. It is also sad to see the balance in such kind of clerkship, as well as the balance. The Kate Capsule, which usually displays up the screen, brightens the screen, is tired of it, when Seleck has just arrived in the band of three weeks, which lasted for a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking for the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often more headline experience than the destination. In the case of 'love letter', however, if everyone lived at home, it was good for everyone concerned. I rate this 1/10.
