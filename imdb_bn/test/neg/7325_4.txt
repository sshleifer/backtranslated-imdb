I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon is a Cerebral Pallisi, whose 10-year-old daughter is known, who knows how to dig in China, flee to the balloon, and thus deal with her lazy existence. I admit that I have moved fast through the scenes, in which two will share friendships and simple pleasures and play in the piano piano music background. Okay, there are three types or four types of scenes. Maybe nine or ten All right, fourteen years. But I sat and saw most of them.
