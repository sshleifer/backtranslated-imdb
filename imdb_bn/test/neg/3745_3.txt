It is unfortunate that other opponents of this movie seem to be influenced by previous bias. (As angry with gay characters, French thriller bad, etc.) I would admit that I was unfamiliar with the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, I was turning my eyes. I hope I can explain my writing in writing enough before writing this film and being busy for 2 hours of running length. (2 hours which was felt 3) Do not make me wrong, I can sit in an hour and a half silent movie, 3 hours epic, I do not have a short attention session, I'm not so surprised by the MTV generation that I am a fine and gradual Building movies do not appreciate. Here goes, the complaint is my grocery list. First stop, end. Yes, it was a schoo oby-du-esquier, explaining everything at the end of the character. Now I really thought about this movie, it was necessary. So many of these plots-spots, mental displays, new information surfing and discoveries were discovered. One critic said it well: "Yes, it is a very logical story, but without too essential back story (their childhood story, relationship between 3 parents, relationship between two love birds and the son of Big Man), it does not seem right. I felt "I've won" throwing in a lot more spoilers here, I could naming specific revelations that were unwanted, but reviewed here Many people who seem to really love it, so I do not want to give anything. I personally can not stand soap opera. Complexity, and twists and turns, for me, the final revelations could probably deliver no effect snuffed out. In the end, I do not care seriously! No gorgeous plot hole was essential, it seems like it can create a great book, it's a good way to write. It is fairly reasonable, but if I believe that it is really believed then it does not fit with some pieces correctly inserted. I often feel very important character that we did not know that to make the plot even more complex, to increase the emotions and to develop mystery Was thrown. I did not have any complaints about acting, guidance, oh, was not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, was lacking on the fore. Those who felt felt this was a perfect thriller, but I could not get it. I gave it 3 because I did not want to feel completely inappropriate, and there was a little conspiracy and a tense moment. <br /> <br /> * Big spinner * and I have to mention it. But when you think of Alex's expression on his father, when you think that the plot can not fit in another curve .. "Your father worked as a hunter I'm not going to die in the accident .. I was the greatest child of all time ... When was the father's progress or even the story really remarkable? !! You are serious !! It was involved in the relationship and already connected with each other, was not already like a complex plot. Does the drama need more emotional vapup than what has already been feeded? Sorry, I had to throw in such a hijack, but never bother me in any film Dropped out
