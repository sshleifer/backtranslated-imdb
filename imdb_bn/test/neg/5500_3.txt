There was a lot of potential for this movie - it's a great story and it's likely to be very vague. But of course, Time Burton is not really vague films, she has counterfeit cartoon film. And I usually like Staff of Time Burton. But I was really weak in this film. The best thing about the movie (and it really is suitable for it) was art direction - it's a great quality quality in the film. The script was not good. It was boring in part and other parts were confusing, and there was no building in the letters. I really did not really care that shake their head by lipped their heads by hand. I thought that there was something better with her attitude to the depiction of Johnny Depp, but she did not go too far with the script being weak - and I became very annoyed with the efforts of her Christian Ritchie. However, sadly, this is not a great movie and if you are not interested in the industry, then it is not worth it.
