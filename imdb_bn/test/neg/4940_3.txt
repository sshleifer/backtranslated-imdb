I saw 'shuttle' an incredibly frustrating movie. It started quite well and moved along intensely until the first hit '(which is a doozy). After that it became very lazy and underwritten as a story. Character executing character was the case of driving character plot. If you hate movies where you do not understand how they perform characters, you'll hate 'shuttle'. In particular, the last work seems to happen in a world without the weird and common sense. In the end, instead of sympathizing with the audience, one of the letters acknowledged the prejudice of the past, most of the people became frustrated. Perhaps this is the story of the heroine was a complete fool. Finally there is a finishing look that seems to be 'frustrating' and comes from a horrible cop-out school 'People are bad, listeners, so accept it without any explanation.' <br /> <br /> Shuttle 'good or bad, but mediator. And annoying.
