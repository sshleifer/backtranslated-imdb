I was the Stan Stan "Dreams As True". Stan was the friend who worked in the factory with the main character and broke his hand in the machine and cried (where the ambulance was?) The film was quite poor with most local actors. From Fox Will Wisconsin I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in the theater, and there was something special to see herself on the big screen. I could be biased, but overall, I enjoyed it. There was also soundtrack band spooner, who later became garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the film. She played Swenson who comes to the crutches door to talk with the police.
