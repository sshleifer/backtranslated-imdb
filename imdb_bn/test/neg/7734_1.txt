It is impossible to avoid the comparison of Zhang Imo's 'Hero' of Anne's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. They were Chinese Kung-fu movies of both big budgets with a cast of impressive painters and super-stars in China's landscape. But apart from the obvious, there is nothing else to actually compare. 'Hero' is really important that fails to reach almost every level, the big names are they, beautiful scenery, and the impact of the impact of the actions that prove that the director is not replacing for art and vision. <br /> <br /> All promotional campaigns have done nothing except premiere of 'Hero', its failure to make a spectacular one. Most anticipated, 'Hero' main role attracted open-film-passengers for the first time in China and Hong Kong theaters, which achieved an instant box-office success. However, even though this script satisfied the government censor, Chinese viewers raised new heights of artistic criticism and satire for their disrespect. Both professional and amateur, online critics published 'ideologically annoying' film from the point of view of slavery, 'Anyone on an amateur artist or any other purpose' wrote. One article was just titled, 'Hero, you made me sick!' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All for a film - annoying! All blockbuster epic movies are known to have some freedom in history history, but when trying to criticize Emperor Stilin or Hitler, 'Hero' passes artistic license as inefficient ignorance. 'Hero' is not entertaining or funny for this lack of moral compass. Instead, it creates an unfortunate weak attempt to 'become deep' and only leads to persuasive and propaganda. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that China's first emperor was cruelly violent, Mao Zedong knew that the ruler was acclaimed - no surprise, Mao gave his illogical rule. Likewise, Beijing's Communist government shows this metaphor, which can easily be dragged between the first emperor and his own iron fist methods, so they are particularly pleased with the latest work of Zhang Emo. 'Hero' star Tony Leung commented in an interview for the promotion of this film: In 1989, the Beijing government students did the right thing by crushing the protests, because it was necessary to maintain 'stability' in China. For this comment, Tony Leeung faced criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he only put the underlying message of the film with a loud and a loud whisked out loudly aloud loudly with a loud voice Aloud loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly aloud loudly Ore loudly cried aloud. In Kung Fu novels and films, the value of a traditional vow and vengeance, to reveal a higher knowledge. Unfortunately, his version of 'Knowledge' happened: The propagator is right. China, where the historical reality has spread this message for thousands of years, is the last resort where the industry can actually get freedom from such torture. The great popularity of the Kung Fu novel can be explained by an ability to escape in an alternative world: One where the Kung Fu fighters surrounded the country for courage and fight for war, free from fear and won against all kinds of conflict with them. Super-human skill. Only in the novel did the person win over the institutional power in China, and only in the novels the victims found their champions. Against this tradition of Kung-Fu's hero, Zhang Imao did not move towards the higher truth, as he had hoped, but as follows, at the level of government propaganda <br /> <br /> <br /> Some pictures of lovers can secretly think, 'All moral decisions aside, it's at least entertaining?' Fortunately, the answer is a great 'no!' Because the same story is said to be over with only a few variations, it tired to see. Furthermore, three conflicting versions of the same story only help confuse the character's development, since after the 'real' version is raised, it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its beautiful image. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect or enhance the storyline. Different colors are used to differentiate between different versions of the story, and cinematography is displayed in a rather beautiful way rather than self-consciously. Great for the trailer, but once you are frustrated to see the whole movie. <br /> <br /> For those who showed disrespect for the unrealistic Kung Fu in China, the 'Crouching Tiger' was very much expected from 'heroes'. 'Actor Jat Lee, an original Kung-Fu artist who kept the national title before starting his career as an actor. His earlier films have expressed limited performance skills, but many hope that Jhang Imu Lee's light can fully utilize his role in influencing body movements, which will not use his acting abilities. But it was not. 'Hero' tries to go out of Kung-Phoo style, so there are not many war scenes and Jaitu is expected to perform a difficult part of the acting: an internal transition directed towards deep foundation and self-sacrifice. Should be expected as casting director, Lee unfortunately fails. Meanwhile, the only film between Lee and Danny Jane, that reveals any true Kung Fu skills. The scenes that follow are frustrating, so 'heroes' of those levels fail to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Although most audiences outside of China are unlikely to be aware of the historic hazard story of cruelty. The first emperor, it seems more likely that they will accept Zhang's 'Chinese knowledge' version, whatever. Perhaps the spectators who came out of screening of 'Hero' were once at a glance - instead of shouting or breaking - there were special screenings for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
