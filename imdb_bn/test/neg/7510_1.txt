I hired this video in Lexington to work on the video store and I must say ... it should never have been. I also know some people who have done this, who are so sorry. Bad effects, awesome acting, especially bad scripts. I swear that the real PHX Resident Evil has not passed the dialogue! It's that bad. If you want to know which movie you want to create, then watch this movie learn two or two topics. If not, do not waste your time. And the director even sucks it because he is coming to try to get our movie Apple. No sir I have seen two-thirds of the horrific department and these rates are less than Plan 9 in outer space. Even Ed Edd said, "No, it's too stupid for me."
