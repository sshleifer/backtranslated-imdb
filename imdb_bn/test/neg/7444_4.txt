Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, Giant Omani Consumer Corporation is going to swallow new Delta City Everything is going on in the way of construction and a new danger in the shape of a kine, a cruel drug lord with the confusion of Christ, suppresses the deadly new addiction to the nuclear road. As he continued his struggle with the memory of his previous life, the tin-plated hero came out to take down this arch; only to cut pieces of scrap metal. Without Robocop's activities, the ruthless OCP business proposes its new Android plan - a machine stomping, snorkeling that requires the same powerless test - which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief confrontation on his system, Rob returned to the streets by bringing justice to the street and setting a score with kines. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a movie that you always manage to surprise while watching it, or you see how many times, a movie that can not be redone. That said, creating a sequel is not surprising - it's even less amazing that the sequence actually compares to the original. Empire Strike Backing Director Evin Kirkkarna has created an unexpected, little inconsistent and excessive film that can not catch the first film magic, as soon as he tries. And it must be that the funny advertisements running in the first movie do not stop, the corporate mood roars as fast and furious as fast and furious, but even the average of the first film with blood / Gore The first film has gained a name for some painful, bloody violence (a man's genetics is being blown up and people are cut into pieces), but it was even more memorable when the appearance of violence / gore on display here was even more evil and ineffective. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie, ? **
