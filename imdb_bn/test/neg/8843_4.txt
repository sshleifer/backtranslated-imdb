Although it starts with commitment, but a woman in the car is walking around the dark street in the night until she hits a man who is almost disguised! It gives me an impression that we are going to see something special, David Linchian (if there is such a word), unfortunately, the film starts replacing, with only a fun story, not just a central center. Women are trying to solve a mystery in a small town. Character study has gone everywhere, and I think it's really not able to care for any characters, especially when some stories suddenly move to flashback mode. I had some hope for this movie, but all of it, it was an isolation.
