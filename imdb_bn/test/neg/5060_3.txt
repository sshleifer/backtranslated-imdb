After spending the previous six years of writing and production, Luke returned to Angel-A's director. I'm a big fan of Leon, and the expectation of black and white French movies from the same chap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unable to pay his debt, and because of refraining from being stuck on the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decided to kill himself. She at the same time as a mysterious woman, she decides to save. To thank him, he started helping to fix his own life. <br /> <br /> The picture starts with a smile, which continues well throughout the whole. The work is quite beautiful and works well with Paris sights. But that's it. All the films that got going for it. And this only two difference films can do nothing to keep the storm of making a terrible movie terribly. Although I can not blame the main character much (although his inconsistencies were closed), the name is a terrible one. The appearance of a terrible screen and annoying boring. The plot ridiculously exposes itself to inconsistent, and sometimes weird foolish, especially; An end engendered by the scene immediately before the release of completely bloodied stranger. Probably the most ridiculous scenario I was observers of watching, it's stupid, lazy, melodramatic, and very "very funny of it's funny" too terrible. The overall firmness of the film may have potentially been possible once, but it has been massively massacred by the inevitable horrific implementation of its ideas. The film was indeed a work to watch, and which gave me the whole path by screaming on the screen. <br /> <br /> Huge and inefficiently flawed, just plain bad in the Angel. Although sometimes funny conversations lead to choral motifs at an interval, it is clear that this movie is nothing unnecessary.
