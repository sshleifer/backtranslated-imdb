Red Sonaza Carrier-The-Da-The-the-The-Direct for Arnold Schwarzenegger He made a little more serious acting role in films such as 'The Terminator' and 'Commando' by creating several films of 'N' astronomy (as Kanan), for a mysterious return to the 'N' astronomy style of the sword only for the 1985 discouragement. . It is difficult to understand why he is disturbed, because it is weaker than all the Canaan films in the imaginary section. Curiously, it was the third Canaan film, but for one reason or another, the title of the leading female character was shifted to the red head of title, which kept the old Arnold incredibly lowly supporting role. Director Richard Foster has also increased the idea of ​​20,000 underwater the sea, the Fantastic way, The Boston Strangler and 10 Reelington Place. Among them - his last film - Flasiano was a huge career move behind. <br /> <br /> Evil Queen Gerenen (Sandal Bergman) wants to rule the world, and he needs such an invaluable and powerful training. He and his brutal army kept the population by priests and stole strong magicians, killing the helpless priests while killing them. Among the deceased Imams, there is a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), who is a flaming red-headed warrior, who swears by vengeance for evil zerain after hearing about her sister's death. In search of the Gender Layer, the gold plate rides above the ground. He chose the way in the form of a son Prince, on behalf of the traveling companion, Turn (Arnie Reyes Jr.) and his bodyguard Falcon (Paul Smith). He will also show muscle fighter Kanan - sorry, I mean Kalidar (!) - wants to join him in search of him. Initially, Sonja did not want Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to help, but instead he wanted to prove his opponent alone and prove to defeat, but eventually he fought with him and accepted his help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . It is so straightforward and amateur that it can easily forget it for its kind of primitive example. This performance is poor due to the incredibly annoying mockery of Bergman's disgusting OTT villain from Schwarzenegger's wooden and disrespectful hero. Nilssen was slightly better as her heroine - perhaps the idea of ​​her first acting role was full of enthusiasm - but she was badly left out because of the silly stupidity of Clive Extension and George McDonald Fraser. The movie has been torn apart with violence, where Schwarzenegger is seen hacking under the bad boy, but in the same sequence there is not a corpse in the long shot scene. Technically it is very inactive, with sub-standard special effects and unexpected mechanical monsters. There is some compensation for the ENIO Merrron's enjoyable music (Mikeon provides good music for 80 extraordinary films, such as Island, Four Crowns Treasure and Hundra). Another compensation is the lensing position of Jeussape Rotonour - in fact, it's more fun to watch the beautiful scenery than from front to back, in most cases! There was very little sword 'N' astronomy films after Lal Sonaza, so in some ways it could fall down in history, which destroyed the film in its own way.
