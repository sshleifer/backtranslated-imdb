I did not have the chance to see my previous picture, but it was probably worse than what I read in other posts, although I suspect it is possible. I am fascinated by the huge fan of "Jabbar" style, and the mental aspects of watching the animals, all the purposes and intentions are for the people, a torture that is only suitable for shooting at the head. Who says, the hot 2 "vegetables" takes the film to a new place. <br /> <br /> I would like to express my complete humiliation to portray special forces in our country as the writer of this film, which is not really big spoilers (which I really do not have to do so) so you will not waste your time. Gomar Pill may have survived more than "Speak Ups" soldiers in this film. To make a loud cry, they should have called their special education force. If you are going to write a script where you want to send an elite team to deal with the jammy outbreak, at least soldiers may be smarter than walking bodies. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the group, but you can find a better way to set up their machine guns and to keep your shoulders on the shoulders of a walking person. And in the dark corner of the strange basement. <br /> <br /> The authors actually try to make the full Jumbo stuff a high-tech virus that they are looking for a vaccine, and the idea is qualified, if it does not get stuck in the middle of a ridiculous exhibition of harmful films. I mean, zombie films are not "high art", and visitors expect some tongue-and-neck glasses with tongue and thrill, but the hot two cheese types that chew you and make the channel fear and the characters are simply stupid. If you like a zombie movie fan like me, please make a Please and stay away from this one.
