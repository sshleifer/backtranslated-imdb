It is true that only 150K is spent for the film, it explains many things. But, it does not explain why it is not a real plot. Midway through film I do not really care if they do not make it or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The end was really stupid and I wanted to close the movie and I went to bed early. Considering there were not many good actors to go there with consideration. If you enjoy really bad movies with terrible lighting (even a cave) and bad camera work (even a cave) ... then you really love this movie. However, if the boy's plane is almost 10 years old or older, then it crashes in the 1980's, how can he speak, and create so much anger? He does not want to get help from the first man that even 14 years later?
