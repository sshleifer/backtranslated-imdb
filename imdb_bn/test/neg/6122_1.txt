I think this movie is very interesting called a thriller. It's a thriller but <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear the piano. Then you hear the sound of the piano. Then some people talk about an incident that does not express concern for a person. <br /> <br /> Then hear the piano again. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film was the reason for registering an IMDB for me, because I think this movie is a warning to mankind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, if any holes in hot chocolate spread, it becomes the most effective part. Also very interesting: "Actors". Yes, quotes are deliberate, you can think, because they do not work. They play piano and do little work, but they are not acting. <br /> <br /> I think before this movie I did not leave any movie and I was angry. Indeed, this picture made me angry. The time and money I spent for angry.
