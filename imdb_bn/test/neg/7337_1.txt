Is it just or really bad racing team Japanese and their arrogant star races seem to be a little over Germany? Perhaps it is like the International Racing Circuit but if America represents them, then they will be encouraged by other countries like Kodi and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who still has to learn how to work). The source movie may be good, but characters should be fun and no one will fulfill that criteria in this movie. Make it briefly - a very bad movie.
