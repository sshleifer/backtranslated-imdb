Remember when I came to this show. It is essentially notified as a mini series. At the end of the last episode, it is said, "Continue", the disappointment of those people who crossed the word and saw the whole annoying. It's finished to finish, so yes, you can blame the series for a finish. This plan was different for the other, if the rating was higher, it was an annoying event that was too long, and when they said that they did nothing annoying, they did nothing else. A few comments blame the cancellation of its cancellation and the lack of finishing up to the public, when the truth is not about the show, that's the end of the plan to end it, it's just a harmful end.
