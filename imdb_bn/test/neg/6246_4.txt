The fourth custom of Cheerleader genocide slam party genocide series, operated by Jim Weinowski (Chopping Mall, The Sweep Thingy Return). Just think about it: It's really a care of anyone in the fourth chapter of a slashher series! So how could this be good? Well, it's not! But since when did Slashar films be good? Cheerleader genocide is amusement, that is sure. But in the field of entertainment, we saw it better, also sure! You can see, I'm not sure where I can stand regarding this movie. Those nudity will only be more than satisfied to watch the slashhers. This movie is all boobs, but unfortunately no blood, not enough. I think I'm generous with this movie because I was good at seeing it and I really enjoyed watching Slashar films, and sometimes they are too bad. If you want to be sincere, Slamara party genocide part 1 best and others also waste time, so I think I have a lot of time to waste! For more fun, see Slipway Camp 2 and cheerleader camp.
