I realized that it was an effort to save a film from Louis Koufman's Pitt. The audio was voiced on the whole movie since the relay was junk. There was so bad and terrible quality over the voice. As much as I love Troma, they feel a little heavy on the job. Acting was terrible. What I've been enjoying from this movie is that of Tray Parker's fastest Cairo, which is a joke with a curse cat. The film has a great director dude like James Gunn and Eli Roth (friend of Lloyd Kauffman). Again I think this is not trying to save a tragedy of Lewis and try to lose a thousand dollars of dollars. I did not have to go on and on but this movie was a mess. See other Troma titles.
