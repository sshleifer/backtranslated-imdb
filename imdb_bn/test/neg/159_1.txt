This film fails to count towards each. It provoked it for an initial, "significant" effort and miserably failed. The script was extremely extreme, anyone said something remotely interesting at any time. It was impossible to care about any of the characters in that letter. There was a self-contained waste of nightly time, while Siena Miller was simply wasted time. The bit about the soldier was a proponent of the film used to go to war, even before it. Use of World War II was the use of a clich√© itself ... shelter for bombs, tube stations etc ... employed to import many more essential drama. Why someone was worth this picture right now is quite beyond my understanding of thinking for a moment. It is yet another case, "Let's look dress up, do not think anything about stories, scripts or acting!"
