This is a really really bad movie. However, it feels great to laugh at awesome ideas and "special" effects. The plot center around an EU space agency, which invented the 10th planet rotating directly against the Earth. They send a man-made mission (they went to Mars and have discovered this planet yet?) Is anyone fool for this planet?) And you can believe it, the mirror of the planet that they came from. Most everything is expected from that point. You can only guess everything from the title of the real movie. The only surprising thing here is the Manpod Space Program, which is operated by Ukrainian :) Plot concept or execution can not really be an excuse. So it feels good to laugh or if you change consciousness.
