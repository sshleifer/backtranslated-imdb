This is a hairy comedy. <br /> <br /> Here is why a man and wife sitcom. OK. <br /> <br /> The husband is a douche bag. Wife Einstein. <br /> <br /> How much is this original? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Close this now. <br /> <br /> Last word: stupid. The average white man continued to destroy ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He's not just here Leah Remini is great eye candy, but unlike. Distorted talent word. Bad sitcom
