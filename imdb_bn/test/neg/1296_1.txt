I was horrified for this movie and was hit by the script. All characters seem to render immune to personal problems - rather like the deer in the headlights. While taking decisive action they dither around screaming and moaning about their emotions. I shouted at the TV screen, trying to wake up in their situation and did something! The plot line is integral. Each time a significant decision taken by a lead character, the other letters will bring all the problems with a clear decision, though the decision will give more difficult - it's a try to shed melodramatic and just wants to bother you. Obviously the import of this decision is obvious - there is no need to treat audiences like audiotherapist. Overall - There are too much mental melody in the whole movie.
