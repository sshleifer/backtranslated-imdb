Wow, kiss your wife, do not be bad, but it was not good. It was not sure that "the next day saint" The movie is swimming in the center ... maybe more than 30 minutes to be able to make more enjoyable films. But the film again leaves the scenes with boring mistress and below - The whole gold owing sequence comes in mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was created for theater release, it looks and sounds more. Like made for TV movie. Each scene is light like a department store. So many characters are throwing away. <br /> <br /> And your favorite Toro is really amazing surprise. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a big room rehearsal dinner in the big table - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people for 250 rooms! Where did everyone go? <br /> <br /> The gay movie has gone down to the new ... but horror films are not being made and shown here! Channel.
