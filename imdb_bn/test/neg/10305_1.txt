The first season was great - a good mix of jobs and home and friends in the house. It was actually a beautiful fun ceremony. <br /> <br /> Now it turns out and brother and two hot girls have gone - and the whole thing is moving around the airline. Even the old man ran the company, even got upstairs, where it was perfect. <br /> <br /> No more Sir Mason - one of Hollywood's best girls. <Br> <br /> What happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show. You can almost see the interview "The old man is funny, focusing on him, to get him to the top and let him do everything about the airline. It will be the soft version of the office!" However, no hot girl, no watch.
