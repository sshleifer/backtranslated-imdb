Seeing the picture of Sidney Palak, I have never linked him to this film. This is his worst movie. Absolute Drake The dialogue is wood and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christian Scott Thomas has been lost in this movie. There is nothing about his character that you even want to believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Like Harrison Ford Valium There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is awful, and he is very smart to see that. So whether it is studio's liability or anything else, the smog of a kind of money, but it's just bloody!
