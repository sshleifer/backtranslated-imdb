A common old B & W film. Dialogues are sometimes good, but very often - especially in the second half - they are naïve, sometimes very naïve, sometimes near the point where they are weird ridiculous. The first third, Lades Gatsby, shows her background information with a series of interesting flashbacks, the best part of the movie. But once Gatsby came to his new villas and made his patch in the bowl field, the film became too much melodramatic. Finishing is still another knockout out; I do not know whether the novel itself has changed this stupid, closed end or the producer of the film, but in the end of the story, I always considered car accidents poorly in order to add drama. I saw this plot-device millions of times (or if it is not a car, it falls from the horse); The author does not know how to finish the story but he knows that he wants to be dramatic, so he joins a car accident. Lame And to make things worse, the plot is plot-intelligent and time-based both coincidence and overwhelming; Plot-intelligence is the reason that the husband's ownership of the field died by the ground, and he came out on the street from the gas station on the streets of Winters, although he did not notice the years he lived there, there was a dangerous road next to his home - and, of course, he The moment she came out, she saw the car of the lad and made it wrong for the fielder's husband and then Chi That is to say, "Here! I'm here! Give me a ride and end the tragic way that!"; Timely because Lad and Field are very involved in the accident when preparing to tell Field's husband about their adapter. Basically, this accident is just a lot of compulsory and artificial mockery. Winters, the husband of The Silva, raided the man who ran his wife, who tried to retaliate to kill him. He is basically looking for car scratches from this car, car walking like a zombie, and really played badly too. Throughout the film, The Silva's performance and behavior of her character are both terrible and confusing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He died before the end of this movie - he may be stupid in this movie You can complain by scripts. Or, perhaps his novels were better than Silly and more naive than the film, and in fact the screen adaptations were developed. Or, movies are just as beautiful as novels. I could, of course, find this special novel, but I just can not be bothered. Fitzgerald's name does not inspire me to read any of his books (and that does not mean my name.) He certainly did not have Hell, Claval, or Twain. More like Hemingway? Nothing much about noise.
