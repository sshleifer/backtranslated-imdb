From the start of the meteor shuffle to the world, you know that you are in a special case. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget shot of a video movie about a video of teenagers stuck in Lighthouse Island. With some monsters. The story is disrespectful and you have never seen it before. Acting is not great, but not entirely awesome, but special effects - in which a good deal - the best ridiculous. In fact, if you can read this sentence, then there is more than 50% probability that you can do more reliable work to create video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Movie Salvage - If you are in the mood of a movie grade Z Turkey - there is always something happening that is never boring. And if you want to make bad movies fun with your friends, you can get a dollar rental only. <br /> <br /> I must say that I first praised the first, "This is the lowest name I ever heard of." Perhaps the best moments in the movie.
