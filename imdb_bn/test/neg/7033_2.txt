It was an unexpected bad film! Ashley Rose Arro was horrible, did not have the charm of Sheryli Temple! That terrible smile when he opened his piggy little eyes, it seemed that it looked beautiful and the audience had to go - "Ahh bless!" It just want me to slap her. He must be "my good morning!" About a hundred times throughout the film. He could also say a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle. Horribly horrible movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would like to. Do not waste your money in this piece of trash, go outside and buy a genuine Sheryli Temple film!
