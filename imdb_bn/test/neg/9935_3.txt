The series does not start as it means to go. Although it is incredibly difficult in the first two seasons, along with the average period, it is narrow with many menus, but then the speed increases and one of the best place opera is born. Star Trek: The Next Generation The first episode of the first episode is remarkable for two things: it's a very enjoyable role for all major cast and the extraordinary pronunciation of Marina Cirtis that will later disappear. It is very pleased to see how it started, and the series is really going on in the minds of everyone else. Otherwise it would feature a very middle-class episode Q and some giant jellyfish. That's right.
