Mr. Seagal has more recently reduced his (already less) value and has now outdone himself for making bad movies. There are so no substances in foreign scripts. It has done an even worse job in the director and music and scores so cheezy and malplaced that you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. The movie is already 10 minutes, you just want to stop it. However, considering the past films of Steven Sighal, you think 'Hey, some great steps-show the order at least valuable ...' ... you're wrong! As film progresses it gets only worse. Everyone (with a few exceptions) speaks to each person that is good, bad or innocent, innocent or not. The only good thing with the movie is that it's over and it's been less time. Put the movie in two words: Survive!
