I'm major in mainstream television sitcoms such as Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. etc. Over the years many sitcoms have come on air and those very small percent are genuinally smart and fun. The War at Home is mostly the example of modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10 deliveries because it's a comedy, but it does not seem to be the way to go out of a good comedy. You should spray your legs with your big wings in a good comedy, you will not be able to see them coming and in TWAH I just see every joke coming. The letters are probably the most straightforward and horrible stereotype that I have seen on the screen and the performance is not very good for the father, which is a stereotypical beer drink game that perfectly illustrates American American intellectuals. <br /> <br /> Poor performance, incredible characters and jokes that do not prevent you to keep an eye on any place that can prevent you from watching this show. If you do not have cable and want to watch comedy, try the Boston legal. It's more valuable to your time.
