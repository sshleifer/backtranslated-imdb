This final Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I give credit to this movie too! My best estimate for the reason for creating this movie is that anyone wanted to show someone else's martial arts skills, but realized that you can not only fight a man with other people and people can not act in movies to watch it, so he fought a story ... and people still do not see it. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this movie was thin onion skin. That was played in Kung Fu and no Kung Fu movie's stereotypical. Dubbing is literally bad I've ever heard. It seems that if you play a small role in this film, such as fatty people or two are trying to catch the main character of the net, it does not matter what your voice is doing more. It could be a disliked with a slurred stutter and nobody said anything. But alongside all of this, the film itself makes up with some terrific war scenes. <br /> <br /> War scenes must have been about this movie. But there was a great absurdity of war! In most cases a person goes out of the tall grass, or looks at the main character from a distance and then attacks him. But once the war started, the sort of thing balanced out. Although there were two things that really prevented the war. That constant "wooshing" effect of the word has been added to each swing of a fist or foot or sword, and poor editing that is 25 percent annoying and sticky. Some will be in the middle of the flip behind and then suddenly kicks in the ground, and then they will stop a punch on their legs. But cutting and pasting editing is more annoying than anything else but it does not affect the movie as a whole. Ultimately, it was not a great movie, but I did not expect a great movie. Do not expect a great movie to watch a box cover like this movie. I saw this movie as if there was a way to overcome an hour and a half of annoyance. I rarely say, but it was only one of those movies for which you have no practical use, so whenever you get some free time you will see it. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it!
