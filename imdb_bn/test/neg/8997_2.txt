After reading most of the excitement about this film, I decided to rent it despite some suspicion of TV. I should follow my feelings. <br /> <br /> I tried so much to get warmed up in the movie and found the eligibility in it but I could not do it. The story never attracts you or rises the truth, and the actress is the best and ridiculous ridiculous. Everything in this product is amateur. <br /> <br /> Always a joy, Mary McDonnell can be the only actor to protect from disaster without damaging her career or reputation. I will not even be bothered to even check the name of the leading person - I hope he is doing advertising again. <br /> <br /> Even poor Venacea Redgrave, whom I respect and respect, he made Catherine Hepburn all the time. She is really drugged at home. Maybe he needs money. <br /> <br /> If I can save one person without spoiling 100 minutes in this tripe, I will be sure.
