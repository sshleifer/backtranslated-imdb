I usually do not have an ongoing categorization as annoying. I do not need action flicks bigger and my senses are not needed to be excited during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good reasonably logical dialogue and story lines. Unfortunately, this movie has no features. Diane Lane is the only preservation grace on this film and her beauty can not even save it. Terrible overbearing music moronic dialogue and equal acting. An actor actually connects with each other, and as a result the film does not connect with the audience. I guess the scenes where the townspeople seem to be moving somewhere, have been added to the story but it appears that they were inserted just to fill the space. The scene appeared sticky and inconvenient. There were some nice ocean shots and beautiful sea beaches.
