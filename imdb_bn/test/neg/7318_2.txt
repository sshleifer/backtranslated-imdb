Oh boy .. this movie is so middle that I really do not know exactly what to write. <br /> <br /> I think it's not easy to write: <br /> <br /> This is not very entertaining. It's not original. And there is no single character in my whole movie. I think about it. <br /> <br /> A certain reality on MTV reminds me of a TV show, but without any funny people. It just drags over and I can wait for it to finish. Jennifer Lions (C: <br /> <br />) I think many times to find a good thing to tell about this movie. What I liked was not a reminder. Judge a person by the first impression you received (when Holly accused Nicole) she earned 2 scores out of 10 instead.
