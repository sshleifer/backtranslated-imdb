This movie sucks. The performances were worse when we were 10 years old with Camcoder, the effects looked like a computer game of 80 and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make this look crappy. 'Bad boys' pronunciation and lectures are so interesting ... .. <br /> <br /> I can not act unless you are a big actor Become a fan. 10 out of 1
