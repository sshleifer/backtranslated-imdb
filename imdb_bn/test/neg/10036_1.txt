Are you kidding me This is probably the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The cast was awesome, the acting was worse than the terrible, and I'm sorry, the picnic man loaded his plate with the filling of the food and was surrounded by the dual glasses and chamber pots surrounding the curly push. When I roared about Bell Wech, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and it seems as if it is possible as a possible story. But this movie has been completely destroyed. Rick White (Director, Writer, Lead Actress, etc.) took himself very seriously and I think he credits more than his own ability .... Please make a favor on your behalf .... Avoid it.
