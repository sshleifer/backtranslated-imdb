With so much terrible camouflaged cinema, it is sadly a breath of new air in the section. It is horrific compared to classics such as airplanes or nude guns, but it is very clever and original compared to recent fools movies like Meet the Spartans and Duster movies. Do not make me wrong, though, this is not a good movie in any way. I laugh a couple of times, and there are some inspired gags, but the references to a pop culture are flat on their face, as in most of the jokes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Lambbow Fields (David Kochner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he has been brought back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hurdin) is feeling away from her and her daughter is playing a football big shot to disturb her father. Various recent movies appear in disguise, such as spectacular gog and nonstop stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is not dependent on the recent movie references. Radio, Rocky, Dosbol, Friday Night Lights, Unknown and other other sports movies are not fun at all. It's mainly a little tumbler that gives a smile like a scratching scene, or chewing tobacco throbbing mix. This short-haired movie can not carry a film and ultimately it is difficult to see. It's annoying to sit for the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Characters have been surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie, but I'm not sure that these characters were made from clich√©s from the genre. Yet, they are not very bad. David Koechner can pull off a movie lead actress. Very bad they gave him many crummy elements to work with. Matthew Lawns is a cross-dressing dancer with a cross-dressing dancer always has fine comedic time in the charming role as a football player. Carl Westers of the Cast of Rounds, Sub-Parse Sports Movie (drama The Rocky Cinema ... Happy Gilmore!) Above all, it's a stupid comedy. Occasionally, it's funny, but not more, it's very annoying and anticipated. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** of 1/2. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, sexual mood and drug smile
