It opens - and half an hour, runs - like the Old Testament education program, though not humor. The movie finally started to increase the wings when the Bible gets to the drop of the drop. One of the mixed successes, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decided to revive the apocalypse and the final quarter of one hour is what humanity is all about? The guild with an optimistic idea of ​​a long (scheduled, unfortunate iron) long shot of play-out, WTC twin towers. <br /> <br /> Apart from Donovan's authority, the role is divided. The rest of the castes have Thespian Meldrum: Although it is officially produced for biblical representation, it is suitable for the modern, paranoid comedy aimed at the strike. But I was surprised to be surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (thus contributing to the dangers in the existing films as a pop star, in a set piece of record store and dangerous patchy soundtrack, which contributed). He was cold - I adopted a continuation of the inadequate lack of focus in the way of many pop icon icons for the film (I'm thinking of performance jugger here), but still maintained firm unity with both cast and project. <Br /> <br /> Finally, it is positive, but this intelligently depends on a bit more like one and firmer than the imagination of the audience. 4/10
