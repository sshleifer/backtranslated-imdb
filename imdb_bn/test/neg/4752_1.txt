The value of AVP2's production can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, even in the imagined areas of AVP: What is good for the predator ship? Why does the Predator clear all the signs of its effect and waste valuable time with the body of the overwhelming human body? Why the hunter alone? Why the hunter itself is decorated on the planet but on the planet of his house? In the end, instead of bombarding the entire countryside, why does a deadly man make his work so uncomfortable? After using one, instead of collecting them together, the hunter has more weapons and more drops. In the end, he left his armor in front of the war in the Battle of Predlalian: A bad mask for the final battle between the first hunter between Arnie and Predator. The predator's gesture is highly exaggerated that she is moving like a Japanese sumo like a highly skilled exotic-safari-hunter. The whole story is a mess as one can see immediately. But it becomes worse because this dressed job is filled with some detailed information about the boring patchwork of isolated interludes, or the criminal past of two brothers (Dallas and Ricky) like the long pizza ordering episode. Sheriff is certainly the friend of these two criminals who keep repeating regularly. (Not absolutely essential for strong beliefs and intrigues). Besides, actors' acting is also terrible. AVP2 is a shameful part of the shit of a former alien or predetermined cinematographer and high-quality actor. Finally, the film's verb really poor. There is no single view of the audience warrant where the audience can see the whole set. Each and every war is imprinted in short and shaky bursts with almost zoomed up in full darkness. This results in an overwhelming experience for the viewers because most of them can not see anything except dark shiny screens. <br /> <br /> I direct that two directors, Brother Strauss, buy a styled cam and send a text to the modern CG so that the next picture has visible visualization of some visible steps and thus the power of their bad directions will not be concealed. <br /> <br /> I would advise anyone against watching this movie (Solid AVP fans also have to die): Preferably the first or the original allen or original predator movies but avoid spoiling yourself by spoiling your valuable time on this failure.
