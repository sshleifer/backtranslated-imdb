A stupid movie with a stupid plot. It seems like they threw every imaginable clich√© in a blender. I especially "liked", where two teenage girls got the French president to clean water. Because we all know how much America offers to the environment. Kyoto, someone ?? And the French chef, who has not seen or seen Hamburger ever since ... This is why people think that Americans have no culture. That's when we came to Europe in Europe, we are not as bad as two evil preyats in this movie, "we can see the world" (ie eat in McDonalds in the foreign capital), but they are just the same amount of cultural knowledge and good behavior.
