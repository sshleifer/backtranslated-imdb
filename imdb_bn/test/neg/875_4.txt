Although I did not read the book, I had a lot of hope for this picture. Richard Care and Diane Lane together - will already be good. But the film is not promised commitment. I kept waiting for more depth in the letters and was not there. I have no problem that it only took time during a holiday for them to fall in love. That could happen. But we do not really know the characters. I would like to focus more on them. This picture reminds me of Madison County Bridges, and that movie was a lot better. I really felt for those characters, and there was a chemistry (a lot of emotion) between Clint Eastwood and Merrill Strip, which was not in the gear and lane. Each of them is very good actor in his own right. Do not have the right movies for them together.
