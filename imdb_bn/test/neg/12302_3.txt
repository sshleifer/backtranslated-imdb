The only thing to tell about the cat in the cat ... is a kidney movie and it's a good comedy movie ... I saw how many deadly jokes in this movie that were not just sucked up, just the right kids. Oh and the way the cat was talking about the cat was annoying ... I totally forgot for the plot. As it sucked anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers has joined, but I think the author is trying to make a sound like this with Austin's power without a strange talk and it has been very successful - but what was it boring? Do not see it - it's in the 100's below .............................. Jokes are so weird it's fun
