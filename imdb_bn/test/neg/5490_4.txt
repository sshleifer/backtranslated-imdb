This movie comes to the very familiar ground - Art and Confusion of Artists Life. It does not specifically say novel or interesting topics about this and actually rather dull. Especially the final scene is interminably tiring. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Minor letters Ben Gazara plays an old and little-touch actor, who gets a full-fledged animal of police hijacking his performance while arresting him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember Saturday Night Live its character "Continental"; An elderly Yorotrash Satyar is trying to get a young woman behind the furniture and take her to bed? He made a similar change in the film, his young man (male) hunted around a old table and driven him with champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was great and annoying, but mostly annoying.
