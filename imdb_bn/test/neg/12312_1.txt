When my own child leaves the opening ceremony of this movie and begging me, then I know it's bad. I wanted to close my eyes. I wanted to reach the screen and wanted to humiliate Mike Mayer to finish his dignity. This is some of my life films that I have seen and want to immediately "unmarked", if that is possible. Other movies are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than this whip from the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself for a terrible endeavor to forget myself today. This blasphemy with the name of good cues <br /> <br /> To Mike Meyer, I ask Austin to revive the Stick or Wayne World. The reason for working only for Jim Carrier, this does not mean that Sius is the success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
