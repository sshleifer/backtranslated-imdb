At the beginning, I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Dutch cinema. Unfortunately, I did not change my mind at seeing de Domini. It is very predictable for my taste and share some common errors like having a plot that linear. Worse than the cast dialogue is that they are stage-actor in a game. Unfortunately it's also common in many Dutch movies and at least it seems impossible for me to engage with the main characters. <br /> <br /> Actor playing the game (I'm sorry, I forgot her name at the moment) giving at least a decent performance, and I'm just one reason why the film is not even worse. Another reason is that at least it had some budget and the production was professional. <br /> <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that the role is often summarized if you do not speak Dutch, but the problem may not be so much, although I have already warned you that this plot is not spectacular but at least it Can be an acceptable movie to watch.
