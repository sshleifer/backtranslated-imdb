Where do I start? The film's plot, which is about love between two high school students during the war, and a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. It was based on a manga of Shin Takahashi, which became an anime in 2002, which I have not yet read or seen. <br /> <br /> Although this review is about this live action adaptation. Sadly, the honesty of this good work was a terrible movie. It is not that someone can give specific directions and for example, the budget is blamed, or blaming the act. Sadly, the coolest and the ineffective elements to bring this film down are <br /> <br /> acting is poor. Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka did not say bad actors, but there was not much to work with them, and seemingly miscast. There was no physical range to attract viewers in the story, and as well as for their portions it was too old to have a misleading degree. <br /> <br /> The script was poor, the leaders act unreasonably and behave unreasonably. The film is playable for heartfelt, but in the end, being predicted, not being forced all the time, and developing under the characters. There are also pacing problems. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it is ineffective. The film uses hugely and unnecessarily green screen in many scenes. Other special effects also have a cheaper appearance, especially where easy-to-use special effects can be used. Scenes are not visible, such as cinematographer or art designer, scenes are consistent and showcasing enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The effects of music and sound were good, but unreliable. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Overall, fans of the series should not be discouraged at least once for at least the end of the movie. It is not the place to enter, because it is probably not a very good movie or melody, with strangers with cycads. This is not a film or cast and a staff fault, it is not just inspired and it is killing it.
