"What emotions!" A woman said after coming out of the theater after seeing Polish brother Pian in Engmer Bergman. There are some symbols right there. But not many "NorthFork" added up to some fine acting that has been weakened by the great cinematography, which is a coherent statement and a confused story that irritates instead of enthralls. <br /> <br /> NorthFark is a city facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam. In operation. This is a team of mid-1950s and uniformly clad state agents, they all seem to have responded to a casting call for "untouchables", they have the task of relocating to the rehabilitated residents who have failed to realize their immediate danger and both of them as well. Donate proffered for moving. An exciting anti-development movie is always a possibility but real: The rural power plant is one of the leading economies of improved living in America's history and one of the advances in the advanced economy. Bamboo can be built without forced transfer? Not in this country <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is less than the hypocrisy of the hypocrites, this is a fantasy creation of pastoral imagination of a mortal young boy. Nick Nolt is a priest who lived with the boy and if he can hear most of what he said, it could be interesting. <br /> <br /> The change in the black-right deportation agents ("Work for Lakefront", "land when the dam builds valuable seeds), and a fantastical collection of strange, the film does not develop the theme even consistent or even attractive. br /> <br /> Cinematography is poor. A corrupted, subdued and depressed color permeates the whole film a little dramatic purpose. At this huge terrain Nikrstabhabe there is no reason to be represented. In fact, most of the natural beauty and diversity of the dam and the power plant has been a very effective contrast between the massive and severe stiffness. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
