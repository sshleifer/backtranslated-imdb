(This review does not reveal the plot of the movie, but it can change the expectations of a movie and thus create a less enjoyable experience.) <br /> <br /> Never hired a scary movie, And instead of the stupid turn of the plot ended the laughing hilarious? There were many opportunities for this film to be printed and the audience was scared. It was badly cut and jumped too close; The reason behind the rehearsal of the past seems to be an excuse for why the plot was moving towards its particular direction. The authors should not have thought that how a possible plot should be done, because the time spent on the plot discourages the viewer and makes the film more tedious. Worse than abuse by authors who might be almost a classic and classic thriller, it is slowly dependent on awesome cheap strategies. Acting is not terrible, and the situation rarely makes it scary, so it needs some dark scenes by shaking it to do something suitable for you. Even those were predictive. <br /> <br /> Even the Gori could not save the plot, and it competed with the thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Se7en is saying, I've tried to follow Se7en's incredibly interesting psychological theme, but failed to do so failed. I was terrific frustrated at the lack of analysis surrounding the killer psychology and the lack of structure of the plot. Early scenes make the viewer excited, thinking that this is a psychological thriller; I believe it's far away. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention poor acting? Initially, Kerry Elves seems to make a credible performance; However, the most important part of this plot is completely destroyed. I was left in tears of this performance smile, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Wheelel is terrible and very out-of-the-box, though not as bad as Elves's performance, and the big red flag is a writer for Hannan. <br /> <br /> The last part of the shower is not ready to be lost in the middle, and this is a huge failure. It's a chance lost, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover have been nominated to play this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This course was not worth $ 4, and in the future I would definitely avoid seeing anything with Elves, Hannel or James Howard. Can be. There was not a big tragedy that was not based on its plot, it was that the possible story had been reduced and the poor performance was humiliated to hit. I will avoid the poor puns involved in the title and just end up with this: do not see this movie.
