Previews were so funny that I could not wait to see this movie. I came home and said, I could not feel more embarrassed in this film. Yes was fun and funny fun, but the stereotypical role was painful. Joan Plowright was a poor actress but just poor taste in the scene with "Negro Spiritual". For most of the white crowd, there was nothing to say in the movie house and was far away (I was a little too small in black).
