I give 4 reasons for this movie because I'm a deadly fan of the video game series. Graphics and animations are fantastic and the whole gang of CG forms are nice to see. Cuffrith is still cold <br /> <br /> For now, it got only four good ones. I have never seen acting (I have seen epic film) <br /> <br /> The movie only seems to be so central to the cloud so that it even embarrasses the fans with clouds and makes clouds. The clouds have so much mention that it does not want you to see him in this movie <br /> <br /> Villains have a reward for the worst villains (I was more afraid of the evil witch in the west) <br /> <br /> All other characters in the movie are kept in movies only for entertaining fans and then do not accept it further. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has been waiting for 9 years and this is the head of Square Synx to shoot the person responsible for burning every copy of the movie. We got a big nasty and annoying cut scene to earn. Get involved in this and create a new movie of Ashes (it would be better to create a movie on live movies and make them based on the original game)
