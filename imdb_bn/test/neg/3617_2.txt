Do not waste your time. One of the parade boxes you want to select in Blockbuster, but it is also not worth it. You do not say, "It's bad, it's good." Just, "it's bad." The Greatest American Hero is a writer who rents a cabin on the African island, named Snake Island. Some other tourists leave that boat, but they are not staying on the island. They just stop to stop the author. Then leaked in the boat, and - Real Hollywood Originality - The only and only radio show on the island. So they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes. Like hundreds of them, which became really annoying and you know that the plot will go anywhere. It's not like it was one of the main snakes ever. A giant mutated snake or all snakes like an extra poisonous king. Instead, there is a bunch of species of ham-e-demider snakes of all kinds. Their only aim was to flee from the island ... to oppose the enemy. Because there were many snakes, you knew that they probably could not try to kill all of them, and they did not try. I saw a movie where a city was deceived by a snake and they took all the snakes into a cave and then flown it. At least then you get the feeling that good feelings kill bad guys and it was a normal end. In Snake Island (by the way, every single character was stunned to see a snake on the island ... two, it was the name of Sam Island for a reason), there was no other plan than trying to get gas for a fool's boat. Oh, they do not get gas by the way. They are already "OK" to find another boat on the island.
