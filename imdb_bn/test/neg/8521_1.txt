A British gangster film you are dead is an indiscribably terrible attempt. There is no real concept in this as a nasty copy of the various components of Lock Stock and two smoking barrels, the Yosey Souppes and Pulp Fiction. Acting and dialogue is absolutely inspirational, despite the continuous efforts of conspiracy the curiosity is ridiculous and completely predictable, and there is nothing except one dimensional stock letter and clich√©s. It has some good actors, but they are unable to do anything with the off-form, and the terrible stuff they're working on. It is absolute torture to sit through this drill.
