This movie is like every other horror movie. It is predictable not only to build up and progress and to succeed in bringing something original or frustrating on the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the movie, which was a committed original concept for a movie overall. <br /> <br /> You can say this movie is a big walk with modern horror movie clichés. It contains all the elements that modern horror films often do not look very cool. One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive young baby. Why are they putting stuff like this kind of movie? The same goes for the direction of drama, which includes the family. It does not work for movies only and is far from interesting or effective. This often shoots movies and shows an annoying one. <br /> <br /> <br /> It has all its clichés but it does not succeed in bringing a screen well on screen. This is simply a very poor as a horror movie. It does not handle its horror or pull very well. The fans of the genre have to enjoy a lot. The story of the film is not well-connected and made in film. Most of the time the movie continues to sleep in part and it never lets its horrors jumpy completely. <br /> <br /> The movie often turns dark (not sure that it wants to hide a fairly low budget) and it shows very little, most of the cases you can not only see them very well. <br /> <br /> You can look at this movie and say that director J. Cardone has many talents for the genre and does not know how to properly handle its current components. He tried some things in the past but all his movies have failed. He just tries unfortunately. Who knows, perhaps with the right people behind the camera (such as Twee Hopper, who was directly connected directly to), this film could still be somewhat modest. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, mostly big unknown. The film's biggest name is Ben Cross, but its role is very small and very simply not enough for the film and its story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
