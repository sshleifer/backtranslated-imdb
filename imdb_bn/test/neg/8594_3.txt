The basic plot can be good and compelling. The music is so big that it became the theme song for the TV show Iron Chef (though it is too unused and too confusing in the film). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!? Well, the plot was expected to be about 95% and the letters were as 1-dimensional as possible. And dialogue?! Who will allow someone to get credit for attempting to communicate with Stupid Mach Bull-Buff? You get a lot more realism from the cartoon! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points, but it's so deadly by hackneyed reviews and circulating dialog that it gets tired quickly. And, it's a shame, because the firemen deserve a better respect than this mess! If you do not believe me, see the number of detective numbers listed in the IMDB for this movie - WAY is more than what you want. They just do not care enough to work on all the kinks and problems. So, the film appears and requires re-writing and re-editing.
