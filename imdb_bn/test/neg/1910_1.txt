I was interested in watching this movie, but when I finally got the opportunity, I was very disappointed. I was off half way due to poor script and instructions (or is it the way to the quarters?). There is no mention of poor color! Josh Hartnet can only act, and he is more appropriate to be the hero of the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie failed to draw my sympathy, even for the purpose of the author. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the weak couple can only hate me! <br /> <br /> <br /> I think all the people of this generation have to sit and review together so that they do not make the same mistake the next time. And next time they might consider Josh Hartnett as a playwright ...
