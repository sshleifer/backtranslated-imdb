I can not tell anyone that it was a real good entertaining movie. It is hard to believe with some well-known actors that it was only made in 2005. It's crap! Acting amateur dramatists, poor amateur tantamount to dramatic. If you do not want to laugh at 100 minutes of pure food, do not get bored for download or rent, which I have seen in a few years. It's played from the past days, where the cowboy shot six bullets from six shooters. The better actors, they were bad, Drury was just sad. I was very disappointed with Li Mazar, did he actually come with such garbage? It was bad enough when he was playing six million dollar people.
