I've seen this Robin Williams have fun with the car. I think you will talk about a political satire about it. This is a political talk show hosts / Commondians who have decided to become president and unexpectedly win. I mostly ridiculed myself. , And Robin Williams are much more moderate and stronger than usual. I would say that the film is more dramatic than a comedian, with some mystery and mystery. I think the dramatic parts work better than comedy parts and the mystery and suspense aspect (although it was a small part of the movie) did the best. Still, I could not rate this movie too much. For me it was just 2 hours, but there was nothing special. My best advice would be to capture it on TV / cable or to buy it cheap first, before deciding. My vote for Man of the Year 4/10
