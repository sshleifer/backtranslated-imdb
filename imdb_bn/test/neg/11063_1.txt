This will be one of the bad movies that I have ever seen. On a par and just boring with Blair witch. Flashing helmet lights make things harder to look at and I think the epilepsy will pay attention because the moments with strawing make the film even more annoying. I think if they are calm, they might find out. Then when you think that Guy could trump up even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when a person who is sexually understands that the girl says that she can hear something. He can really hear something. One of them saw at least the scram (where they attracted your attention to such things). When it's so much love in a love and when someone writes the script it's a big lot-down. So sorry guys I got it at the weekly video shop and I still want my money back.
