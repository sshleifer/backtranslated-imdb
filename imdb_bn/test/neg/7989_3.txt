"Menlo Park Wizards" was deeply responsible for many things given in 2007: Even if they did not invent them without their rivals or supporters, they would not be able to produce electric lights, phoneographs, motion picture cameras, electric car batteries, electric power grids (perhaps its most important but The least expected invention), the default house and the telephone and the telegraph Ticker-tape machines as well as an initial voting machine The total number of patents is more than 1000 - more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> Edison was a cruel business contestant. He often fought large legal battles on the preference of his inventions on the rivals. The best example is the telephone, in which he had seven or eight opponents claiming against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's discovery was not central to the idea that Bell and Gray freely brought each other in 1876, but the improvements in the quality of the phone receiver and the transmitter's quality of the ball were not developed. Yet it was a major part of the Supreme Court decision of 1888 which is the Supreme Court's decision of the Supreme Court (the only income of their reports!) Written by Chief Justice Morrison White - which killed the weak Chief Justice in excessive work within weeks. To complete this <br /> <br /> In 1886 Edison found equally ruthless rivalry in the big power fields of electric power grids. It was George Wehrfinghaus, the inventor of the air pause of the railway. Westinghouse's farm new inventor and former Edison assistant, Nikola Tesla received help. Tesla developed "alternative variable", which was Edison's "direct current" competing system. Edison's system was essentially a direct circuit system for electricity. The Tesla system allowed the system to switch from circuit to other circuits - it was actually a good and more effective system. But Edison was determined to break this rival by a campaign campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with electric power line. Edison initially had its underground ground, so that they would not be endangered by the weather conditions. But the Westinghouse was forced to open its lines in open-air telephone lines. Several lines of accidental deaths (especially in an incident where repairers were burnt alive in front of hundreds of dangerous audiences in Manhattan's business district) were reported by the repair linemen in the lines of Westinghouses, Edison insisted that the AC current is more dangerous than the DC <br /> <br / > One result of this is the Edison Westinghouse AC generator and the electric chair chair With the help of some great abiskarakarike was namosa. Edison himself denied that he had invented an electric chair, but he helped a few fewer people along the way - the full text reads the addition of Mark Aceig's Edison and Electric Cheer (New York: Wallark and Company, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison examines himself with the cats and dogs (he was glad to see the public). In addition to discovering new methods of execution for a long time, Edison failed to achieve the failure of the public's support staff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has killed many men who helped "putting" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy"). He did so by electrocuting the poor animal with AC but the entire killing is on the film - and this one can see today. This is a kindly looking movie - no poor "Topsy" was a poor animal - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see lightning flashing which shows elephant's death, we know it will end soon, but the sudden fall of "topsy" is still unexpected. The film has a bad smell on the faces of modern filmmakers. Yet, sadly, it has probably earned profit for Edison - his description of the movie in his catalog of films shows the real pride of his achievements here. Seeing it in 1903 may be exciting entertainment for many Americans. One is happy that more people are becoming worried today - sometimes one might think that the human race has improved a bit.
