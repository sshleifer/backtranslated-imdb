The movie seems to be a spectrum. Most of the movies, left and right for entertainment and / or commercial purposes are made. In the middle, there are both entertainment and artistic movies. Movies on the right is not commercial, but industry is more focused on art than film. <br /> <br /> I do not say that any part of the spectrum is better than any other. , But since a movie goes too far, it is rarely good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what do I say, what do I say? Some friends are going to ask and I wanted to come along. None of us knew what to expect, and in the end, none of us were satisfied. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are exciting pictures. Yes, I went in search through the filmmakers archive footage. Yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable and perhaps the best part of the experience. The thing is, I went so far to the right of this spectrum that I said that I can not say anything good about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Promote it. It is a quarrel of symbolism and clear morality It's not saying something new or is not compelling the viewer to test life a new way. It just tells us what we already know (that is, if we tell it what we can say). <br /> <br /> This movie is simply an art for industry. "An attempt to see how deep and anxious we can be using Montage!" When a movie becomes more and more shining or intelligent than its creator, it can be a movie and only Seluloid gets self-satisfaction.
