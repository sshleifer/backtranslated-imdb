I saw this little brother with a lot of videotaped in the long time, even though I was a young boy who was hearing weakly. I did not have closed capacitor decoder (it was 1986, Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what's going on. It was not my fault. I saw an animated movie made for girls. Hired a video to show my dad to my younger sister. <br /> <br /> After a decade I stopped the video (for 50 cents) and closed the closed caption. My memories of this movie were completely destroyed by someone other than a retreat script. I have seen lots of poorly written films (eg COL as ICE and JASON becomes Hello: last Friday), but I've never seen these bad conversations (or heard), just enough to laugh at your head, enough tranquility of violence and the pain of sitting through this movie He screams from pain. Despite the concept of good plot and curiosity stories, the script should be the greatest ever to write for the screen, not the time! Unfinished Howard R. Cohen can never work as a painter, professional or any other. I can not believe that they allow terrible scripts to create a movie in such a way. Did Japanese producers translate the script into broken English before learning or translating it? Even GI Joe the Movie and My Little Pony The Movie Recovered Value Than This Hatred. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the 80's animation, or just get the nostalgia trip, be careful about Rainbow Bright and Star! It does not matter whether you've been embarrassed by a scriptwritten animated film with a written script, or you did not see the movie, did not see the movie. Should never watch a bad script to watch movies with alert to learn how!
