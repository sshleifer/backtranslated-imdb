This film has absolutely no redeeming features. It's not worth being in the 'very bad it's good' section - it's just bad. Badly played, badly shot, badly written, badly operated, terrible sound recording and the whole thing incredibly amateur Oh, and someone can tell a major actress that if you're playing 'crazy' it does not mean that your hair should continue to leak - in a film that was generally boring, it was probably the most annoying One of the things. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think this is the only feature of Nazi Karzai.
