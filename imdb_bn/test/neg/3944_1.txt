I could say this might be bad from the trailer, but the DVD box's lust however I got to rent it. I was just a boy <br /> <br /> For some reasons, the DVD version is very vague and sometimes vague (for video quality). It seems like they shot the whole movie with the 20-year-old Camcoder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie I was very surprised. I would not say no spoilers, but let's say that the end is so bad that I laugh, it has been long ago. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems to be something which is a middle school English paper. If I ever see a movie as the worst movie, it could only be so. I can not believe they actually release this film. If you do not want to have a good smile for the cost of film, it is not actually worth the price of rent or value.
