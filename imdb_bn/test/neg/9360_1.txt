I have no respect for RMDB rating. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic film, it is promoting Mormon. With something wrong, but the outline of the plot and the ways described it are completely confusing. If you are touched by the Christian or Mormon, see this movie, you love it and it feels really amazing. For others, do not bother, stories become so transformed, random stuff happens in a way that does not really follow suitably. This guy tried to commit suicide because he was sleeping with his neighbor. Are you kidding What a pussy However, this is a terrible movie.
