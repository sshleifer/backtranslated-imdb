Based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name, Kylchet suffers from lack of focus, direction, and creativity ?? All elements of the original story that were probably and negative screening screening strengthened serious edits, (with the full enthusiasm of a character) that would affect a movie like a Leonard story. Many characters are very easy to find and available (not a common feature of the author's work) and the switch switches between two injured men, who make it difficult and a dedicated couple who do not order our sympathy. Although the story itself offers several valuable twists and turns, sadly, the mystery of the film still remains with mysteries at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Smoke hits-man Armand "Blackbird" Dagas (Mickey Roar) follows the stringent code during his mission, which undoubtedly excavates his latest assignment. Now under the direction of his former employer, he looted a wealthy Reuters with unrestrained mechanic criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and joined firmly for some quick cash gain. When couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are confined to the fictitious plot of the thieves in the couple's fight, they are forced to hide because the lunatic killers will not stop to keep the two witnesses silent. <br /> <br /> The killings prove that there is no basis for immediate success or even a committed adaptation based on Elmo Leonard's novel. The characters, situations and even the resolutions of the film are all tired and irrational and only a little more random. Was it not possible, especially when Raukek's black girl, calm and collected killers took an injury during the first scene? Purpose and principals are abandoned as soon as each minute goes away. Styles and methods are the most exciting in which each character is introduced; Bird's role and even the Owen also provide the right creator, instant interest and depth to people immediately to make creative effects. <br /> <br /> The combination of cold and counting black bird with Richie is an enticing combination of Richie (extraordinarily very kind of comparison with Fargo), each character seems to lose their initially attractive tracks which feature their tracks gradually. As Richie begins to highlight the more savvy killer habits, Bird reduces the risk of his own murder. Despite what he saw in Donating (Rosario Dawson) with his passing light-hearted floating, it is difficult to imagine that his final clash with Karchen Carmen affects his true nature and later results of helplessness. Probably or not, is this Killshot's unfortunate collapse ?? And little entertainment can be awakened from these characters who constantly makes their incentives which loses their originality by habit. <br /> <br /> - Massage Twin
