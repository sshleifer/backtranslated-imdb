This is one of the more badly made movies I've ever seen. One would seriously take something by Truffaut; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> and Denwee, whose dozens (?) character flip-flops are simply incredible - not even played badly; Just do not act. Among other things, how could a person like Julie / Marianne, like a beautiful woman like Duneauv, be outside anyone to suspend the mistrust; The role is absolutely beautiful so nobody claims. Belmond's acting is also suffering, though Emo's character is not as incredible as Daniel. Clich√©'s end (which I will not describe) is unfortunately very suitable for this complete mistake.
