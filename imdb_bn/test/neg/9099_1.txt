Seeing the first few moments, you realize that it's going to be a parody - and of course it's * a parody, but I'm not sure (no fairy tale - an opera? S Hollywood movie - if there was anything there), and I'm sure you It's not worth it. It is simply an uninterrupted film (cf. A good parody disconnected from everything), very impressive character projection, with shallow lecture. It's like a Cammedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched cammed dell'arte. And the score sings in a deliberately unsupported way (some greenway will use it more efficiently), it is painful to hear (unless someone uses some antrilag, hahaha). Go for quality movies (e.g., Mr. Mitra Ha Than Peter the Great Boyhood of His Murray, 1976) and made this mistake clear.
