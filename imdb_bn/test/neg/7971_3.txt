First of all I want to say that I have read everything about this subject and I know it inside, and finally I was very excited to see it. But you only need to read this book to realize that this short series is not a true story that happened just 90 years ago. It is neutral based on the information, the rest is taken from the script writer's imagination. And unfortunately these changes are successful, but most are unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the name of Mita and Lusha until their relationship began, and during this time Violet was also known as Vita Dmitry and Julian. It was Violet when they retreated thirteen years old. When the 'temptation' scene started, Violet was much more passive than representing here and certainly did not kiss the Vita. I could go further, these examples were included just after the series started. In addition to all these changes from the incident, the characteristic features are all wrong. Occasionally the Bhita behaves like crazy woman. Especially in the scene where he saw from the announcement of the newsletter Violet, it's just ridiculous. Keep her surges in the emotions inside the hut. This was Violet Moody and showed her feelings (good or bad). When all the Bhita fell, he was almost scared, that is all. Having a gentle nature, Harold avoids conflict in real-life, but here he is sometimes quite harsh and accusing. Harold and Bhita always discuss their intimate things in characters, verbally. And Violet ... I know that this series deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but this does not mean that all other characters will be only dolls in the straight path. Here he is completely one dimensional character, and his given line is mostly shallowly embarrassing. In fact he is an intelligent, gifted, quite a remarkable woman who rarely credits achievement. I've always thought of a lot more interesting person than the Vita. In this series, his problem with his illness, loneliness and his mother was completely ignored. Viewer has little background to his background and family, how he or she (or married) did anything to fight with Dennis Trafusice or how hard he fought in the Bethel. Vita was the only love of her life, her princess, and if she fell in love with Harold, Violet did it too. After that his life was in ruins, and it took time that he could drag himself again. The statue can play the role of Denys, that there is much depth in her character. Lady Sequeville-West is just a badly drawn character; An annoying chatterbox with exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> This series ends in the completely poorly written view of the amiens, and the end of this writing was in the script writer's opinion. No, the whole year continues until the end, and it's going to end up being a lot more linking and sad than that. But what is worrisome about the stupid end if the whole series is stupid from the beginning. The actors have to give some credit, they tried to play the best role given to them, even though the Vita is the only person who is truly illuminated by the Mactier. One can not complain about the settings. All the complainant directors and most, the script writers go. Instead of insightful character research, there are many sex scenes and soft conversations. The scenes are much longer, some do not bring in vain and story lines. On the other hand, many details are small or completely excluded. There should have been more information about how the youth of Vita and Violet have improved, and how they have improved their friendship. This is an impressive story that deserves very good adaptation. Maybe someone someday will do it. At this moment, the real book or Violet letters can create more of this story by sending it to Bhita, which is a great thing.
