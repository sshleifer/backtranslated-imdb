Computing Can anything be more boring? While sitting in front of the computer, type a few keys every day, tap and tap. Most of the problems in this movie, the heroine is sitting in front of a computer in front of the video, and does not offer any kind of movement, or the director uses a very close-up of the suspicious notes or directors. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is it possible to hack into a computer that is closed and not connected to the Internet? I think that the net was made 10 years ago, very few people could understand how the computer worked, so the screenliters were able to make BS in length, but we now live in villages around the world, while in the Western world almost every family has its own computer viewers, The actual errors are very involved. And of course, there are many instances where someone works out of stupid characters in important times, which makes the net a very medieval film.
