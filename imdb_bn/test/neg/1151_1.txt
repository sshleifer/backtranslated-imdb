He said the problem of this movie is that it sees the United States - perhaps the most hostile Jewish community outside Israel - as different from Nazi Germany. The film set in 1943 is about a man (William H. Messi) who is confused with the Jews after wearing glasses! After that several painful incidents (he lost his job and he could not find a new one, his neighbors disappointed him, all ended in a violent clash). From Arthur Miller's self-confidence, the novelist patronage gave a bad name to liberalism.
