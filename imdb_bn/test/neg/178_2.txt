I do not understand why this movie got so good grades from critics - I've seen documentary (TV) for a few decades about the wine world, when you see it, it was a lot better, please two think Mandovino's boring aspects: First of all, the painting is just terrible and terrible and annoying: to me, it's the only person behind the camera who got the material And playing with it: plenty of zoom (not for any purpose other than to push the button) In / Out), for example, - - that's why I watch it almost off! Secondly, the interviewer (director I think) is not really relevant: he thinks and asks questions like boys scout, not like journalists, but even general ideas and themes were interesting, but there were very poor conclusions: too much bad documentary, maybe only for those people Do not know anything about wine >> Not everyone recommended (2/10)
