The film was not bad at all, especially the plot-based, but in the acting section, they chose the main role as the chit (and hairdo) actors. I will choose someone else. The idea of ​​"Going to America" ​​was very impressive and questioned the main character that he had learned, making him a little favorite, but there was not much of a pistachio blob for a major actor. <br /> <br /> The story was interesting. There is a question about how the cloning issue will be managed in the future. Of course, cloning will not be allowed for the film, but for today it is still valid argument. Clone is still man ... okay? <br /> <br /> The film was not particularly special, but it's still a lot better than a few pieces released in the 70's. Do not forget to attack our "monster spider". I give it a 4, since it was not completely wasted, but the version of MST3 version made this movie 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You like this movie, but it will not be your favorite.
