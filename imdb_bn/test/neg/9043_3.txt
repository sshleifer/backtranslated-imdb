I recently saw a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about horrible things! A film Ed Wood sometimes looks like Oscar material than this ridiculous thing. It should be clear that a few lines from the script will be prolonged in memory such as "these people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meats from supermarkets like us, they refresh me every day like you." Classic! The character of 'Jonesville' type leader madly in the jungle was the best painter, he really looked like a nuts. I think he was not the only actor (badly), if these Italianians could have American characters in their films, but why do not they cobble in the conversation instead of trying their best to make American citizens sound like Anne Okelley? I'll give 3 out of 10, I'll give it three because it's more fun than most comedies this day.
