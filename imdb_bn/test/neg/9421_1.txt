Novel Wiphen, which acts as the foundation of this harmful piece of garbage, it is one of the best techno-thrillers that picks down in the long run. The character of Solo, which is not supposed to look like humans, was terrible to see Clone in another terminator-clone, trying to "act" like a wonderful creator and Mary Van Poblues's terribly robot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many errors with SOLO, who are not inviting any person with a foot in their list of a great game in Hoopschich. Avoid this horror film and look for Robert Mason's 2 novels that highlight the extraordinary character of Solo. The books do not pay any attention to this horror drake of WEAPON and a wonderful signal from SOLO.But a movie.
