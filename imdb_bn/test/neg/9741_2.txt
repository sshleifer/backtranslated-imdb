Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife Joan cover their heads and prefer to sleep on their pillow to sleep on their feet. Two of them equally challenged children, Booster and Pettonia. One day, Mr. Stupid's notice has returned to their rubbish .... someone must steal from carbon. He goes off the roller blades after garbage trucks. Finally, when he reads the dump, he is simply surprised to know that "other people's rubbish" was stolen, but there is a meeting of the landfill secret organization. He thinks the world is determined to defeat the garbage nappers. In the meantime, Petenonia and Baster visited the police station and a Chinese restaurant for their parents to search because the youngsters are missing. Will they break their way through their problems? This is just a stupid, stupid movie, criminal being a terrible script. Alard and Marshall's books are violent and some of the book's ending ends in this film. Arnold is indeed excellent as Mr. Stupid and other cast members try too much, making the movie work very difficult. Production prices are very high by adding tiny tears to Stupid's dogs and cats. However, it is nothing, because the plot is terrible and weak. Probably, one day, funny alarud books on the big screen will need another stab in translation. Therefore, if you love to laugh then rent something else to get something new and above all, get books too. But, stay away from yourself stupid, anyone who sees this movie at the end can only be called intelligent.
