This movie was terrible. The acting was horrific. The script was awful. What was even worse was the camera shot and the sound. Half the time the voice actor does not match with the lips, and the same camera angle will have a completely different color. The worst part was when one actor was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building was 50 kilometers high and probably 100 feet wide. However, another shot from the actors was at the top, they were "recreated" in the building's top. The width of the building has been nearly eight feet wide. How can a foot be hundreds of feet high eight feet? I know the movie was low budget, but it is ineligible. The film only pushed the ideas about "story" but actually there is a story or point. This script seems to have been reduced from mere garbage, these characters seem to be selling ideas in their lines rather than feeling emotion and moving the film in a way. It was a complete waste of time watching. The film gives a bad name to Christians if it is one of the best Christian films currently available.
