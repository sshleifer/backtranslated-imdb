Meet Cursomo (Jason Prussi), with a cumbersome number of her annoying lives for the crowd and a perfect young manuscript material for a perfect basement apartment in a Senior Citizen Center. His only entertainment is watching TV and he's been trying occasionally with his comedic prostitution pala, Honey (Zenne Garfalo). But one day these changes occur when the masses are killed and the well-known and persuasive new chief Gordon (Robert Logia) is well-known to whom Kosoma is elected to be a full-blown person. This is an offer that the unwanted Casomo can not be repeated, can not be denied, and soon its stubborn, harmless gangster Steve (Peter Rigert) for the Seven course, for the existence of the most comfortable, the highest salary of the work of Subburn Forest Vivant and the minimum hours. At any given time, Cosmo makes himself anxious and shows absolutely outstanding expertise for Steve's advice. Although he never touched the gun before, Cosmo Crake proved to be a cold, disconnected killer after both Markman and the primary wave of moral quarrels. Soon, Cosmo is sending death clients, with speed and style, and rapidly establishing its natural floor with a gun as an invaluable addition to Gordon's crowd. <br /> <br /> One night, when sent by honey, Cosmos accepts a little offensive feeling and he suggests trying yoga to recommend it. Cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by Jasmine (a beautiful young girl named Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately taken with kind and gentle jasmine, soon after the cosmo is pulled. Now if she can only get rid of her painful, humiliating boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), she and Cosmo might actually start something. Cosmo, using some of his new "skills", eventually persuades Randie to disappear and closes his relationship with Jasmine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Writer / Director M. Wallace Waldarcki's Emmy Award twice - Winner for his work on "Tracy Olman Show" and "The Simpson", has created a script for love of three princes: "I like comedy, gangster movies and romance," Uuldarskie explained, So I originally made three films. "But what he came up with is a movie that is so confused and non Saturday Night laibhate potential that it looks like a very long sketch. This uninterrupted voice does not match humorous criticism, because Jason Priestley spent a lot of money for the car to dismantle the image of his wonderful person, which he did not succeed completely, because he is playing his character is not as inferior, but as a lenico junkie . Can be a mere naive, but there is a cruel passion. Passion for internally guided things. But his character, as the mentally lacking praseley, plays almost anti-forest Gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" actually does not have the opportunity to develop forester gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Rigert (Local Hero, Animal House) plays naturally well, and Kimbery Williams tries his best to work with him, but Jane Garphalo (Hiro's Larry Sanders Show) is actually spoiled in his role as a friend of Cosmo happens. Probably not long, though. Garofalo is looking forward to all his enthusiasm and humor and it's a matter of time before it takes the role of a mother language, hopefully doing a tag team with Marisa Tomomi. <br /> <br />
