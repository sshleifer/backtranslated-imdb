I understand why "sakuran" colors and sets were so sticky and chic, and it's painful to watch. The story is about a high class prostitute known as an oran in Japan. Their Kimono was always cheerful and glorious compared to other Kimono so that Arna could stand. But director Mika Ninagawa was convinced that the director stood out of the main character or even stood out of the story. <br /> <br /> Anna Anna Souciya gave me the cripps in this picture. You can not call acting It was not more than its flip-out, high school-girl fan base. Hey Ani, good luck as you are old Yes, right, a strange and indecent, trend-violent, biker chick. Have we not already seen this character portrayed in more appropriate movies? <br /> <br /> The story was boring and annoying. What is the story of "Sakuran"? An abusive little bitch sometimes remains true to his self: an offensive bitch. He sees that unknowingly, the man is attracted to him and he becomes a successful, high-class prostitution, who speaks and behaves as a member of a male rabid gang, although he has a vague ability to manipulate a man. His so-called seductive power is talked about, but we can never see it, probably because of the incompetence of the main, unreasonable-phony-biker, because I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie gets angry with a rich and powerful man because he waits while serving a much more humble customer. Not very kind, is not it? How can such a woman be Orean? Oh, because the past had killed himself and needed a wedding for the house that could claim high prices. Who would pay a high price for a whore so cheap? Get rumors almost How did he not react to a strong man? Because the screenlitter is dlt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Respect (which does not understand, how can anyone honor such a valuable person?). <br /> <br /> Like screaming, like a director, he took a huge cyclical dump. Edo period's aesthetic, culture and society. Nobody is aware, Mono, WI, subtlety, elegance, what is the thing as a strictly dominated society? Everyone is going to be as innocent, Nuvu-rich Pervenu as a director. Surprisingly, many other Japanese watched the film, sat around the director, and shook up the blinking stinging strap spoon and highlighted how sweet it was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Japan was disconnected from the international world (excluding Izera 3.7 acres of Digimia) when Biodon and Bandon as Backdrop for Adobe Time? Why not just eat food, bad ass-biker oran, his cell phone, and the answer to the character of rich and powerful Daimai trapping him in his red return? The song we had heard was Jarring and Anonovic (like Art Design). At the end, I thought that there were only two or three small flowers on the cherry tree of the temple. But, first, secondly he said that he would leave the waist only, we all knew exactly what would happen. How annoying, so clearly the telegraph ends But what is the point of the old tree? The rich and powerful man is already enjoying the cherry blossom as the mountains of Yishino in spring. Does that affect her at all? Not certainly not. I already know that about whores. I'm saying that nicely balls them to kick. Maybe it seems to be ideal for people when they know themselves as true: only cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Considering capturing the director with goldfish, the second to the last scene should be that a goldenfish bowl fell accidentally on a porch. Two fish fall into a stream which carries them to escape outside the carrier's carrier, the gold fishes stuck in their bowl and can not survive outside (such as having a relationship with Joy earning). Otherwise, the goldfish fate has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Cherry trees were full of flowers in the final scene, but the intensity of the kiss is a special thing for cherry flowers. I did not think that soon enough will remove all the soft pink color and warmth of the evening scene. The sky will go faster than the shadows, in a deep boom, and will fall on the night. It will be cold, very cold. And the darkness. That was not really a happy ending, is not it? Romantic love (in the period of time?) Can survive in the face of terrible poverty, and as long as the cherry trees are shining, it can survive for it. Maybe in a few days, as soon as it rains. But do we see strangely romantic love here? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Literally. Look at his "prominent" scene, where he seems to have the right shoes, but to keep him from his ass, he must be kept on the shoulders of some people. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it the directional direction of the industry on both sides of the film, but then I realized what it was: a sick influential in the director's part. That color and set is similar to the director's scream, "I'm the most important one here! Me! It's about me!"
