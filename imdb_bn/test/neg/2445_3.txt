Genre: Short of cartoon with no dialogue, African girl and lion <br /> <br /> Major characters: Inki, Lion and Minah birds. <br /> <br /> What happened: one wants to eat an African girl called Singh Inki. There is a rather misleading melee bird. Inki, or next to the lion. She is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg !! :-( I like how the main character Inki (an African girl) is a very beautiful character, but she still portrays her cruelly and does not like younger audiences because she is hunting! GRR Charles M. Jones !! I do not like lion very much and I think the Mina bird is okay (I think). Personally I'll be the future of Charles M. Jones's Lonny Tune Cartoon <br /> <br /> If you want to see it anyway, then I recommend the YouTube website. Type "Inki" in the original page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I want Charles M. Jones Necker is there in this little Inki. <br /> <br /> Recommended: Interested in old cartoons and / or those who just travel around your tube.
