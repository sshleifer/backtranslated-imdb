I saw this ego-centric "effort" to acquire a movie of "Russian epic" status of several Russian Russian families. Five people gave 5 different reactions, Mokhalakov worshiped my innate spirit. <br /> <br /> I have seen that a movie like Mikhalov saw "canal" + money, some of his (and others) pockets and film turned on a bunch of students. I've calculated at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. There is no way that the same director is not responsible for these different scenes. <br /> <br /> · Train station view (Saying goodbye to Andrei) <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panorama shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> · The Grand Attitude and the Next Chase scene's initial attempts to get back to André in singing in Figo. <br /> <br /> · Fence order <br /> <br /> Juria is faster than the Orange Superman. <br /> <br /> Russian citizens believe that the "galaxy" printed in Russia's life was not in history history. They call it "tourist postcard" to Russia. <br /> <br /> They are all proud that Russian director / producer / fixer has been able to break "big time" and be able to waste more than 30 million dollars. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you want to see the Russian film. Get some coffee before you go.
