Video is straightforward and good due. Like putting a game in the backyard of its children, but bad. A young man (Don DiGiulio) is a farm heir in West Virginia who has been disabled for generations. He decides to take out a few friends to check out the property. This soil is also used to produce good chicken crops during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owners kill the owner and drink the field with their blood. Then hanging their bodies as scarecrows. Special effects beautiful lunatics and awesome dialogue is invisible one-liners full and deaf so ridiculous words can be better off. The cheap gore and a shocking flick is an addict. Cast to Digioulio: Jane Chik, B. York, Chest Cheat and Jessica Dunphy
