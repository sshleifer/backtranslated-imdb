This film coincided with Mike Allied's comic book mini series, "Red Rocket Seven", and told the story of an alien who ran away from the world to wait for "Astroscope" which is related to the publisher and the Apocalyptic Book. This is only part of a big story (if the movie confuses you, "RR7" will read too). You can easily tell that the picture is used to tell the story. The side is very good and the effect is not bad for the $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the role, and probably could not say that he could not work. Also, Mike does not show his writing skills in this movie. Her dialgase spoon feeds the plot for you and lets you enjoy the characters. It was frustrating considering her extraordinary writing ability to show in her joke books. 10 out of 4
