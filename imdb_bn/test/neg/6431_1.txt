11:11 A.K.A. Hells Gate (2004) Another bad movie that makes it very difficult to not be anything like this. A young girl is a fictional playmate. One day out of the playground with his friends, some missiles met his parents and dropped them for any apparent reason. The young girl closes and hides from bad men. After years, the girl grew up in a woman with the problem. Losing her at school (showing offensive homosexuals) pretends her manhood in front of her when she rejects one of them. Girls are unhappy about her for her hatred and general life. A visit to his past a secret is his visit. Who or what is it Why does everyone hate him? What is the problem with his guardian? To find out you need to look at hell's gate. <br /> <br /> The new title does not give any sense at all. I do not know why people are being paid money to make such a bad movie. This film is not good enough to make fun. It is a headache inducing mess that it tries to conceive some ideas will be confused. Do not value your time <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
