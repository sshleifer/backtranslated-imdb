This movie looks quite bad, aggressive, not played well, well-directed, low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and isolated. After watching the previous comments it went to see, but if you try to compare it now with everything, Platoon, or anyone else, you really close the tracks. This film is not like 60 years old and fully-crafted film, which is seen with the slope of the Undertrheal, not to mention (or really) reflections, changes in the budget, low budget fireworks, and all the poorly depicted characteristic features. Although it can be seen, if you want to see it as the primary development of the movie document, then do not go back. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, the guys are quite okay.
