Dear Movie Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when trying to understand the state of emergency, it might be best to run your hero instead of earning / replacing it. Especially if you are trying to strengthen a time line. For example, if you are trying to convince the audience that if the hero is not able to find him, then the bad guy will kill the hostage, perhaps it is a good idea to express your feelings that your hero feels like this ... but even though it is confronted. Creating a * good * movie was certainly not your goal. Your goal is to make some junk pumps that will earn more money than this. Otherwise you may have to hire some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, boring viewer <br /> <br /> <br /> I have seen this long movie for a long time. I can not say it is bad because I could finish it. It was bad, bad, though bad. Dude, where am I back?
