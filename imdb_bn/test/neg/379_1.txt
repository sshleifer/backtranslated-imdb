If you are in the mood of a real horror film, it will be hard to find something that can be compared. I've spent a lot of time watching movies terribly, enjoying pleasure from me, and people, it's the worst. This movie was so bad, I had to buy a third buster master. That one was not as bad, which is wonderful because it was a direct video. This is a film that is hard to understand on how the first one was made. I mean, someone could actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several drafts) and said "yes, that's it. There's some money here." Indeed, they probably wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 even before a script, then went with them whatever. Uncle, awesome So, if you're a really bad movie fan, check it out. This is a true classic, and the film is not much worse than this. And if it is, please let me know.
