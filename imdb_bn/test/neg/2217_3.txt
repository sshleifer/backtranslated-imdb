Why is it impossible to write French? Very kuchh! This journey in the center of the world, however, was the immediate technical possibilities of 1976. This big "Qasimi" monster is completely ridiculous! However, the film deserves "ring", such as "King Kong" (the last one), with a little more provided scene. Professor Calculus professor is similar and rather funny. David (character) is inconsistent enough but cross (spend) on people with a good message "You get together and defeat you!" Together we will say a movie made in the 40's. Now that I have said (or almost) bad that I thought, we can say that if we are tired of the brain or others have to see something else, then matter (matter) Hugh! Like my opinion! (Translating from French to English with "Revro": Sorry for the possible mistake!)
