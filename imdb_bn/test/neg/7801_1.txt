This one is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story is not compatible with other TZ episodes. It's pretty annoying, though Peter Fawc looks like Fidel Castro looks like a sunny. <br /> <br /> Whenever a twilight zone is broadcasted in my home in an emergency, I will grab a sandwich and settle for a drink and some quality entertainment. 10 times 9 times, it wounds this episode! The strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another TZ fan like me). Amongst many of us it was that one of us would say, "I was ready to see Tavilite Zone_ and guess which episode was the episode of Cuban Dictator!" Obviously, some people like this episode, it's got 6.7 ratings ... how it happened, I do not have any idea - but in this and itself will create a great twillight zone plot!
