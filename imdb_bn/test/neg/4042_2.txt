This picture can not be expressed how poor. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, acting is helpless, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> It's about 96 minutes long while running 97 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's okay as a short sketch on a comedy show, but the premiere is a very painful act that does not seem boring. <<br /> <br /> Avoid it, rent a better movie instead!
