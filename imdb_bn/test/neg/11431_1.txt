A humor that will appeal to the exclusive, small audience, it will be in vain and uninterrupted by the average audience. When the cartoon network advertises this show, it saw a big drama or event, it is a real rain scene and government officials are trying to catch sheep. <br /> <br /> In the air, I was wondering how all the characters were so desperate at one dimensional and a complete bland animation. It was kept in nothing near humor, only "private public" and "common-specific", some obscure references to cultural aspects, and names of names of Lady Richington kissed her ship with steel wie. <Br /> <br /> Turn off the subject a little, but I do not see why with the ball of dirty cotton ball, white will fall in love? It was fierce!
