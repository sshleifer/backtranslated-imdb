Chicken wars are an entertaining story about two fabulous cities and their arms race. It is generally a confusing form of cold war and weapon races. Yes, this is a children's book, but as a result of many of Theodore Cuisine Gospel, it strikes people on the head with its morals. <br /> <br /> And what is that moral? Encouraging us to focus more on integrating ourselves rather than sharing it is commendable for us. This is a good thing to encourage international cooperation. But it is easy to compare the difference between the countries of Warsaw's agreement between the NATO West and the application of butter in the west of NATO. For specifics, many countries of Warsaw treaties enjoy intermediate times of butter and bread deficiency - if they were found, they would be happy to eat butter grapes. Regardless of the less literal level, and whatever your political tendency, the Soviet Socialism versus the West (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not a mere question of choice and customs. <br /> <br /> This point has not been developed in a cold war with the Soviets to create a more clear, nuclear weapon, but in a warm war with the powers of the Axis. There is no doubt during the war of nuclear power in Germany. Will the United States refrain from believing in their uncertain (at least) victory in the ongoing war of nuclear weapons research? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the attacking enemies of Pearl Harbor. Does a nation work at this time when Ginny goes out of the bottle? In addition, the hedgehog is 20-20, which is not saying that there was no way to assure half-mad dictators that he would not harvest his eyes with the development of atomic arms. The second Gulf War showed incredible difficulties in identifying trustworthy threats and making them neutral. <br /> <br /> In any case, the cartoon is little more than just plain propaganda, which does not know a little about exploring the moral questions related to nuclear power, and instead of trying to scupper the weapon technology in children.
