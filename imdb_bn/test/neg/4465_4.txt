Headline: Dracula 1972 AD <br /> <br /> Director: Allan Gibson <br /> <br /> Paste: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stefani Bicham <br /> <br /> Review: Sometimes you can return to the movie time any time Capsules that transport In this case ... our time is Capsule Hummers Dracula Eddie 1972 which sends us back in time that Austin Powerers feel right at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of kids (not a gang! A group!) that loves to hang in a cafe cafe called "Cafe". One day, Johnny Alcard (Hummy's last name ... wait ... it makes Dracula behind!) Provides new ways to get new members to their group. He offered them a black mass and a magic of black magic. What they say "Why not make hell, it can be fun!". So at any time in the plane, find yourself reviving the Count Dracula from the Ashes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He does not know the people of his team, yet they Everyone was sitting in his house and sitting in his house. The table is made at the top and doing dance, medicine. The filmmakers had ensured that this sequence was considered to be the coolest of any young people at that time. Everyone says the words like "way out" and "groovy" and they say a lot of their sentences, "all that jazz". So yes, it's quite obvious that these are the 70s. To stop this, a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you're drowning in the 70's. And when I saw this, I asked myself, "How is her black cape with a jerky dracula and will adapt to all this?" And that's exactly what happened. Old Dakula finds all the partitions and places between rock and roll and medicines. Most of the scenes in the film are fantastic .... But sadly, the music they decided to add to the act does not just fit into it and completely eliminates the mood of things. It will happen on some horrible or scary screen and suddenly the trumpet will start playing and a bunch of conjos will start to beat and you will get out of your completely awful material. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I will mention this. What we saw in Dracula's blood taste is that the story was just a rehearsal. Actually stories are dishonest around common. Let's see ... a young boy with a dry ring and ash heir ... check. Then he decided to bring Draku back to life with the help of some people who do not know anything about what they got in them ... Check. Black mass is returning the Dakula to an impure church ... Check it. The likelihood list goes on and on. So if you ask me this movie is not very original. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that make this movie valuable. For example, this film was a time capsule in London in the early seventeenth century which makes the movie entertaining. Every time someone kept mess and sunny, someone spoke in the 70s phrase. I did not believe that wearing some clothes in this dress and they drive! This makes the movie fun for me, but we're here to explode here, saw Drak kill some of the virgins and take revenge on Van Helsing's house. Can we get any of that? Yes good There are some good order shrinking to satisfy the old school hammer fans. First off, black mass order which was above all satanic! They mention the name of a monster of many and many bloodshed spread. The sequence was awesome, but it was confused by the music at its most important moment. Then there is the real resurrection of the Dakulas which I visit from a visible perspective. Some mist Draculus comes out from the grave and slowly but surely Christopher Lees derived from silhouette and face fog. Silent killer! I love it We finally have a Cushing and Lee mouth close. And if I hung up a piece of furniture through Dakula air, I could not help laughing at one moment. I smile because he did it in every single movie from Dracula's Horror. Her hammer traditions begin to throw each other a candle stick and chairs where the characters begin. And I think that, after throwing a candle stick on our heroes, they are not even more exciting things to show a bad guy. Oh well, anyhows, Dracula all are similar to all Hammer Dracula before death, the vampire is slaked and then we only cut a series of frames until the rest of the frame. <br /> <br /> All in all, a strange funny Hammer Dracula film. It was trapped in the 70's, and even though it made a fun watch (and it is not as awesome as the dracula's satanic customs) it still does not imprison the hacker from the expected Dracula universe. <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 of 5
