This was the first time I was a teenager, and I saw it in Japan. I did not have tea cup as the film's High School Sophomore, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. In the newspaper it had become poor, so foreign workers had heard it, even though it was never seen in post theaters. <br /> <br /> This image started the tendency of throwing object to the audience, which was taken in the absurd levels with the next 3-D films. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it is eligible as a spoiler, but if it is, you have been warned. Most of the time, actors often worked in front of "Rear Projection Screen", where the backgrounds could show that they were in a different environment, such as an actor was actually an actor when a jungle background. Sound level It works well in regular movies, but when seen in 3D, it looks like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where Rear Projection was used and it did not work well in the theater. In 3D, it can be seen as another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only important importance of this movie is historical, because it was the first type.
