This foolish integration of Wales's memory and gifted genocide, self-presupposition of the grand theme, is sometimes seen with no other incomplete Welsh projects. Now we know why! In order to add more insults to previous injuries, amateur American dancers and even great people in amateur American languages ​​are making all the mistakes in storytelling and construction. It seems like some good weekend Spanish souls have omitted Osan from some peso, a 35 mm camera and some other low-end production of negative films and spoke of leaving Welles to the Spanish countryside and just keeping some shooting and everything. Until the film gets run out of stock. It is true that Osanan actually transformed this movie in the form of infamous Jesus instead of Franco, if he had 85% of what he shot, but we would never know. Wells did not take time to perform his own work here, and either he or his heir allowed anyone else to do it, he was not completely foolhardy for despair. Those who want to prove in their early days that Wales was lucky for the young men because they surrounded themselves like John Hussman, Herman Manquich, Gregg Tullen, Bernard Herman and Robert Wies, no proof of his adult inadequacy than this mess. A film At his tragic age, Welles was able to do some things if he needed some money or pesos, including selling his artistic spirit. Satan definitely got his deserve with this one!
