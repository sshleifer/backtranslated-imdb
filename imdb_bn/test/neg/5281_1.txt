This movie sucked so much! Ever seen a dentist? This movie was created like a great essay by The Dentist. I really do not recommend this movie unless you really are really really cinema really is really annoying. It was SO corny. The killer monster reminds you of the monsters, then there are his goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, worried inside me, I thought she was going to hit her butt, but all that she had done could throw a ribbon-general trash on her, I was very frustrated, her wife About the crying scene, so I felt the pain of her tears ......... no !!!!! So before watching this movie, hold a blanket and pillow, be comfortable because it T is very comfortable.
