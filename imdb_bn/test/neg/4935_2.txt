Bonus film about two girls and some people, they arrive late on the late night shuttle bus and end up in trouble at an airport until the end of the whole world. Great twists and turns fully, and I completely defy the description, as a film with a plot incredibly stupid, meaning to be wasted. What is going on in a general sense is OK, I mean the idea of ​​a man abducting girls overwhelmingly is a good idea. The problem is that this information is so out of the belief that if you do not stop the movie, I will be disappointed. Yes, a person who is thinking of taking you home does not go anywhere and you stay on the bus? Worse than this, think about each bad choice and this movie creates letters, even at the point where they can walk only, but never can do it. It is annoying that some of the twists and turns may work if something is intelligent before, but there is almost no intelligence in this picture. OK, probably, last, last, cute. The last thing is that you can do pretty well. This is "Oh # $ * @ !!!!" Should be the moment and horror movie becomes a classic. Instead it lies in a stupid cinema stupid debris. One of the most mindless movies of the year.
