New York physician Alice Dodson suspended his license when he treated one of his patients with unnecessary drugs, causing the patient to die. Without a job, Alice was forced to go to Jamaica, where she went to the brother of a wealthy man. White landowner Brother thinks that he is deeply involved in a zombie and nutritional practice and customs of the local people. "Genre" is a medieval horror fix. The action is quite dusty, plot twists are stupid and no doubt. Some people are killing white people with mice, but not too much. Cinematography is honest, but the acting is really sad. To avoid 4 out of 10.
