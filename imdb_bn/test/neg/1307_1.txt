I usually liked this stupid / no brain activity movie, but this was very stupid. There were many clich√©s in the way and the plot really did not have much knowledge. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely poor and casual. The big master plan worked but we did not see it. We have only seen the main character on his death, Professor (who died due to stupidity). <br /> <br /> One of the scenes is particularly annoying. Why did he give the engineer his oxygen for about 5 minutes to impose on the dam? And if they have oxygen containers containing oxygen worth 5 minutes, then why are they not two or three? Then he will survive ?? That was bloody stupid. The movie is such a stupid thing quite beautiful. I can recommend it all.
