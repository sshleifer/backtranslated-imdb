Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict almost anything that's going to happen. Barbara Jinn is very stupid. It's even like a character. Such a show should be at least one who meets real life. I guess Barbara Jean represented an disabled person. Whoever or whatever his name, Reba, Brock, they are all fools! Who like to be the most intelligent of the show, and he is still stupid Everyone stupid! This is my opinion in Rebecca. Since I said what I said about this show, I'm not saying what I'm saying right now and how to do it until the next 10 lines are done. There Reba gets 2/10.
