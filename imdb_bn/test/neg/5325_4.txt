Unfortunately, Coentz failed to die due to a suitable adaptation of his work. The Whispers closely followed the original, seemingly production company out of the meanwhile runs out. All the sets on the first side of the film were remotely re-established from the book - something that is lacking in other Quantes movies. Despite his other (numerous) downfall, I look forward to the arrival of some really cool scenery. Wrong When detectives show cracks in the apartment (in the book), the film comes out of the fund and the most suspicious scenes of the book are destroyed. Where the book is highly searched, the boys search and behind the apartment, the boys offer a backset of the car. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Quantz thinks without budget, because imagination is free. If the Quantz novel is ever turned into a suitable movie, no one can see it, because they have been released a lot long ago. That's why Dean Kitzge's Frankenstein is now just Frankenstein - if you have seen your work, many times you have seen it happen, you'll be out soon!
