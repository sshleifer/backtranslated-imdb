Police officer Michael (Thomas Arana, "The Church") has completed his hand while investigating his serial killer, who is currently reported to have been murdered at the house of a widow, Tracy (Jona Ponula). Mike has to find ways to stop the body, perhaps the time to fall in love with this process. <br /> <br /> The feeling of the movie 'Geyolo' has spread, although we know that the killer has a good set-piece from the gate-off, and the film (later the scene is particularly memorable in the film set in the blind school). However, when it is all said and not done. Above all, Bawa's is not nearly as extraordinary as the previous "Macbre" or its first two "Demon" movies, but at the end of the film you are quite enjoyable if you can apologize to the plot twists. Extra exercise of any type of image entertainment DVD, like I was interested in anything. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
