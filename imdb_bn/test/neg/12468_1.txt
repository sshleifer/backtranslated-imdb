Ehad, what a bad movie! Tart is probably the worst movie I've seen throughout the year, and I have run across some doozies. There is nothing empty from the point of view of the plot about the trash. Even the brightest Dominique Swain could not save this movie. Any character illustrated by Eloise's possible exception (unusually, Lacey Chabbert, the only bright spot of this impossible failure) is at least bit sympathetic. <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with the tart is that it is saying something. Instead of leading us in the story, it becomes drunk. It presents potentially many potential details (Hypochondriac brother, continually re-established, anti-Semitic classmate of mother property, murderer father of other classmates) successfully without any explanation. And when I finally thought that there might be some sort of solution for characters, the film unexpectedly pushed the violent end. <br /> <br /> I felt the film was trying to tell me something, but forgot the message before forgetting the message that with a strong impression. It is a writer / director who, before spending enough time under the truly established filmmakers, spent a lot of time before fashing his work on a vague public. <br /> <br /> I gave this image 1. Out of 10, and I'm usually very bad, even with bad movies.
