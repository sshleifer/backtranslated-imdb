Apart from the technical skills of production or its lack of performance, it is absolutely awesome. It's really scary about this movie that I was actually a copy of it, of course, it was in a contract box and it was named "Dark Harvest 2" and after seeing it I realized why it was Tender Bin - they took it from their inventory I should pay. <br /> <br /> If you want to call it, mostly movie is running around a drunken ground, the mood is spent by a dirty father looking for his girls because he has a premonition something to happen to them. I suspect that the cameras that were going on with the girls at the beginning of this film are probably one of the production cameras for this Fiasco. On the street she goes inside some children, which is done badly, and the movie goes horribly south. <br /> <br /> I see why they changed the name of this movie, otherwise, they will never have to get rid of them. I was sitting by the very worst movies, and I did not spend $ 2 on it.
