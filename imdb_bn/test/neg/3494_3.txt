All right, it was great ... but the best picture? Please close it. Munich was good, the caption was much better, good night and good luck was very good ... brokeback mountain - well, that would win! Academy voters seem to be working like Democrats for the current day - please do only a little bit, but do not dare to take a concrete position. That's why we have complete body in the US office. <br /> <br /> It has been a presentation of AHA ... and forgot since 1987. Hollywood is so scared on its bottom line that it can not be set "directly". Many voters apparently do not even see the Brokeback Mountain. Get real and get along with it. <br /> <br /> I saw in the mid 60's that it was the most kind year and I was just two. <br /> <br /> Wake up, there's anyone. This happened in the Hollywood IS mainstream and in the box office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star War film, another Batman movie, remake or Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, which is coming in 2006. <br/> <br /> There were at least the original best pictures, i.e. Munich, but have heard that the Capet - great; Catherine Keiner will have to win, although now we know Reese can sing a cash / carter, etc., a much better picture than the Syrian crash. Since the early 1960s, this film has been made and we have to make the best film? In 2005, the horrific one year in Oscars and another annoying year ended in 2006. For the best picture at least BAFTA went to Brackbuy, and what that horror song won? Poorly I think there are about 20 years left in the United States or America, some are coming and some will change. Maybe China may be so much of this country ... or India, because they have all high technology jobs and the world's largest democratic country <br /> <br /> America has become fat, merciful, and stupid land. Trash can be found in more places than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and the Middle-West. <br /> <br /> Drive through Local MacDonald or Burger King for love. All you want until you get a heart attack. Keep yourself out of trouble.
