Basically a road movie. Lesbian, transcultural and other sex-bender themes are rather annoying, especially when children are involved. You must transfer it to the costume designer. For actors, I was known only as a Terrence Stamp. I think it was a very good performance, outside of his (or somebody's) normal range. The film was completely shallow, clever, just a car for the wicked banner. After all, I do not recommend this one.
