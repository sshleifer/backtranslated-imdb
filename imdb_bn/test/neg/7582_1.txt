This movie stands by the wall of Chapel, proving that God has really died. Did I see this only picture (rather than swimming)? This is the only movie I have ever seen in the theater that I am sorry to walk and ask for my money back - it was not right. And even in the local movie "Hiandar 2: The Quicking" has been seen. From start to finish, Gibson and Donny have absolutely no chemistry, as two inconsistencies, throwing them together by the situation, eventually working together as the best friends. The actions (what's a little bit) are stupid and dull as the author's skullbone. Our "movie" is any "Air America 2." There is no chance for this to see any god of ours looking at us.
