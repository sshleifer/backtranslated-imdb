After all, I just say that after watching this movie I felt that I had sold a bill. It seems that this movie is not a fault that IMDB heard it as a comedy and a horror second (though I do not know how it was entered ... but maybe some body crew members could insert it). Because of the fierce / comedy genre, I tested it based on it and I'm so sorry. Where do you start? First, to touch my beginning, there is no comedy in this movie. It strives once or twice, but never gets better than a chuckle. My response was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why tired material would be fun. Also, there is no scary here. Tension can not be found in a second. You think I'm exaggerated ... I'm not. There is no tension, very little blood, and there is not too much violence on the screen (sorry, but a great deal of fate as well as a good start in a terrible jarring). Hell ... there are even nude nudges. Tell me a purist ... If I can not come up with the original plot / prize, I like something terrible. And that's all hell tired as the "reality TV show has gone wrong thing"? It has been done well and much better before. Wrong turn 2 or ... like .... That whatever that movie is called with Edward Furlong. How bad this movie is I do not even think of that movie, but it was better than that. I enjoyed a comment claiming good time for it because "the reality TV is taking" Anyone from a past post with the machine? Are you kidding me This thing is trash ... and not a fun way.
