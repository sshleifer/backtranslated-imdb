Strawberry Blund is a great scripts, but I was just in the place of Ariel Flin, instead of James Cagnie, that person is not that part. I think Olivia has done a great job. This movie is a day's wrapping wrap, so it's hard to follow. I do not like the attitude of male character; Cagney presents it the way it was just close. I played it by a main male character for a poor 3. (If you like tough rage males who want to fight all the time and argue it is your movie). If the positive attitude of the main character was even greater then Strawberry Blund would have been better and changed the script so that he was happy with Oliva. <br /> <br /> By pointing this movie, money can not bring happiness, women's rights joke Flat and easy are not the best movies, but everyone has to decide for themselves.
