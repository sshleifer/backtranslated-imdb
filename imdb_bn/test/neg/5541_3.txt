I understand it's a small statistical sample (8 votes as this post), but 10 out of 5.9? I'm giving a 3 in this movie and even that's generous. I have now tried to watch this movie three times (premiere on the 9 PM Saifai channel and re-broadcast on Saturday night on 1 October and Thursday night) and I was asleep before the movie ended three times. Which leaves me with a laundry list of inappropriate questions. For example, was Lance Henriquesen guilty of cash, that he would have to play the supporting role of this devious "Pumpkinhead" series? Is Henrikine banned from the contract of "Pumpkinhead"? The makers of this franchise are not better than a giant who looks like a geriatric, can walk like "jumping" allians, just like his stick is **? When did hikers of these movies realize that handguns and rifles do not hit "Pumpkinhead"? Why do not they try jamming another stick up this stick? ** Instead? And, ultimately, the authors of this movie have challenged so creatively that they can not name more for two conflicting families than Hitfields and McCoys? When you're in it, why not write a screenplay about the legendary president and his name is George Bush? One day I could have a mental stamina to watch this movie as I got out of sleep. Then, if anyone has the answer, please let me know.
