As the German occupation of France and the rule of fascism, filmmakers tried to grasp the influence of Mandovis and Robert Parker. But they never found a victim in this film. We have heard the mourning of wine makers, critics and distributors that it has become increasingly monotonous when the vintage industry grew. But the film does not succumb to any such case that it earns a lot of money without the harm of a good wine or a person or culture, similar to the wine-scented reader readers. <br /> <br /> If it was a movie for the diamond business, where the market dominance of the Debian corporation is a result of human suffering, the Makrakan style may have been suitable. But it comes as anti-American, modern modernization and anti-capitalism. If filmmakers were very close in the 1870s, then perhaps the American Vince protested against the efforts to save French alcohol.
