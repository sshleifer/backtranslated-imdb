I was waiting for the expectation / hopes of seventeen exploitation slaughter drive-style slices in this movie, but what I got was a lot more talk and without adequate work, I was a Western West. It is clear that this film was made in budget; Pushing the locations and shots badly, when played too many leaves to be desired. This plot keeps an eye on the three robbers (a father and two sons) who steal an iron gold after killing a mine. They come across a young girl and her cousin residing in a cabin ... and all this is said in a young girl, now in a flashback by residing in a sanctuary. It is clear that director Louis Lehmann and William Sax feel that they were really somewhat frustrating; But despite his best efforts, the south of the Hell Mountain is very annoying for the visitors. The film is about eighty minutes of drones and most of the annoying characters are annoying and long winds. The only good thing to tell about the film is related to music; Which is good at the place. The only other good thing about finishing movies; And it's just because it's the last thing. I would not recommend anyone disturbed this tracking track ... There were so many good trash made in the seventy set.
