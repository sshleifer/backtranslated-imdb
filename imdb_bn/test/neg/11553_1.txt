I do not know who can enjoy or smile at this movie. I'll say it's the worst movie of the year I've seen and I see many of them. Maybe I forgot junior high? It is very difficult to believe that this crossing of George Washington's doing this great job is similar to Jeff Daniel. He looks like a duper, he's gone to the tank. Can you believe he even wrote this junk and managed?
