I love sci-fi and are willing to do a lot. Science-fi movies / TVs are usually under, low praise and misunderstandings. I tried to like it, I really did, but it is also the best TV scientist in the Babylonian 5 Star Trek (original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogs, CGs do not match that background, and painfully one dimensional character can not be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure you are there who believe that Babylon 5 is not good science-Fi TV, it's not like the audience and impressive development.) While US viewers may like to develop passion and character, science is a genre that takes itself seriously Do not do (CF Star Trek). It can consider important things, even though it is not a serious philosophy. It's really hard to take care of the characters here because they are not just fools, just missing a gimmick of life. Their actions and responses are wooden and predictable, watch often watch. The creator of the world knows that it is garbage, because they always say "the world of Gene Ruddenbru ... ..." but otherwise people will not see it. Roddenberry's Asia must bend their orbits in this low, inexpensive, badly edited (watching it without ad breaks really bring this home) into a vacuum tray space. Spoiler So, kill a major character. And then brought him back as another actor. Jeeez! Again all of Dallas.
