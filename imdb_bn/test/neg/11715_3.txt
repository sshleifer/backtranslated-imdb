A few years ago a few friends and I visited the video shop and we were in a mood to hire some unknown invisible flickr. My friend was holding the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well that set off our smile and decided we have to go to the table and have a bet who will pay for the movie. Well, you guessed it, I was also !!!!!!!! I did not get so much shame in my life. We returned home and we were rolling about sunny floors for about 45 minutes because it was the most fun movie in the world. I can not remember a lot about it, but one thing I think is that the blonde girl got it with some people behind the shop every minute. The head laughs me and it laughs me more when I see other people's opinions outside the film. The head of the family is so good and the head is funny and I still smile, haha ​​haha ​​haha ​​ha
