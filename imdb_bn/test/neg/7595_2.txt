This movie is a strange sensation of various ghost stories and suspense-thriller conventions, there is no completely grasp of them and they all are provoked. The script was perfunctory. Acting, Dito. The terrible FX was mostly ridiculous, the moment of a wonderful sit-jammer that scared me, though I saw it coming a mile away. Now, explain to me why you need ghosts and black magic, and Archana programs, and Capapula Cgi Bugman, and psychological investigators and family discipline, and Irish prejudice, and the bowl of bow for the supernatural creatures, and dollies possessed, All in the same movie? With all that you would expect horrible multiple better moments, but this movie is cripple, hair, hair.
