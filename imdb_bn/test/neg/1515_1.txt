Yes, this has got one of the lamest movies I've ever seen. It's completely shameless, no style, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the entire movie can run so much oil tanker so that you can run an oil tanker through it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I would appreciate a good B-movie like most male white homo sapiens. But I have seen to be the worst. In fact, there is a lack of everything that makes it attractive to a B-movie. <br /> <br /> The whole film is located around such charming artwork, characters are completely different, different physical functions and completely lacking some sanity on the outside screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, it was wasted time watching, and I hope others will not make the same mistake. If you pay for it then you have to work a serious brainscan.
