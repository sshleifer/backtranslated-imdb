It is, in my opinion, a very poor film that plays Arnold Schwarzenegger (also as his co-star) selling more copies. Clearly from the same theme? With the impact of the Conan film, the film failed to prove it enjoyable and eventually failed to entertain it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the death of his village, his family was killed by a ghostly personality And the soldiers of Queen Zidran (Sandhal Bergman) rape her. Gadran wants control over the barbarous world, and Sonaa Sister finds a sharp queen protected to protect her. After discovering what is happening to goldsmith revenge, at the same time, he must save the world from the wrath of Zedoran. Kalidar (Schwarzenegger), who is the master of Talistman, has set him to protect whether he wants to stay there. <br /> <br /> The first major problem with this movie is the beginning. The events going forward towards events, where gold was given power, could easily make ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable films. Anyway, it's like a minute ago? Segment from a television show. They really created the events and then could spend some filters, but they could start reducing the film, but unfortunately they (why am I surprised by director Richard Fleisch, who currently has two films in red film) Sonja) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But in this case Unfortunately failed. He was writing in the film for a lot of humorous relief but with the overall inconsistency of the film, was it another costly mistake? 'Red Sonaza' <br /> <br /> <br /> All its flaws were somewhat good, the scenes seem to be both Nielsen and Arne, but this is not enough to save this turkey. As far as acting is good for this quality film and even Arnio does not feel very bored about his performance. I do not recommend all of these films; To me it is a half hour waste. My rating? Red gold ?? 3/10
