Do not waste your time. The plot drags, the characters are wooded and reluctant, their motivation of action is completely unknown. Waiting for "romantic" or "comedy" to happen, and nothing happened. Even worse, the love letter is not even romantic, but it sounds like someone desperate for a certain period wrote. Did I mention that "Plot Twist" which we have seen in the movie from 15 minutes is "Hollywood Crafty", which means nothing to despair, but nothing like Hollywood's mentality, and rather vaguely invasive. <br /> <br /> It is also worth $ 2 worth to rent. It does not bother to see it.
