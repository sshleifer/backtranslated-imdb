I can not imagine why such a possible reason Madden and Hopper wanted to stay in the film after reading the script. Did they get blackmail? Or are they badly out of the money? The main issue of the movie is it annoying. The dialogue between Madness and Hooper's character is not pointless, just like the boring chat between two friends while eating beer on Saturday night. You never feel for any characters (although Madison's psycho killer is much more liked than other characters). Hooper was always a good actor, and Madsen did a good job as serial killer, otherwise acting is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is happening, every one of them lasts for about three minutes. Although the "killing and thinking about the nature of murder and murder" scene was interesting, but if they were in a book view. The whole idea was interesting for a novel, but a movie can not survive with a story with so much internal thinking and such a small step.
