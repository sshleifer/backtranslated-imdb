Mother's desert starts in the middle of a place like a wooden building. A pick-up truck pulls down and an angry father kisses her whore girl Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and throws it out, but the picture of the creator of Nestor Duvalier (Brian James) shows him from a distance. Virginia tried to negotiate but she gave a cigarette ants under her leopard prints, and after breaking up the high, high heels, the Nestor holding her with her neck and putting him in the dark. The cast then rips his top open, turns into a giant and starts to eat his innards. The latest victim of a series killer murderer from Virginia is divided into Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and LAPD, or at least the message is told by local television reporter Clay Duiare (Mark Thomas Miller) to his audience. Clay is happily living with her pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and so her mother Emily (Jeane Betes) has kept an extra room that she decided to hire Nestor wearing 'dark' dark sunglasses. Unfortunately, for Emily, she happily stopped Neander's sunglasses, which revealed her strange colorful eyes, then Nestor turned into a monster again, and Emily donated a monster to eat her own meat. Nestor takes Emily to train him, he finds a decent homeless left (Rory Ventent), kills him and eats his hat but Emily's son Clay sees the whole thing and she is right and will choose between her love for her mother who is now just A bloody bleeding and eating meat would be a monster! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand, I thought Mom was a very horrible movie. Looking at some other IMDB comments and the list has been listed, many feel that a comedy comedy of mom Well I can tell you now that I have not seen any comedic elements of mother because they are none, until they are very fine. The only thing I can guess is that the real situation of the mother is presented to comedy, an elderly woman is a meat eating giant and predictive problems and emotional pain that finds her boy. There is no joke (In addition to the name of a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens), snapstick humor or anything else is fun and funny even in the funny movie and as long as I see it is played entirely straight through the 90-minute run, so mom has no comedy Meaning there is a lot of horror right? False, mother disappointed and especially after the first thirty minutes after a few minutes Frequently often, frequently, frequently going on frequently at a moderately modest speed frequently, frequently, frequently and frequently, frequently, frequently, frequently, frequently, frequently There was a special make-up effect and my interest was, unfortunately, with the suffering of mother Emily's son, mental pain which runs for another hour, the last deterioration of her marriage and her love for her mother and she is a mother The food is isolated between the giant. This part of the film is incredibly slow, annoying and wasted like water, even for the scenes of nervous role-playing, where Clay tells her mother to go to her mother and behind her behind the door. Had to stay and put the bar on his window so that he could not escape from his room. The mother script completely ignores the motivation of the monsters and only we must admit that I am so stupid to be able to help some background of the giant, without the sole reason why this thing should be done without us. Technically, looking for Mad Blood and Cheap, although I can not say it badly, it's a very bad thing that does not affect a particular thing or something I can do to make time to pass the fun. The special make-up effect on the monster is okay but use them very fast in dizziness, hug and you'll miss them. An amateur video like me will not be fooled by box artwork, the giant is only three times the maximum and it is dynamic within the first thirty minutes. There is no excuse, a stacked arm, some short intake, a burned body and a drill in someone's arm that we have received. All right about that dodgy accent, but what did Mr. Brian James do? At least James knew well that he was in despair and willingly decided to kill him before the judicial process, others all hope for black lieutenant who was a black police officer in Fred Knight (1985) but you might recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990) He could have done the same year mother and Maya hard? Talk about the opposite of spectrum! Overall there is nothing that I can really recommend to my mother as a scary movie, and as much as I'm concerned about, it's definitely not a comedy. Very poor, very frustrating and yet again I have been dressed in the fancy video box artwork with great popularity. Of course one should avoid.
