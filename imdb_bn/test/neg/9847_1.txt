The film tried to capture the similarity of idealism that many young girls have fun for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sexuality, maturity etc. The problem was that it failed to place these things on each level; That's why it fails to build a decent story around them. I could not follow any part of this story, I should not take care of any reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a search in Pedophilia. It is basically the daughter of love for her sister and her sister is loved by the "men" concept. The second tries to love the man, the former tried to win back his sister "even getting". <br /> <br /> The plot was weak, the letter was weak, and its reality was very similar. An amateur porn creator (without sexual substance).
