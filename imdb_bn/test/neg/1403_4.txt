Each shawbie in this harmful psychodrama book uses the device to show attention and sympathy for us, who are not eligible for a notice with an exception, leaving two valuable hours of movie time. <br /> <br /> As Robert Redford's "normal man" (a fantastic movie that shows the "heroes" vacuquity), a late teenage boy died, and left his family dead on the death penalty. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always survives in a melee way, psychological well poisons. We follow these people for the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> The father (Jeff Daniels) is withdrawn, often silent, usually drunk, who secretly takes a leave of his job for a few months, instead of a park bench all day, and the food for the dead boy for every meal Strong suggestions to set the whole plate. He treats everyone else in the family with cruelty unrest. He regularly visits his doctor, but in the case of his apparently effective therapeutic intervention never comes. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Waiver) is calling on her neighbor, when she tries foolishly to buy a "marijuana" (her period) in a head shop (actually, any adult will use such stupid stunts?), and the last On the side of the lungs, the tumor turns into a comforter that everyone feels cancer in the theater (he is a heavy smoker). Miss Waiver has some flip lines, but usually behaves very sympathetic to treating it with sympathy. <br /> <br /> It is not that there are no people who behave in this stupid way when a severe situation arises. But why make such a drill a picture? What can anyone learn from this pair behavior? <br /> <br /> The old dead sister (Michelle Williams) has gone to college and is happy to move herself away from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emil Hirosh) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is true, its multiplicity, and its behavior is synchronized in situations. But the character of Hirosh is very soft, very thick and fatal, to carry the film. Other bit players, subtails and cutesy, do not help false conversations. <br /> <br /> The suicide theme is almost unreasonably echoed in the case of two minor characters. So is the writer-director Dan Harris trying to talk about this? Is not it a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play the father's sap as this written in the Papple is something his father could possibly answer. Avoid these dogs. Instead of Redford's classic fares.
