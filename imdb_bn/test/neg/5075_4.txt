Does bank hest / cop thriller seem to be okay? <br /> <br /> Choice looks like: nicely made, good production value, high concept worker ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is both smart and unbelievable, that is, "how we really got money" modes abruptly disagree, and at the same time "who did this and why" section has been complicated? <br /> <br /> Joining, Ryan Phillip is not screaming, is not serious or scary ... and if scary is particularly difficult or scary, scary. Sincerely, his great explosion is the only funny scene in the film. He needs to adopt the role of Anakin Skywalker and now he is doing ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The extra line of lines is so sad that even some cleared faces are needed. She feels uncomfortable. Do you feel more silent? <br /> <br /> Snipes is exactly the way to Typstast, but another talent in the coffin of a talented actor: he needs an actor's role, or an action hero Rehash. Perhaps the business will break the mold with his tax and the public and the critics vote him sympathetically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said it might be good / but it can not only break the general germ with horrible lines, extraordinary scores and amplitude levels. <br /> <br /> Overall, I almost made it: incredibly annoying, and Ryan .... Please, please get rid of Sonnels ....
