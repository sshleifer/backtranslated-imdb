I can assume that this movie was a test that was unconditional. Years ago, it has been running pictures accompanied by music. Later, it added silent words. Eventually it was a technicolor, cinemusic or an emax. This image has made a confusing attempt to introduce a new element of the conversation. During all the emotional scenes, the character stays in the central dialogue and their internal thoughts are described when they look at the distance or appeal to the camera. This barrier is very painful. Imagine this top level actor in the busy look when the drone drone. Painful. I have no idea who came with this hostage, but it was the only time I saw it used - and for good reason. In each scene, actors were forced to roll their eyes, bind them, or press the pressure on such a degree, I really thought it was actually a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a frustrating soap opera that happens in a few generations. Narva Shearer, frustrated in love, searching for a reason to live. He has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who worshiped him - but he granted him. He was attracted to a doctor run by Clark Gabelle, but he is confident and not interested in him. She settles for a weak that needs her weaknesses. She simply could not find the madness in her family and she could have a child with her, not only to marry him. Besides, he comes to the doctor who pops a bun in his hair selfishly, only soon after he learns that he loves everyone after him. The child maintains confidence in her husband, who succeeds, but she realizes that Clerk really loves. Still confused? Forget the rest, look at some episodes of "World Towers" and it will be clear. <br /> <br /> Keep watching the final scene if you are forced to watch this movie. The actor gyrations keep Harold LLoyd from shame. It is not missed.
