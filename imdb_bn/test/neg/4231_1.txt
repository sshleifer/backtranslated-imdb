Main character, Foreignon, former film has suffered losses of his wife and child in the past. He's just police with shutting off mentally. Very long film, Foreigner's inexperienced face, too much "road time" (one of the TV restrictions: time spent driving cars, trains, etc) is spent much time. Its long scenes are trivial - sometimes totally unavailable, nonsensically trivial - not because of the actions or with emotion. His best friend Joseph and Domino are not much, their relationship on the basis of sexual relations (this film probably means new meaning of "unwanted sex"); Domino and Pharaoh's mother are two characters who show some emotions, but not many. It is difficult to say all the characters in this movie: it is simply indifferent character portrayed by unreasonable acting, indifferent writing, or good acting and good acting. The characters of this film rarely speak to someone; It's astonishingly different from their emotionally detached, which is all the more bizarre because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and familiar with each other.
