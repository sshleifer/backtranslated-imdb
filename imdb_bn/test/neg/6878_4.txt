I never wanted to see sadness, but I just caught up on him. It has good stuff. Luciana Swim's atmosphere is one reason, unfortunately we will not see so much of unfortunately movies due to the storm of Katrina. It is based on a fun idea, a regular man is pictured with evil spirits. His conflict with his son could have been interesting, as was the case with most of the movie. But an interesting concept that happens in Hollywood goes from a familiar point: <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Agnes Brunner, but another Characters, the son mentioned before the villain CEC, who will be a Voodoo PuDesi, is more interesting. And for God's love, once I want to see the virgin die. We all like simple girl, why can not she live? In this case it was Biju Phillips, and we love him. <br /> <br /> Finally, the idea of ​​Wilne's incompetence did not end. All killings and atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
