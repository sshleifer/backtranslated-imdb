Well, the sai-fi channel keeps the torch in the turkey ... and they seem to be getting worse every time. When good actors like John Rice-Davies and Zyngarello Esposito are locked out as amateur, you can imagine that this waste-how unrealistic of the shield RESTs in your time-effort. The only half beautiful thing is the rubber decoration (it's a quick flashing thing that you do not really have time to actually have time to see it). Conversation ... plot ... if this "food" (and I used a short term term) was the food, Jack-in-the-box would be an important food compared to it. See the re-run of "The Monsters" to see 372nd - your time will spend even better (and along with many squares)!
