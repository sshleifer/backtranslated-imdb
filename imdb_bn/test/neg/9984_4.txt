Although its plot is taken from ancient Rome's history, 'Kaligula' is not made in 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator' like the epic of the Taulal-e-Chandra. (The style of film making was not favorable at the end of the seventeenth century). Rather, it is more closely related to the cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the 150 minute version is shortened. I have never seen the full 210-minute version, but to think from the description of this page it's a hard-core porn movie and a video seems to be near a cross in the nasty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The heterxozel is probably unexpected from the publisher of a closely related journal of the person's lifestyle, that the number of male males as men's presence is very high and apparently the homeostatic overturns lead to many scenes. Sex with sex is equally balanced with violence, including Bob Gucci√≥n, Gore Vidal and Tintro Bras, trying to kill two tabs with one stone. (It is a great restraint that a director of such a Brazilian film should be called 'Brass' and such author of glory should be called 'Gore'). Characters die or disintegrate in a variety of sad ways, and there is a charming view of gay rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and her predecessor Tiberias were certainly known for their unimportant living, so the density of movies for sexual and violence is not historically incorrect. However, I ask about whether such density is needed to help understand this period in Roman history. Both the 'Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during Comilla's reign, which was cruel and cruel as Emperor Kaligula. In any case, the makers of 'Up Pumpi!', 'Emmanuel' and 'Texas Texas Massacre' did not find the need to launch their film, and both films are much better than artists rather than 'Kaligula'. <Br /> <br /> The film's performance is not particularly bad, such as the terrible wood of Tuscea Ann Sobhay, like Drussila. Malcolm McDowell makes an appropriate insane Caligula. (The true creator, in the context of this film. The actual Kaligula was undoubtedly both cruel and barbaric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is just why so famous British actors will be willing to take part in such a trashy production. Perhaps Helen Mirren (perhaps the only doc in the past of the British Empire) was probably associated with her tragic tendency instead of the fierce and lazy, but Heaven alone was Peter O'Waul and who knows John Gilgood they are doing. Another famous actor, such as Lawrence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gilgood has not always watched entirely in the movie, but here he gave a respectable explanation for the role of a decent and respected senator, nerve in the old school. Unfortunately, any effort to honor this movie is a pearl place on a dunghil. <br /> <br /> Gucci was clearly successful in achieving the ambition of this film. (Whether the ambition for the film was similar to Bras and Vidal). However, the film does not succeed at any other level like industrial industry or as a study of dictatorship politics. It is also seen as the Yautica second rate. 4/10
