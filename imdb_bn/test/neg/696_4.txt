Because they want to watch movies because they are beautiful, you should fix it with this one. If you want to watch movies that start with a good person trying to catch the bad guy, then reveal the motives of each of the film. At the end of the film, I still do not know why Sturgers killed women like that. When you are setting up such a conservative serial killer, where the rituals are originated from, it is also good to know. Dreams was a serial killer with a similar beautiful movie that was not the best, but at least it was explained how to kill girls. They gave a hint to Vaughn's character in a dark background, but did not explain why Lopez's child psychologist did not really say why it was so appropriate for this work compared to the rest of his interview, he did not explain much. For the problems of little kids, etc. If the rest of the story is compulsory, then how could I not know all the sterger's latest electronic equipment and underground chambers, or why I did not know how to check whether the FBI owned it. There was an opportunity to reach out to other property or to go out of the way when they wanted to see if the whole killer's heart was waiting to see, but I'd like to get ideas about how to kill a serial killer in a serial killer film.
