A really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew disturb their valued career time, and our equally valuable leisure time, support this fully anticipated and definitely formula piece of commercial junk. The film is based on really good and very topical concept, but both the producers and the directors have applied the Hollywood 'disaster film' formula and thus eliminated the possible value from the production. <br /> <br /> A unusual high tide and very strong melting condition produces a record high storm surge that London overwhelms and combines the production of most floods in the Thames Valley. Plot centered around a heroic scientist (Tom Corten), who warns of danger and ultimately protects that day, an impressive female police chief who manages the entire show and a neglected deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who tries to look important . <br /> <br /> But after 30 minutes it seems like an extended tea break. The young Glamorer Women's Police Commissioner demanded full authority over the army and declared it (eg!). The experienced general has been kept aside just like a fool, which would have to boot due to its apparently high power. The problem is our female superimo, though it is now responsible for millions of animals, most of the time worried about the fate of her two daughters, who traveled south-west London and did not telephonically claim it. So our Almighty Women sets their staff for their search and decides that the only priority for all army and rescue services will be South West London and no other quarter of the city. Of course, the minister, army and the entire housewife take his priority without question. One can only guess they have all the property. Her children are finally found by her staff after uninterrupted reporting and efforts, she said by our male hero, 'thank God they are safe, this is the main thing'. He can not think about millions of others or all other responsibilities that he can control; It was all right as long as her own children were safe. <br /> <br /> This picture is another excuse for pushing the same old brutal sexist sex trap, which is a clever, minded, caring, and clearly capable leader of women, though men have nothing to do with physical courage, mind power and nothing else. Very expert knowledge And yet a general direction that he could give to the people; That is, to go to the nearest tall building and calmly go to the 4th floor or above and wait for guidance when the water super hero never or anyone else gives it. The whole problem was so easy to solve and still millions of people did not seem to be going upstairs! Poor garbage.
