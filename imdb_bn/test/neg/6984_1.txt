On the opposite side of the spectrum from the riders of the LOST ARK, David Hemings' completely inferior adventure with the World War II era, with a valuable cargo. Among the resources include beautiful New Zealand settings, Brian May's energetic music score and some wild helicopters flying and jet boat movement. Bad, however, a lot better. Donald Pleasence probably hams before; Half of its dialogue is nearly obsolete. George Pepper Australian (I think) tried the accent, then it gave it through half. Lesley Ann Warren is her most annoying. Who wow, well, who wow. The dialog is painful to hear and Heming's side is largely inactive. The script is not only obvious but terrible. Jokes fall flat, the scenes carry no punch and the continuity of the scenes virtually exists. According to the last achievement, two people were killed when the filmmaker was shot. What a waste
