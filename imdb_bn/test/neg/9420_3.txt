A team of US soldiers joined the US troops to blow up the rebel airfield, joining them is a robot called Solo (Mario van Paibel), which can use any weapon, it is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human Being Although something went wrong and refused to kill innocent civilians, which are not satisfied with returning to Colonel Frank Madden (William Saddler) base and General Henes (Barry Corpin). One of Solo's main instructions is to go back to the South American jungle with self-preservation where Colonel Madenen and his men have been sent to recover it ... <br /> <br /> This Mexican American co-production was conducted by Norberto Barba and one Solo Have to say terrible. The script written by David Curley was based on Robert Mason's novel 'Weepon' and on the other hand there was a clinic, Sola was made in Hollywood and box office; So, Soul Rip Off 1987 likes Rabakop), Universal Soldier (1992) and two Terminator Flickr as well Original story (1987) as same setting and predator. It is a senseless robot about the normal garbage that enhances the humanity's mind while living around, firstly, he does not know anything, why a person will take care of others, but eventually he develops emotions and begins to be friendly. People, Terminator 2 sounds: Judgment Day (1991) me. The character is not absolutely motivated to hate the poor and the Colonel Maden, especially the Soul, and why he will kill other US soldiers and disobey orders. You know I saw it on the telephone last night (thanks, I did not spend any money on it) and I saw it in the TV guide and you know what you know? Acting as a terrible science-fee action in my TV guide Soloque 'Maria Van Paibel', which I think is a perfect description of Solo With less than 10 words, my TV guide hit the nail on the head, meaning it's a science-reed action film, it must be Mario van Pubbs and it must be terrible. Actually I said <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Barbara does not do anything special here, and there is no real tension in the action scene, and in reality there is no existence except Robot. So the army is losing Solo and Colonel Maden to bring it back? I'm not funny, but if something happens, the army will establish a 'self-reliant' system inside Solo? Surely at least Solo had a tracking device in it so that the military could at least tell where it was at any time? I'm not funny but these people can come with a robotic soldier but they do not realize that if a tracking or self-destroying device goes wrong, then can it be helpful? Violence is light, some are just scenes of war, but it is actually a very weak thing. <br /> <br /> The technically correct film was created and produced efficiently, it was actually shot in Mexico. Delft Lundgren's Action Flick's creator, Agent Red (2000), edited footage from Solo in this film. The act was poor, van Paibel was the perfect choice to run a passionate robot ... William Saddler is better than he, he looked at Hard Hard 2: Die Harder (1990) just a few years ago. br /> <br /> Solo is a real bad Saif-back action flick, which is a huge rip-off of Hollywood big-action action films of big budget like Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminal Films. Do not recommend and when I like to choose movies, my TV guide needs to pay more attention ...
