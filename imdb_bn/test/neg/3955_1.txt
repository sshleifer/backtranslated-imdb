Frankie Muniez is too quick to understand as well (Malcolm in Middle Flashback?) This film still can not accept the scary. The story was interesting about "Countess" and the surrounding history of his story, but plots, and many side plots, are not just tie together. Plot synopsis: kill ghosts lures through video games. Toss between some blood spatters and a special effect and you've got yourself to be another bomb explosion. Scratch Cronis sees a lot more ghosts in "The Ring Two". Every person's emotions are played and the constant and dramatic changes are incredible. Save your money.
