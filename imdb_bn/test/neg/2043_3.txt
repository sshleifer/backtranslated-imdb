From most aspects of alternative titles in English, "sexcaster" is obviously the most appropriate one, because it is basically a shameless rip off of William Fredkin's classic horror film, which replaced 13-year-old Linda Blair with 19 years. Her oldest Stella Kernasina can reveal only her unbearable naked body. I'm not sure what Satan tries to accomplish here, but he thinks that he is a young girl who wants to play sexual acts on her! The poor Daniila watches around the clock and tries to seduce the priest and even his own father having sex with him. The young girl is a smart and ambitious theologian-student as a malicious boyfriend (stupid yellow car driving) and loving, adulterous parents. When he took a remarkably crucified home for rebuilding, the life of ancient style came in and the devil himself ("Jungle Holocaust" and "Vampire of Planet" played by Ivan Rashimov) is even less. Sequence of excessive masturbation sessions and some vicious nightmares covered three quarters of movie and finally the director Mario Garijao started with genuine enthusiasm. That final segment is even more embarrassing and amateur! The priests do not do anything about saying a few nonsense prayers, but suddenly, Daniella suddenly thinks everyone is healthy. Not too much, dialogues are horrific, and producers add more shocks to compensate every small mistake! This is one of the seventieth year's strange Italian exploitation efforts (why they refer to "The Rocky Hour Picture Show"?), But certainly not the best. If you like the clones of "Exorcist", then I recommend "Daemon Witch Child", "The Day the Door" and "The Antichrist".
