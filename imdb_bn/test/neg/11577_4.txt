Jim Wynorski again strikes again with the literally-minded KOMODO VS. Cobra Here is no guess. A giant CGI comodo dragon - it seems like a dog subdued fur - it carries a huge CGI king to Cobra, a bunch of trees and caught in others. Tree Hagrama Charter Boat Captain Michael Pare (who else?) Get an off-border federal island to take them Growing too large veggies has become an experiment of increasingly large critters by a mad scientist, thanks to our lost military. Now all that remains on the island is the big critters and mad scientist's small, metaphor girl. The group runs into its old planting lab, the monsters come, and the chase. If you see enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi channel flicks, you will find many other sets of movies and locations. The acting is as nonexistent as the plot is. In a very short time, you can see animated Compo / dog stops before you scarf on their victimized prey. Cobra only strikes and swallows. There is no imagination.
