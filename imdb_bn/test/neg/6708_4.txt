This movie started with this wonderful song which gave me some coolness like "Elmustrie Nightmare" song! It is immediately set to mood! The sequence that follows also shows what you expect! We are aware that we present a Scratch! The mystery about this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to understand! The idea behind the plot is quite interesting! Just what we have been told is very abstract! I realized that the director believed that as long as the mystery should be maintained! You will not get a satisfactory explanation when the issue exposes certain issues! The objectives of the important character are omitted and some of the questions raised in the film are not answered! Because we do not know enough about the characters, it becomes difficult to care for them! And as a result you will loose the interest! Just save some of these scares and become a twist total failure! Twist is interesting but no real shock! Experienced visitors will see it coming! Some critics have complained that the film is much more like "RINGU" and it is not original! Well it is true that some effects and fears are taken from that movie! But there is a major difference! Based on this mobile phone of "Pangu", the audience finds out how the characters die! Another crazy wrap is used as a surprising effect on the twists of "Rayong" ("Rinu")! "RANG" relies heavily on a complex structural plot and wrapping that is not afraid enough to keep your interest in it! Simply tell: this is not a scary movie!
