I decided to watch this small budget movie from "Poverty Row" studio, PRC, because it co-sponsored with exciting character actor Lionel Atu? Plus I really liked the title. Although Attil often played in this cheap film, his style of acting seems to be very good at all, because his screen personality was great (his real life too interesting - like an odd soap opera). The reason for using the term "poverty line" is a nickname given to the cheapest and worst producing companies of this era. Many of these were not even studio, but production companies who rented the space and set from the main studio at night! Yes, after a normal working hour it was a good opportunity to impress? This is a common thing for such studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atoll telling a story about something that is related to a few years of his friends. Before A doctor falls in love with a lady but she is afraid to tell herself about herself. Because his job is to award death sentence to death? Not a glamor job! Doc asks his friend (Atual) for advice on breaking up with his friend, but he will not have that person. Later, you understood this because his own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later, a person dies and the woman is involved? A brown bit) and the proof against the lady was poor. However, apparently the jury was full of senseless people and was convicted and sentenced to death. Even more intelligent that his old boyfriend was responsible for his execution. Do you think someone else might not be able to handle this case?! Until these lucky hours, his friend (Atwill) spent most of the film in order to prove his innocence ?? And proved that flaky sisters know a lot about the case than the case admits. <br /> <br /> Overall, movies are only silently interesting and a bit scary. While watching it and atwill like this (as usual), the rest of the film did not really top up in Munndi and played quite pretty. Is this a sub-par and what do you expect from such low budget flicks? And there is nothing other than cool title.
