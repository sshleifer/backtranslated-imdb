Mormon stands a dull through prostelatizing banalities. Odd non funny One of the rules of the widely held theory, that the bathrooms humor must be fun, it must be illogical; It also claims that close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. Do not worry about any social problem coming up in the dinner table after this campaign, more than film. This movie is a collection of grace, especially the striking young Marmon women's correct screenplay. Oh well, your $ 7.50
