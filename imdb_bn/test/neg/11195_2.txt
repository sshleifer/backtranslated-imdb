This show started well, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was competitive. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they did strange hobbies. In the second season, a man said that he talked about his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one is careful about winning the money. All they wanted to do was "live" or something else. Men were always afraid that women are going to be grouped together. Women were the same. I just could not take it anymore. I was close to watching it. It was one of the really worst shows ever.
