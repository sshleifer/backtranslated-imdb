About your awesome movie Bithovan's copy. As a professional musician, I have a duty to see every film made about a musician and my favorite of Beethoven. When Hungarian and Americans meet, it is just a horrible combination on the top emotions combined with potentially bad flavors. You proved it to your terrible B-movie. The only thing that carries the movie is music. Of course you will not be too bored to look better but in my taste, the congratulatory performance of the quadruple performance, but well, I acknowledge that at least the performance is the quality of the quality compared to the movies you have made. It started with DEAF Beethoven's death, who completely understands Anna completely silent. During the filming, Beethoven's hearing became better minutes, but it could certainly be some vague divine thing. Then impossible impossible to take semi-pornographic "eyes wide open" dual performances which ultimately bring joyful and eventually topped with nephews (who are constantly red eyes, what a performance of my god), and so forth. And as a rap-off from Amadeus, Beethoven does not note the music in Anne's music document, but it is totally meaningless, which he can fully understand but no one else in your audience can even understand trained professional musicians. Of course, your response is a negative reaction, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is making an unrealistic creation and because of his misery. I condemn this so-called tribute and I'm sorry for hiring one of the worst movies I made though about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you understand the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams and of course do not follow and play after violating some lessons. This is your problem with the Americans: you think you can understand everything even during hard work. Yes we can do it the way! Remember to come up with a good product hard labor, talent, devotion and professionalism. This is the creator of the lack of you all creator Beethoven. Kindergarten you see.
