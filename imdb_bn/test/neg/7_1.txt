The legendary fiasco of Black Edwards seems to be in vain after just 10 minutes. The combination of the eagle hung landed, Star!, Oh! What a loving fight !, and Edwards's Pink Panther films, Darling Lily is not involved in the audience; Air sequences, musical numbers, romance, comedy, and spy all the hummies. Does the audience have to give any point? This disaster surrounds the voice, never decides what it wants and apparently it seems to be a fool, but it is terribly and impressive square. In the oldest sense of the old fashion, listen to the listeners droves far away. It's boring James Garner has a huge improvement over Hodgson, which is simply cardboard and he does not connect Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hodson have been given in fun and do not seem to have performed with a wrong distorted sincerity. Black Edwards' SOB is not much better than him, but it's the only good one that has come from Darling Lily. The most expensive and professional appearance of Darling Lily only becomes more difficult to bear. To quote the head of Paramount, Robert Evans, "There is no film worth 24 million dollars and no pictures".
