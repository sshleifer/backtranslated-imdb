I was waiting for the development of this film, but, lazy, it is the worst kind of sedimentary film: a sugar and sugar confectionery that reduces the weight of self-importance of its own moon. The speed of leagina leaked like the Sahara! Good conversations are bigger with the absent white linen attractive to do something other than good looks. Irene is yet another fundamental magician who touches the sun. Kas is a happy singer but not an actress. Thankfully, the script often does not call its emote away from the jazz club microphone. All enviably relaxed, superb, unnecessary characters are tired, enabling masticating scenery with an airy sophisticated. The whole exercise comes across an interminably long Ralph Lauren ad. <br /> <br /> If you are forty years old and believe that Frankfilia is the key to servicing, but you can mistake this cardboard mistake for this fiance. Well, if you like this movie, you probably felt proud to appreciate the Guadard-led Illog√© de L'Oro, and you could even be sitting without lewd divorce.
