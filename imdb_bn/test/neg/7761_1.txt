I look at family issues, at night in the UTVVice at night, at Cornwallis Street and family events in the last quarter is the worst, bad plot, bad sequence, and the worst performance of a Safii is worse than the US and it's saying something. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed that these events in UKTV Australia are "far behind the UK" and when someone tries to find out the reason, they simply stop you through some stories that they have double episodes You can catch up, do not say it never happens, I am very happy that family matters are going on, to make room for doing good things, but the same I wanted to know because of the background, they finally understood how bad it was that people did not stop seeing it? Whatever you do not leave us suspending, why do you think you have to keep everything from your fans secret? Do not take care of this, try and keep your public up to date, family matters is notorious for her children. The strings disappear and do not appear again for some reason, we get involved in the lives of people. <br /> <br /> I understand why family matters will end, even though we are far behind in Australia, the authors easily Outdated ideas for new plots, many plots are being repeated and old episodes are coming back. I noticed that with the introduction of new letters, one of many really bad actors, you scrap underneath the barrels, and finally thanks to Vince with Drake
