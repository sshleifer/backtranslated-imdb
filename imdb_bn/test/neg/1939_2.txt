Viva La Bala focuses on this "Jakas" spin off left Margarine and her pals (Johnny Noxville, Brandon Decimillo, etc.) (esp. Script) adventure. When this show is in its fair share of roughly comedy and crazy stunts, it mainly focuses on the torture of left-wing parents. <br /> <br /> I want to say, left, but ... you are not as cold as you think in any way. This ego tripped show is not only painful (and yes, I like Jacques), but also outrageous beyond belief. At the end, the article related to the left, ultimately, explains that he wants to "do whatever is F ***". How do you actually do something that's funny? I liked "Jacques" for what it was worth. The camera was terrible - any fool could create a good show with Camcoder in their parent's garage - but at least the show went on at a steady pace and never seems annoying with the crazy, dangerous or just boring stunts. <br /> <br /> <br /> Not so, "Viva la left". We do not feel like something else than a really lame and scripted comedy, as we play a trick on our friends and torture her relatives as we follow our hero around. Stants and tricks are hilarious entertainment, but these are a tedious and soft fashion that they can laugh at you. <br /> <br /> "Viva La Bam" is a poor spin off of it, which is a little better, but fun is already very big ego. I do not recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.
