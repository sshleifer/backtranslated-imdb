Rajiv Roy himself? Once upon a time, film director Hit, like Tridev and Viswanathan, is making a bad movie after another. I was excited at the thought of returning to Rajiv Roy's activities, but hurriedly hurried. As a fan of Rajiv Roy, I thought it should be left at least but I went out an hour later. One reason for the film to get out of the film so early is the amount of explosion in the film, it was not the previous initiative of Rai. <br /> <br /> A lot of directors have been invited but I did not expect there was another song of LataDown from Rajiv Roy. Rajiv Ray has always had good music. Just have a good song and watch the wreck laddun. Rai is not played from Lahore's Nasir Uddin Shah or performance till the performance. Once the rental is portable from my favorite director.
