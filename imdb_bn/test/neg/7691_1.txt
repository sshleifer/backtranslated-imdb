This piece of shit is worth a critical review so I do not know these movie backgrounds to write some information for them. First it was not the first of the Saudi film, they used this wrong information for commercial purposes (they are liars!). Secondly, they did not make it for money for anything else. They won the Harrah (Hashem) Star Academy (like Big Brother). It is popular with a popular celebrity and Joker Hasham but fools, Chess and immediately selected famous Kuwaiti actors. (Also fool and immediately) but a popular (I count how many times I'll use the word "popular", then email me to get your reward) but popular show and Jordan actress Moyes Hamdan has appeared in the popular comic show CBM (Curious) So she is famous * PoPular! Then they picked some Saudi actors. The most interesting thing is the director! She is Canadian with the roots of Palestine (I believe the identity of the film is its director's identity) .. Wait a minute! Screen play was written by an Egyptian photographer (very terrible one!) With some help from Lebanese critics (famous as a critic, but in reality he is a money collector!). Multi Race (Money Slaves) This group does not know about Saudi culture, they do not represent it, but when we know who is behind this trash, all our questions will be solved! Walid bin Talal is the Saudi princess and businessman who is not concerned about Saudi culture or Saudi people, even if he does not live in Saudi Arabia (even if he is alive, he will live in his world, his world is far away from the real world people) So he does not know anything or takes care of anything other than increasing his invisible fortune. <br /> <br /> * Not a Saudi movie (no movie). <br /> <br /> Screw them all. <br /> <br /> 10 beats out!
