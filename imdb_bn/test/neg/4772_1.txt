The debris is a bad version of a light commercial movie, which is more bad than Armageddon, as a profound influence of Turistas. If one of the characters is supposed to go to medical school, then why do they retards all? "You can not keep cutting." -Best line forms this movie. This is a terrible movie. I like scary movies, but fully grateful that most of them are terrible, but after watching IMDB's reviews there was a lot more hope for this movie. They are stupid in the situation they are stupid and how they handle it. This is terrible, one thing that makes it a little simpler, it's its wonderful Australian backdrop, though they spend a large number of movies in one place.
