Lil Pump is the story of a little boy who becomes a pump. Animation and voice acting were perfect for such a movie. <br /> <br /> I smiled for the first 20 minutes or more of this movie; In most cases the idea is. Then, the joke was thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp has been a classic. Instead, this film is completely made up of a long joke which lasted for a long time. <br /> <br /> Weather, the sound of Ludicas, there are several weird and fun one-fishing equipment. Unfortunately, this boy's pet mice is good that he does not contribute anything else to the story. Finally, I became bored with his comments as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of South Park and other animations for adults. I play several online pump games, so I partly about the story about Pimps. Lil Pump conversion from the little boy was brilliant; But then, both the stories and the dialogue become void and anticipated. <br /> <br /> I give this movie five. It is valuable for great ideas and voice acting. Just do not expect anything more or you will be quite frustrated.
