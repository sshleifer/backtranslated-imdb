Has anyone found the plot anywhere in the picture? It is probably absent in this ugly exercise of cinema. It is quite surprising that Gordon says "nothing is a movie without any plots" ... it is possible to say that the characters have their own WM Weather Is this expression or actor director decided to send a hint in the original background?
