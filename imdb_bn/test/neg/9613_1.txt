With most critics appearing for the first time, 'Franzhi' recently conned the UK TV round. I think it looks like after its original release, and if the hittercock wanted to confess some sort of screen about its harmful misogynism, then he could not find a vested car to do it. <br /> <br /> But the time has changed the perspective, and so was the annoying or bad of 1972, after all these years, higher re-evaluation may be eligible. <br /> <br /> Probably. . . But not The 'frenzy' is in the draw. An adult filmmaker who wanted to adopt artistic independence of the 70th filmmaking, in his absence, wanted to realize the freedom of achieving independence without feeling of independence - in particular, to bring honesty to his work. <br /> <br /> There is no one here. And there is not much evidence of previous guided brightness - the implicit clarity of spine-tingling is not explicitly swirling, it is also not frustrating, stylish for a top stylist: it is simply amazing (prolonged murder scenes that are: prolonged, without speed, without cause, without any official will Other than any other artist, which is cheap sled, Michael Wei Other acclaimed practitioner of arera considered). <br /> <br /> And it turns out to be bad, with a dialogue that denies the motivation of a person (to hide harmful inside our favorite wood inspector's life and to cook his wife). <br /> <br /> There is a quarrel between a bar lawyer who is probably the best of the scenes (and patience as the most categorical allegation of Hitakoos' personality), where they discuss the continuous murder and then agree that at least rape of women At first there was a good time. <br /> <br /> I remember my rebellion that the scene has returned to '72 again, and it is still unchecked, because the hottak is tricky, or simple, or trying to create some universal points (big theme, big truth, Hitcoak Fort, or personal choice.) It was just a hitchcock, through the texture of the film, to reflect the distorted mirror of its own life. <br /> <br /> Calling 'Fenji' is a last-minute hit by Hitcoch, which is a little betraying what Hitako realizes. Follow the path of cinematic trickery, cinematic thrills, and amazing cinematic skills. <br /> <br /> 'Frenzy' is what it was now: a cheap, nasty and ham-free movie that did not offer any services, or a movie-maker's memory that was really in his Hollywood days. , The greatest of all times ever.
