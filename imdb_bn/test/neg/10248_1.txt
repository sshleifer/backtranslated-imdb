For the bad movie connoisseurs, Galaxina is a real jewel. With really horrible dialogue, acting, and direction, there is no choice for people seeking the right film. But as one of the most funny sunny movies in its continuity, it is invaluable for a good smile. In particular, Harley-Davidson-watching scenes involving motorcycle culture are particularly good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheaper laugh. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratton really failed to deliver, but since he is playing an Android, I think someone might forgive him for acting in wood. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, do not pass this one!
