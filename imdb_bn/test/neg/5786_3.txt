Top guns without conflict in the house. Or class Or money Or cruise. None of the top stars have an excuse for a top mobile cast, which has the ability to market their mother tongue with the ability to market, none of them can get their teeth. This is shameful because the first shot of Charlie Shin has been open with great promise, which is almost isolated with a set piece of great wedding. Barking <br /> <br /> Dennis Hesbert is a changeable actor for me, but in this film he is a great, especially action sequence. Michael Biehn is not the leader of a first-class action but a leading man: Charlie Shane is the leader of all motives and intentions, leading people but never an action hero. Those who have hundreds of stunt cast are notable. 3/10
