First tell me that the people who voted in it "are just kidding" and are trying to get the vote to a respectable level ... something that is not worthy of the movie. (The only movie that has 10 IMO qualifications classic ... Godfather, Shawncock etc.) For the complete list, see the top films of all time.) I noticed that many people gave positive votes to make it realistic so far as it is inside a cave. Although I would like to agree with them around, they are not merely rating the film altogether ... they roam around but miss the overall review. This will give a 10 vote for the movie "Justin Two Kelly" because I think the ocean scene reminds me of what appears to be in Florida Keys ... although this may be true, but it is not suitable for the film. Because the film was completely incognito. <br /> <br /> I could tell you that this film has been preserved, for example, if one thing goes awful, then something else can be picked up. Weakness (Former - bad actors shadowed by a great plot and / or great camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and it started all roughly naturally. We started to become funny, the first to die ... after some driving and hiking they set camp for the night. At the moment, I discussed some things that really protected the rest of the film. I had two main problems: bad effects and an even worse story line. The things we noticed were the campfires were not real ... you could easily see "CGI" or a fake fire that they all sat. For a horror movie such a vague effect should tell me what the error was for me the next hour. <br /> <br /> Just a few minutes later, I was shown how the film was badly written. I do not think at the right time how they reached, but basically, we know that "token nader" is writing a book for the search of caves etc. Another person in this group wants to tell a story about an experience, but embarrassingly says, "I do not want this story from your book." The author raises the conviction that he will not keep the story in his book and he can believe in him. (A direct quote: "If I tell you a story, you must definitely want it in your book.") At this point, I was completely expecting the 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and sincere acting. I got a brief, badly-told (and played) statement. I say the statement because what he said was 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I do not remember the exact quotes, but basically he said: "We were in a cave, there was a flood of caves, a friend of mine died, as a girl died." You might think that I'm exaggerated and really critical, but it's not far from the lines of direct line of the movie line, from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> For the next 50 minutes or more, the movie gets in the cave and although what I want to see in a cave, it seems to be light, but I could really work with the film's truly unclear / vague look, and the camera The vibration is the only one that I did not go for. (I really got a good perspective, and after watching the main parts of the film, I felt that I was blindfolded.) I was emotionally disconnected from this movie, so perhaps those parts were probably not scary. Maybe I could start acting very slow and bad, I was at least frightened, but nobody remembers anyone in the dark room even in the "activity" scene. <Br> <br /> The last scene probably will probably never forget, and it's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped naked in a room. The "monster" comes to attack / kill the woman ... when she stops watching the little boy's picture. A flashback happened where we know that "monster" was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Cut back at the present time, and he takes his "mask" (a big skeleton that seems to be a deerskin shirt). He looked at the pictures and found the weakness / soft spot of two women caves. At that time, he beat a girl with a beating, then she was raped instead of raping another woman. After about 30 seconds after watching the camera scream, she ransomed her, credits, and finished the movie. <br /> <br /> If I had to do this and I used to waste money for renting this movie, I could save myself for one hour and could see the first scene and the last scene of this movie and still walk on with this same thought. That has gone ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... If you could understand how a director and author were directed to Blair's filming It was revolutionary ... each cast Dasyake movie day / night to a script other than the members of the cast What does it mean? Other actors are working. <br /> <br /> If IMDB leaves me, it will get negative score ... I do not understand how anyone can properly recommend this movie.
