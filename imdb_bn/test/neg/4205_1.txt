Sometimes, Chuck Norris takes the bad boy aside and discusses discussions with them in light of discussions with them in the light of their discussion, and with tears in their eyes, they hold hands, calm the world's mistakes together. And the similarity and the end of the world's evil kingdom forever? <br /> <br /> Well, forget it, joke. <br /> <br /> "Breaker!" Instead, it is right for drop-kicks like our Truck-Drivin 'Man Chuck, in his small little towns where his younger brother is a corrupt judge and even more corrupt law enforcers. <br /> <br /> An evil activist does not dare to raise his head until every bad bat in cakes, chokes, slices, gullines and crinel-beauty. Many fights for tension are slow, but only for the 86 minutes to help the film pad. <br /> <br /> And there are many fights in which there is only 15 minutes left for the plot to develop ... and all the plots you get. But what did you expect: for calm talks? <br /> <br /> <br /> For one year! And that's a small 10-4, good friend.
