Greedy Land Baron in the small western city of Priri City, wants all their zamindars to stop their land, using them with fierce tactics and firing to get them empty. It seems as the city is swimming on the oil, and when the Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is thrown out by Berne's mercenary gun. The farmer's sea boy came soon, gradually realized what he was fighting against and trying to fight the other residents. Another in-the-western-story, everyone under the villain's pillar (who normally holds all the cards). With a long wait before our Stoic Hero finally gets up to her dander, frequent derivative and uncomfortable. Sterling Hydhen's half-hearted Swedish pronunciation is a big problem, although she is strong, sympathetic to the screen, and often produces the image to watch. Director Joseph H. Lewis is strongly impressed with most of the scenes, such as a TV Western, and Gerald Friede's Bagel-heavy score is not a help, although Ray Renaheen's rich black and white painters are excellent. An independent project released by the United Artist starts with an intriguing start (starts with the shot from the end of the movie, then follows the shots from the middle of the film), but it is a certain demand power that guarantees the audience to Hayden. ** **** to
