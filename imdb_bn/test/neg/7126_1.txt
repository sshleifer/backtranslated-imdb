I went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain me the story of the first blame. Well, if the first person does not give any impression on the plot to explain the plot, then I suspected that it would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what the trailers will say: Asian women are behind and so Sarah Michelle Gellar is. Thankfully for him, he is not very long around. This decision may save his career. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie, and none of them understands. And even worse, none of them are developed. You almost start to understand, and then someone dies and gets behind the story. Okay, killing people can be scary, but I was more confused than plot development than I was afraid of. They can look back in the lines of three stories, which are not related ... or are they?!?! * Sound effects * ~~~ Time is disconnected during three stories, and at the beginning you can say that there is a curve at the end of the movie. prepare. Wait. Sorry, this is not a fight club or quality of quality at the Vertigo, you can see it coming away from this mile. And probably many good horse horses in your head ... they should hire me. Instead of making the girl look "amazing", maybe it could be Michael Jackson? That part of the horror movie 4 was frightened by my shit. <br /> <br /> The sequence of assassinations was completed extensively. In contrast to the horror film of the past, where a murderer does not go out of place, for example a closet or a door behind, and everyone jumps into the theater (and after a fatty person behind you spreads popcorn under your neck) - there is no horrible pop in the UK. P. come. Zoom will show where they are random Asian ladies or goats, and you knew exactly what's coming. Instead of having music really get louder, then cool, then you pop out of the psyche out, the music actually gives you time for scary scenes. If I know it's coming, it will not scare me. <br /> <br /> The movie started with an explanation of "fault"; When a person was killed at the right time of wrath, he was cursed where he was held. So the Asian lady is cursed by her mother, why there is any significance in the story? And now why is the country running across the country? This movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> This disturbed my friends for leaving me - we saw these animated Pixar movies. It has been scarier.
