My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... I saw it. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First off, how does this rate so high? I can not understand. This "show" is filled with greedy people, stupid people, or just unlike ordinary at the top. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where the wife of Earl's brother covered himself with a dead fish. I'm not kidding. That was not funny, that's boring, that's boring. Then he and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid) then had sex.

Jason Lee is a talented actor, but stuck in helpless role in this terrible "comedy". <br /> <br /> Earl is now in jail this season.
