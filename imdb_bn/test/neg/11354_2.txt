I was waiting for this on this review and based on fairly good ratings. It was a big disappointment. It does not hold a candle on contemporary zombie flights such as Shaon of the dead, dead day, dead land etc. Horror Flickr takes time to take some time, you have to create letters so that they ruin it, you feel some sympathy, but even before slicing a dead body there is a whole 45 minutes to sit here, until it sees a bad soap opera If you do not have any interest or relevance, and if you want to see it for the first time, you can honestly 45 minutes later You can start seeing, you will not miss anything on a plot-based basis. When things are going, all its very sub-par elements. The killers and make-up are doing some good things, others are working very weakly, there is a lack of consistency here and some really frustrating continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you really believe that it is taking place at a flat place, the guns are being fired, the firing will be stopped, a pilot in a violent storm will still not be in the air, we will say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> zombie know the film and you expand things but this is the other major error listed above the picture, zero zero Was gyata. One to miss
