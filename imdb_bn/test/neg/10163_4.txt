John Wayne is one of the most popular and liked actors of all time without a doubt. His career expanded for forty years, and during that time he was known as "Angel and the Badman", "The Green Bear", "Sands of Eo Zima", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska" and "This Inappropriate". <br /> <br /> The above listed movie was saluted as one of her best efforts against the "Randy Rids Allon" of 1934, which has been forgotten by almost all the time, which is unclear, it's only a short period of 53 minutes Not something memorable. <br /> <br /> A young man played by Wayne Randy Bauer, because the reasons were never explained, came to salon in the middle and found that everyone inside was killed. While looking around, a animal came there and found Randi there and they arrested him and wanted to know the rest of his gang. He was kept in jail for his murder. Sally Rogers, whose uncle was owned by Salun and murdered, came to see Randy to become clear among one of the gang members (he was hiding in a secret room in the secret room). Sally does not believe that Randie is a killer, and she can not recognize him, so when the sheriff goes out, she sucks him and Randy escapes. During the run away from Sheriff and his fur, Randy was conveniently responsible for the murder of those who stumbles in the hideout of a cave gang. Randy to clean his name and bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rids Allon" can be a fun movie, especially if you're John Wayne Fan. But at the same time it has many errors which it is impossible to ignore. The film will be extremely dated, as you expect; We've shot a terrible camera that looks like everyone walks super-fast and the dialog is terrible. Actor is not too big, and Owen's character is very woody and he looks like other cast and wooden dolls, as well as someone who is handling (in this case it is the director of Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser has helm, and a good job is enough but the story is paper thin. Nobody can help, but it seems that almost ten minutes are missing since the beginning of the film because Randy has not come anywhere in salon and wants to meet someone. An explanation about why Randy was there, which might be something like him that he was a P.I who was sent to someone to investigate, someone trying to take someone to town. I really did not like it to be honest, most of the time I hope to finish the film. <br /> <br /> But saying that I did not think this movie was completely horrific. I enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite funny. But this is not really a great movie, and it's not really valuable to watch or track. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Allon" is a tired Western with incredibly dated and very few releases. It may be fun but overall it is not a great movie, and certainly one of Owen's weak eyes
