The third in the series surrounds Vigilant for the revenge of Paul Curse (Branson) to kill his old friend. I do not know why this movie has brought me, but anyway. I found myself rooting for Bronson to erase the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them I felt well. This movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it does? Firework Finlay has a good build-up that goes on to attack Branson. But as far as acting and plot goes, it just does not measure. If I were around that, I could get out as soon as possible, but it seems people are asking for trouble. I know that the mentality we have to save on our streets, but people here are limited. I had to give it a 4. 4. "Boom is far better" scene but that's about it. At that time, Brunson was 64. I'm sure that the lips really want to get their way with Branson, this film is a bronze, a Schwarzenegger Or Stallone. This movie gives you a sense of happiness, the common man can save the surrounding area to save the day. This is far from the original death wish, but if you look, if only to better separate figures shooting.
