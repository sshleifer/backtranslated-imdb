I can not believe that this terrible film was created by the same people who made Leopard Sela Lepo Gore. See that and skip this. The plot is muddled and the letters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I think the editor has gone halfway through the film because the quick, sticky cut starts to appear, which confuses things instead of just explaining them. <br /> <br /> It has originally created a promotional film so Saras can express sorrow for herself and could inspire America for the 1999 Natwar bombings. They do it by imposing a lie about the service. During WWII, our allies have wronged themselves against the claims of the whole world and ignored Slobodan Milosevich's alleged and everything, like fighting in three neighboring countries. They think of the intention of creating a political movie, but without a word, show a few seconds Milosvec on the TV screen. The nationalist program clearly showed no idea of ​​the industry that was not with the LPa cilera. Sorry, I have recommended this movie to the teacher when it was played at the Seattle International Film Festival last week. He quoted bad editing and misleading plots, and I apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned.
