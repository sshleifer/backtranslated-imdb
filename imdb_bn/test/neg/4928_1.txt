Just watched this movie in fantasy filmfirst Berlin. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is running. Very girls return from their Mexico vacation. While waiting for their baggage, they can know some boys, who are in the city's end and certainly have a wrong shuttle. Another older man on the board, so it is weirdly portrayed that you immediately guess that he is a bad guy. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle takes them to the industrial area and then does another job, some blood, some of the worst spent, some violence, mostly play with fear. Girls have heres and at the end of some ups and downs, some very new scare moments, everyone is dead but drivers and girls. Girls are sleeping with other girlfriends lover and admitted in some garages, where one of them dies. The other girl, which is sold by the conclusion, leftist kidnappers (yes, weirdo died) Some cargo boxes are in Asia (being the final picture of a freight port.) The first. The story Offensive tones, questions you ask yourself, are loose ends, and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but total disappointment. I do not see how many such casual losers have kidnapped dozens of women (such as the drive is indicated by the full drawer of the license ... aha) second. Acting Mediocre is its best. <br /> <br /> third. Scary Factor OK. But I'm excited by torture to do anything other than myself. Trade with humans can be a good reason for a horrific flick, but it is not used as one of the backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Fourth, music and sound. Some tried hard, but the possibilities of word of sound in industrial landscape, warehouse garage, and truck sound were not really explored. Song? It's worse without it, but apart from that. Moving the synth string theme for some mood of mind in the girls while reaching their ultimate destination. All right, I guess. Ray: Leave it!
