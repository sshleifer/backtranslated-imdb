Daft potboilers do not come much later than this, but it's a Douglas Sykber movie which makes everything right. Without this case it's not. Based on a sacred novel by the Holy Spiritual Lloyd C. Douglas (he wrote "The Rob"), and already in 1935 filmed with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it got more lift from a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In order to correct he took medicine, became a great eye surgeon and restored it. (No, it was not fairly difficult; he planned to be a doctor before being a violent player). Occasionally, they may fall in love. <br /> <br /> As long as I try, I can not face the criticism of the reptile social commentary and criticism of the American peer at the bottom of Syrac, (this one is not very deep). Plus Hodson is not half bad (I think I'm re-inventing him), and, of course, it looks great, (people live in room-sized rooms in Syrk's movies). None of his work in this film matches his best work, and even in sub-opera terms it is also the best TV of the day.
