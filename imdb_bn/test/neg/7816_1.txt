It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are so many things in the house which are not wrong, it's not too funny. This is an approved film that does not happen in normal life, but this film is not far behind any such theories. These people are in the house and no one has noticed the other, which seems to be coming everywhere, but the high owl is not mentioned in its cage. I could deal with an owl joke in the first few times, but after an hour I could not accept it, I would kill myself rather than seeing that great owl. I laugh during this movie? No Not even once? No Awesome, awesome, awesome The rubbish of Abner Kutcher has been closed and its pants picked up in front of everyone makes the image worse. But wait, the day is saved because sweat can fly upside down. Oh so beautiful However, I give this movie some credit, it is not as bad as an epic movie .....
