There is an underlying problem with comments or reviews such as a film. After disliking the Dogma, I feel the same way. If you do not like a movie weird and controversial like Movie Handland, you see "not getting it". Of course, for those who watched this movie you know that the whole point is not available. <br /> <br /> I have heard from different sources that the unique and favorite aspect of this movie is a dream - it's good quality. In other words, this plot is not like other movies. In the case of Mulholland Dr., it seems like a focus collage made by a third-grade boy who procrastinated till the last second of his industrial project. It does not understand, it is not supposed to be, but I know it can be a TV series. It seems that Lynch had an unnecessary film stack and decided to marsh it with a bunch of new stuff. You will notice increasing nudity, sex and dirty language towards the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rate: 10 Between 2
