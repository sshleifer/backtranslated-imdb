This movie starts the way to begin each movie, with Andy and / or Topless people walking around and roaming around the kids. Take a couple of them to shower. I love it so far! Unfortunately, we then meet or main characters. They are not particularly liked. Generally in these movies, actresses are not actually acting, they give very "normal" performance and they are quite sympathetic, funny and favorite. Not here. They have no personality and I do not care too much about them. <br /> <br /> Some girls travel to camping school. They stopped at a backwoods gas station and met a biking gang. Bike gang really should be dropped from the movie - it was before Chess, but now it's just simple fool. John Bower for Head Bike Halloween looks like a mid-aged guy dressed as Jovi. The girls have to go to the jungle and later the Bikar gang follows them. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's happening next to the hack. There is a bunch about the end of the world because it's the end of the millennium, then some bikers kill a mysterious Indian father who disappears. Nobody gets eaten by a chessy-lock monster thing as he swim across a lake. Some people in the stupid makeup are obviously a drude, and she will give some of the girls something for the last rains of the world. Or maybe the world may end, I'm afraid I'm not paying too much attention. At first she used to wear girls' clothes in women's underwear. <br /> <br /> It can be really fun Chess movie, but the bicker gang kind of destroys the atmosphere and the plot was so holesome that it was not even my grade J. Schlock hoped to live up. They should really remove half of the plot material and should focus only on one or two things. Instead it's everywhere. Overall, if you are looking late '80scall, I imagine you could make it worse. You have tried really hard. In the beginning there are lots of nudity, but letters are harmful and the plot is rarely unrecognizable, even at least bit satisfied.
