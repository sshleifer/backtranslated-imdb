Although abnormally in a second strings oat color, the lively clothes of lead ladies fail to bring a life in a flatly managed screenplay. The "plot" parrors move around young people in a straight-forward attempt, but a vengeance is determined to involve them in the former Pinkerton Man (seeing Fred Clark's chewing scene) and a female patrol in their bank robbery schemes. Or not As Cole Younger, Owen Morris is big and fierce enough but his "cool" demeanor and wooden acting skills damaged things. The quality of performance is not better than any episode of Gene Autri or Roy Rogers TV with Cort .45, it does not need to be reloaded and extraordinary shooting skills, which allow horse rider to shoot from the hip and injure a man at least 50 feet . Oh dear ...
