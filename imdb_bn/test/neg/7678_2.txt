This movie is sometimes scary, probably nothing more than the naked George Kennedy when he wants a little more sugar to his mandate. Fortunately, its nudity is covered by a blanket, but the picture is more awesome than anything else, for example, the list of Skinner's. <br /> <br /> The dialog was inspirational in this movie; It inspired me to see another movie. In one case, when a steward comment about male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's a 'cock' peat? <br /> <br /> And yes, some of it writes, in contrast, this picture is very Bad
