I was excited about the idea of ​​my favorite comic book hero in television ... and the final result was very frustrating. <br /> <br /> The only "amazing" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the wire). I thought Nick Hammond was not a Peter Parker ... and he was different in comparison to those who stunted the spider case. You can say they were two different actors. Guess, if I look at Tobi McGuay, I can spot the modern Spider-Man movies and when I see CGI. But that's a trained eye and work experience with CGI. Nevertheless, the 70s can be better even after the lack of special FX. <br /> <br /> The web was hockey and it looked like a rop, which kept wrapping around them instead of keeping the stick. And with him what a spider to travel around the mobile. Hello He is the web slinger man <br /> <br /> Sorry ... so it does not work, but our favorite wall crawler is well deserved.
