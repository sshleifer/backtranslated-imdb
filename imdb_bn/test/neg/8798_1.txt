Okay, before I come to it, go ahead and get out of the way with caution: this movie is a SLEAZE diverse "cinematic" definition! There is a movie that can be out-shocked or out-disested by a film that has more artistic legitimacy than the film's antithesis. So what makes it so lazy ?? Let's look at the "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ..... <br /> <br /> In 1974, virtually nothing was done to do, this is a real "plot" of a family rather than "roughie" Moscow kicks looking for a day when a skelet in a ski mask accosted by a dude and used to spend a day to illustrate what went on thighs. Being systematically murdered by the smooth kripa sex with each other. So those who deal with the concern are encouraged to see Somewhere else sensitive. Then add genuinely spiritual level or show absolute neutrality for the film making industry, the "girl" of the party goes away after having sex with her brother and finds a random black dancer (!). Tied with a tree branch ("... that fat group-bitch left me here for 3 days ...") with virtually no explanation !! She is living ... or what? Of course not !! They were caught before they fled, where our killer forced them to have sexual relations with them and when the mother was forced to die, everyone was told, and after the end, a dead black dancer (being courtesy of the chest by the chest) becomes. Then our slaughtered girl and mother forced to give oral sex when a woman goes to the mache ... and the movie suddenly disappears !!! Just like that! No warning, no tied up, loose up ..... it's just over. Now this film may end up properly (I do not know really), but I only saw the extremely crude alpha blue archive version. The end of their version seems completely finished or how it ends. If it was deliberate, in film making 101, I'm sure there are thumb rules for completing a movie, but it should not be done this way! Fans of "Psycho" should be glad to hear soundtrack music, because it is through the film! I'd like to be willing to bet any license or something was there. Also, although it is a "violent" film, there is not a large number of hell, so Gourhounds will not find any real use here. No violence is shown graphical ... only results (one of the hunters gets stabbed with a machete to the right of the vagina region). Also, sex is something of the UGLIEST sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie can effectively look at a ugly movie or some other person to act as an erotic porn, but those who tend to love lazy, ugly, and ugly things, but who are looking for enough violent enough to earn any real notoriety with them Not. For something really brutal like "barbarous holocaust" or other flicks. The only "infamous" thing about this steaming shield is that violence was added to an adult film, at that time a fairly new idea, especially when you consider pornographic, all the rugs and greenhouses that are filled with the 42nd streets of pornographic mavens The most pale group. It was not and it is not "mainstream" indecent. <br /> <br /> If you were in the film making film and there was a list of "No List" for filmmaking, then this film would be a brilliant example of that lesson! When the filmmakers challenge "budget" (in this case maybe $ 142 ... it seems!) And all those movies "donts" ignore them "yes", this image Bad !! One more thing: those who are offended by racial epithets are encouraged to see more. The black people of the film are constantly abusing their caste and the killer is probably racist, but in the early 70's there was no political purity. I'm not sure that a movie like this can be made today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it will not titillate someone "will not disappoint" or head to anyone else, but those who are freed from untouchability. Actually, I got bored. It is so difficult to see the sex is so ugly and hypocritical, and if you get it, then thank you God for the fast forward button! "Acting", if you want to call it, but there is no reason to care for any of the other among the amateur (the best means, it is also worse for porno!). If you want to see it, then download it, because if you buy it, you really feel like Hill. Some things are simply worthless that are ..... and "Wet Wildernes". The only thing unexpected to watch this movie is to watch the movie sit in a theater and look at others in appearances and suddenly feel insecure. Perhaps not the greatest collection of scholars and intellectuals in society. But if you get up for some stupid, yet sLEAZY porn trash, give it a crack. It's 54 minutes and still, it seems a lot more !! Cracked will love this! Then again, maybe there is something wrong with doing something like this ...... Cavity importer, sleaze-lovers !!
