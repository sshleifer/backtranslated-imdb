I do not have to go to another Tarantino movie again. The whole picture was in vain. My wife and I both regret that we could not get up and go out of the first hint that this film will actually happen (it is still difficult to determine because it was a ridiculous story ... blood, gull, and violence are the only Seems to be the real theme), but we were optimistic that something around the corner would be freed. Unfortunately, there was nothing that was sensual! We, many of the audience came out of the theater "which was hateful", "waste time", "I will go out", "Where was the comedy", "it was merciful", etc. It's actually ours, the audience, our hatred and we felt that we were completely leaked. The only thing in the film that was the costume and the ability to play almost all of the film's merit ... there was no qualification for them. I rated it 1 because there is no number 0. I just do not understand that anyone can give this rate to more than 0!
