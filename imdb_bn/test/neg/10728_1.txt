See Dick Job. <br /> <br /> Check out Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married <br /> <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The boy speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Hah ha <br /> <br /> Follow the Dick. <br /> <br /> CEO of Pope is a hypocrite. <Br / <br /> <br /> Please see Dick Poppus fall for CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane releases her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane <br /> <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane turned to crime <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the last credit. <br /> <br /> Ok, so you got the plot. Outside of this, Dick and Jane did the following from one scene. Connection with one last or the next one. The nature of the whole thing is terribly episodic. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey does not bother to bring his "A" ingredient, he is just brilliant and seems to be somewhat ashamed of the whole thing. But the hack, when you're paying $ 20 million plus, why bother. Tea Leoni is boring. I guess it would be terrible not to blame for this flop. <br /> <br /> There is a bit about Dick and Jane. Carrie and Lenny are not funny and have little chemistry. Script is not funny. And it's not well designed. <br /> <br /> But it can be larger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is probably very little. Perhaps it is not funny to lose their jobs in situations like humans, when there is no happy ending in real life.
