Scanning through comments, this movie does not show much love and it is not difficult to see why it is not so difficult. Now, by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in the post production I'll begin to end by saying, the product was hurt in many ways. With the purchase of the Lumis farm, the end of this film needs to be repeated and mixed with the mysterious "Man in Black" seems to be the double twist in the end, and I do not want to say Johnny Cash. <Br> <br /> Now the story. The fifth film, rather helplessly with Black Mirror, escaped from prison with the mysterious man. It comes out (eigh) that this man knows the origin of Michael's temple and Dr. Dr. Lumiss's colleague too. They kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played Daniel Harris in the 4 and 5 episodes but JC Brandy played here). Jamie, pregnant, Dr. Winn fled from the Layer and so Michael followed him and killed him. But he had a baby, so now he has to track the child so that he can kill his big nephew. <br /> <br /> We heard some ridiculous interpretations of Mitchell's temple with Guilic's disciplinary and mysterious symbols. A radio show was broadcasted from the city of Micilil's house, which defeats Maihil more desperate victims. <br /> <br /> Like the movie, this review is unclear, confusing and stupid <br /> The poor plot, the running effect, the call slasher to kill with some good runs, but the lack of serious motivation. Everything that was supposed to explain, raises a few new questions, makes parts 4 and 5 uninhibited, and a great actor in Plasensan was a bad way to end his life and career.
