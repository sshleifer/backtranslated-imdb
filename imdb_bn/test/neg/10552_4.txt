The best characters here were beautiful actors and actresses, plus it was a famous band and some famous dancers ... yet the film did not work. This time was almost, I was bored of death. The dialogue was stupid, humorous (mainly Milton Barel's) was cruel, and the music was not on my lattice. <br /> <br /> I have never been a big band fan, and if I hear "in mood" I'll blow once more. <br /> <br /> This was my first appearance on the famous skater-actor Sonja Haney and there is no complaint about me. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, it's so date that it is no longer fun. Barlow, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Scatleton, Abbott and Costello etc. were fun for the crowd in the 40's and 50's but humor changed, and today's funny thing was not.
