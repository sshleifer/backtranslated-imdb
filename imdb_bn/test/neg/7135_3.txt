I will not deny the Japanese horror films I enjoyed so much fun, but seeing the same thing you all will be very annoyed with them. <br /> <br /> Following the picture, the animosity Audrey, requesting his mother, is going to get her sister back. But when she arrives, her sister may have something strange and her sister dies. He wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (Ison) joins him. On the other hand, there are things happening to the three daughters along with the family, but they seem to be too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I can not see the points for the three girls, as they appear in the international schools, they are not related to the story. For the reason that women are holding anger, killing people is still not clear (I think they are just saying the same thing I have seen). And the sudden appearance of Odd in front of the boy is undoubtedly weird, which I think is an effort to make the story related to the family. Assassination scenes are a mix of rump and Shibya Kaidans. Acting should be another bad point. As a Hong Kong I really want to support the first attempt of Hollywood's Edison Chen, but as a film lover, I can not find any point to really support bad acting. Other actors like Baba, although he was present in some scenes, he could also do good work. The film's atmosphere is good, especially when I saw it in the middle of the night alone. <br /> <br /> If you have the time, really enjoy a horror movie and see all the potential horror movies. Without this, like me, you can go to kill some time. But if you really like these horror movies, you have to spend some time watching the Japanese version of the ring.
