I am not going to comment on any part of this movie since this comment has already been established. However, seeing this with my friends, when we all laugh loudly, when Lead girl made the Shellell Hack reference then on the phone. The writer tried to find out the reason for mixing him. We can only assume that once he was settling a Charlie's Angels. Based on this reference, we think that this film must have been executed in Charlie's Angels in 1979 or 1980, but it was made about what I read here in 1987. You can not tell from the poor production standards. It seems that it was made for a film class by a college student. And by no means do I hope the low-budget trash festivities are politically correct, the red chicks in this movie like to point out insulting gay comments to each other. Yet I still rank it as the second second horror movie, the second is only "nail song genocide"
