When I went to the movie rental store to see the movie I saw it and I immediately thought it would be fun. The image seems to be a classic comedy type which involves teenagers (such as road trips) that I found valuable. When I was walking, I became frustrated because the jokes were awful and fascinating. The director might think that the only bit visitors were wet floors. This is not a joke and does not let people laugh. I actually consider turning off halfway through this picture coming through. I was annoyed with this movie because it was only a waste of time and it meant paying rent. There was not enough time to take care of this film and not enough work to take. I found acting is quite bad as well. I laughed, I laughed, I laughed! I rated this film 1/10. I hope you found this comment useful.
