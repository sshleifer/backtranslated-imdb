I went to Cork, Ireland here this three nights earlier. It was the premiere of the world, as part of the Kirk Film Festival, in the small movie at Trishal Arts Center. <br /> <br /> I found "strange results" as an extraordinary movie. It's a bit rough around the edge, but a low budget movie that will be expected! Actually acting (especially from the main seat Kent Folkcon) is amazing, cinematography and direction are excellent, and the script is a great entertainment and some excellent set-up and thoughtful dialogue with the scripts. <br /> <br /> The end of the sudden came to an end suddenly, if no conclusion was given to the conclusion of the character and the incident, it finally ended ... but perhaps that was for the movie makers? It certainly did not make the movie more uncertain. The main character was never understood on the screen with his mother: I liked it to be surprised that he would never do it, as in these real life sometimes these things are never settled. It was a good choice, it emotionally left it officially instead of being wrapped! <br /> <br /> "Strange Facts" will be tangled throughout life and in this case the author / director Kyle Schickner will be released next. She and her colleagues - valuable to see a talent. <br /> <br /> I hope "weird fruits" will soon be released to a larger, because more people are eligible to see this movie, some of the original-real thriller original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's deep south. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
