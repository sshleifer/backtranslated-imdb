TANDEM Japanese pink style is an odd place-it has the necessary sexual scenes and harmful tone that is essential for such films, but it also spreads in an odd drama / dark-comedy story that looks like it. D has been suitable for various types of films. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with two people in a restaurant-each night and night of the previous sex competition. One is groping a mutual subway, the other is a pretty typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. Start talking after seeing two sponsors and giving a second cigarette loan. They hang for an evening and talk about their respective sex life. The film is inter-cut in the flashback scene of both man's interaction with the central women in their life. Two men have fallen and the film ended in a strange but expected note ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do with the doodem. It comes in the form of anti-friend-film type of a soft-core, strange couple, but does not find the subject matter in a satisfying degree. These kinds of films often do not have very much extreme nervousness - so I do not understand what I actually understand. I do not say much because the film can be fun, depressed, or both. I think Tandem may have some potential as a more serious dramatic film with a dark-comedy edge- but as a soft-core sex film that tries to be 'smart' for itself - it just does not work. I can not say hate this one- but can not say there is something remarkable about it. 4/10
