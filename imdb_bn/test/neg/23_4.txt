When people say that children are annoying, I think my younger cousins ​​may be annoying and I said a little. These children are turning 10 and without any doubt one of the most annoying bratty children they will ever encounter (a film). Let's start with blonde - Debbie - She is a girl a whore, I mean she comes to wear mini skirt, she has a freckley red rabbit like stupid frizzy blonde hair and face. He works so innocent. Later our second child was born - Guy - who thinks he is very cool, his long range shooting and using a cylinder (a coat on the gun) and all his bad bratish smiles The next child is silent, for which you have no difference, all of that on him. This film provoked me angry about the children's intelligence and was the only enjoyment to get disturbed by my only cousin.
