Unsupported movie. There is nothing but a complete waste and nothing I expect it to be. Packaging makes it feel as American pie genre (not it). Rather it is a humorous string that simultaneously feels like writing exercises. (Try to see how many mixtures we can write that should be a bad SNL skit in the presentation of a full-length feature). What's so extraordinary is that the director (according to his comments on DVD) fully accepts himself. I have become a huge fan of these films that National Lamphun joins its name with One WIlder. With this one, I feel completely deceived. Actually, I'm suffering. I was expecting Van Winner to revive my college days but instead of one and a half hour of rubbish was served. What is the ultimate expectation of my leadership? Well, for beginners, all the covers on the DVD are cast nude (an extraordinary sausage covered, which must be covered). In which case the images of the description along with the incident and you mislead the person thinking that this is not a film that is not it. To make matters even worse, the film begins as one half of the naked drunk college students may also try to stunt the photo, but eventually there is nothing to do with this film. Actually, I did not even realize that the people of the early sequence where the film's character should not have been until I told the audience in this speech. Do not make me wrong, I love plot twists and are surprised to see movies, but I hate the hatred that this movie is not something that it is not. Finally, it is itself a huge helpless (artist, though not financially) because it sets the audience confusion and frustration because it ignores it for advertising. <br /> <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you watch in this case. This is not your usual national lampon movie. The only interesting thing about this is that most actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their comedy entertaining here.
