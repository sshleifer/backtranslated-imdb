This whole movie is so terrible that it is a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can not believe anyone sitting and writing about it and it seems that it will make a good movie! The acting is probably the worst ever made out of any B movie. I have seen many Saifai type B-movies before and some of them are really good, some of them - but should never be made from Friday. <br /> <br /> Some movie makers think that they put together something and they got it on the roof of a movie store, they did something that is good and it should be seen by the people. This is not always true, and it is definitely not true since Friday. This film loses all accounts: terrible acting, fool plot, very poor special effects, best dress, non-realistic dialogue, bad side etc. You can only tell this movie that it only takes 20 dollars to build it, and I can give it a lot of credit! I request you to stay away from this train debris of a film for your own good!
