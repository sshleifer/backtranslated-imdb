I wanted to like this movie, but it's very less about liking it. According to the public of IMDB, it is one of the best films of all time, starting with a Randy Newman song from Normann Leer's Cold Turkey memorable, Gene Stapleton and Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I guess). So far everything is right. Michael Jackson's idea of ​​living in the Pansy Milbank Motors of the Earth? Well, give it a chance, it is supposed to be a comedy. OK, so far, so good. But Michael does something that an angel never gets, and it completely affects the credibility of a movie. Other characters of the movie do not have too much appeal. Michael brings back a dog's life, and we are supposed to be afraid of that. People make up the corny country songs. In the end, Stapleton dances with Travoltor. Big deal She was smart, she would not even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought, "G, what stupid, tasteless, annoying, curly, sacred movie!" It is not suitable for kids or anyone to see them.
