If you take the original Fred Aulna Roy movie and enjoy the fun, then what will it be to you? Or on the contrary, it's like a Uwell Bowl movie, but with as much incompatibility. A young Nubail Chain Gang convicted (C. C. Kustin) agreed to suppress a plan Marshall to stop the mismanagement of Kim Dawson's plan ... Everyone is sexually explicit (the scary challenge is sexual) to others. Anyone who went to search for serious science fiction in this movie got it well, which you deserve for not doing homework in the film. The first time Kim Dawson had played a star other than the soft-core Skinmax level nuts. Before you go to hospital, think about something else that you expect to see, restart it for Costgin and see it as a manager. Do not make a mistake for a space / action / soft-core / titillation flick, this movie is not good yet, but if you expect anything from the "communication" line, then I will not be sorry for you. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Star-on-demand (available until December 8, 2005)
