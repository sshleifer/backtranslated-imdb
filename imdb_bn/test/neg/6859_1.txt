I have been watching "LOST" with my family from the first episode, it used to be great. It was very disappointing last season, it seems they do not know what to do with the show (writer), so they take a whole episode of the story line and try to create it for it. The current season, which I just tried to see Rodrigo Santoro, and with a little hope that would be a little better; Another disappointment has happened; My husband and son also saw me off. After all, he (Santoro) only attended for 30 seconds of each episode. But the real problem is with the line of the story, in fact nothing is happening, each episode can be displayed in 15 minutes. We wait for something that does not happen in each episode; I'm not asking that each secret mystery will be published at once, but how about some changes in the story line? In the first and second seasons, we had lines of different stories, we saw character history, a little step, a little romance, now it's like a big event, the whole episode is unveiled. It's almost tedious to watch, when it's over you feel that you've lost your time. Now, it is certainly important that actors are still cool. I can not believe they are Mr. Echo (Adelwalli) has done great, Jack (Matthew Fox) is still incredible, perfect hero, so kind, gentle, brave. Swar (Josh Holley), "Bad Boy" is gentle because of Kate (Ivan Lynne), but it's cool. I miss Said (New Andrews), Sun and Jean (Yun-Jean Kim and Daniel Die Kim), they all are important (or should be) of the plot, but we only see them. I hope Paolo (Rodrigo Santoro) will have a bigger part in the show; If not, why do you join her in a big deal of shows (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry, if I have been rumbling for too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started to see it was fantastic, I used it, and it is very frustrating to see how it's going. I'm here, waiting for progress !!! Katia
