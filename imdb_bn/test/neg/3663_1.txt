Not the best movie in the world ???? That was an understatement. I personally did not like all of this movie. Due to graphic violence and nudity, storyline is not due to line. Nudity really did not need it, nothing was done for the story, it probably did not have to spend a rough time with the girls, and possibly being nude probably made them worse. But one of the movies I hated was ... it was very dark. You can not really do what's going on. I think if it is not dark, and you can see where they were, then it might not be so bad. All you know is that its a place somewhere. You see no house, no road, killer in it, you can see almost half its mouth for about 5 seconds. I would like to see some stuff in a movie. After 20 minutes it becomes quite annoying and a flashlight or wall that you can see occasionally. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that was good about the movie, probably the sensation in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but there is no doubt about whether the film will end, but its mystery .. I can see something in this movie but some of the nude bodies and flashing lights are light. But honestly people, this saw Blair Witch's project met wannabe. Both are both top notch movies, and both with the correct lighting to think of what is happening. If you can see, then forget this movie .. If your blind person .. you want to rent to listen to screaming like this. But again if you are blind, you probably do not read this .. So anyway ... bad movie !!!!
