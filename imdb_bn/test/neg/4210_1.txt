Save some very first Norris, there is nothing to offer "Breaker, Breaker" which can not be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A kind effort to create movies, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Despite this, I saw it, the fast forward button was thumbed because the acting was so awful that it was ridiculous. Of course, the film is considered to be an action / drama but a book is not about making a movie. Everything that could be wrong with the film is on this "dog" screen. If you happen to come across it, give it a peek. It's very bad, it's fun.
