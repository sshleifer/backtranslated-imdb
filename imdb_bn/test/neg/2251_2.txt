I'm sorry, but I want to say that everybody I do not understand the horrific feeling of seeing this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw this, I looked at my watch and saw how long it would take. It was spent with this kindergarten nonsense. <br /> <br /> So why this verdict? <br /> <br /> Firstly, the movie tells a story that does not give any excitement! It's not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino that we used to know. This story may come from the heads of every small child. There is nothing intelligent about it, nothing is inventive and it's not going for hours ... The story contains about 30 minutes worth of content. Just a wildly improved scene that is supposed to leave a slightly cooler picture of the rest does not work. Even before the cutbacks shown that Tarantino often uses confusion and is not cold in any way. <br /> Second: Some people go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Hello really What are they There were a number of people who killed the Nazis only, one of them was far better than death rather than betraying his partner. Tarantino wanted to give this ugly face? Is a brave more brave than "bastard"? Of course -> What happens to the failed and horrible Nazi-Basterds Basterds? They all kill by the Nazis, who take the two prisoners -> Wow, what terrible revenge monsters they are ... <br /> <br /> Third: Which characters? Yes one! The only role for the whole film and the only character of the hope is that of Chittoff Waltz, who is making a deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely played out by Waltz. Pitt has never seen such a weak performance ... and the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen before and will not see them later. When the movie began and I saw seven Bastards teams, I would like to see something like "great seven": a group of extraordinary people, with each individual character, making their fate unusable and intelligent ... I was very frustrated when I "inglourious Basterds" saw. There is no description, no characters, no real men, just do not remember some random boys who did not allow themselves to be separated ... but in reality you do not even need confusion, because "shocking basters" do not play any role in this film except Pitt ... <br /> <br /> I was really frustrated, and this movie is always the only one to see # 40 of the greatest film of all time. Isaya. Leave me with my mouth open ...
