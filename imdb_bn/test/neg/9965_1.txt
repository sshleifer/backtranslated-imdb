This has got to be the most terrible piece of deity in movie crap I have ever seen. It makes the Mel Brooks movie Oscar-worthy comparison. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people will say that this movie is a genuine "Texas Texas genocide" in the style of the lower budget of the classics. "Or" Living Dead of Night ", is not on the question of production value, it is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a possible story line, Welding is helpless, for Charlie's role, she chose the first actor with a beard and long hair, and the actor's hair Half of the back did not come down (Mason had never followed his shoulder), this actor was a part of a personality So terribly uncomfortable that Steve Railsacab or even Jeremy Davis illustrated the image of the man. The selected actor played the hair of curly hair instead of the dark hair, but it is actually the one who showed the most distant interest in the Mansion case. "Like the Minnesota look like a farmer, playing Susan Atkins, the actress is much more than Oprah Although there are family members who know that "Clems" was considered a bit annoying, the actor portrayed him, such as a camp, Chaplinesque means it was like watching an old Vudevile law. + Sharon's pat instead looks like a beautiful pregnant woman, The actress looked like rash, alcoholic trailer trash. VanBebber has not proven far enough in this technique "Munsters" yet still up to photo motion in some places for artistic effect. The last credit list lists all known family members, but we are never known to most of them and we are sometimes not sure with those we know. <br /> <br /> Events have also been destroyed in this movie. "Lotuspopa" did not die in the real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abigail Folzar was not trapped in the trap, where was Murine Brunner and Bruce Davis at the time of Himen Murder? Patricia Crenwick never played the "Dothothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most terrible aspect of this movie was to "fix" the modern day with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo? What was the problem with the journalists? What was the meaning or purpose of the final conflict? Why were they included, while? The visitors never know! <br /> <br /> Holy McCray, I could go but the place prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this trash because your hands will be very busy again and again when you say "what are you?"
