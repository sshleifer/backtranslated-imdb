OK, when I was young (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) Barney was one of my favorite shows. I grew up with him and threw my old barn tapes. So one day I am moving through the channel, I see that Barney now falls into a cab, and I thought, "Um, this is the proper ceremony?" Once I realized, I was afraid. Why do they change the settings of a CABOOSE show from a school? Still, the show was absolutely terrible, and the only reason I'm giving it a 2) is because of the reason I'm good, b) Reef, and c) because the show at the old time was endangered. Now I just hate it. Hate it <br /> <br /> 2/10
