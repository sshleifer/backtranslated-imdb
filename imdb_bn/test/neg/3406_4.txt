I'm not saying all of my life has lived in Louisville, Kentucky. I grew up to Â½ mile from Weaveri. At the winter we will have to cross Dixie Highway to pull our sleds down the road to Maryman and go to the sleigh on Waverly Hill. During the winter of 76-77, we will climb the tunnel to heat ourselves. The place was still running as a "GERTURAL CENTER". We'll go through the tunnel on the hill which we thought was a "morgue door". I have to be honest. The only feeling we feel is that we are going away with something that we should not do. I want to say that over 50 times in the winter, we got the tunnel up. There has never been anything stupid acting than a teenage boy. I love the fact that after all these years have received attention. One evening when I was young, we looked at the porch in front of us and saw the whole mountain was burnt down in the fire. There was an old hospital burnt to the mountain. He was burned for hours and sitting outside the house. The thing about the Weaveri missing is that many people live in TB. Let's face it ?? The doctors then decided everything that they thought was right for man to save. People have a lot of pain in order to know how infectious TB was. Is focused on those who are too much damaged. I traveled to the building in the early 70's. We will visit the shut-in nursing home through the Youth Group of the Church. However, the film did not have a prison like a steel door with a chain and padlock. They were wooden and open? Sometimes too open. It smelled urine and palms and you saw occasionally open gowns related to dementia patients. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. Many of these building's age or right people have not been paid. These are all after Kentucky. The most part of the document I left is the body shield in a cart. If you are not mistaken, it looks like Holocaust footage has happened. That has been added for the dramatic effect. In my mouth for filmmaker it leaves me with a yeast taste. I am a skeptical when it comes to "Scratch". I believe that many people around here really think this place is frustrating. Although for me Weverly symbolizes a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled though.
