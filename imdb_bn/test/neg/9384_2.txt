Talk about strange. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl in the fugitive abductor later, you have fun, but only if you like these things. I did not think, from Frank, this episode was scary. Thankfully, this is one of the few Duff episodes of Season 3 and only one of the Charles Grant Craig episodes, so you will not get much more of this type of season. So, overall judgment? Just read the summary at the top. This is a powerful rival (say hello hi hi!) For the worst part of the 3th episode. Although to be honest, I was not really expecting much. I hope I can do this episode Obuliate together. It's a thing they got right: Title.
