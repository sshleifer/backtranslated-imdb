I thought that this movie might be a good fool, or at least a good independent comedy. Instead it was like some of the high school ones would create with their parents camcorder. This is not just a budget that makes this movie a bad one (many big films have been made in a low budget), it's just a bad movie and it's not bad enough to be good camp. Case on Point: Nothing happens for the first ten minutes of the movie, sitting on the smoking dip in their home, three main characters keep their makeup and then answer a phone call. You keep waiting for something to get moving in the story, but it does not come. The word was so bad that the way the TV is saying is often done (it was not interesting anyway). If I rent a movie, I would usually get worse through it even if it was bad, but could even sit in 20 minutes. I think beforehand the man felt the same because they did not return the tape and left the same place. The only reason I got a score of 1 is because there is no negative number of rating system.
