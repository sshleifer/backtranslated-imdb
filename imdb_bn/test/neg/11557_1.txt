I think I can say safely (not really removing anything), there was no robot in this movie. The "Robot" clothing does not work as the boys do or speak, and the evil thing behind the "plots" is not a robot. <br /> <br /> It looks like shooting a whole thing somewhere in a city park, the director needs a custom set when excluding the background. I can not even use words to describe acting ... <br /> <br /> It could not even offer the ridiculous end of "Star Crystal". In short, it's one of the worst movies of the 80s and I'd be brave to say "all time".
