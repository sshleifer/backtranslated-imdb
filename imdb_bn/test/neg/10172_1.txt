The big trunk that I have seen this movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is notified as a scientist when it is actually nothing more than a Christian filling equipment. <br /> <br /> It would betray you to get them to hear their sales pitch, while the Christian church says quite a bit about the state. But then again what do you expect from an organization that will go through such a large length to help protect a large number of children of this organization. <br /> <br /> Religion is nothing but disloyalty, hypocrites, and war mongers. Let's not forget, our rebel former President really came out and "God told him" to attack Iraq. No one was listening or heard anything? However, here's the topic going on. This film has nothing to do with UFO, it is not much more than a religious production.
