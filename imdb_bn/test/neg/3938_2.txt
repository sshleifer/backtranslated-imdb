Good idea .... shame about the real movie. It likes to be a little more scary, and explains more about the characters, and who is that bad woman? If he tortures children, why do not they help him kill and kill others? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, the end! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What happened to the character of Frankie Munit? He should be safe in the wild rose bed, but the computer game shows him as a game, ie dead. The next thing he came up with the annoying blonde grass, the man who was able to rescue the fearful man, I noticed, when the giant lady was behind him, there was no curiosity about light flashes! <br /> <br /> Many inconsistencies in this movie really enjoy it, however, you can think twice about playing a new computer game!
