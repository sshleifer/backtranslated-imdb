Seeing these reviews and seeing these high ratings, I think that the amount of red gem syrup amounted to a lot of brain-related images. This movie was passed in vain. All of the clich√© is a slasher film without any material. I'm sure I can find out more about the movie but why are you disturbed when you can add it? Obviously everyone wants Mandy Lane and she apparently does not want anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He started one of their searches. Do you think so far? But this film spread out of faith when you found out that only his dead friend is not a killer but he is also good .. The plan was ridiculous. Kill all our friends together and then kill each other. They wanted to do this work and because of Mandy Lane's "Give to Juices" demand, they do not give any reason that they make these characters sharpen your head even more than what they motivate them to do. It is tragic. There was a lot of potential in this movie but the directors or writers could not possibly relate to the audience.
