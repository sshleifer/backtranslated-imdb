Yet another cookie film is about a rigid adult who meets an adorable, street smart child (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And again, it's not fun or funny, to see anyone - kids or adults. I'm sure some people can make this movie fun, but I have no worldly idea. Again, I'm sorry for the poor kids who forced me to work in this movie so that everyone else and their parents could earn some money on a cheesy cheesy movie price.
