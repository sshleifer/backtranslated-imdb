I went to the expected movie to see a great film based on all the sounds and awesome reviews of the face. At the beginning of the opening sequence, I knew I was in trouble. Music and credit was trying so hard to utter the emotion I wanted to mute. I got clich√©d characters from this film, spoken conversations and an irrational script. The director / writer Paul Haggiss received great reviews with his impressive, self-righteous writings, but it does not fool me. Some performance was good. Don Cheadle is always the best. I think it was a little less than Terrence Howard, but he was honest. Sunny nose was the very way. She should be rapping stick. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito So what ever has no impression. I do not find anything interesting about her. Sandra Calf is always the same in every film, he is all right. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Phillip was good. But as far as the script and lousy guidelines - this is actually the movie that's so annoying bad I actually took time to write about it. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, waste time
