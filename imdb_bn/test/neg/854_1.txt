Technically, this film was all about: a decent actor, a beautiful landscape, a clear sight of the budget lack, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. Plots of plot are also committed, ridiculous bureaucrats and ridicule on the general public. <br /> <br /> But it is never distributed. The plot is simply too irrational. Throughout the whole film, one person is not a single intelligent thing. Crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, dead villagers of the brain - far away from each other's incredible situation. They do not understand what they understand in a context outside the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a movie should be irrational and exaggerated. However, at least one city should have at least one example to indicate the craziness behind splitting. In fact, there are at least two attempts that unfortunately fail: the main character, who does not seem to be clear about what is happening to him and the "writer", which is sometimes considered funny by the 12-year-old audience . <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I have seen several bad "funny" films, but each of them has at least 2 or 3 well sunny. So in this sense, "pond" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, see "Brazil". Do not waste your time in the "pond"
