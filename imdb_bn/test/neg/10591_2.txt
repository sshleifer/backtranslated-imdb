It was my bad luck in the BBC last night, I hope I can be the only spectator. From the beginning, there was some misconception about the film, for a few minutes after watching it, I learned how to work. The movie was bad! Not as bad as wellpack or a sigal film, only old completely bad. <br /> <br /> Why was it made in a movie? I saw a few episodes of TV series and it seems to be ok, but I've seen it repeat because they created it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It seems to me in some way, that Farina has mentioned that the squad will not be able to keep the regular police in the model. Being a 'place' is a 'club', to be one of the toughest places, maybe it was the student night? I lost the look of plot at this time or there was no plot, and the film was cut from different TV series remixes with different symptoms. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I do not remember any laugh <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole scene of this movie is the lack of ability to steal the bad guys like Seema Hoffman. Ribi with her was bounce off someone.
