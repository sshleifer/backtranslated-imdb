This movie has the look and feel of many "fresh" directors (closeup and focus on the feelings felt by the actors). The point of the film was presented from many angles and released well by relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "Believe in Jesus Christ and Mormon Church" Oh, and if you have read or heard something against the teachings of the Prophet, then it can go away. (Fuel for hate)
