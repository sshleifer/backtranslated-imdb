If you do not read the best version of the Tokyo; Sometimes prepare yourself for the best movie experience! But if you ... after reading books several times, for many years, I have come to love letters and stories and think that I know it deeply. I have my own personal views about Shayar, Habitat and Character Gallery. So the movie was disappointing for me. Why? It displays the presence of characters (inevitably), it changes events, it removes the important story, it does not remove such important stories. What a great part of what the Lord of the ring makes, it is simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 can not judge the imagination of Tokyoian (and your own). Peter Jackson made an honest effort impossible, and I do not think anyone else could do it well! But in the end, I'm sorry to see the film. The next time I read the Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision is not my own, but it will move forward.
