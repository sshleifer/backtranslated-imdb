An American family lives in an isolated house and comes to the countryside of Spain. Regina (Ana Pauquin), a teenage girl in Mark (Yan Glen), is ill and has some mental problems and Nurse Maria (Lena Olin) wrote that strange things are happening in the house and her younger brother Paul (Stefan Enquist), but her mother believes in him No Regi decided to investigate the invention of his boyfriend Carlos (Fei Martinez) 's house, and they were six years before the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask his grandfather Albert (Ziancarlo Giaynani) for help in protecting his home and his father. <br /> <br /> I expected this DVD to be a good movie of the Hunted House. Ana bird's name, Lena Olin, Fei Martinez ("Thesis" and "Abray Lose Ozos") and Ziancarlo Zaynani In addition, I like very Spanish movies. Despite this, I found a terrible screenplay, a terrible aspect and an awesome performance of excellent actors and actors. The purpose of the story is to remember "The Shining" in a little while, but unfortunately, it is very poorly developed, never cleaned, for example, the American family moved to Spain and the causes and intentions of intimidating relations between the members, why the situation in the family, mainly Maria and angry The direction is confused, unfortunately dark and shadows try to influence the horror of the story. I love Anna Pauquin, but her expressionless face never works in this glow. Lane Olin She is a fairy of actress great actress; And Stefan Enquis is very weak for the important role. Only Ft Mart√≠nez has a good performance among his supporter's character. I like the story ended open. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Seetima Vitaima" ("Seventh Hunting")
