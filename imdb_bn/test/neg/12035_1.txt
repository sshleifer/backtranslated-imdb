This movie made me so angry !! Here I am thinking that here is a new horror film, a w / intelligence and then the movie begins. Scenery, line delivery, dress, fake Gore, what do I have to go? There is porn movie out with better dialogue than this. I have understood the concept behind Indi, but my goodness, it is not Indi. It is a high school book shot shot / camcoder and cast all friends and relatives. It is 1 movie which is destroyed from its start. Maybe it could fly the movie instead of the new millennium in 1982. But I think someone has hung a rock around this elbotus neck and it's drowning at a slow speed.
