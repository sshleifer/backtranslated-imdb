Following the success of Star Wars, the interest in the Sci-Fi movie was expanded. It was one of the cheapest attempts to cash money fast. <br /> <br /> A group of live-steep dinosaurs living in a spaceship of a planet where half of them are systematically killed (man dinosaurs). Acting in porn-movie level. Cheap effects, even for special times, seem to have made many efforts. <br /> <br /> Wearing a style like a hairstyle was 1970. Ah, 70's. I hope that a disco may be released at any moment. <br /> <br /> This picture does not really need any recommendations.
