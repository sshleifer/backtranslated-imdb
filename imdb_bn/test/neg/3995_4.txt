The Italian horror Dario Argono is said to be a lot of bad things by master-fans. And backlash is absolutely worthwhile. In fact, every time I heard something bad about Argentina - I think they are talking about Michelle Sovi. He did not get the same attention because his films did not succeed in the theater. In fact, his best film - 1994's Cemetery Man - was probably his lowest success. Or he did not get the attention, he felt his ability, because after that he left the film and went on to the television. He has never gone back. So people really do not know how bad their other films are, because they saw them, they are already fans of Italian horror aesthetics. Which means that you have often made a poor sense and usually take very unreasonable movies. This is where the church stands from the pack. Because apparently, it is very cheap and looking ancient, you can smell the dust. But it's his charms too, though they're a few. Cameras are actually being arrested and music scores are very broad and grand. <br /> <br /> Since the people of Argentina saw the work of Sovi, nobody is known to anyone before the Susparia of Argentina. And deep red Sovi a bit of a hack. The most common example of a style choice on the substance of Italian mike garris. Church errors are constant and abundant. The film is open with some interesting temptations, which shows the knights in the white horses charged by the white peasants who are seen in the adaptation of any Robin Hood in the long ago century. These scenes are intense enough, energetic, and get to the point fast. Then, we cut the current, where the film's style takes. Yes, look at the movie is OK. And now for about 35 or so minutes, wherever in Italy-Italy, the film is very interesting to reach out to the poisonous elements that are slowly appearing to us. So now we know that the purpose of the film is to create its horror. And it's a decent build up, for the most part. But the movie reaches half point, we can understand the film's driving, and ... nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, book catalogs and others work as a restorer of the wall artwork of another, discovering a scroll / scripture that man thinks he will lead to any kind of graveyard or invaluable artifact which he can sell and get rich. So he simply followed his map which can unleash a power under the church, which he halusinet him, when he gradually becomes a monster who will be able to hallucinate to others. So when he is doing his demon work, he killed himself in such a way that everyone in the church would be trapped, when the 'congenene' of the giants spread to everyone, who would leave a black preacher and little girl, church church every night to go to church only 2 people who crossed the wall of the church Can plug off the extension. Perhaps it is more neutral than action-packed and Soviet style Argentina. But I've never seen this annoying annoying movie as a mythological movie. I'm not joking with you. Nothing happens in the whole picture! I have seen movies (or printers, I have a film super grade) before, but most of them are actually happening (for John Horner's Halloween). <br /> <br /> It follows closely at Lambertto Bava's footsteps of the demo movie (from Co-produced by Argentine). We have shown in a place where a group of people are gathered, becomes a monster, the other isolate each other, that person transits everyone except the survivor, then the wicked spirits are infected or survived from the world. Scratch dead when out. This image puts all the same elements. In addition, unlike Argentine's work, nothing will happen. OK, something will happen. But there is only a malicious sequence Lamberto's more fun fun demo movie. Rips from the neck floor to a random woman's neck, she is impaled by a giant using a part of the fence. What is malicious about that, you wonder? It happens in front of almost two dozen people. What do they do There is nothing. She died, trickles blood in her head closeup. But these people do not even notice, even though it happens in general and 8 feet away from them. Maybe 4 people pushed him because he noticed that someone ran a run up race, so they duck from the path. He died and died after the shot, everyone just has to sit near, calm when a boy plays a saxophone. I'm not joking with you. That's what happens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are all right and so on Forget about it. And this 15-second thing is the only one that happens in the movie. I'm not saying this is the only violence, violence, or murder. It's not just the only thing that we can say is happening. For example, in a scene, a beautiful woman herself looks at herself a mirror and feels old and ugly. She starts clawing the skin off the face, but when she reappears in the minute after- no scratches People are seized by fish and their mouths are squashed by the subway vehicle. But later on, they became a totally unaccountable member of the whole community of believers, which was shot to the shot by Roman Polanski's 1968 artist Rasmarin's Baby, and the famous scene was copied. Even if Argentina did it, I would be angry!
