Haha - Oh no - what about this picture? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does it start? Many good things have already been told - so I will not be publishing in the same area. I believe you already have a movie summary - so I will not portray the movie. <br /> <br /> At first - start well. <br /> <br /> 1) If you think that the mental thrillers think of you (as I do), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - a movie that you describe as a child that you have spoken in a long car from an early age. (If you want to choose a family member, someone else will die, or if you die or die in the fire) This movie is a great idea - the bottom line <br /> <br /> 2) The garment group has done a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Actually though it is difficult to implement? ..... OK, that's all about for good. Let's talk about the bad. <br /> <br /> 1) This movie looks like a two-hour "Twilight Zone" episode. It can easily be 90 minutes. That movie can be tolerable. <br /> <br /> 2) Do you think "Dus Til Don from?". The movie became interesting, then it came in a deteriorating way through half the film? Yes - the same thing here. The authors asked to start with an idea, I did not know what to do with them. I got the deep thoughts revival of Transformer 2. <br /> <br /> 3) Yes - we got hesitation in the film. We have realized philosophical consciousness and practical attitude - but the story went a long way, not over the pressure of the current story, and one (excusing me) completely leads to a humiliating direction. <br /> <br /> 4) Not the last knowledge definitely no. Someone <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie will create a great term paper at 101 o'clock in the philosophy of college. If you fall from your mind to bed, are sick in bed, or have ever liked to face Pai, and can see this free online line - all the way, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you want to give something to watch this movie do not waste your time - you're good to see old Howie Mandel stand you tube up. You will find more philosophical stimuli reorganizing your sock drawers.
