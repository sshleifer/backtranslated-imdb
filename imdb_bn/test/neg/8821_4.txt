I had heard many bad things about this picture, but it seemed that all the negative comments were probably down to minimized budget and poor performance - when I could deal with it in the case of Jumbo films. However, I did not count what this picture is really annoying; If there is one thing, you can rely on less budget jumbo, its emphasis and entertainment - but unfortunately, this movie is also not there. I'm surprised, because I saw director Bob Clark - two of the last two horror films of Deathdream and Black Christmas - both highly innovative and entertaining movies, but children can not play with the dead but it will not be cut. The plot line follows a group of young adults who travel to a disgusting island with rituals to bring the body back to life. However, they can soon learn that the things they can not understand are actually a foolish idea, when their ceremony actually brings the dead back and the dead bodies of the island return to their bloodstream! <br /> <br /> <br /> As the plot sounds like it may be a decent flash, but I do not mention that interesting part is not started until the final twenty minutes; And as a ninety minute movie, I'm sure that you can guess that it's not a good thing. The opening hours and ten minutes are played out poorly and even with the bad characters out of the pad. I can understand a situation set up so that it gets horizontal once it is stronger; But please, if you're going to spend it so long, you really have to make it interesting. On top and annoying of all the characters in the film, and personally I just wanted to zombies fast and eat quickly. The film is not without its capabilities, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. Lució Folië will show seven years later how an isolated island and meat eating cloth can mix well; But Bob Clarke did this with this picture already. The side is not bad, but it has been brought down by a poor makeup effect and a distinct lack of blood, which does not favor the fans of the zombie films. Overall, I really can not recommend this film; But if you are a hardcore zombie fanatic, you can get it a kick out.
