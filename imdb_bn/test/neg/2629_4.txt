Four young grade school girls witnessed killing one of their classmates during what they thought was an innocent game. A strange young boy named killer Milo Zaida. After 16 years, four survivors of the incident were reunited under the blessed condition of the same city. They believe that soon after the assassination, the Milo was drowned in the river, but soon learned that the demon killer Milo has returned, still a little boy, almost two decades later he remained unchanged. <br /> <br /> The cover for this movie looks really cool (I still expect a bad movie out of it). When I pop the DVD into my player, the menu comes up and the film still looks great. Sadly, this film did not get excited about me. When the film is the average effort of your Slashar film and when I think it is average, then I think like other small budget slash films that have never been welcomed with open arms among most members of the Harra community (I'm talking about you, a horror fan). In other words, you can walk towards any horrible fan and most of the responses will "suck it". <br /> <br /> did the movie make any mistakes? First, the DVD cover art looks really dark in Milo, but they hit everyone on the scene by showing him in the movie. She was likely to be a very strange character. Second, behind the cover art Freddy, Jason, Chuckie etc. came out to come out to pack their bags because the mix is ​​so good ... Why would not it be when it comes to hell? Name, low budget slasher film that has certainly failed? I mean, it only increases your expectations of the movie, it makes it harder to print yourself. In an endeavor to attract attention, it said ("from the maker of Anaconda)" (very large letters). As much as possible for the movie, they are giving you as much attention as possible to show you. <br /> <br /> The image of the cows gets reduced, the director gives you some harmful angles when someone attacks you. Music is not that bad at all and I fall asleep during a movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to find out what Milo actually did. My best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anybody else knows, tell me. To ensure the rest, I would not have lost any sleep over thinking about it.
