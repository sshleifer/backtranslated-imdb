The first thing is the first, someone with his creativity on the right side can believe in a movie like this. I saw this movie and after a few hours I was going out of my head, exactly what the director was trying to say. <br /> <br /> If there is a thriller then there is no thrills, if it works, then there is action, no drama, and a lot of touted love stories, it does not actually take place without a Chase sequence. There is no emotion, no emotions. <br /> <br /> Actually I do not expect surprises from the movie, but after opening the bumper, I thought of giving it a chance. I have no problem with Himesh Reshamiya, and I am not one of those people who would bother him at every opportunity. I went with an open mind and came up with a close-off. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamiya, she's just a debutant actor. But the directions, the script, the writing, the makeup have all gone for the toss. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very tough and it takes a long time to take curves. He can play the role of Don. Hansika is just a kid, and it shows on the screen with the fat of her baby and the way she is walking. <br /> <br /> Himesh's friend was the only actor, I do not know his name, but he looks promising. See it at your own risk, it is not good to see it while watching. <br /> <br /> ** Strongly recommend to avoid this movie. **
