We've brought this picture as a joke for a friend, and it can be our worst joke. The film is just watchable, and acting terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff provided a poor performance. The plot was disrespectful and we were so annoyed at points that we were thinking about what we were thinking. It tries to be awesome in places but just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just terrible
