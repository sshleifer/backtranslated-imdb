Royal Rumble 1988 is my fantastic fantastic bothered. The garland itself is quite unknown, filled with middle-minded people, and the winner was a really winning point, and why was the world on the earth with the main event of The Yang Stalien's Island? Half of the crowd left. JC Ventura feels annoyed by half, and you mention when he mentions that he is making Hogan v. Andrake more attractive. There is no chemistry between McMahon and Ventura's Gorilla and Jesse. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat V. Extremely frustrating matches, with many rest, and a slow speed too much, sink this one. It's too late when it looks like a madman in the last 5 minutes. Stompot won by DQ. <br /> <br /> Later, Dino Bravo is trying to set a new bench press record, Ventura explores him. What a terrific segment with no entertainment value, so what ever Ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, even McMahon acknowledged that it was boring. Debate or not, I wasted enough time on this shit. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ > Glamor Girls | C | Heart of the / wa hostage. Jumping bombs Angels vs. This night's best match, I'm not kidding! Very exciting element for women's wrestling, and you will be given a good day, pressure to find these good things. Jumping bombs Angels were on the road, and the crowd went to sh * t to win their title. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hogan gets a decent pop, but there are some significant boo for him, probably because of his reasons in Canada . A bit too much for my liking, but it was needed for the story. Its point, and some useful moments, but many times I said "go with it" Both signed, and Andrea slams Hogan's head on the table, and pushing the table on her. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match Very weak Royal Rumble, probably due to peculiar pacing, and the lack of true strength of star power. I had tested the water with Vince this one, and showed it. Ventura feels reluctant, and I do not blame him. The crowd wanted to conquer Roberts clearly, the DD shouted in about five minutes, and when Doggun got a good pop, I do not believe that he believed he was the winner, and where was his career? Somewhere. Brett's first ever Royal Rumble, and she's showing an impressive. It was not terrible, but it was very unimaginable and it was not enough for the ceremony, based on the show, this event was there. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Hagan has an interview with Craig Digioz. Interview with the standard hulkers, but not with the same frenzy, and generally they make insulting comments. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre did interview. Anda said he was championship Mr. Give to Debussy. Small, but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> among 3 fruits <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is for public Completely dead, and their half bolted to the exit. It was quite dust, and the main events were no business. Jesse and Vince felt disturbed, and argued about other issues during the match. Islands gained wins due to taking advantage of Ramadan injuries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think historically important, but there really is nothing to see here. This was just an introductory formula for the great things for The Royal Rumble, and you can see potential flashes here, there is no way to look here. I usually recommend everything to fans of die hard wrestling and considering this first royal rumble event, I think I have it, but it's time to get ready to get annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3/10
