Look, do not make me wrong I love independent films but I'm coming! I could sit through it without wanting to kill myself. The director had absolutely no talent and turned into a F *** ing nightmare that might just be OK. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even sucked the music. The act was shit. <br /> <br /> I usually bleed heart for this low budget movie, but this one does not even try it. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be very strict but come! It dragged on and over and over. Remember when the kids get into that group with weird cupcakes and watermelon martinis? How did they just mix? It disappointed me that they could go wherever they wanted and get hurt and could go with sex and a "meaningful conversation" that they want. I know, I got together, but my mind hated about this image.
