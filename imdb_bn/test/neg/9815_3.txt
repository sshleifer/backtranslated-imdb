This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad films, I can say that I look a little different. Not a plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more ways to cut the scene. Murder surveys give us many deadly dialogue scenes, but they last much longer than most of these films. For this reason some hunter seems like a little bit like a cut out of the pitboard. Just a little. I had a hard time finding out what was going on at the beginning, and it was surprising that some events were a sequence of dreams. In my favorite scene when two boys escaped from the murderer and took refuge in the car. In the gloves debit, they find a hammer. "Thank God!" One of them exclaims with joy. The man's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head, and I spend a lot of time waiting to be amazed, "What is that, where's the relationship between two people in the car?" Then boom! The head exploded and I figured that it was supposed to be one of the guys who got off his shot in the head with a shotgun. I love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
