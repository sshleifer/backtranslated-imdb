Unfortunately, there were some bombs, unfortunately, with the release of many good movies in 1995 (unfortunately "Martial Combat" and "Seven"), and this film is indeed a boring, anticipated plot and a disgusting end. It seems that Antonio Banderasa is "savage", can not find a decent script from the movie that she did. The eighth person in the brain can tell someone from the beginning of the demoron staller. Her mother had nothing to do with her flashback of death but in a paper slim story muddle nothing has ever been done. Dennis Miller has been offended in this picture; This part corresponds to its animated similar role in "net". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what do I say? Plus, animal cruelty in any shape or shape in any film does not show any fake, automatically gets finger-down from me. <br /> <br /> To write long stories, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid all costs. Do not talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
