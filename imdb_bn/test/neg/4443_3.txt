Seeing QUINTET does not look like a word playing game in Portuguese or a group that you do not understand. You get the idea that they are playing a game, and if you see enough watch, you can start to understand the rules only. But, why bother, it is clear that you can not join and if you do not want to get the chance <br /> <br /> One of the directors Robert Altman requested the audience to like his movie, realizing them alone. Sometimes he lets you slip into the picture as part of the crowd, like M * A * S * H, Nashville and a wedding, movies are so full of hobbies and stagnant chaos, one or two more bodies of the scene 'do not make much of a difference. And at other times, he seems annoyed with the fact that this guy might even see his film; As an image or as three women, stories often have a single audience, personal psychologist created for Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to be someone brave to deliberately be involved in the description. <br /> <br /> You can not depend on Altman to do logical or anticipated work, which is sometimes something that makes his film unusually iconic. But sometimes not unexpected, brave, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we introduced a young girl who is apparently the last person in the world to be pregnant, and she really is with the child. The last ray of hope for this damage society is burned almost immediately; Altman does not wait until the end of his last sadness card game in this enormous nihilistic and depressing story. He knows how empty and meaningless life is right to stop our bat. Brave may be. Stupid? Clearly. A motive deprivation, he tries to make a story on a fast molten snow, reminds us of all the time, how effortless is foolish. <br /> <br /> For record, QUINTET can claim to be at least predictive. The story is centered in a traitor's game played by various annoying characters. This is a form of TAG (killing game): Some people target each other for the elimination, everyone will be assassinated and everyone will be considered as losers. Two or more can kill a third murder killing coalition. They die, new goals are set. Anyone lives, win All this happens at some external, uncomfortable wasteland. This is mostly an extreme, scientific-version of "Survivor" - subtracting commercial plugins and "reality." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not a bad idea for science epic. A post-apocalyptic setting, a miniature miniature in the world (Caste is clearly multinational), a game where no one can be trusted or at least lasting, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. May have a firm eye on the taste of dark humor and violent innovation, and the director may be on the field day. Quinnet's mystery game or how it is not played, but why it all exists. If the game is a metaphor for "quintettes" life, Altman can not see anything in the element but an opportunity to show life as an empty, meaningless game - it is a clear conclusion as untrue. Given animated, although the outstanding nature of his films, I do not believe that Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman has no faith in its material, why should we?
