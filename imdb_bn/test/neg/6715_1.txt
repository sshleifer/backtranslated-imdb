Well ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why such an awesome script is allowed in the first place. It is not wrong to have a complex plot, but the audience has not been properly explained! <br /> <br /> It is bad to explain the plot through wife flashbacks. Very bad for the fight scenes so badly! Such fantastic editing only appears in the trailer. It's a whole look cheaper! <br /> <br /> And who is the Russian boys at the top of the movie? Who is the victim of torture? Is he with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This image is not worth the release in theaters. But it is not suitable for production in the first place. This is a joke for Hollywood.
