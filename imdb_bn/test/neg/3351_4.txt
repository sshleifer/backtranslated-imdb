When you look at the cover and read stuff about it, you get a completely different movie than what you get here. Then again I read the summary of another movie called "Mausoleum" because the two films of this title were released at the same time, both of which consisted of common platforms that were in the original elements. Anyway, here's a story about the movie that I'm learning, I saw it, and not one, and that film is less than a title that would imagine a movie. I'll be honest, I hope more of a zombie type picture and that you get some degree of this DVD. However, there are more things about deception and peculiar power that will see the opening scene of the person to be removed by the doer at the beginning of the film. The film also has the old theme of kids where they are not going anywhere, there are some crazy parties, in this case it is actually a tomb. The other movie I do not think is that the main feature plays a prominent role in the movie, and I see that there is a number more for it, but this is not the only movie I expected.
