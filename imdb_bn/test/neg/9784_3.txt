My jaw has fallen many times over this flick, I have bruises. All right, allowed, I really did not expect the quality of others or even teens (the new one, which was just terrible and still the head and shoulders above this frenzy). Someone mention thin letters ... I do not call them "thin". "Thin" can mean something to them. How about almost the existence? We have no special order: Girl will scramble; The American who will figure out it all; Maolo will kill Guy with everything until he is killed: the intelligent black man will die first; The additional guy is the first to die; Extra women who play hard. That's it. This is the list of your character and what they are and how they start from the beginning. If they are "thin", at least, at least from the beginning may change somewhat. But they do not. Okay, okay, the American people decide that he will be with the field eventually and the Screaming Girl will return to the place where he came back. That change Also, they all work according to their assigned role and finally when they are in this trouble, they believe in a real emotion. <br /> <br /> Now, the producers support a basic danger, I'll say. I understand that the story is going to be "sharp" but instead of giant worms, with ants. I give credit to the author: It's a very cool, very scary ants and bone that they do with excellent. (For the first time, "bone graduation" emerged, I acknowledge that I was a few feet tall.) Unfortunately, a very calm idea quickly became aliens in the desert. Do we have received many comments on ants that can not be true or may not be true, but we do not get the legend that is based on danger. And we get every giant movie cliché ever made. People go to places where they do not know and when they do not have any compulsive reasons. Moronic characters do not interfere our heroes and try to die for it. One character doubles "a scientist who does not want to kill the monster but wants to study it." A very cool gadget is only launched so that Americans can tell everyone about the worm, Gee, I hope everyone knows it all. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes come out of something that can disrupt the damage. And then those ultimate, annoying moments we know when the danger is still with us - and wonder how the hero or heroine came in and how it came to be surprised. It renders everything that went completely before as false and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the use of cool and goose bone. Nothing at nothing for clichés, clunky dialogue and egg bulb characters
