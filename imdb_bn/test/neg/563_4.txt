This film should have been called "the eyes of Alexander", and they must be involved in the concept of Bogart. The movie began with some ridiculous moments in front of Bogart's heir and face of surgery, but after the first 15-30 minutes, it became a more serious thriller, where the sapphire of two palm-shaped, marble marble, Alexander the Great's title, for him and his death He had just met before. So gems are not only for their quality and size but also because of the restrictions of the greatest worshiper of the world. To be an expert on Alexander, I must say that this is a complete and completely fiction, but it makes a good film. So the film first came closer to the snowfall, and on both sides of the coming Alexander, along with the rotation of Alexander, along with both the sides and the background (which I really liked) ran, a date shark ended with the attack (you can not go to a movie in '79 - ' 80 shows some shark showing the dangers of visitors). A man named Yuridis (the wife of Alexander's father's youth), Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (I've seen this movie about 5 years, so I can not remember all the details), Olympia, some street names, and more. It was fun to try to capture the details of all the background layouts kept in the director (probably an Alexander himself). When everything is said and done, eyes are restored and the camera is lying on their bed. Roll by credit. A clean finish type. What would have been more fun if they went way to Indiana Jones and had an action adventure. It is more interesting in Elijah's version of Ilias, for example, it was possible to live many lives of Alexander during his many lifetime journeys in the version of Anisteol, which should be found today). Olivia Hasey (my favorite b-movie actress) died very soon, and she should not be the main actress, not the girl's daughter and the poppy ... though she was easy in her own eyes. If you can find this flick, check out for historical elements and Olivia Lisa may be very interesting to show humor at the fun time, but beyond that I will send it for some more entertainment. <Br / <br /> You, Nick
