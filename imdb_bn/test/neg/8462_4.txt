This movie is not great ... it's just good at the moment when you want to laugh, because it's funny :) It's a lot of mistakes and it's Chess. I got this movie for Christmas five years ago but for some reason I have never left it. I think I only like it for rainy days even though I can see it once a year. It's a really 90's movie so it's really fun to see how everyone dresses and works. This film is good for the youth ... even though it comes to mind, when I was 12 years old, I did not like it, but this is my personal opinion. The movie was really predictable. I wish it were some extra weird twists but I guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. I think it was perfect for the whole family, but Halley's dress was somewhat unexpected but enough for family stuff.
