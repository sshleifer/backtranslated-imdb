New Year's Day. In the middle of the middle of the night, after several vodka martins and colonization, the day has been merged with Budabud several times, my wife and I discovered local cable companies provide free digital channels for January. We had a choice - do we use Freeby channels or did we start seeing eight seasons in the X-file from the DVD that we got for our Christmas for Christmas? <br /> <br /> Since we are digital freebies, DVDs are not going anywhere and at the end of all X-files we need something like ten to twelve hours. Drive-in channel provided a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of Damned (1996) and The Pat and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum has been thoroughly reviewed here and Pitt and Pendulam are too late to see us, which means we can be really critical for the threatened house. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried to try to get serious about the film because there are very good credentials for her star - Greg Evgen (written over Tekwars written by William Shatner) and Alexander Paul (the only child of a ten-year-old boy Can work but have a body). Unfortunately, we soon entered into the effects of little hair follies, as each of us cried out the names of the movies through which this dog borrowed his views: Poltartist, The Shining, Hell House, Hound on Household Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> Acting, especially by the real-life daughter of Evgan, was not too bad considering the stupid script they had to work with. For the 1996 CGI was ridiculous - at the worst time of the final scene when it was the most horrific, my wife was so bad and I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4/5, script 2/5, SFX 0/5
