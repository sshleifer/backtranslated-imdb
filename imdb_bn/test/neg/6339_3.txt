Michael J. disappointed the comedy-drama with the image Fox has ideally played a former child star, which now runs a talent organization for Theson Tuts; Nathan Lane and Syndy Loper are his associates. It all seems like it can not miss, but in many cases, Stystina Vidal is given a road side, whose fox believes the next big thing. They quickly lock the lock head, and annoying dialogue takes them behind them in an unhealthy, formula finish. Both Fox and Lane are objectionable, but the power of initial scenes gives way to frustration. Slickly produced, but ultimately old. * **** to 1/2
