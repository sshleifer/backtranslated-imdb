My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Armes, directed by Chemos, Damon Weinens, and Archie Sandler, is the best of friendship and for a year. Did not Moses know that Kit is actually Jack Carter, a secret police who is waiting for the right time to kill Moses and Frank Coulton, a major criminal involved with Moses. Calton and Moses find out that Ketes wants to kill a policeman, Colton Moses, but after firing Carter's head, he does not kill Carter. Moses' police was found and the falsity of Colton was found to prove. But when the carter and police are going to assemble him in the plain areas, all the other policemen died and Moses and Carter were alone in the desert. Carter would have to live with Moses as well. <br /> <br /> A fairly average action comedy, Bulleprof has a fair plot but many movies are simply stupid. For a comedy, I mostly found the joke completely unfunny. But as an action movie, it has some fairly good action scenes. Adam Sandler or Damon Weiens are not very fond of, I got the role and therefore, the letters are well below the bottom The measurement is not really great, and the film is so unrealistic. It's not quite bad, not very good, and it's too small. Running under 85 minutes, although it was 15 minutes to finish, but was not there, and the film was too small. Overall, the whole time is not wasted, but I still do not recommend bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA5+: moderate level violence, sexual references, medium level quote language <br /> <br /> 100 out 56
