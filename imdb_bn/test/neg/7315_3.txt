University professor Justin Thorny (Jimmy Smith) made it. With a beautiful, sophisticated teacher, a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays saxphon, a costly car owner and his students love and respect him. But when the temptation calls as Jennifer Carter (Namie Watts) as her bright, beautiful, sexy and willing student, she stupidly lets. The next day she was accused of raping her and her perfect life will be destroyed forever. <br /> <br /> We are seeing American actors in Australian cinema, we know that we are not in a fine text. But even with low expectations, "Gross Misconduct" is a huge flop. Rather, based on a play with an obsolete title and then adapted to a reasonable enjoyable book, it is busy with its audience on a basic level, unable to satisfy even remote distances. The scripts are painful and unconvincing; Acting, in the most part, is not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance, to show his emotions to the cinema screen for the first time, but he is not the only good thing about the film, which seems almost even waiting for it to wait. <br /> <br /> The direction is not terrible or very confusing, but it's just painful intermediaries. Apart from the previously mentioned Naomi Watts, who can apologize, at the beginning of his career, the act gets worse with the wood and the film. Generally reliable Jimmy Smit does not seem to be doing such a trick, and who can blame him? These small failures only add to the final serious error of the film, which is completely wrong in the spot. Any sympathy for character or outcome of interest is adult-type soft-core entertainment which is lost in the ocean. In the end, the audience is probably annoyed, tired and they wish to wish to do anything else with their ninety minutes. If you want Naomi Naomi 4 or 5 times naked, you must be able to miss Miss this unexpected movie.
