All right, a movie about a movie can be entertaining to take a crack to create a video movie. Maybe, funny, lively, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... this might be a negative version of the Bizzero of the film. Hamlin 'B' was entertaining as a film producer. The shutters still played crazy, and all had good lines. The rest of the letters were annoying, anticipated, annoying, resorting, annoying and annoying. The production value was lame. You'll actually see that one comes to the boom in the scene. The sound scene was somewhat awful. Hey, I'm a big fan of Saturn and Hamlin, but their talents are destroyed here. At least the story was a clich√©d end.
