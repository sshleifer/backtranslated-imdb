The speed that I believe is the direct copy of the Hollywood movie cellular (I have not seen it) that gives the impression of a test match which is very exciting in the first four days, but ultimately it is very annoying draw. I watched this movie on 12 January 2008, mercenary VCD. It's a release date 19 October 2007. But luckily I do not know much about this movie or have heard that it is flop in the box office. So in this situation when I see the movie, I think this movie can be a very good movie, but the director is again trapped for Bollywood's heritage and wasted a great opportunity. <br /> <br /> Route must be copied from anywhere else in the movie. But today's days do not matter to me, if I do not see the original movie. I just found the original theme like 'Nick of Time' and 'King'. Sanjay has been shown a detective agent in the film, but his wife feels that he is a chef. This brings back true false memories. Only new parts are used in the phone. But I also found that movies are now taken from cellular. So when a movie is made in combination with other movies, its future is quite clear. <br /> <br /> The speed I like about the movie is its speed. The name refers to things that happen quickly, and there is no time to think about the scenes. But in the last 20 minutes, this movie is where the traditional Bollywood style shocks. <br /> <br /> <br /> Three stories parallel Going, one after the other Ummah's kidnapping, one of Jamaat's Urmila and then trying to plan to kill the Prime Minister. These three stories are naturally mixed with each other as the movie is running. <br /> <br /> But very common acting and unnecessary extra style killed the movie's soul. None other than Sanjay Suri gives no impression. It also goes even for the Urmila, who is always committed to RGV movies. Due to this general performance some scenes do not express real feelings which the director wanted. For example, in the end of the disconnecting of the phone by leaving Ummah all hope, the scene can have a great effect. But instead of just waiting for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> Other than acting, the unnecessary love for style damages the movie. For Hollywood movies, it is not good to show such a good kilometer for Bollywood, not only for Bollywood, but also for the background style of London, and not very intelligent features of this background. Especially to the end, all these graciously arbitrary were totally unnecessary. The director might have an impression that the Hindi movie climax should have such fights. They look at the unrealistic appearance, increase the length of the film and ensure that people can leave the theater before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Over and over, I saw the movie once. It's coming on TV or you can rent it right there. But then again make sure that the remote and forward buttons are useful to you. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely see other channels.
