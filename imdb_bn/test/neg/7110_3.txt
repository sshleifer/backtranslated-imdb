This 1988 picture was recently shown on a wire channel. We wanted to see another movie, which was supposedly started, but due to a mix, the rent-in-cop was shown slot at the time. When it is commercially released it is not seen, we take it an opportunity. Bad Decision <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A wonderful photo of people with "rent-a-cop" or how they sold it in the studio behind the delivery, went ahead with it. It appears to be mad at this movie big time. This picture does not add anything new to its style. It is completely predetermined, once the basic basis is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Bart Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do well, but who knows what was behind the scenes, or perhaps the order given to him by Jerry London, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has an expression throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The romance between her lumps and the church seems to be terrible since the beginning. He and Mr. Reynolds plays one dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this Turkish.
