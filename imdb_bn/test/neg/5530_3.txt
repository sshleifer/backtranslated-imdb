I'm very glad I just got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt that. I have my eyes on this one for a short time and finally I saw it on sale. I caught it immediately and despised my head just taking it home. This movie sucked. I heard this movie proud and voiceless about talking to people. It's not really poor or violent. I've seen it three times, and I think I've lost enough life in this regard. At the time of the monsters get a point of being cool and kinda cool. Sex gets a point from almost the point. Horny old man is horny and still gets half point for having sex drive And the main character (whose name I deleted from my mind) gets half points for his gun's wonderful design. I saw the main connection between this movie and Daemon City Sinzukur. Both of them have the same style animation, which is clear because of the director, both are the Lam soundtrack that sucks like antichrist, and both are terrible endings. Avoid this movie until you are animate sex.
