All right, I liked Bridget Nielsen unhealthy, I have one thing for the 6 'tall women with the sword. I said there, <br /> <br /> <br /> Is this photo wrong? Almost every mistake you can make is made. You take a successful film series (Canaan) and you drag it through a bad script, bad casting, bad influences and the worst thing of all, with clay ... you have an intelligent child there for comic relief. These types of things almost know the Indiana Jones series. Cute kids are not real movies, for Disney movies. Nilsen took at least the movie seriously, although it seems no one else did it. Sharvjenegger repeatedly took out the red flame of Sonadja from the fire and dropped his character in considerable quantity. A warrior woman does not need a dude to get him from a mess, that's her job! This movie was a crime not to reuse the Kanan character. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never set the right mood, and its pensing was rather distraught and absconding, in contrast to Canaan Barbarian, which streamlined the lines of multiple stories fascinating. In the case of imaginative movies, it's Chesy costumes are okay, there's HarahiSueen Style Animation, it's OK that there is an extra set of folly that does not give any idea, but there is a scary script that is disabled. <br /> <br /> This movie may be classic but the script seems to be a 12 year old text.
