Although the statistics are higher than other areas of the society, I do not protest on high salaries for today's entertainment and athletes. <br /> <br /> With A-Rod, Lebron or Brady both good 8 numbers, or less-9 areas. Ray Romano and Jerry Safefield may actually become billions of their shows, huge residues and fees that they currently claim. Even their cast members and "Friends" reached every 7th of every episode of the group. Letterman's earnings can solve the financial problems of most people for a single show and can take care of many for a week or two. <br /> <br /> But these are based on the sound supply / demand prints and financial benefits to their employers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Annoying, and a mandatory "perkiness" that proverbial "3 dollar bill." <br /> <br /> A friend of me is responsible for planning for special meetings, events and conventions and its approval. One of the main talent sources is that hundreds of clients are available from the $ 5-10K level, which amount to $ 200 and per face. (Tram, Safefield, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams in this area, and no fun, Larry the Cabale Guy). <br /> <br /> $ 100,001 - 200,000 range has a larger number; The list includes the likes of Bill Cosky, Steve Martin and even Terry Larry's adviser Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This section contains Rachel verdict. I think he can acknowledge his "talent" and enough demands for the suggestion to justify his tech show and there are some who will pay $ 100K, + first-class aircraft, hotel suite, all costs and more. The limos are door-to-door, just for a few hours for its whiny thrust at its organization event. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this could be possible.
