Generally I would congratulate a movie that tried to do something different or original in a series. It is clear that the parody of the movie itself is somewhat parody. And I really tried my best to enjoy the movie. But I just could not. Interesting is not funny enough! (I saw my part of Japanese film and most of the time I liked the humor used in that movie and understood. "Red Shadow" is simply stupid!) The characters portrayed in this movie know that it is not a serious movie and all that fun is about to show that. See letters from parodies like "hot shots" or "scary movie" What they do on the screen is done directly with the face and does not leave the character! And for this reason, some scenes become funny and ridiculous. The actor never achieved this in "Red Shadow". The shadow ninja is supposed to be very efficient and deadly. Sadly the actors do their best in convincing us of their talents. They do things right with the face. If Jokes were good, it would have been better! The bad scenes of action scenes have affected my viewing experience. I like to work well till the martial arts movie laughs. "Red Shadow" just failed in that section. So what's left to enjoy. Well, the music (techno) was lifted. It is not spontaneous that it would be as action. And some small dramatic scenes are good but simple. The lack of humor, stories and depths make me think this movie is for children. But if I'm surprised, kids will actually like this movie. Waste time!
