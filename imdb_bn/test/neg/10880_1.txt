Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> There is no plot, there is no direction in the structure, there is no talking about acting, no visual style is no pressure. <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <Br /> <br /> The best thing about it is to end the box and the event ends. Who could have experienced 85 millinas this time? <br /> <br /> Again: Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to construct any plot, no acting, no visual style, no visual style <br /> <br /> In a word - no <br /> <br /> <br /> The best thing about the box and it is finally finished. Who can feel 85mins so long
