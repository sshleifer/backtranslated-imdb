The film starts with a little girl (Rita) after seeing her father's murder. He is obviously a criminal who complained against his colleagues. Later, and this section makes a bit sensual, the girl has grown up and the past killing of her father is still going on! A little later, Rita met anything for a good and her date. During their dated one, he was a little drunk and driving like a total fool. Police pursue and move quickly - killing pedestrians already. Here comes the really stupid part. He believes in confessing him because he assures his lawyer that he can free Scott. Why, oh, why would he agree this ?! Yet he spent the next few years in prison! And, soon after his firm conviction, this boyfriend disappears - he's showing a total heel showing. What a kiss !!! Later, after his release, his friend (Jack La Rui) told him the truth about a boyfriend. Then, he explains that the boyfriend's family has been loaded and he has to pay a lot of cash for the problems that he has given him by ripping him. Actually, they understand that - as they must be given to him - especially because they knew that he would go to prison and had every intention to use it and then put him aside. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​bloodshed from rich Champs is a good conspiracy idea. However, there was no way in the first place because it is difficult to believe that anyone can be so fooled by the hit-run-run! In an interesting twist, the foolish lady decides to commit a crime - picking a whopping and picking a rich man - taking him to the desert and robbing in a gunfight! Wow ... how he changed! Apparently he likes the idea of ​​stealing money from "phony" - that is, the rich hypocrites. However, it does not have any meaning, she closes the job soon and pushes the old boyfriend's father - why he was annoyed by a little robbery. And, believing it was a little harder to ask for money from the old shake, instead, he was eager to influence his people in public control for Maya. Strange ... very, very weird In <br /> <br />, another plot develops involving a young allan lad. He is a secret agent who enters the crowd. He was elected because he is really going to be a dead pigment for the real rare - what a cliche! But there is no connotation that this real prison is not in jail and crime is committed while fraud in another city. <br /> <br /> Finally there is enough evidence to provide warranty warranty in Kingpin - capable to release the ladders. It's an event in a very bad time, as the last, she decided to become a decent and legitimate woman, because she met a nice guy who wants to get married! Wow, that's strange ...! Overall, it is a fool and rather a cellphone cinema that is suffering from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are a lot of plot elements and strange twists to make the film at least bit credible. Plus, since the film lasted more than one hour, so it seems all too compelling and arising. This is a relatively bad B-movie com-studio PRC note that only Allan Ladd's performance is in order to gain extraordinary fame just in the aftermath. This DVD was released by the <br /> <br />, an alpha video --- an organization that sometimes reveals some extraordinary vague titles (most public domain) but never adds a print or closed caption. In other words, the DVD production standard is strictly third-rate ... best.
