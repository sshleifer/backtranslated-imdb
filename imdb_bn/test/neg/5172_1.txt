Oh dear, just in case of our West 'M (East London / S Sex Style), there is a need for another Asx-Kunkney Garbage effort to churn the rise of foot gangster / Rage gangster. Nobody told you that they won the world hat! And then certainly inevitable decay in the underworld of Rave culture in the UK. Blah Blah Blah. I do not know why and how to want to fund such a film, but it is praying that instead of private financias (we first see drug dealers, merchant bankers - what we all say, and what the rest will say) instead of public financing means Hopefully we will not see this again with the recession. If we do, then we will call for the death penalty for British films and of course we all will be able to blame the number one British country gangster Guy Ritchie.
