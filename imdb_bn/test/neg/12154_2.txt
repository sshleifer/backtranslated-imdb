I am really surprised that it has received 88% of Roton Tomatoes and Oscars nominated for the best foreign film. 7.3 rating on IMDB ... it is very surprised at the way IMDB users have recently voted to vote. I can not enter a movie where the actual information about its original character has been clearly distorted and not the artistic way to create the film, rather it is not for the musician and the less annoying. Which, it turns out, actually makes it very annoying for anyone who was hoping to see a serious and credible explanation of life in Changis Khan. Far and dramatic Mongols often prefer 300, a movie that can not be happy to be laughingly vague; But unlike the 300, Mars took it seriously. It mixes clear seriousness, obvious disqualification, it really makes the most annoying film I've seen this year; Probably the most action or biodiversity movie I've ever seen Characters are written pathetically. Actually, I suspect that Changis Khan, shown in this film is boring and inactive. Which is interesting to me, because there is something that should be changed for dramatic, it turns an annoying person into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and the message is equally annoying, easy and stupid. Also, without a long distance, the only fool scene in the long run of Mars - where more than 20 minutes of plot development should be, the film goes ahead without any explanation. It got something like a Saturday night live skit, which is a terrific pensing epic action movies. (Did I mention that Mongla has given importance to importance?) Meanwhile, it has dragged like a film that I have never seen before. Even now, I can swear it was three hours long. It's been around 45 minutes, I checked the time, it's almost finished. Along with some scenic scenes and quality of acting, from Asano (naturally), Mars is genuinely a disaster. It failed to fully entertain me or enlighten me. I do not have to give this film a second chance. And racist or patriot or whatever, but do not give a trashy and Manmohan American epic on any day to Mars. At least then I know that I know what I get, unlike the Mongols, where the reviews and ratings believed me that it was actually a bit worth watching. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing about what I hate to Mars is that I am friends who I know, without a doubt, will simply love it.
