After the screen became dark, the feeling was my feeling. Confused, there was another. Two favorite screen vets like Matthu and Lemon will sign in to this Patad project? I guess I could not read the script before the cameras were rolling. All cast, this unfunny, uninteresting and unimpressive movie, is wasted. Sadly, this was one of the last projects of this heavy Edward Mulhar. Diane Canon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'Connor reciting few lines carrying with prejudice. (???? !!) I'm not with "refugee soldiers" My point is that they were clearly spotted for the strange language of using off-color language. That's a great effort to infuse "humor" in a movie. Although he actually delivered the only morsel of entertainment, when he had a pattern of dansfur. I preserve my strict criticism for leadership. Walter Mathiou will be well-known. He still distributes great solo performance (IQ, Dennis the Menace, etc.). Its character, though affable, rather dull and one dimensional. I saw him once, saw him all. Another of Jack Lemon's tricks, crying, gives "very overly sensitive" male screenplay. When he started that mode, I would very much like to put him in the tissue box. It's hard to get out of the sea, and anyone who made this mess has to walk the plate.
