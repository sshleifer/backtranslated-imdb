I read all the Dave Rosakox novels and consider James Lee Barke as my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've visited most of New Iberia and Acadiana to be able to make most of these books look better. Not saying, I wished to see the "Electric Miss", especially when I thought Tommy Lee would be awesome as Robbicox Jones. <br /> <br /> I was very frustrated. The story was very sticky; The interstate page was "shallow" with "Ghost of Confederate Dead" and it lost the impact and ambition added to the book; And Tommy Lee Jones was guilty, unresponsive and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgotten movie is to add my "Dito" to a previous user's comment that this film is one of the oldest made movies. I asked Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show anytime. <br /> <br /> Location settings were correct, and photography occasionally picked steamy bios, smoky juke joints and the above mentioned object - the south louisiana ground graveyard. The controversial presentation of the story is very bad and Tommy Lee's sub-performance interferes with the unique mood and spicy tensions in the region. After the final comment: In the novels, Dave Robicco's nickname "Strik" is due to the distinctive line of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (If the Sofrans' Polly Vaults are to be seen only in Profiles, then how will it appear.) The film did not have any signs of Tommy Lee, probably because of the interview with editor James L. Burke and Mr. Jones's interview. Poor imitation of Dave Robicocos. Final comment: Although in most cases I think Alec Belvedin is terrible and objectionable, then Tommy Lee is more than "Electric Miss in the Prison of Heaven". "Also, the prisons of Heaven are more interesting and exciting, with similar credible performance and more innovative environments than this new movie. <br /> <br />" There is nothing better "on TV" Electric Miss "and there is nothing good on TV. , are infomercials.
