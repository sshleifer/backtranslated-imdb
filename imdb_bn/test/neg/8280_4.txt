This is usually a divine CGA performance, and if you are a man / legend fan then you should run properly and grab a copy. <br /> <br /> But we see slashhers for the kill (you know it's true), not performance, and fail to deliver on the largest number of days (there is a really good murder). The true horror only comes during a performance by the band "Felony". Ever heard? See graduation day and find out why.
