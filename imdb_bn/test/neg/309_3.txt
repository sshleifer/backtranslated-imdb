I agree that this movie is very provocative, and it's not easy to know where it's going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I found this film as the highest rating here, according to some previous reviews here. However, I remind you that this same director who is laarra de dharma (Il Seriso de mia madre - my mother's smile) her credit - a jewel of a movie! <br /> <br /> Was he trying to get out of Fallini 81/2? The scene with dogs, which has been specified, is weird and too much ?? Just one example. Others will take a lot of space, and some critics have already mentioned them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the most frustrating and annoying experience!
