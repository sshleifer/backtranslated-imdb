Being a science fiction fan from my childhood (from long time) I always hate the incredible plots. It is unfortunate that most of the writers of science fiction stories do not show such respect for their visitors. I always suspected of thinking about them: "Fool to realize children, so we do not have to struggle". The author of "Science Fiction" (2002) is no exception. The story is about a boy who is encouraged by his new friends to espouse his parents, because they think that parents and parents are allergic. As I had the idea, I was bored by my perception. I thought that the filmmakers' idea was right and for more than 90 minutes it was dark, stylish and slowly tried to expand it by spreading it slowly and slowly. The only thing that kept me in my seat was "How to get out of this disgraceful garbage"? And then - the lips - they did not even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and see "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
