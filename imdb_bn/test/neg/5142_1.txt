All right ... So ... I really like Chris's Christmas and his usual delivery available in his movies. The age helped him with his soft spoken low power style and he would immediately steal a scene. However, his inaccuracy is the wrong way. Holy molly, it was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I must have curiosity with cinematography and chris with this movie, to try to distinguish this folly from their fairy tales! None of them could understand and Chris probably did not understand it, and he was just going forward and hoping that someone would come to him and tell him what he would say! <br /> <br /> I'm not in love for the project of this movie, or this kind of dirty ... I saw a good budget movie which was a plot for love! This was not anyone, zilcho, nada, zippo, because the vacancy ... good talent, scenery and complete waste of celluloid! <br /> <br /> I broke pieces into pieces, and want my money back! I want to waste my time at this grade like my 2 hours ago! Do not watch this movie or waste your precious time 1 minute, where it is open in a room where it is running or even holding the DVD! Trust me, thank you for the advice!
