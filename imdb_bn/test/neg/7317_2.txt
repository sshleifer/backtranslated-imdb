This is a common college comedy and it is very average. The story is okay but not too entertaining. Reno, who lost his job about an unfortunate man, his car explodes and his uncle dies in strippage. Although he got a girlfriend (a nice one-btw .-) However, this uncle gave her palace as heritage of LA and Mercedes and soon Reno and her girlfriend moved to this new home in LA. The problem is the high rent for this house so that they have to make some roommates and so the film is released ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts right there and there are some funny jokes, but suddenly the movie becomes a wolf directly. The end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything about the movie. When you look at the movie, I know what I'm saying ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
