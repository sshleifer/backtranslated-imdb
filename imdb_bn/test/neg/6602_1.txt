Generally when a television biopic is released in a celebrity, very few camps (such as Cyber ​​Shepherd Martha Stewart, Larry Buckle Doris Duke), this is the most awesome, cheap and boring television movie. If VV-1 is going to create a television movie, they could spend more money on them. Flex Alexander - though gifted with Michael Voices - is not a great dancer, Michael is not similar to one bit, and is not even under his approach. VH-1 has done a good job through a real impersonation hiring, just like Michael needs to get plastic surgery, he's not really looking exactly the same. Why should we take us to the same size picture when Michael's nose is shrinking? Elizabeth Taylor playing the female can not act and can not see anything like her, and I can not start like this, like Janet Jackson. VH-1 is required to produce more movies due to the serious scripts and serious cases of corruption. Flex Alexander made Michael Jr. rather than Michael Michael. Costumes Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Footage from news docs split together. Do not bother with this one .... It's not even remotely priced. A good part of casting - starring actor Joseph Jackson and Lisa Marry played a girl as praseley, though she should have been more than a girl girl.
