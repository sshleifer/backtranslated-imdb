There is no idea how I can give high marks to this movie. I did not think it was the next great awful flick, the next great horrible spoof, or the next great low budget was horrible spoof. Obviously, this is not to be scared, but a deadly error with the product has spread joy beyond the viewing experience. The sound editing was horrible. I was working to control whole movie volume. You can imagine how something can be done - even a low budget spofel - when you're doing the volume down or down, or later you are expected to do it. Regular dialogue is very low, and all screaming, words, etc., very loud. We are not talking about toggling between Volume Control 5 to 7, a happy medium has been found at 6. We're talking about volume between 2 to 9 where it's impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie might be a good example of what might be, but you are going to spend so much time adjusting your volume control that you will not have the opportunity to enjoy it.
