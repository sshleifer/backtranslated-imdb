This movie (even it's an overstatement of calling a movie) is ridiculous horrible. "B" list movies are usually a huge fan of Erie Roberts, a flashing tragedy asks me the question of his original B! And Charlie, please go back to the hopes of a Diagnosis Murderer instead .... You can not blame anonymously eye candy (oh ... beauty patron members) to participate in this poor movie, but you are a former TV star! Pull yourself together. Do not even start Stuart Pankino. For good stewart, you should have seen that it is not a real movie! Brian Michael Stollar is not only able to convince anyone for investing this picture (money or time), for example, not just absolute talent. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was not a parody or stupid movie even though it tried a second-grade level. In most cases, it is poor writing and acting and working on the camera and editing and ... everything is good. I saw it because I read an article in some magazines about the involvement of agent MJ and my interest increased due to the case involving the case. I am surprised now that they are the only reason to show him on the shoulder of the film because he looks like trial, wearing pajamas bottle and becoming very clear (second seconds wait, does he really look handsome?). Move away from the main course). And agent mj? Could they be the best for a name for his character? Sheez. What an amazing piece of originality! Or can it be fun? At first it was a nice touch by inserting movies into movies, but after all it was said overdone and annoying. <br /> <br /> Express your regret ... Do not say! Will alert you
