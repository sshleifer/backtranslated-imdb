Oh, what's the hack, I'll reveal the secret: This movie is burning! <br /> <br /> Yes, some nifty dinosaurs have the effect that it was interesting to see for their time. Now they do not cut it, but they are not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at this. So they sat there, I smiled at this, not excited, just, well, disturbed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the box is dinosaur vs. Cowboys promise, and it provides it in a very simple sense. People dressed like cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs. But in reality these boys are a bunch of cecilia, and the hero is a harmful (later on more) and dinosaurs are rarely terrible. Plot is a yawner, and there are not many technically incorrect errors with it that are sunny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that was what I caught. Oh and they are in Mexico at the beginning of the century, so they dressed like a dress like a cowboy at least in clothes. So a lot of these people, I think they were in the desert, and they fall on these dinosaurs (they find a small horse ... I do not know, let's go). Then the film deteriorated into a really unfortunate King Kong ripoff between the final act. At that time I kept my eyes on the television level and even went to arbitrarily lost, and I drifted in and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> "Hero" is played by people from below the planet of Apes, and Haston decides that he does not want to be part of chicken Hesson. He chose the reason, shock and shock, he looks like Hesson. That's all she's going to do for me. When he was the hero of the film, he was really annoyed, because what he did was named gloves, snear, chick bag in the film (who is named as K. ... Unfortunately he is not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name). Meanwhile, his friend kills all dinosaurs, save many times a day, and what does he get for him? No recognition, nothing! And he died, sacrificing himself for his friends! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image does not enjoy pain on an explosion drop scale on your eye belt.
