I love low budget movies. Deliberately or non-deliberately funny, with extra net worth, violence etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's also stupid. Once you see the end, you will say, what was the killings of all the killings and there was no witness (except for a pair) to testify to them. And how did the last come in (I will not give it enough to go away looking for it to be the whole story away). The granny is like a psychologist Jason. At first he was outside the window with his body and after 15 seconds he knit in the living room. The whole thing is a setup for a new arrival. They shot graphic kill scenes, pulling knitting needles in the eye, that could only pull Chris Angel Mike Freak. And again, the very last was ex. Waste in 56 minutes. I saw the directors of another movie and it was almost bad. My 20th Grand Day and I could do better. This really deserves a big fat 0.
