This is Hamilton Sagar's worst movie and Karl Hamilton's worst actor. No doubt he has a psychological look and no style. Peter Stormer just can not stop it. "Fargo" or "8mm" but in such roles, he is simply useless. <br /> <br /> Lane Olin's appearance did not use any of these pictures. She could not save what she could: There is no s swedish in this movie, but in the big budget action films such as "Golden Hard", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", an American copy, but the actor does not have any idea about it. It is clear that some Norwegian upstairs director with MacTearan as director of the model. <br/> <br /> Identify the presence of the attack is only ridiculous. 10 out of 2
