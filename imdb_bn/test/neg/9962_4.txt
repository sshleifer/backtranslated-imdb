George Zuckero Boris was like Karl, how poor he was in a film, he always maintained a dignified feeling and turned into a better performance. "Mad Monster" is no exception to that rule. It is by all quality of a poor (if entertaining) film. Filmmakers do not know how to make the most money in their low budget and the script is believed to be within a day or two. Still, Zucco is crazy and crazy scientist as believers. <br /> <br /> The camp itself is enjoyable in the camp level. Most of the filmmakers of general fear films will not like in the PRC movie. However, following this "Poverty Row" production there are a small but devoted religion. Occasionally they will rise above their limitations with "Soto" and its best example. Usually they looked like this. For all its technically poor qualities, "Mad Monster" is a fun way to kill a rainy afternoon. The DVD is recommended from Retromedia because it adds another PRC production to "The Black Renain", the real dramatic trailer, and its role in this movie with the best interview of interview with Glen Strange. (4/10)
