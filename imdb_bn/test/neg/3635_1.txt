This television show is mostly stereotyped on its side and a lot of Facebook. <br /> <br /> The first setting. All the letters are present with PCA, stylish dorms, painted in this incredible boarding school. There is no reasonable rule on campus - for example, boys are often seen in women's dormitories and vice versa. But it can be simply because Dorm Advisor, a harmless character that basically encourages visitors to the audience rather than fun, as I guess its motive is supposed to be, almost sitting and does nothing. I have friends in the boarding school, and they laugh at many aspects of this event school. <br /> <br /> Next, characters. I was very disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not creative with the personality of this show. They all represent the character of the character that is very conservative: Joe is absolutely perfect in what he does (shows, grade, sports, boys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is joke, Logan does not do anything basically like a boastful blur Along with the addition of all the characters as well as increasing our poor visitors, Nichol Pruppe is fool, who knows nothing but is straightforward Bay managed it, the wing was a tough girl, Quinn was unrealistic 'smart kid', whom she constantly joked, Chase is a man who is afraid of admitting her true feelings, which really excites me because she is going to the show and the new girl Lola Another clone of some nicol <br /> <br /> The letter that makes me the most awake is Joe and Quinn. After all, I just could not understand Joe's character. He was evidently created as the 'perfect' character described above, but it seems to be the most defective of them - they have to fix a problem in most of the episodes. Frustrating that we wanted to love him and he does not make a very amazing character when he can start. <br /> <br /> Quinn bothered me, on the other hand, because she's absolutely insulting her character that the point is too much. The impression I received from Nick about his character is that the 'Gaikes' and 'Nerds' are laughing, criticizing, mocking people. One year before the spring break, they presented two 'nerds', whose characters were 'cool'. I found this highly offensive and stereotypical. What is Nick sending this type of kids? Do not do good at school, do not get good grades, do not work hard - you will end up as a guru and we will scoff at your future television series! As it is definitely the message I received from these weakly created characters, and this is a terrible message. And <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope I can do that Nick one day will realize that the intelligent people in our world, they are not doing any good.
