This picture is terrible, and Jesus does not blame Franken, because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This movie has been silenced for many years by Wales because he got the money to unify a crew and actors. To do some shooting. It is not clear how many films shot wells, although movies or all sequences are not there, but all the movie's "key" sequences, such as quixot in a movie theater, are not in the hands of collectors or backgrounds who give them Here the film is only less than two hours and I strictly impose that it works in any length. Based on a few comments made before Welles's death, I have expressed my opinion that he was never accused of releasing the film, but it was united as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> Most of what is here is shot nicely, but dramatically dead. For the first hour except for Quixote and Sancho, it happened very rarely around the country. One of the types of dust material would be described. The second-hour Quixote concludes in modern Spain and deals with daily life in a series of very good sequences. There is no good moments like this, ventilation and chicken sequences are quite good, but most of the time it is a huge waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Full" Wales assistant director Jesus Franco in the huge chambers in the middle of the night we have a bunch of film pieces together that are best placed as best as possible. Many people have crucified Franko because the film is frustrating, but in reality nobody can make a good movie from the bag material. One critics recorded in the 1970s as a separate track record, which means that Franco has made this version itself and destroyed it. Although it may be true, I've added the story of Welsh Cutting and spent the film several times over the years, because she never could achieve it correctly. <br /> <br /> This film does not matter anyway <br /> <br /> I was finally thinking how good a filmmaker Wells was. Along with Citizen Kane, almost all of his films have become frustrated or interfered due to lack of budget, so we are left with excuses that many of his films are "only if good ...". How do we know? How do we know? Perhaps Wales was less talented than ours, and many of his borders were not good at times and sometimes it could not be. There is no room to argue about the position of Wales in the history of the film; Don Quixote's remaining material, which supposedly conveys (I think), is a good thing to think about how we see people and their work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for a good sequence (though 2 of 10 is probably closer to reality)
