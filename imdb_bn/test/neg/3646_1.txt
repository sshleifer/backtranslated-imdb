Well there are some things about this movie. Everyone will see it. You see Iraq nation as you have not seen it covered by the media and shot from a point of view which is considered by most Americans to be the main audience. But let's look at the many other events of the mind that all glorious staff cinema. The Iraqi people were handed over 150 cameras, which saw the downfall of war and holding forces as a growing pain to their country's progress. And it's just a weak scratching on the skin compared to Saddam. Also, Netfix released it as its main distributor before a fun selection, which sent our entire roster to see the movie. What should be labeled as an opinion considered as the information listed by the Iraqis to be interviewed, is wrong. Abu Ghareb was a fine mix of 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% properly detached people if someone does not have Saddam's espionage to review the Red Cross record of torture. It was not revealed that 10-20% of anyone who was violating Schnad's Henchen or Curfew. In addition, the Arab world has not really listed 'Democracy' as one of their opponents, more accurately, the US 6 billion dollars a year, our military base in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I am afraid that the Iraqi people representing this film have been edited to talk about Yankee voice. Yes it is true that Saddam is a fool, and his remnant see for the best. It is true that some Iraqis actually provide a good wage. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people control their most valuable oils and US corporations. It does not mention that 20,000 civilians have died specifically in US gunfights. Still 15% of the countries which were not running water and electricity. It also does not mention that the UN-1993 UNO bans the purpose of the ban and more than 200,000 Iraqis by the United States government. Or does democracy mention that when people decide the government, it is not a huge war machine that sends messages, 'kill or obey'. I'm afraid the floor in the cutting room must be a bit bigger for Iraqis, which is not so happy with the profession. The vast part of the earth is not for war. In fact, America, Britannia, Spain and their rest are not the carriers of democracy, when they return to their pockets, they turn to them. Hur, Saddam is out of power, but I'm afraid any Iraqi is still in power. The corporation is in power, the media is in power. Read, do your own research, and do not blindfold them to you.
