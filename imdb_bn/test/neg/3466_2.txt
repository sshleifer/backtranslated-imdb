I think this movie is going to be good. Despite Oscar winning lead actors, they were not one at all. I once laughed, and no one heard in the theater. Rainy Gelzer pancake make-up was very disrespectful. Everyone seems to be trying so hard in this movie, imitating the slopstick but it is not dragging. I think this film is probably good for development, but there is something missing in the translation. He is roaming like 20? I do not think so. Everything seems artificial a joke. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The picture is in Sepia Tones, just like every other movie in the 20's or 30's. There is no originality here.
