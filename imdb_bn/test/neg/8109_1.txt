Some sphir may be AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how to make this last of the screenplay to knock it out for this one. It's horrible Fully unwatchable. I used to be there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and could not stand anymore. I was the Elias Wood fan of the 90's (see "The War") and I saw Mandy Moore's transitions become critically serious this year (see "Liberty Chasing", which is surprisingly entertaining). I saw the "Lola run run" bit. So I like the three Leeds should be fine with this. It was not. Someone turned a good performance. Wooden Jones was flat. He was not beside any imagination for an aspiring writer (his violent fantasies seemed to have been blown away from "non-Christmas story" and he was ridiculous - a cross between hah, annoying and risky). Potente was absolutely unlikely from the first second and I just want to know that he was supposed to be "girl" by reading. Talking about the summaries - The task that they employed makes the film fun, playful, romantic, and quite enjoyable. That person was the person, he should be appointed to rewrite this script. By the half point, I no longer care about any of the letters. Moore Lisa is an aspiring actress, who is fast and a bit of respect (not for any reason) but she's equivalent to one of the scripts of her humorous game (which is considered funny in the presentation). I think it was a happy, romantic comedy that ended with Turkey - they had to work with the character stuff, I just can not imagine this. Save your money. Get your friends alert. Do not watch this movie.
