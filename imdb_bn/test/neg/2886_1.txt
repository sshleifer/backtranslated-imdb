A man is builing at a hotel with a partner. He did not find the hotel. Things just get worse. There is a huge mumber in this picture view. Some of them have been put together in sleep. It jumps from place to place. It is not worn something for too long. The last one starts Christmas morning with a hotel fire. Then the night of the fire was cut off and then returned in the daytime. DVD sound track awesome It takes a perfect plot and has become my worst movie for a long time.
