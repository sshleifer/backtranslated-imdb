I did not see many episodes of "Family Guy" and it is a safe bet that I will not look much in the future. Some people compare this show because "Simpson" is inappropriate. If I think this program is not available then "Simpsons" did not come first and I absolutely think that it wants to be very much from "Simpsons". I do not understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I have seen, I have realized where they wanted to laugh me, I realized that someone thinks a joke is right but the joke is not funny. I think the whole show is lazy: the title, "joke" is a complete lack of inspiration. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Is added, is more rewritten and then it is illustrated. <br /> <br /> The "Family Guy" episode will be created as follows: A script is written and illustrated.
