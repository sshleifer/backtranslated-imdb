TWINS effect is a poor film in many cases. Only good material does not take it seriously. Furthermore, this is not a film, but a merchandise for the film's two stars, the popular pop statues of their local Hong Kong <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly created and played. The direction offers some silly martial arts which is different from the action director (and guided by co-director) Danny Yen. Like many Hong Kong films made for Teen Viewers, "Actors" are the main actors Twins (like these two girls who are the stars of this movie) and Ikon Cheng, there is very bad music to excite the viewers who believe in some scenes. Funny, cute, etc. <br /> <br /> Final Conclusion: It's not everything. Even as a fan of Hong Kong film, it is a poor movie. Not enough fun, not serious enough, and usually a very good bubble gum for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
