I guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as intent visitors. You can tell yourself a) "Let's have a movie that kids will love today!" Or b) "I made a movie that I liked when I was young!" The second method explains why why Steven Spielberg often appeals to young people's audience. Examples of prime example E.T., Goonies or Indiana Jones That's an example of Darn Cat's first approach. You say this flat, unbelievable characters are supposed to be fun but it's not. Plot itself is enough for ten minutes, but instead it is turned on. And even though I'm not a child, I do not understand what should be fun for kids in this movie? Ugly police driven by the old lady with a dog, a tweety bird or sarcastic oneliners of Christina Ricci? One actor showed a gimmick with his very cute humor: Dog E Dog FBI playing the agent.
