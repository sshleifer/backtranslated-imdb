Being a former MST3k observer, I even found this movie inaccessible. The terrible attempt at acting is a terrible attempt at humor-heck. Nobody needs to read these junk pieces. <br /> <br /> All the positive reviews were clearly written by me as well as by custom members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wows - they are all reviewed by modern vampires. Give me a few dollars and I can make a movie better than this. I've ever seen some of the most unfinished pieces of film making and it's saying something. Look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 0/10
