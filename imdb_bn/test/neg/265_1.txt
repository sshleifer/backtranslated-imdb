Twelve of the Ocean: There is nothing compared to just plain fool, bad and the other two. <br /> <br /> An art robbery. 10 known actors, at least A weak script and very slow idea of ​​developing. That's why I characterized a movie that I only saw at least 20 minutes. Do not make me wrong, you can choose it. But because of the heavy theme, I only love ocean movies. If the ocean 12 does not talk about it, then what is the signal? Glad Soderberg saw his main flaw and released himself by creating a much better film than a first film. <br/> Steven Soderberg is not actually a good director. In addition to his hits, "Sex Loot and VideoTop" ... there was nothing so great about this director's career. It's over. But only his fault.
