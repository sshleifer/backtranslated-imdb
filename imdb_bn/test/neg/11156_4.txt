The end of the day, quite well, Arne plays a down and out of the police (a very similar character in the Lithal Arms Riges) and the story looks like a serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver, as Arne is as good as we have hoped, so Gabriel also likes to take care of his role more carefully than Beyond. Cast as Satan; This is probably the weakest illustration of the Lord of Darkness. <br /> <br /> This film gets very little disaster for me, and the last order, far from being weak, apparently I have seen in the worst one 'recent years, the CGI has been better than it has been in the early 1990's. <br /> <br /> is simply not good enough. 4/10 (Do not expect too much if you have it, because it will not be supplied)
