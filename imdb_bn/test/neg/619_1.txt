One of the worst things in the movie studio is to use another tragedy to commercialize the 'Shock' or 'Gore' factor, to sell tickets to buy other people's hero necklaces. One of the worst things is to make the director a favorite real story of an incredible song making events, dialogues and images of his choice. Finally, one of the worst things in the movie studio is to use the following barrel actors and shoot it at a sound level hired for exactly fifty cents. These three filmmakers are guilty of this. It hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. Celluloid '1' for this waste is a very good score. Filmmakers should not be ashamed to make it, they should be ashamed to exploit the heroes of this story, which both living and dead suffer this tragic experience.
