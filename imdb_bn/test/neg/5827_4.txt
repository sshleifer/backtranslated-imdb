I saw Winnie's Hefalamp a few days ago. A nice story based on well-known characters made by A.A.Milne. Although this animated feature includes Winnie, Pigeon, Teger and Rabbit, the main character RU He made friends with the fearful Hefalamp who does not prove to be scary and shows everyone that friendship does not know any bounds and everyone is happy. I love this picture and I love it more than 10 or 15 years old. Well, to enjoy the story of this hefalump, I want to become a child again, but everything else with me is a feeling of sadness due to the loss of childlessness and innocence which is full of this movie? I'm glad to hear Carlie Simon Guy, Joel McNally gave a great score.
