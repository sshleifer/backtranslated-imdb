I have selected this DVD at the 3.99 at Rogers Video to get enough points for getting free DVDs. I was not really planning to watch it but it started to insect my curiosity and I finally decided to pop the DVD player. The effect of this photo is terrible and inexpensive. Some dialogues in this movie seem to have been written by the 12-year-old son. Some areas are really greasy, and the "action" scene is completely ridiculous. You will laugh in some parts which were positive for me because it made me humble. This plot curses a few girls for which they have to vomit the snake so that some Shaman takes him to Los Angeles, where two girls are trying to smuggle medicines and some people are not important for the plot, nor is it really a plot. Do not expect anything from this movie and do not hear the cover, there are 100 passengers and 3,000 spinners, 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Must be bad Also featurette was not a stupid kind of people involved in this movie without really showing a lot of which making a really bad one. If you really want a bad movie that you can laugh with friends then I can not recommend it. I give 2 cat cats out of 5.
