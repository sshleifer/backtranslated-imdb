*** SPEAKER *** *** SPEAKER *** Some of the African Farmer-Hilby species are found in the desert when they find a hard pulse in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: At least one pond hits the head and it starts open cracks. Then he looks in the hole and sticks his head and bless! Some eat him. The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery boy, but he plays a specialist scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be at least 35 years old, at least). Cam is joining C and helping to find the diamond. There are several oddities in the truck that Bairstow has chosen to go to Camp Seed, which usually produces movies like "Pitch Black" "Thing". The truck runs on the first truck and they decide to investigate (because they were driving a car while driving the baysto, they were traveling on the same road?). So they found the body of eating habits and on them there are some modest special effects on the bones with the bones of the meat. The group's head crazy, Carl, decides that they must find the murderer. The truck almost navigates into the desert after some tracks, and eventually it is trapped in an electric short and tropical desert. The most cruel person in this group took out a bunch of bones to carry them using their jackets. When he takes a neck (wearing the same jacket) the animals eat him alive, and run on another guy and stick his hand into the peg and that dummy also lose his hand. A few minutes later, Dr. Bayesto realized that the animal actually used to keep the bones together, so they can travel to a new honey (because the mines are open old hive). Now, the last time I tested, the ants could rotate on their own without using the bones for the structure to kill people. They were difficult if they were needed, they could put the stick together and use them to create a form. The whole story is really, really stupid, and only one of the grammatical explanations. The rest of the film is killing the entire group until they are searching for the entire ankle and hunt the ant-brain (sorting) and killing thousands of ants, then their own ET-BT foot. An additional anti-brain has been found (off-camera) and has been sent for analysis so that it creates a reason for a single cylinder.
