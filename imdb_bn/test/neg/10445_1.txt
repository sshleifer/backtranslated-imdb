A terrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. Bad story bad talks Bad characters are a complete end to even a confusing bad plot. From my perspective, a waist of time I thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw that I can not pay to see this burden load, please spare the moment to avoid any cost. Even if you like jaws, which I used to do often, even if you are interested in Paleontology, you will not see it, even if you like genuine films with dry actors, Sniffer likes the folding plots during the TV, but do a favor to humanity and I repeat Do not, it's still a science-animal animal thriller for you to ridicule this ridiculous excuse Who is not polluted, some people have it ... ten rentim know whether or not they are serious (but sincerely hope they were not)
