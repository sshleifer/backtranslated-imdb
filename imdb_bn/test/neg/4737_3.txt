Anyone who has seen "Allen v. Producer" must know that the conventions of "Allian Square" were not perfectly suitable for the film. In some unusual elements, the speed of the embrace is a few minutes faster, aliens with a fast long tail. However, the idea of ​​hunter-gatherers was to give inspiration to city and temple buildings for hunting, so the fighters felt so obnoxious that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I hope the end of the film is not the direction of this signal, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot about the end of the first film, the dead hunter had an explosion through his chest, which carries the characteristics of both species. <br /> <br /> I'm just a list of "good" and "bad" features for this picture. <br /> <br /> Good: Many beautiful people, especially men. <br /> <br />: Many beautiful people have got mutant predators / aliens and pryather in Munich. <br /> <br /> Good: Predator is an interesting concept of the planet. <br /> <br /> Bad: An incompatible scale in a city. It's a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sier system, and homeless. This is a small town, or a city? The police force is a sheriff and three deputies, or I count. <br /> <br /> Good: Um ... <br /> <br /> Bad: Why are these mutant aliens / predators growing up? Very fast Within five minutes, they seem to grow in their full size. I mean, kissing ... what are these things ... Chiia pet aliens ??? And when we are in this matter, why does an alien mutates inside the body of a predator, but is not an alien in a human body? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And why does this "Alien" pour acid on all residues, but it decides to kill an intelligent deputy and then sketch him and turn him over. I mean, so much in disguise! <br /> <br /> Well ... Ah ... I'm stuck. I guess there are so many words! <br /> <br /> Bad: How do these evolved alien / pridettors grow? Apparently they found the speed of a pregnant woman and a kiss type, they submitted many descendants in the woman's body. Yeah, what do you want to see, Ah? Pregnant women explode their bodies into mutant aliens - just like the previous path was not enough !!! I mean, even the alien queen is not there. <br /> <br /> I said that the people of this movie are gorgeous? <br /> <br /> Bad: When a nuclear device separates buildings, how can the helicopter survive the blast? And one of the passengers is so hard to mock the pilot that "I told you not to crash!" I mean, after the nuclear fall, when he wakes up in the morning, he will not have any hair left! <br /> <br /> I could go, but I think you got the message. Explosive Alien / Predator bursts through dead lethal body and enhances the matter for a few minutes, kills all the predators and crashes on the earth. More mutant aliens / predators are made, when the world's one-size hunter comes to destroy these mutant mutant species. Hunters kill the people. Mutant alien / kill the hunter. People kill people <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> First, I recommend you leave this sigell.
