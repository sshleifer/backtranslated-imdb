The best thing is the first: I agree with other viewers, who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. She did - I was finally tickled to get a chance to laugh. And at other moments I was delighted - Raymond's parents tried to jeopardize Carol Lomber with a bad planking of the bathroom, and with Robert Montgomery, the miraculously noticing at the restaurant scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was frustrated. I love most of Carroll Lombard and Hippococo. And I understand the restrictions placed on the production by the Hedge Code. But this was embarrassing and frequent. Of course I knew they would end up together, after all it was a romantic comedy. But it does not have any idea, it happened very quickly. Plus I can not believe the love job when experiencing such traumatic behavior, both physical and confrontational.
