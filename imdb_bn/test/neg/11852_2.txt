This movie is sad. According to my fellow IMDB users, (* Spliler *) RAPTOR uses stock footage of Carnotos films. Well because I did not see the carnote movie, I can not tell. However, I noticed some pretty bad editing and even worse acting. This movie is a big steaming pile of ****. It makes absolutely no sense. Here is a thing called itself PLOT: Mad scientist re-creates a rapper. Raptors kill people Sheriff Investigation * Spirir * (though I do not know how I'm hiding) Sheriff is diagnosed with mad doctor's plans. Army troops were sent and raptors started killing soldiers soldiers. Raptors. Yes right I could create a soil image that looks more realistic. FX is the cheapest movie ever. There's a lot of gore. Cheap gore It does not even look real. I would agree with another person rated this movie that the film is only going to go for it, it's the end. This film contains about two seconds of originality. And that's only the Sheriff comes from talking about some of his electric bill or some tax agent in the phone about the phone. This concept has been used in 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I'm going to give the rapper 1/5 because it's over.
