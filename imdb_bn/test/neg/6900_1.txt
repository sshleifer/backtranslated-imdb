When I fell asleep in my six year old theater during this film, I was pretty sure that this movie was frustrating. It was boring. The scary part was annoying. The part of Maudlin was boring. Even fun parts - with two small exceptions - were annoying. And expected. And did I mention the forecast? Examples: 1) Drunk but loving parents indulging a brat her brat. 2) Bought the drunk but loving father farm (when singing a song?!). 3) A child chooses to run and run a child, but thanks to his friends, because they stop things as they need him. 4) Brat a child winner against incredible weird. 5) And a sassy character voiced by an African-American actress. These filmmakers have to credit that fundamentality and to sustain that stereotype. I have mentioned two funny bits. In both cases, contribute by small letters. Bouncing the mouse over the farmer's pulse was funny. Lead dog worn-out farmer dog was fun. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to create a hipone-through-committee movie and it made a computer-animated film even creating its sparkle, and this was the result. And instead of just eating them, did Batman-Villen fool by having a relationship with their victims? And well There is no need for blood in this film for the kids, Already, Mak is paying attention on alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and soft humor. And a different things-in-box? What was just right? A porcupine? Tasmanian devil? Is really the stupid plot to help Otis, as well as the mother of all the fighting cow? Barnyard is a bomb. And I do not even have to mention uders.
