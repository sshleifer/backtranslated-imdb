Astroesquie (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I do not know what this title was supposed to be ... the idea of ​​halfway through this film is less than that! , It still kept me interested in order. It's a low, low-budget movie, alongside the "El Mariachi" line, illustrated in 16 mm ... and how much it is worth, the shots are very well-made and visually stylish. Written and operated by comic book writer / artist Michael Allred ... I do not think it's astonishing that the film looks good. Unfortunately, some of the acting is overcome worse ... and the rest of the rest is better. Overwhelmed himself comes out of the best ... but only because he really can not say much. He is just roaming towards peace most of the times ... or trying to kill him from the crazy red guy. The word is too bad ... almost as if it is incomplete in places ... perhaps they can not pay for the music they want to use? Strange, vaguely science-fictional plot ... similar to the title "Man Foil to Man" ... but most of the films open to an ideal-of-the-da-people and kill them before. - They killed - you plot. Eventually to be successful but not very courageous movie without interest for watching.
