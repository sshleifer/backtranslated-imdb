What time and money is a ridiculous waste !!!! This movie was the biggest damages of the year. All the promotions were a warning. I am disappointed for Julia Roberts, he is the most gifted Cast member. I really played the ability to carry the film in his capacity. The boys' boys club was a bit awkward, and why did Catherine beat up Jones to insult the pain? She only has the ability to destroy a film. He lacks the ability to chemically screen anyone with somebody, he has no power to mention that he has no work to do. She lacks chemistry with other characters: the kind "memorable of America's sweetheart". He created "Terminal" Terminal. This movie is not headed anywhere, what a shame, please do not tell me "13" on the way!
