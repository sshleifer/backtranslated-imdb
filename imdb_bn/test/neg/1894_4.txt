Yes, this wicked feature John Sayles wrote. In Toronto, it is still a feature of the dangers of a '80s urban forests, where the police are afraid to go and homeless and the only occupant of the criminal category. In this mixture comes a senior young man, raised by a bag lady after being murdered by a pagan youth of Wild Thing, a murderer of his parents (Mori Chanchin) and Chopper's local guy (Robert Davey). Move between local collaborators (Pastor San Huyet and stupid social worker Catholin Quilan), and you have a recipe for some rather extravagant action sequences. Standout in Davy Cast, and cinematographer Ren Verzier works a pretty good job. Otherwise it is a rather laminated action picture that will not satisfy action fans and will release Slayk-Javed in support of Cyayes.
