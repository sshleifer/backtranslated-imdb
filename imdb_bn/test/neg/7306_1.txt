It was (intelligent) sitting down to see what I promised a friend with a little interest, the worst / best movie experience in my life, the strong 'Roller Plaque 7'. 2 years and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes my dear friends it's really bad. Obviously they get 40 minutes of footage and then decide to use the footage indefinitely and use it repeatedly in brain-flexible effects. This is my only fear in the post-apocalyptic world in Turkey that, however, in some ways this hatred will remain alive. Really jealous of living dead
