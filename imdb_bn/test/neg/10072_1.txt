This movie was probably the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. I was ready to leave for the first 10 minutes. Glossy face faces, and the plot was not only fool-proof, but full of holes more than Swiss cheese. I'm considering a case of losing 2 hours, and 6.25 dollars, the fact is that I'm silent to see the waste of this movie now. T-Rex must be flipping into their graves, so to speak.
