I was frustrated with this movie. For beginners, what happened to him does not seem too terrible to me (sorry Male Choiceist Pov). As has been explicitly stated by one of the London prisoners: "Most men _pay_ will be in your position". Which he replied, "but it's not like _my_." OK, OK, fair point, so really bad was it? Please let us know. But now the kicker: he does not know _oneone_, until the end of the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, nor the counselor, nor the police, no one. Then, she comes to the woman who knows about the bright plan of f * ck * ng, so she recognizes the tattoo (or something) of one of her prisoners. I thought it was just unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his imprisonment? Is not it time to take a little break from all? For me, his, make it light, the sick counsel "broken the film unbelief" of action. I took a book out of the last half hour of my eyes.
