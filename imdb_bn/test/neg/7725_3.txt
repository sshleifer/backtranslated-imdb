I saw the first house of the dead and expected root canal would be more fun, so when I was not bad I was amazed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got my <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to see it again and say good to myself. Those who gave good reviews, or wondered if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> '' Nightingale '' Morgan, played by Ed Quinn Alex and Emmanuel Wagia Alexander, played a role that was below them. They deserve to be good movies. <br /> <br /> Special effects were correct and some characters were selective / hate-able and it was made for a tolerant watch, but in most cases, this movie is only a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, I have to ask this because I myself said the most by saying in the movie ... Nobody knew what it was like to shut the door behind them? Just fold in the room? Just once it happened (the jumbo was going inside) and I saw that it is a little convenient ... soldiers roaming around the house, open outside the door, do not pay any attention to the same door, so if the jumbo can only walk, they feel it (" Survival "There is no way to survive) And once the jambi followed them. Maybe <br /> <br /> if I fought for my life, then I wanted to walk around the house and leave the room wide open, so Jumbo May catch me and eat me. <br/> <br /> <br /> I was just boring * the only thing in this film, and in most cases the movie was not just a bad sign in the totally hateful origin.
