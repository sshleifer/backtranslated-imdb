Most of them like to watch this movie, I did it for Michael Madison and Dennis Hooper. Two are very intrinsically and sadly, because of that, there are many headings in shit. In this movie, Hooper played a man who accidentally killed a blackmailer and offered help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> This picture is not really terrible that it might be. I've seen both both work independently and both together (LAPD, horror film) are both very bad. The aspect was poor and some of the scripts needed to be rewritten, but both of them provided the best performance with the content. Also the end is pretty superb, so you can tell the potential of the story. But when a movie is a brilliant review, "it can be worse", it is not saying too much for the film. <br /> <br /> Everyone can easily be omitted if none of these actors can draw you, but if you are both or both fans, then this is a clock. They both give strong performance that expose the obvious flaws in the film. I believe, there are many bad alternatives.
