Except for the gifted Austin Powers Discoverer Richard Halappar, this film was your driving in Mill Movies Spoof. Date movie references will not help viewers who might come to this end in the future. Look for "Groovy" Austin power in hot tubes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For my money, I would rent DVDs of classic spoofs as "Biman" or "Mars from Mars."
