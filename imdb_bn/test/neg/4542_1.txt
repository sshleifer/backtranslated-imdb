Well, I like to watch bad scary B-movies, because I think ruthlessly ruthlessly shoot good movies, stupidity and inability. (I always compare with these movies - for example - I do not understand the big difference between some Spielberg work and what I see again.) I like the movie Ed Wood because it's so funny. But man !!! "Chiling" is not funny and even "funny". This is a very horrific horror film, even without the slightest viewing of even bad movies. No acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and even blood. It is highly inactive amateurish film. It's definitely the perfect movie I've ever seen (and I saw many "bad movies" - believe me). I warn you 1/10
