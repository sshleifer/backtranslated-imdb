Some of the secondary actors tried, really hard. And the camera shot in the desert is quite beautiful. Otherwise, this picture is terrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from an emotional institution. What is the point of this film of the amateur screenwriter psychotherapies? Harvey would do something to read his script and convert it into a movie, even if it is meant to take a movie crew hostage. What is the amateur screenlit ... Grove? Maybe they could <br /> <br /> The film's setup is very long way. We do not get the point of the story until the second half. Fleet among the first half darts and mixed letters. <br /> <br /> "Shot or B Shot" is shouted as a comedy, but I'm not quite funny at it. The dialog contains no symptoms. Anyone of the characters is credible as real people. They're all stick figures that perform similar "actions" in cartoon characters. Actually, the film is primarily a cartoon for adults: fools, madmen, birds. <br /> <br /> I understand why there are some actors in this film. They need money or exposure. But what are you doing inside the soulner and Harry Hamlin? Maybe Shatna wants more comedy roles. Is this the best he can do? What is Hamlin frustrated for money? He was a respected actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Probably that was not the intention. But of course how it can be explained. For example, the script was very badly written.
