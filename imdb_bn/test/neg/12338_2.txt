Downhill Racers is a great movie that only looks for great skiing sequences. Although there is a story, the character of Robert Redford, the skier trying to form the United States Olympic team, is so colorful and disrespectful that why you worry about him. Gene Hackman adds a primitive performance, nicely, but it is a film that can be seen close and it does not make much of a difference.
