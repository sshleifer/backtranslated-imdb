To put it simply, this cannon poopie was a pompous piece. It is fairly stupid and every one of the musical plays is the queen of every moment. After a while, I hope that in the beginning, every character in the movie is not a stuffed up gut retinentive. <br /> <br /> And one of the most important of this movie is the boring thing which has recently arrived in vogue and should not have: all the scenes washed out, blue-steel-grayishness. Hmmm, last time I checked, able to place a fairly wide spectrum of candles and torch colors. In fact, the light they highlighted is more in yellow, yellow-orange ranges of the spectrum. So all the blue-steel-gray light coming from <br /> <br /> <br /> There are fancy sets and glitz CGI FX in this movie, but it's still a draw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Universal Studios 1941 "The Wolman" is unlikely today, even though its FX is quite primitive than it can nowadays. <br /> <br /> I did it with this franchise. The first movie was reasonably modest. The second is still a bit entertaining. But this one I could not even end up at all because it was annoying.
