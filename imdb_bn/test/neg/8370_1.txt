This is a real big bang that enables people to easily make films today because of the cheap digital video cameras. Usually I appreciate this possibility, but if you see the movie, it's just a big shame. And if people like it, then it is also shameful. Lovers get abuse by this choice. I rent this "cinema" cuz rent "h.p. Lovecraft" drops. And I adapted her to many big fan, mainly those who were accomplished by Brian Yuzna & Stuart Gordon. There is nothing to give this movie! A beach and an old wine cellar are a cheap scenery. DG-cam effect "red light" on the whole movie No actors, some stupid low-grade models who have definite what they are doing, are as tough as wood. And so be the director. It is clear that he tried to create some atmosphere. But the whole thing is so ridiculous that it does not work. And no cervical effects, just some blood in a river (you drink = become giant = you) and drop here and there. Oh yes, story: Thousands of years ago, some "big old" colonized the world and took people as slaves. Then mankind became independent, so "old" tried to destroy them. And now there's some survivors after an apocalyptic world. The only possibility to save mankind is to find NECRONOMICON, where it gets love. So those soldiers fight against some of their beaches and their wine-houses and demons. Incredible - the whole thing! But it's been dubbed (German title: "Army des Justts") and you can find it in most commercial video-stores like you think you can make money by doing things. I think this information is impressive.
