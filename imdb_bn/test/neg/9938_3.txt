How nice! The movie that should be shown in the morning on the morning of the cinemax on two screens in the signmex (The Lord knows that they will probably get out of borodums to watch this film). Dreadful acting, killer is far from horror, I've seen scarier clowns that meet at carnivals. This film has many unnecessary 'skin', pseudo-screen scenes that are horrible in more than a million ways, a Gaudy soap opera style script that actually hit the movie and there was no difference between the director trying any type of continuation. Made with this picture. I could see a group of teens with their parents Camcoder doing a better job than them. I do not think there is a part of me that can recommend this film to anyone ...
