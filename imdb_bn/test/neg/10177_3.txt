My wife watched this film in the ropes at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but after introducing it to my wife, Rebecca was in St. James's film, realizing that it was a Christian film and we suggested it to be seen. We are conservative evangelists but we know that there is a poor reputation of mainstream "Christian" movies. However, we decided to give it a screening. <br /> <br /> To be fair, some things about film I've liked. Musical score - which was very orchestrated - was quite good. Cinematography was considered to be very good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any quality of the production of this movie is lost in a sad script. The film starts with an interesting generation - UFO abduction - but through the feature, the story flows heavily on a Gospel crusade driven by two main characters of the movie ... which later floats wildly in a book in Rapper. At least Frank Porter-inspired "The Visitation" (which itself was a deeply flawed film) was a mobile phone that gathered in the movie premises. "Unwanted" has not started anywhere where it starts, which is a huge isolation. <br /> <br /> for acting? Support ranging from moderately to horror to acting. (Rebecca St James is a bit part dramatic and passable.) In their part, some key characters are manned in sufficient quantities. Sadly, their genius is incredible in order to lose one dimensional character in their personality. "Drama" is anything but; You know that it is bad when you find the most vocal Christian character in the picture to be the most curious of two Christian viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a final note on the sound of the Gospel of this movie, which will show more interest to Christians than non-Christian readers. A word, it's embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmen's "champion" and the couture "The Hangman's Curse" have been able to communicate in a truly incompatible portrait of Christian faith without promotional or oppressive words. On the contrary, this film is a Slaghammer, which seems very heavy tool, and a Christian lacks it difficult to accept it seriously. <br /> <br /> I believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I appreciate the efforts of making good Christian films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film, "Mercy's Road," the "champion" above, or "Sent" (if you are Pentecostal) of Robert Duvall's provocative. Please consider. <br /> <br /> for "unknown?" You must hire it, but screen it before showing it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
