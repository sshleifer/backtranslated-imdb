Very annoying..I do not take care of your body's ant-guard bone, this baby sucks ... and do not go and see it because I've mentioned it, save it for the "Empire" of Warhol, it's far more entertaining !! I saw other bad films which were a lot better, so I was fascinated why it was considered a "masterpiece". As an industrial historian, I had to consider the basic works of Marcel Ducham, Chris Birden and Damien Hart, and I still see artistic intentions, even quality and recreational aspects for their art rendering. "India song" - It's not even soft-porn - Anus was almost here - G-rate slideshow - and a voice-over that is not related to slide shows / movies ... shit and even campy ... Sadly just a bore And 2 hours a waste. To add humiliation to injury, I saw the print fade and the hell was scratched !!! (Harvard Film Archive), I'd like to see the "annoying entertaining" I see the Bunkey !! Yes "India song" - keep your head from the late modernity and be really annoyed !! See 70 porn movies, cut all the good parts and turn the word down, you will get "India song" but no annoying music or comments will be available except for the cinematography and horror consonants !!!
