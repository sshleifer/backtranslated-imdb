This movie is very difficult to understand, why couples want to divorce? No reason is given, we do not know anything about their lives in Lisbon, nor do I know anything about Mari's work. We can only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life. We do not know who took the initiative to seek divorce. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In the 90's, I saw some Japanese films reminding me that, in fact, it would have to acknowledge the expression of other cultures in relation to it. I do not know whether this story will suit a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> Someone can see the logic of the view but the result is a burqa, but I decided to finally see it because I wanted the soul and it got all the money. Actually, I just realized that the story of these two animals is not yet finished because the train left the station without killing. These are a few for so long! I can not recommend this work.
