This comedy is a new approach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are French names in Paris, and characters. Louise Aubind, for example ... played by Bob Hoskins? The film also played French Jeff Goldblom and Natasha Richardson in the same way. The conditions are the same and the characters work in a few years ago, such as the Kerry-on film. <br /> <br /> I believe that these actors - those who do not try to act in French to act as these actors, cover them with a wide variety of English dance comedies, and keeping the bloomin 'mystery obscure to the audience. <br /> <br /> In the humorous section, it is virtually the Algorogno Round Table, ISN. <br /> <br /> The film tries to be charming and curious, and I think these features are fun. Doc is not as interesting as the soup or love and death, probably more interesting than Deer Hunter or Blesshepe Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is an example of personal filmmaking. It does not make any real effort to reach and share with viewers, but it is true in its premises and its internal arguments. Although all the facts are unbelievable, they are logical in the film's own intimate world. <br /> <br /> I usually like this kind of bright movie, but I found it very slowly, tedious, and very little delightful surprises or genuine intelligence. It's just guessable and sophomoric in kind of manners, and some excellent talent waste along the way. It will be the few points in each major star's career, who are otherwise prominent players. I found it the greatest waste of talent from Betsy, and I have never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in these things. So, call it an interesting miss, and if you pass it as a lot then you really do not have much time to kill then rent. <br /> <br />
