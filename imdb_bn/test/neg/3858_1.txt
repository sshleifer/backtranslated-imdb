There is a famous short story about a man who has been a victim of a Safari predator, who has lost interest in hunting other than humans. It's quite good, and it has been done and the film and TV have been renewed many times. Some notable, but this urban version, that exhausted tired old racism theme, just stinks out flat. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as unfunny scripts. Chaplin, this guy is not. There will be people who can not stop the fun dance, I think it's funny in a tricky way, but it is not enough to carry a movie. Whatever you want to think about the usual Nazi Holdawar or Neo-Nazi, we would like to think, type villain, who must be boyfriend, German accent ... to get the picture?
