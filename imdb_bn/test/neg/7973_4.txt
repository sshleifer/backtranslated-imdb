When Kristy Swanson gets the attack of guiltts about what she wants, she wants out. Unfortunately, Madsen is one of its best companies, "There is no alternative to two weeks' notice." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But as a killer on the runner ... well, stay on Kristy. Run, run away! This image is not an idea that has never been done before, but it's better! <br /> <br /> I do not want to see this rest of the film, but I felt that if I wanted to give this movie a review. I always liked Madden, and his character was somewhat expected, but surely the time was lost while watching and making this movie ... It is no surprise that it was not released in the theater!
