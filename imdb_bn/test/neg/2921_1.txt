I'm thinking of some things for this movie: First, really a very bad movie. This is really "Superbad". The film looked very optimistic in the trailers but it was flat ... probably the original idea was good, but a bad script and bad acting movie became annoying and empty. My advice will not waste your valuable time of 2 hours. You have been warned. This is the first movie I rated IMDB.com at 1 star rating ... Second, no character is preferred. You do not really care what happened to them ... Third, Villene is very easy to detect. The grandson kills his father, resembles a friend's son, gives the maiden pregnancy, rebukes his grandfather ... The jee says, "If you like bad without any punishment, this is your movie". Say nothing else
