If you have heard any of the books in James Lieu on tapes or CDs and reader Will Patan you can agree with me that Will Dave R.'s personality <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones portrayed a local Texan (or so I heard) and no Texan good IMHO, but he is not a Cajun. All of her delivery is wrong. I have lived in the state for a number of years and I have heard strange poems in Louisiana. I thought that Stevenberg was a good choice for Bootsi, but I could see Claytas (who would be thrown out? Rock? Mickey Roche? Anyone, he would be big). <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was only 4 - the plots had flopped out of the water like fish and were not quite attractive, non-<br /> <br /> I hope, another JLB book from Hollywood Try, the "best car to elicion fields" will be a good choice. We will see some of the best villains ever from JLB.
