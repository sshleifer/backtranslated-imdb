Paul Majorsky misfires in this movie. Writing, direction, casting and acting (including Victorio Gassman's exceptions) are all marked off. I remember middle-class reviews 20+ years ago, but I think it may still be appropriate. With the remarkableness of Susan Sarandan, Raul Julia (who practiced most of his scenes) and John Cosvettes, I realized that much more. Music for Music is to make confusion between Jaring, New York and Greece, and overall speed is going to be preferred. Why Paul Mazaraski felt the need to update this story, or adding his touch is annoying - this resume of Prospero and his daughter imports very little, and added more. The game is not in the best of Shakespeare, and it does not decide to make it even better. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this movie.
