It seems to be a good way to get more insight into a book created for the Television version of the Heart of Darkness, it was a misconception. The movie has made it even worse. I was extremely disappointed about everything around the movie. I hope this movie will probably help to bring together pieces of book that I did not understand, but it did not do that. It still confused me and left hanging. This is a movie that one feels that it would be more fun to see the grass instead of seeing the movie. Just do not have someone's cup cup. It was an overall horrible, annoying and slow movie. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Disease must have been very disappointed to start when he decided that he already wanted to do the job of moving the annoying book to the movie. . This is a sure loss. It's going to a knife war, but forgetting the knife in the kitchen counter. The worst person is going to lose; And in the case, the neutral person was Roeg. Everything I heard about the movie is bad, and the film is about to tell those bad things about it. Looking at the film, I found the idea that those who made the film just got knocked down in the book to get the key points. However, the film follows the book of the original book, it has left several details, and this is the last change. I'm not a fan of that. Marlow and his crew came across the camp of the Russian sailors when Roe left, and in the camp they found the book. When they said that they came across the sign in the camp, it was not shown that "Wood for you, take action quickly." Use caution (Conrad 110). Also, at the end of the book, Kurtz died in boats, or at an internal station. <br /> <br /> In contrast, Nicholas did a good thing while making his movie; He managed to hire some beautiful decent actors to play in the movies. For example, he earned Team Roth and John Malkovic, both of whom are going to succeed later. In this way, he added a little something to the horror movie. Also, although I have scattered his books, I have some respect for him, because the courage of the Heart of Darkness takes much effort. This is not the easiest novel to be portrayed in a film. Yet a brave attempt! In conclusion, if anyone wants to watch this movie, for any reason, I first recommend reading Heart of Darkness. In this way, you will get all the scenes outside the movie and you will not be completely lost while watching it. But I really recommend that you do not read the book and you really do not see the movie; Both will be a complete waste of your time. Trust me I was forced to do both of my English teachers, and now I do not want books and movies to exist. If the book or movie is followed, good luck!
