Chilean Pamara is tired of doing movies and knows some of the music in the success. As half of Mafiaso half-expert talks, he wants to get into the music market. However, everyone knows like him and it will be difficult to expect as much to record the good singer Linda Chand for a hit. The first part is filled with fun and satirical, this one falls into easy joke and has much less good moments. Only two women (Uma and Million) are suitable in their part. Most movies are filled with heterrionic characters, excessive exaggerated (few are OK, very disgusting) and only anyone who can save is a homosexual bodyguard, who is at least coherent, others are too stupid. The most wonderful thing is that the movie is not annoying, everything becomes so fast and if you want to follow the film then there are many things you do not have time to get bothered. It may insult your intelligence (much!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But, well, it's not annoying.
