Star Ratings: ***** Jodi Marsh **** Michelle Marsh * Kim Marsh * Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Castler is not like bad actors like Steven Siegel (Kevin) But ....... Aaaahah, you will get it) Robin Hood (Well, you can play with Brian Adams background ... ... no, you can hear it), a person who steals a blood money and runs from a narcotic seller Down orphans b LA to keep using it. But now he has come forward to run a haystay van in Las Vegas, one of the things before the retired job. But, of course, it all goes wrong and he will make the top boys and the paties for the big boys in prison. Here he meets a man named (although you do not know about paying attention to the movie) Ice Cool (trach), with which he is friends and ends up breaking into prison. Once free, he has to prove his innocence, find out the meaning of the missing and, naturally, go with those who have created him! <br /> <br /> All of Segual's recent live video films, the look of Today You Die, in its entirety, including his past films such as Half Paste Dead and Exaggate Wounders, is a rap star as his co-star. Yes, it seems as if he is not making films with environmental care, he is claiming to be acting with black and wrappers. But TYD is not a movie movie, and it's not a luxury theme that the block is under 3 (sometimes!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attention but it's the fastest mountain Goes. Once seagal hit the prison, the plot quickly loses its partner. In fact, Trach's character popped out somewhere without any role as his sidekick, and from there you quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> This is it. I know I said it before but I think I mean this time. I do not seem to be going directly to any video on Sigal films at any time. I have no enthusiasm just watching Shadow Man. Actually, I can honestly say that I did not enjoy any of his Stevie films till this point, and today you die, exceptionally, indifferent, annoying efforts can not be avoided at all. *
