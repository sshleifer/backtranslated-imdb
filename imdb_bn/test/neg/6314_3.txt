Lots of spoilers You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was completely frustrated, this is my first street fighter movie (I still do not have the courage to go around 1994). In contrast to most Japanites, the Street Fighter Zero (ALPHA) draws very little attention. The tragedy was done brilliantly on the boards (heard violet a cheerful) and the drama, especially to the end, is to control everything in his fight against his brother when there is too much mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> The warrior, Ryu, has inscribed a much darker version inside myself. Suddenly a little brother's sudden disappointment in the dark control! A movie street fight contest is held more than just a fight on the motto of the motto. <br /> <br /> What is with the drawing of the artist's feet? Excellent impressive an anime pulled up on the stomach. The soft nature of the story makes the Strait Fighter General very intelligent and emphasizes a character (listen), which is not even a warrior of video games! More than one character research is completely ignored by the main street fighters. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? Street Fighter Zero Video Game Lack of Imagination.
