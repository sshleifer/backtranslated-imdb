I saw this program a few times and see it more, less I like it. She was approached to claim Jamie Lynn Spiers as her sister in Britain and I want to say that it is obvious on the show. They have created the character Joe for everything they want to believe in Jamie Lynn, cute, real, smart, beautiful, popular, etc. The characters around him make his appearance better, then more smart, more popular than the boys more than the boys. There is nothing original about this and it has been pumped with money, so among the best fashion and stuff of every child. For the 13-year-old (or older, she can not be older) she wear very mature clothes, those small skirts are very small, they want to wear them to the youth, and make-up to everyone, why young girls get so much trouble Growing issues add up. The only thing I would say is that in the beginning, Jamie sings the lyrics of Lynn's achievement and, given her age, not bad, she is much better than her sister, it comes in the voice case. Sorry, it's very mature and still very dumbed down. It has played with lines of poorly predictable stories and too much stereotyping is going on.
