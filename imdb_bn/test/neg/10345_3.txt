The idea behind dead silence is great: zombie prevalence takes place during a crazy Pannonia radio talk show. This is so much for the film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies created their appearance, all lost. <br /> <br /> This picture is ridiculous and only those with a passion for Chess, B-Flick awful it will enjoy. Zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting a spectacular house for elementary students. <br /> <br /> I know this a brief review, but I do not see the need to invest a lot in this. This is a stupid movie. You have been warned.
