I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It looks helpless to me, as much as I was looking at Penelope Cruz, and the details of the plot often worked badly. It seemed like an intense sex film: If gender roles are reversed, in almost every sense, this movie is in operation to complain. Not only that the main man is portrayed as a complete quarrel and a sexual predator, but the woman is portrayed as flawless, which constitutes an ostrich community, which lacks any conflict and which relies on shamelessness and good humor. Utopias turned out to be one of the notoriously dull and this one exception. But it is also interesting to notice what is happening (and here comes the plot off, though it talks about a very basic scene) when the teenage girl kills her father. (1) Her mother runs for her duty and (2) the girl does not regret (and actually her mental life disappears from the film). This is not a magnificent killer, though the Alodomavar camera relies on blood on the bloodstream, although it makes an attractive painter, and then it does not eat the blood of the baby or the mother, even if it becomes either physically or emotionally bloody and is visually impaired. The film then again released another man's murder, and again it was a murderous film which is sincerely supported by this film. In short, Wolver is an ideally managed film which is unexpected and is actually an unfavorable ideology and so I write an ideological criticism. But without that, it's not just very interesting. It does not have any depth, talking to him in Aldomovar, which I like.
