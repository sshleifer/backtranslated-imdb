To cut this film, people are becoming cold and dull like it, which is not it. This movie was thought to be 11th in the ocean. It is said by many cast members and director Steven Soderberg. Ocean 12, when it was the lack of a sticky plot, it was broken because it was different from what people wanted. If it is released before the ocean 11, it is not as a separate seagel, it will be taken very differently. The problem with Sequels is that people should look like it and go into it with a preset idea and have many prospects. They should go through an open mind in this movie and should not expect it to be "Ocean 11, again".
