Bollywood movies are mostly not for me, but they are still very favorite and Bollywood is a big file maker like their own fans. <br /> <br /> How much of a movie that shows me the film can change or influence the American American actress based on the Indian film based on. It has not only changed the story of the film, this mix is ​​a few funny happenings. <br /> <br /> I mean that it is very common for Indian movies to see unreasonable hops, because they have their own movie in the movie. But once you see such an event, it laughs with America. For the glory of God you can believe that a famous American actress is stuck in despair and feels oppressed. Can you imagine that an American actress has fallen in love with a dancer whose American lover's boyfriend has already fallen in love with American lover and at the same time they meet each other. There was a lot of similar things to mention. Said less well. <br /> <br /> Probably I was wrong because I had a lot of hope from Indian cinema.
