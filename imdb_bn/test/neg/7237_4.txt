I hate the first movie really annoying and we'll see octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The bodies found in the port of New York have been found. Nick and his colleagues realize that the police has no source or suspect until the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the Police Captain, refused to believe Nick's story, and soon the boat will be filled with boats for the celebration on July 4 ... <br /> <br /> In this film we see more giant octopus and the special effects of this movie Really good for her time. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bad but not very good but it's okay and able to see. <br /> <br /> There are some really cheese scenes in the film, but if it ends, you will have to enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
