- There are main spoilers <br /> <br /> Clearly, this film has definitely created many connections. I can not see it any other way. Am I really surprised that anyone does not use Alan Smith's name, and more surprisingly, everyone does not use this name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, where will it start? Worse conversations, continuous clothing, tragic movie stock, curious comedy, top notch and more dissonance than George W. Bush's college career. I did not know what was fun, the guy was losing his hand due to the snow, or the slow scene where all the kids were being killed by Jack Frosts. Also, one of the best lines of all time in this movie has been mentioned. "How do we know him?" Like a mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with Snowball! A great camp film, but overall a very bad film.
