This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo drama, but my modest opinion is a terrible one. Jaran tried to change the character's personality to start. After long stuck on the island, he thought Miranda was insane, Prospero was no different from him - a mixture of crazyness and self-confidence in his part. I did not think that Shakespeare thought of reminiscing his characters to Jarman. <br /> <br /> The only thing that got the appearance of Caliban was that, but again, I thought that Caliban turned out to be a painful, perverted monster but an insane rambling, the northerner is constantly cackling, I would not have imagined him . Ferdinand shows a brief look, mostly silent and salty. <br /> <br /> In fact, I stopped showing this horrific campaign, so much of the game has been spent on their game. If anything, I think Jarman is trying to rewrite Shakespeare and most of his time to include his own scenes. In the first part, many texts are cut that it is Shakespeare's play, but the composer of the 70s loads the incoherent garbage. <br /> <br /> Trying to explain this game more realistically, but this game was not a realistic one and it is created like nothing appears in text.
