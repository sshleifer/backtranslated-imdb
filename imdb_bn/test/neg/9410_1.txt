This movie was completely and vaguely terrible. The plot was so anticipated and annoying and the script was so stupid and frightening that I wanted to throw my eyes with the earliest pen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but I was surprised to get positive reviews. Although I acknowledge that in some parts of the play was right, script deficits were far better than exceeding good acting. The only reason I saw it was because some of my friends watched it, it was probably made as the worst movie, trial by the trailer. We were not at least frustrated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brandon: I want to get your mind, your heart, your soul. I can not see you wearing any pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll rate this movie as the worst movie I've ever seen, which took itself seriously.
