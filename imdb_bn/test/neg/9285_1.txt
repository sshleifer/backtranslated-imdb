I saw a small channel late in the night and I kept it for a smile or two hope. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I think he can be a good actress / actor in Richard Pearl's style. <br /> <br /> I could not be more wrong. This concert was awful. This is a platform full of racist comments described in white people, Muslims and people of India (Muslim and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and Ramdhan, a cleaned code-view (Lawrence, many black comics and directors, can not resist). Desire to preach time. During the start-up comedy show, do we really need lectures for Martin Luther King and civil rights struggle?). Then her horrific comments were designed to make her restrained with the woman, she heard him on my skin. Worst, the show was not funny and I found it boring. I crossed half way and came back to find him or her child's birth and to preach about the birth of his child (there was no humor in the story of his child's birth and it was self-motivated in his part) to contact us for details. He did not say anything explicitly or he could have cut this section of this section). <br /> <br /> This show was garbage: Runtel!
