Because it came from HBO and based on IMDB rating, I saw the first season of this series, what is the waste Characters are sometimes interesting but most cartoon-like. Acting is better with STRONGA than medieval genius. Not only the prisoners, visitors should give up all hope of the cell that believes in this story, it is a dung that will require an extraordinarily powerful test to keep you under observation. Violence, as with most of the story's development, is titled and what is considered morality is the light diversity. Though your idea is included in the fantastic television, OZ will be included in the written, acting and overall production quality seen in Sopranos, Deadwood or Six FEET. If you want to see digitalland annotate xerox, see oz. Such a stuffgy gives a bad name.
