This movie, "Demerit Mejours", was ... I'm not sure how to put it into words. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I can not stop smiling at how ridiculous. I love Michael Keaton, and in fact he does not realize that he did it. They did a good job to maintain my attention because I could not wait to be so ridiculous that minute minutes. I actually registered on this site so that I could get this. I do not review movies. I do not have time to do this, but I can not tell that I have not done my civil duty to citizens (those who have 85 and more IQ), they know that it is not a action / thriller, it is good religious fun. You've got my thrills in fear that people actually did this. See a good movie like a million dollar baby. Clint Eastwood's performance is not fantastic, but at the end I was saying. Exercise Your Brain America!
