It was a weird film. A bit awkward and of course the film is silent. After seeing some fifth columnist and mysteriously showing the Manuar Colombo (Bela Lugosi), they started to die with Japanese stains in their hands. <br /> <br /> Soon Lone Ranger comes to FBI agent Richard's 'Dick' Martin (Client Moore). Martin is vulnerable to the murder of a murderer, because he is more interested in a missing doctor's brother (Joan Barclay) who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies, the doctor is very horrified, arranged by some strange serum, true story of the party comes out and where it gets interesting and weird. I will not spread it. <br /> <br /> Lugoshi was wonderful as shiny killer.
