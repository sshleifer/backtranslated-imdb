I saw the first 15 minutes and I can say that there is no advice with any kind of military personnel. The feature of Judith Lite (an officer) is laid on her hair! The first officer who receives him before leaving the medical facility he runs, has a weight more so that his pants become pocket gap! No - they were not given any military advice in this film. Even a former military may be a booster here.
