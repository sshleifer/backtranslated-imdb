If you come to know something about depression in this movie, forget it: you do not learn anything except writing a screenplay on the subject. I realized how serious depression could transform a person into complete debris, but the result was a diminished character that I have ever seen in the feature of Hollywood ... no small achievement. Christina Ricchi as Elizabeth, crying out at the top of her lungs, insulting someone by crying, spraying tears, or three compounds (only the exceptions are somewhat calm at the beginning and at the end). There is no indication of what he may be without depression ... he does not shy strange in any other aspect of his personality ... he just screams. At one point, his roommate told him, "Lei, you're so much fun when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "What's that?" It seems impossible that the author will include this comment without giving us an example, but this script is a lesson for misconduct. It has no discernible structure or flow; Instead, it's a series of strangely strung lizzie screams together in a series of scenes, then ended. Character development? No ... the scene of his daily existence, like going to class, perhaps it could be important information? No ... scream at the highest volume? Check out. It's not enough, I'm afraid. 1/10
