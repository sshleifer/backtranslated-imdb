This image is sometimes one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prezudis. If it is a filmmaker and Jane Austen is alive, then he wants to remove his name from the film. Austin's novel is simply the story of the true love development between Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzelium Dariusz, supernaturally. This is a commentary on Regency Britain's class structure. This picture only focuses on the love story, which makes frustrating spectators hope that it will judge the novel. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the film's historic accuracy. In this movie, the dance that Darcy Elizabeth graduated is not a public concert, which includes Bennett, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy family, but rather a lower-dance dance. They could not dance to dancing dance to the farmer Banar. Costume and hair problems are, too. According to the practice of marriage, married women wear white robes for their hair cut and women wear knit when going outside. In the public the Regency era women were not so liberated to override bounty requirements. The worst historical mistake Elisabeth (his nightgown and quote) in the morning morning and Mr. Darcy (Sense Cravat and Vest) that they recognize their love for each other. It is a void freedom with the novel. No respected young girl or woman comes out of the garment door or does not want to show anyone in the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the ostensite dialogue and the latest modern dialogue hazard Austen does not need any help from the author for the conversation, who thinks he can write like Austin. The author of the non-Austen dialogue Austin's talent was not only poor, but Austin's style also has no sense. <br /> <br /> The best for acting is done by Judy Denn, who clearly understands the absurdity of democracy. Brenda Bluthin took some freedom to make Mrs. Bennet less frightening than Austen's photo. His pictures are interesting and seem to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His influential British accent is terrible and he is like a 20th-century father. At the end of the 18th century, Bennet gave a picture of his father. Matthew McFaudin's Darcy filming plane. I can not imagine that someone is falling in love with Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a beautiful Elizabeth, but Elizabeth Bennett's screenplay is very modern. Nightly draws attention to Elizabeth's simplicity, but her screenplay only lacks understanding of social crises and conferences of time. Prior to trying to illustrate Elizabeth and before studying the behavior of women of that time, she used to do a good job reading the novel. <br /> <br /> If someone makes a movie of a period, one must be true. Duration This film needed a historical adviser who really knew something about the Regency period. It was also necessary for a writer who realized and appreciated Austen's text better. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decided to take Pride and a Prizudiss film in the near future to remove this hatred from our mind. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it has many beautiful scenes in the English countryside. Chatsworth is better used as Pemberly (it was 1995 adaptation of BBC). But beautiful scenery and beautiful actors can not save this film. Austen's true fans will look at the home page to see the textbook of Asten to see the DVD of the BBC product DVDs of Jebiffer Ahel and Colin Firth in 1995 or to erase this version from their mind.
