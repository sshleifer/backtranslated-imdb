When I was a boy, I saw this movie (before WWII) and it was astonishing that there was a copy of the local library. Sixty years later I saw it again and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that is not a movie of "A". No editing, poor script, poor acting and many directions. Even the witch has turned over for years as to how should not even be as high as a "B". I think I basically saw it when it was good.
