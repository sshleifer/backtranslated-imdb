I was looking forward to watching this movie, it seems like nobody saw it. I was totally disappointed. The acting was so overdone. The script writer collected 25 different scripts from different movies and randomly selected the dialogue and pieced them together to form a plagized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: There was no cliche left in this movie? The group's hits, homosexuality, prostitution, a series killer, fire, numerous godfather wannabees, main character of love with prostitution, torture by the police, torture, Hannibal Lechter style were mutilations, and I could go on. <br /> <br /> Like the line (Falling in Godfather's prostitution) <br /> <br /> - "Ben Senen Eric Kelismani Estermium" (I do not want to work anymore) <br /> <br> Callisam kirai kim odesek? " (If I do not work, the hirer should give it) <br /> <br /> While we did not see a policeman during the serial killer scene, his father took him to police and abused for several weeks when the main character disappeared. . <br /> <br /> The only way I can understand this whole movie is if my version of the scene is critically edited from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and to take care of it, anyone will be happy to discuss it further with them. <br /> <br />
