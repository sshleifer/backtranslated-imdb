Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for Spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, is not it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know that he could not be a murderer too close; He and a student witnessed the first murders. So, there is no doubt that Professor is the killer. The final explanation of the mystery is to have a long, tiring build up. The solution is interesting, but it does not come anywhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a small film) is not exciting enough for your interest. Even in the tradition of "wrong people accused" it failed, because police never seriously blames the professor, and the killer is never after him. Soft, dull, dull
