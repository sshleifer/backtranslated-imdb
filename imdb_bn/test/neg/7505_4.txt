The zombie planet feels like an example of overstepping good ideas and pretty ambition budget. I had genuine original and gnarly to explain for zombies, and showcased munching dogs in the scene. The rest was effective in the low budget, but there was a lot of difference in the film. The problem was that it was very long and anti-climatic. Sure, they are an incentive, if derivative plot line and similar familiar but quiet setting, but a low-budget zombie movie should be really gorgeous to create an impression and it did not have enough red moment for me. Especially I was looking for cheap and especially in small amounts especially in bloodless war scenery surpluses. Plus, for two hours of film, very little is off at the end, and even though it wants me to track Platinum Planet 2, I think in my mind. So perhaps most of them are looking at two pricing.
