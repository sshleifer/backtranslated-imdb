*** Matching spinners *** Dear Inman, I find it hard to find vocal words for the film to describe. Problems for my remembered problems are broad and painful. . . Yet I feel that like the others, refraining from tolerating the same annoyance. This is not a film for anyone under the age of 50, it is sloooowwwww, soooooo slow slow, and when the big reunion of Add and Inman is made. . The biggest and most important scene in the film, nothing happens, it is an epic letdown. Now, like the director, I will keep my words brief and upright with this alert, your film is isolated, annoying, no flow and Jude's law has been harmful, he showed more passion as the AI ​​robot. - Be cautious, the film should be retitled. . . Bored Mountain. Love, add
