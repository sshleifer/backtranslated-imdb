This entry does not contain a spoiler. Do not do it. The movie is predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first alien movie was something that could be a doubt. It was in the first two predecessors, although it was less common. Requiem has completely removed the mystery element and replaced it with blood and eagerness. You know people are going to die (well duh, it's an AVSP movie), but you know who will die and when they are going to die, and where they are going to die before it happens. The director should take a hikko education that said, "Suspense is not a bomb under a table. Suspense does not go under a bomb table". When do you know what will happen to any event and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes to the video and wait it till RENT IT, but in no way will I buy it.
