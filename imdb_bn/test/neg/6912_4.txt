When I saw this movie, I returned home from work after noon. I love horror movies and some have seen really cheesy ones, but this takes the cake. The plot presented to the audience at the beginning of the film seems a bit curious, but due to the film's progress, the script creates a bad turn with terrible clich√©s and bad presentation, which makes the movie completely dull and annoying. I do not mean to keep scripts and plot criticism, because I believe that is not the worst part. Acting to start acting was not terrible and I was very good with Taylor Lock, it's one of her first movies. The worst part of the film was special effects. They expected less budget, and demolished the viewer's view, even if they were simply interested in the plot. I suggest you see this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate the author and the director well.
