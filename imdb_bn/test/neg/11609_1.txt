After watching this film on a pretext of a very 82-minute film, and when I saw another "James Wee Will Bay Love" James Tobacco-directed mess, I wanted to open the eyes, I came to the conclusion that he is the best agent in the world. How horribly written, painfully managed pieces can be made in the first place. <br /> <br /> I like Robert Doni Jr., but probably because of being in this film, he has been made an abusive substance. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham will be embarrassed about his junkyfide performance. Half a day on the camera, he just looks at a riddle <br /> <br /> <br /> Such a vague script Prepare yourself for the Hollywood name-dropping gallery (for example: Dingle Washington's acting ... etc) <br/> Joseph Hell's novel Catch-22 is a great character called Dunbar. He spends most of the time in the novel Shooting Skit, which he abhors. I asked why he hates so much, why he always shoots Skit, he answers that it creeps by time, and he has one more life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time spent, see this film! I swear ... it will take longer than the epic of David Lin for 4 hours for 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> I hope I will not see another James Tubbak film again. If I could give this star, I would like to.
