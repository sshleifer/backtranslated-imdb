This was the most terrible movie I had to sit through. 30 minutes in the film and I could not take it anymore. Seriously, if you do not have any sensible thinking or do not want any of that pseudo-aunty type, do not bother it until it is like a triangle so that they can feel more sanskrit. Boring is fine though acting; The kid is just plain annoying. Some scenes are a little weird with very weird close up. I do not know why they did the whole movie black and white, but they were optimistic about how they could impact. There was nothing to see, and even though it is a tragic story, it seems so stupid that it is difficult to feel any sympathy for the characters.
