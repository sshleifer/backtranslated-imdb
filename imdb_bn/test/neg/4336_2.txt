Talk about a bore-snore. This 3rd rate biker movie comes as soon as I come to the screen. The shame is that among them there are many actors from George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriquesen, and William Forcesite. <br /> <br /> Western classics, hi noon, it's basically a story of a former US military green bit (Henriksen) that helped her get rid of a horse town in a gang of violent bikes. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, but the script grade school level. Kennedy sees Edmine Award from Out-Standing Performance in a Cool Hand Look at such a comedown. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem in sleeping at night, it will be a perfect movie video to pay rent .......... You will never sleep!
