I'm a regular reader of Kathy Reese's Temperance Brainn. In this way I was very surprised to consult with this event. <br /> <br /> It's fierce than the book. The character of Temperance Brainen is in the book, the alcoholics of an infant college and the rest of the divorced mother under the earth. In 'Bones', she is a proud (rimes with richness), who is usually in PC fashion, not mother. Completely opposite the book with its complete information about the emphasis on his assistant staff, who have so many sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> In total feeling of the PC movement, he as a peace lover to the enemies of the US (!) Some information is not even right, for example, having a character as an active member of an Arab American friendship group from Afghanistan. When is the Afghan a Arab ?! I am convinced that negative references to 'distressed minorities', or women, or GLBT have been created, show producer / writer / directors should apologize. However, generally many left-fashioned ethnic slurs, the highest achieving minority group - as in Asia, the David Boreanaz agent's booth continually refers to Angela Montenegro as a 'squint'. <br /> <br /> That stuff, and forget about this show. After the 'The Man in the SV' episode, I thought I wanted to see if I would try any other episode. It just got worse! Q: I do not care too much about suicide or suicide in response to teenage questions, and I will never see this show.
