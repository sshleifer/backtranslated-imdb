If this picture won the Lumiare prize for the best French-language film, but what kind of garbage is coming from France this day? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are kept as an economic prisoner of the supposed international organization to help them. Most African countries pay almost 40% of the public budget, but their people suffer from disease, uncertainty and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the matter is treated in the most dry condition. This film can be thought of as compared to Sahara - people compared to Sahara - compared to Dryer. I'm approaching "documentary" and "trial", which is more nominated than any documentary (and I'm a successive fan) and lack of action-due, "prisoner" banks and IMF in the film. Some critics can set up sites in color visual visual acids, but they did not have any supplemental soundtracks while on screen. They are better than coffee table books compared to this photo. <br /> <br /> Even the characters of the film say something like "This trial is annoying" and "When will it end?" Everyone laughs at the theater. People who are reading our mind on the screen? <br /> <br /> There was a brief appearance of Danny Glover in this film. It was a television movie between "Bamako" and it was established in Morocco or Mali. It was more ridiculous than Spaghetti-Western, I have ever tried to avoid. This was the only part of the five minutes of the lost minutes where a Caucasian bad guy accidentally carries a baby in an African woman and does not show any remorse. Perhaps it has embarrassed the World Bank's dissatisfaction and how it unknowingly killed Africans. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I have already put the movie in front of you. False will not be fooled by. No need to see this film. You will not get this two hours back in your life.
