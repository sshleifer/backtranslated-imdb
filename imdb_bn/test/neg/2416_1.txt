Bad films are bad and bad-bad-movies and enjoyable movies are bad ... it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> As part of "Greenhouse Cinema", I saw it in screening at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles on 14 November 2006. This theater puts every month. Hope publisher Eric Caiden & Co. Think twice before the writer / director Laurinis Fouls is closer to them. What a con man The man stood up to talk before the movie - you thought he was talking about Osros Wells "Evil Touch" or any other lost classics. Hardly She liked it to take time for 20 minutes with her disliked Rampal. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Angel House" and "Death Wish" but if you "revenge" or "clever" "you will be for a sad disappointment The script makes zero sense .. What is the picture that is so poor that the actors feel ashamed and what is the best thing to do in the movie Car Curfew? <br /> <br /> Bad Richard "Shutte" Rundetry. In the movie he directed another character with the first character of "John", but his only character here is the classic, which is described in the classic, and hopefully this film will be able to rent it for another month. Includes Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste, even among audiences it seems. (Except one spag-boy who sits behind, who is five minutes "Oah" and his girlfriend who opens his mouth, giggles with the encouragement of the neighboring conversation Barbie). <br /> <br /> For real movies about Vigilants, I would suggest the following: <br /> <br /> I want to die, second, third, exile I, Vigilant Force, Miss 45, Rolling Thunder, The No-Mercy Man (next two years Before the theater was presented a pair of movies - most likely, "budget", but both are the same as the budget was a million times better!)
