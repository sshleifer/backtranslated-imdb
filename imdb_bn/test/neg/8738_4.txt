Master Plan: There is a winning team in a deadly tournament. One of the few martial arts action photos to try to keep the smell of the famous "Enter the Dragon" from 73 is a South African effort. The villain's castle is a little different, being seen as a white castle fort at a distance in the middle of the desert. Villain himself, Baron or General, a slightly more reversed version of "Dr. no" or Master Villa's Han Mold with strange flashbacks in the glorious days of Nazi Germany. She wear full regalia Nazi uniform in some points. His main ambition in life is to keep an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese opponent, to increase their cooperation in World War II (their army is better than your army). It sounds stupid and it works around crazy and crazed machismo suggestions, though. Central Hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), is similar to the character of a white 'Bruce Lee', similarly greasy, impressive nature, though it is clearly not the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought he would be some secret government agent here but obviously not. He and his girlfriend have joined the Baron team of fighters, but they decided to resign (what do they think they are coming?) Of course, this is not easy. There is a strange sequence in them that escapes through the desert using a debris car with a desert - it can do wonders for the wind in the desert. It looks like <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To be hostage. The most striking character is chico, a dwarf who is a villain; He is loyal to Baron, but sympathetic to the hero's plight. Most of the war uses power like hero ballet, with plenty of lapping and slow motion. Sound FX becomes more resistant to an effort to make more impact and is too narrow. During the tournament there are some good fights in Claymax, but no one is standing like this. Someone picked, but I think the best is that Baron's brutal muscle man-Henman was delayed in the story (he followed the car at one point). You will be disappointed that the hero will finally get him out, since most of the brutality is frustrating. The acting is very middle-aged, as far as the girl is entering the camp, she laughs for any reason, as if she is on grass, although she is very beautiful. Some of the training scenes have campuses, especially those who run or run on desert rays. And, with such a title, there are amazing few real killings. As Steve Chase, Ryan returned as a continuation of the series "Kill And Kail Go" series as the traditional agent.
