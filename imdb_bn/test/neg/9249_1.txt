Acting is weird and awesome, and not in a good way ... at all. Chemistry in writers, dialogues, and actors is horrible. Nothing understands and looks up to 3 or 4 seconds long, it looks like a Mexican soap opera (telenovela) up to the expression or expression of the actor. Everything is unrealistic in writing, and all the actors involved make it even worse with the script's explanations of the script. I saw this ??? Centuries have been used to describe the use of the word Chess to describe this Canadian disaster. The director watched the final cut before entering the air ???
