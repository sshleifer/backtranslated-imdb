Now, I love Italian horror films. They cheesier, well. However, this Chinese is not Italian. Rolling meatballs with this old spaghetted sauce this week. It's amateur hours of each level No doubt, there is no danger, only a few drops of blood have spread, which reminds you that you are actually watching horror movies. "Special effects" When the ghost (or which is supposed to be) is near, the lights change and a string bed cloths are pulled up and down. Oh, can you feel cold? DVD quality is a VHS transfer (which actually helps more than the film's pain). Dubbing is the lowest "bad Italian movie quality" even below and I've given it a star because dialogue is so delightful! And finally when we are surprised, what do we discover (one minute and the next night on a scene) ... well, I will not loot it for anyone I want to see, but let's just say it is not very "novel"!
