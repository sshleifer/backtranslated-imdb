This very light retailing of Carmen started in a high note with a sophisticated, sexually-explicit dance among the Seinglis prisoner "Carmen" and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minute did not shine in a coherent movie. One minute Carmen is a sex hunter, later danced in protest of his inept government, and then suddenly he is a runner on the ocean ... even though the film blames Kodu for posting the first animated bi-rational "Carmen". The broad strokes fill the African version of a Bollywood musical with its "uneducated" matching array of "Basic-Institutes" matching, so that its colors are so narrow and unsupported that the film is closed as schizophrenic.
