I hired it after I left the video cassette in 1995. After seeing again, there was not much change about my idea. <br /> <br /> I was an old man and I am still an adult! Lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other critics did not bother me. This is not a documentary, it is a fantasy story where animals can speak! <br /> <br /> Although I do not care about many songs, I like it at the end of the photo where it sings Barry Manilo and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people think it is an excuse for its primitive animation that CGIIT is not often used in animated features, but do not forget that the Lion King was released annually. It was probably even better than before and any animated features! <br /> <br /> But I think it seems pretty beautiful that PEBLELE and PINGOIN became cheaper when Lion King was' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> High points for me in today's days, as well as the mystery made by some dangerous (most of the water) chasing scenes today. <br /> <br /> I also like a music note page and a little bit of love story which is an early look. But most of the time the story was dragged and boring. <br /> <br /> If you like animations, if you are an adult and do not take risk, then get another Walt Disney product instead. this!
