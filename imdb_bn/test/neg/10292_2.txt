Important Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick, boring movie ... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chamber Lynch, who wrote it. I do not know why I gave the rating 2 to this movie. This is not the fault of the actors. Throwing certainly depicted their role well. How this movie was written and how the letters were written is the true sickness benchmark <br /> <br /> I know I will never see, a movie written or directed by Jennifer Chamber Lynch. She is a sick, rolled, messy-cruel, deviant-thinking deviant. He frowns his brain, hears, talks and sounds like a biker with his brain, who has worked hard for 20 years. Seeing him in the special feature section of "Watch: Watch the Watch Watching", he can see clearly what kind of person he is. You can see and hear him for yourself. I was worse than what was worse than the film's writing. <br /> <br /> I'm not frustrated by the bad language, although this director must speak like a sailor. This simple bad language crosses; No p0rn is worse than film She writes that the underlying sabotage between each character is level of violence and distortion level which is even illegal by the value of p0rn. This distorted, annoying thought is his own personality and what he says clearly is clear. Another critic I want to find the description. This is a snap film. <br /> <br /> Do not forget about the deleted scenes and the description of its description over the end. This director / writer is really a sick person I can not believe that anyone who will be responsible for filming him, will pay less for him. You can be assured that I will never see another movie related to him. I have watched and collected thousands of movies, there are only a few directors and writers who have made such boycott futile. I have never seen before connecting with a movie shooter that aggression beyond anyone. Some bad directors and writers have been, but none of their sick, stomach minds could compare. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie, which is just one murder after the other. Once after the hotel assassination ... the sick police were firing and the drivers were brutally hurled for the kicks ... the family of the holiday was bad parents (there was no business in the presence of children) ... after drug narcotics .... then the movie (Even more) went to the isolated, barbarous serial killers. <br /> <br /> I saw the serial killers express themselves, I was surprised to wonder how bad the movie was written by the sick. Those were my real thoughts as I saw this movie. I was completely prepared to find the author so ill ... because that writer has to be seriously committed for long-term mental health. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what I say in the DVD, then I realized that my assessment of the author is just nose. In the DVD, he was really sick, stomach, I saw such a boring movie. <br /> <br /> The little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, who really stole the show ... I believe that her real life parents will keep the sick, fool-free, the director somewhere near their daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, sick, objectionable, twisted and needs of a director-a psychological advantage of some serious treatment. <br /> <br /> As far as the film ends ... Option end, this should be the result of a terrible weak result. Due to the death of another character there was no point in flow or flow of film or story, and there was no benefit. I have studio that actually delivered the studio movie. The trailer was completely confusing. The only reason that the film was received by the audience was because of the intelligent trailer and creative painting of the trailer. The trailer you see is not representative of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other than the child ... Each character of this film is made by the writer-director mind who has been ill, murderer, distorted, distorted, violent sexual intercourse and their characters are mirrored. But if you observe it carefully, even the parents of the holiday family; The sick police took the pot shot; Posing the role of serial killer alternative; At the police station; And even the station sender ... The role of this character includes a sexual, twisted, violent distortion of every single role. I'm not sure of some actors after filming movies and movies in the Canadian city's special features category. <br /> <br /> This writer-director is so personal mind-set that he does not write anything, the role of each character holds the same carbon copy stamp. The only character which was not this deviant tendency was the children. Look closely and you will see this in each character. Then listen to the director-writer talk in the DVD Special Features section and understand what you are saying about his mental state and mental problem. If he is not from the Hollywood movie making family, many will not be tolerated in the appropriate home. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chamber Lynch does not have a filmography ... things. Because Carbon copies these annoying features among her characters, I do not think her father, director David Lynch will not be able to write or direct many movies until she helps him. I would suggest staying away from any movie that is related to her ... and I'm not sure that her father's films will be better. <br /> <br /> Please be kind to yourself. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
