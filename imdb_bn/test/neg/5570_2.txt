I just saw it because I saw some good reviews for it, so I was expecting at least half a Chess movie. Toybox even does not provide that. I have not had a lot of problems with this membrane, I do not even know where to start, so I'll list some of the main problems (again, spoiler alert. Only to read them, it will save you the trouble of seeing it later). <br /> <br /> One, this movie begins and is often mentioned that a mythological title (a witch whose main character claims to be a resurrection) of Celeste Nire and Mid-folker (or something like that, a big An evil man with laughter who sells open men with their hook and their innards pies). I liked it, it was a clever idea, anything with Pizz is easy to enjoy. But then you see this movie and what about this stupid girl and her boyfriend (and what was the deal with her?) What was her capability, why did she see that the so-called 'witch' did not notice ??) And meeting them their insane family. Not really insane, they just argued a lot. Most of the films are controversial, and they sometimes touch the supposed myth, except for some confusing scenes that you can not create tears or tales <br /> <br /> <br /> At one stage, Berinis (main witch-related character) folds and performs some sort of candle light. It seems rather important, but after doing nothing, nothing happened, it has ruined my time even more. <br /> <br /> And who was that man with his dog? Do you see him from the very beginning of the movie that he is walking in the house with the evil red dog, and then finally he goes there and dies? What bad condition Was he moderate? Was his dog possessed? Did anyone kill the dog? They really did not show that. Also, any scenes associated with Viqar were completely vain and only explained the length of the long end. They had all these interesting character ideas and they all went somewhere! The boyfriend, who probably had some power but did not explain them. Grandmother, who has appeared some magical powers, but does not use them. Vicar, who ... OK, do not remember, there really was no point for its existence. And then there was Berenice and his stupid amulet. Could he really do magic, or did he use it to reflect only light and blind people? It was a complete waste of time, and only because I was able to give it two stars because a) Benoenis is cute cute and b) It has been mentioned. Save yourself the means of renting and dear God, do not think about buying it, if you do not waste it, new fad.
