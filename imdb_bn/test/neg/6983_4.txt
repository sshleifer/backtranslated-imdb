Yes, I know his character was supposed to be drunk, and he might just be fooling. But some critics say that Mr. Pleasence really got a lot and the film was drunk in her view. Basically, everything he says is lost and often unknown. Or maybe it was just poor quality requirements ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> However, Race for Yankee Jeffy is a movie that just does not work. This is also shameful, because the film is a great opening and usually a fascinating plot. Finally production values ​​are very low and this is very busy to supply the product for the bravery of New Zealand. This story is related to a US war aircraft, filled with gold, money and medals, which float in a lake in New Zealand during WWII. For almost 40 years, the plane is finally lost, and in this way it gets pushed in some way and it literally drowns on the inside with a drunk (comfortable). At first he collected all the purple heart medals and tried to sell them in the city, actually for them 75 dollars! He knows that once he sells them, the local jewelry gets the phone and starts trying to track information about the plane. Before you shed tears, all attention brings a wealthy scuba bog (paper) and its pregnant city to town and they try to force the old man to leave the plane because they know that there is more than just medals. The old drunk business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) tried to claim fate before the bad guys could get it. As a result, the action is not funny just because you expect it to be. <br /> <br /> Save for acting rather horrible, Pleasence. George Pepeard tried to accent some (I guess) Austrian accent, but it is rarely credible. Leslie Ann Warren is not very bad, but who wow really bad. He is basically doing his best impression on his worst day Michael Perera. And that's saying something. I hope he has made a lot of money in this film, which will fix his front teeth, which looked a bit of a scream. I do not think if he was Wiseguy straight there by him in time. Cast rest is pretty cool Probably most of the locals who do not do much more. I think the biggest problem for me was the lack of a lot of movies and a lack of danger. Villains take very serious and serious stupidity. And honestly, there is no helicopter in the movie that looks like a DVD cover. And no boat in the movie can paint the teeth on them. <br /> <br /> She has her strength in this film. Started as a newspaper in the beginning and then a nice touch has become part of the story. Brian Girl's score sounds a bit like one at Mad Max 2, but in some scenes they include a beautiful little procession for Plasens. Just like a great escape! Some fragrance helicopter stunts and a big boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. Despite the great looks of the picture, it is still quite beautiful. Although the things that you remember most are the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence, though. She was almost enough to save this film. Almost 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Hound.
