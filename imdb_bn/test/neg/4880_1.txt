I found this movie a satirical bint, a sunny bad blurred hope. Boy I was frustrated. (Without Avon.) You see, the movie is really awesome, but so awesome, it's not even ridiculous. Plot, oh wait, there's no plot. I think you can tell it about the main character rising in street battles. At the end of the film, the directors decided that they would not make any ideas, or perhaps died, and there was a monkey finish to manage the film. Do not you do not want to end up vibrating! Although the end does not really spoil anything. The main character ends up in a room filled with mirrors, a la cartridge enters, and then gets the original rage, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end Hui. <br /> <br /> The only freedom fighter in this movie was Avon's scene. He is talking to the rival street battlefield and says with these lines, "The whole thing about death:" And do not worry about sir, I killed him in a modern way. I worried him, I drew, we went to the disco. And then I killed him. "At the point of a boss," Good job avon. You number 1. " And Avon says "number 1! AliIIIET! Aliwaite!" The scene continues with the continuation of "Alllrriiiight!" Repeatedly The next scene is a dead avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I do not think so. Finally, I own the "Homework" version of this movie, which means the title "Home" in my own box. It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. This movie never happens. These people do not have movies. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this review, but I'm going to continue it.
