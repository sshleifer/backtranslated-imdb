I love watching the Australian movie but this steaming pile of shit was just plain embarrassing. DVD cover looked committed but you know what you know, do not judge the DVD through its cover. <br /> <br /> I noticed that it won a Best Actor Award, but the competition was really bad because acting in this movie is sad. It seemed as if the director felt that he had enough skill to handle it properly and compete properly before concentrating on part of filmmaking and before spreading it too thin. Music was quite common. The stories do not really go anywhere. It was just a continuation of collision with poor script and Chess dialogue. <br /> <br /> I would say it to these aspiring filmmakers. See this picture. This will give you hope that your movie will win some festivals. <br /> <br /> But there's better to go there and go there. They have learned some lessons and hope their next venture is a little better.
