This is not the film from the 1990 TV show, 1979. It's just like three episodes under 90 minutes. Before watching this, I think it was one of the movie versions, and I saw it, it was a TV show. I do not care too much about it. I just did not feel the story, and there was not much on the path of excitement or drama. I was flipping through my DVD player repeatedly, I was really annoyed. I was also thinking that there were some conversations, it would be flexible, not good. Plus, I thought the actress would have left much to be desired. But it's just me, it's a clean, healthy family entertainment. There is nothing objectionable here. Who will probably enjoy it. For me, Black Stallion 4/10
