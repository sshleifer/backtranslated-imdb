This 3-hour-made TV minisers with us from Blockbuster this weekend came with us. The production company clearly spends a lot of money, expensive (Bridget Falls, especially), and special effects (including a great Jim Henson fiction, Polar Bear and Rayanne). They should have spent a little more money getting a coherent script. The story line was so loose that it did not really come together. Someone can leave the Irish-accredited Germans, but not the story of radioactive-quarrels. With the end of the absurd loose endings included by the special guest in the devil, this one is certainly not determined to be a Christmas classic. By two shyness is a shame that they spoil good performance.
