I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival would like to include in this program in their program. I think they have to agree with others who have reviewed this image. On the other hand, I have ever seen that this is the worst movie. It's a bad script, full of holes, and starts with the dialog so that it's embarrassing. When the idea is introduced, then dropped with no development. The acting left me completely cold and uninvolved. Set decor was perfect for the time, but the nightmare of a decorating. This room is the only way to love if their previous houses are terrible. Atik felt that the incident was thrown for the scene and the appearance of a real attack was filled with junk for years. There were photography lead and various lacks. Save your money for something worthwhile.
