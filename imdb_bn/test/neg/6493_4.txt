This is a very medieval Jackie Chan movie and one of its most evil James Glycunhaus, it is destroyed! I look forward to all the characters, but the story is so much, although Jackie Chan still looks bright, but it's amazing. Jackie and Danny Aime also had Zero Chemistry together, and it was very annoying, but the end was more than the last and was fairly entertaining and there were some good stunts! I still did not see the Hong Kong version, but I'm sure it would be better, this bud, the plaster is very predictable! It's really useless and soft, and I do not blame Jackie for not being happy about it, and if he does not act in it, it was unbearable and completely undesirable. The opening seems to be memorable, but I have never seen it before and have not seen anything better, and I think the whole movie was rather lazy and if Jackie controls it, it can be an extraordinary movie! Do not route for any characters. This is a very medieval Jackie Chan film, and its perfect worst, James Gicklehouse, has destroyed it! Not even for hard Jackie Chan fans. Direction is terrible! James Gullenhaus has done a terrible job here, keeping extremely bizarre camera work, bad angles, and boring film across the essence. Acting is so. Jackie Chan is always Amazing, but he is not his usual energetic soul, and disturbed throughout the film and shows P * Id, Danny Ayllo was chemistry with zero, and I do not really blame him! (Jackie Rule !!!!!). Danny Isle is here as a partner of Jackie, but his character was a bit of an ass, and Jackie had chemistry with his chemistry, he seemed right. Ray Chiao was as good as the main villain, but he was still going through the speed and he did not face anybody, he is still cool. Cast Best is the best of the rest. Do not value your time or money as a whole. 5 * out 1/2
