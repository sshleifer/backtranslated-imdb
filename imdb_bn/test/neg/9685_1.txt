Although I have great interest in biblical movies, I was concerned about the death of the movie every minute. Everything is bad The movie is very long, mostly a joke and scripts are played horrible. I do not get the point of mixing stories together with Abraham and Noah. So if you value your time and stay away from Sanita this awful.
