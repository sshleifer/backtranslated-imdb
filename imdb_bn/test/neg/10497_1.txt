Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than "Tikila Body Shots" and "Z Zombie Nation" - rather than such torture - and those movies are harmful. The writer / director / star Ron is detached from both charisma and acting ability, and the concept of the most basic instructions is definitely disabled. Probably the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and war choreography I've ever seen in a film. Rarely cut two shots together, you can see a lot in exotic lighting. The terrible dialogue is pronounced very loud by very vivid cast, it extends the film in about 87 minutes. This is a really ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, fans of terrible cinema would like to see it, but it is very difficult to sit with how much you feel as a bad-movie exhibitor. Ron is actually surprising that it was actually revealing. If you're a movie director and you actually think that opening your movie's opening credits title is right to include some frames of SLUG words, but your rough editing is left - and you can not visually strengthen the frame to edit the frame - then Your value is certainly less so insulting. I am surprised that Singh Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie to the DVD. In spite of brief short story Rudy Ray Moore, this film is one of the most authoritarian acts in Ron Hall's part - he clearly believes that he is a strong actor, and believes that his higher writing and skill guidance - but the film is incredibly unknown that it believes It is hard to do that I really want to see people like this that I am now ruthlessly in the same way I'm winning. A jaw dropping, insane horror movie. I'm not kidding
