The inefficient second-string feature of Universal Pictures is doing a military investigation about a maiden movie actress, which makes her romance recruitment to stop the progress of hot young girls. This adaptation of the short story "Come Bay My Love" directed by Robert Montgomery, and his performance in this era is unrelievedly lazy. The plot is a sad, predictable element and author Robert Carson gave all the real funny lines (as usual in this time movie). It's always nice to support Anne Blythe and Jane Koule, but they can not do much with this hockey element. * ****
