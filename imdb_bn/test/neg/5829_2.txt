Extremely stupid high school / teen geeks relax about trying to prove themselves better than rich brats. Sound familiar? Director Rod Ameto's television movie "Excellent Valor" and some "Hazard Doce" episodes do not believe or does not say anything, nothing does nothing, and of course it will certainly be entertaining. For the most important "Michael J. Fox", Bob Denver ("Gilligan") and Todd Bridges ("different strokes"), who are notable for this crazy effort limiting limbs on the limit line. Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
