Visitors of the independent film know that once or twice they are going to see stories about the sick family every year and they are coming to their expectations and the challenges of keeping them fresh are becoming more and more, but despite the good cast, it seems to be the same. The story about the family of Travis is trying to recover Matt (Kip Pardu) suicide, who was very optimistic swimming in high school. Benn (Jeff Daniels) father who withdrew from all and did not deal with Matt's other son Tim (Emil Hirish) and Matt, but he contacted his mother, Sandy (Sigourney Waver) and started smoking (some) and smoked. <br /> <br /> ***** Spirir Alert ***** Shardi starts flirting with many young men like grocery stores check-out cashier, but when he tried to buy more marijuana he was barbaric and locked in jail. gets hauled. He did not tell anyone what happened, but he invented the curvature of the team and Ben was absent from work. After all these happenings, Shetty fell ill and landslide in the hospital where her life was in danger, which Ben would understand that she had to come to terms of losing another part of her family. <br /> <br /> This picture was written and directed by Dan Harris who has worked with "X2" and Brian Singh with "X2" and upcoming Superman movies, and his script allows these characters to stay in the real moment of their pain and confusion. If you touch many scoops in scripts that require your scorecard to keep track of them, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, negligence, homosexuality examinations, and a life-threatening illness. If these situations are not enough for you, then Harris finally ticks up a plot that explains and explains the greatest feeling to the team. When I keep my eyes unchanged for two or three times at a time, then roll my eyes, but I must admit that I do not hate this picture and for this the actors have to credit. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film, but I want this story to be more attention than Weaver and his character, Hircher. Weaver was exceptional and with a sharp script, he could have played a role that could possibly bring Oscars nomination, but instead we could have the persistent view of Hirosh on the side of the opponent in the party or in his cantonment. Harris shows that he may be a good writer / director, but through this effort, the audience has thrown so much different things that the material just becomes fun.
