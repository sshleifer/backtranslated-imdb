Do not take this movie seriously, hire some people who want to play this mystery science 3000, and you will probably laugh off your boots. The evil people are not so scary, it's funny, it's some 7th grade kids, in which they come up with a fork in a sickle. Acting fun I love self torture occasionally with a poor horror film and this was really riggling to me. I recommend it on that basis Of course, the recreational drug experience will improve. Oh, a nude group swimming scene, which will allow for some star dust on the 5-star system. Token black male gets badly injured, but his joke, as well as the whole body of injured wounds, is quite easy to use. Enjoy this complete and complete disrespect for the movie.
