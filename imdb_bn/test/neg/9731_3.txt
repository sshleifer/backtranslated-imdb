Let me tell you first, I'm not going to expect much, and help you to see it in the first night at prime-time. I believe, there are more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's so strong. The role was Robotics, and the film did not explain anything until the last 30 minutes. I suppose that the plot was their way of twisting; Finally, keep everyone in the dark to understand the direction of the film and explain everything in the dark and hope that it looks like a triangle. <br /> <br /> Unknown to the end of the movie: -How are they a dark-link? Cg was cool but I want to understand! Why power can be asked? Especially if genocide is ultimatum. Why so much power in power is so bad? After you just normal, right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, SpeedID has ever been intelligent knowing. I swear you're seeing a person's start .... Well, it was near soft-core. And of course there was a shower scene, and it was duds to mix it. There were lots of cracks in Butt, progress in a sausage festival. But there was a single girl shower scene where nothing was seen, and for nearly 12 minutes she slapped her best looking dorm around the bathroom. Then there was a girl talk PJ party. The other thing I could not get over is the amount of driving that Caleb did in his Super Coal Ford Mustang GT. It was commercial for about 1/4 fourth quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. Or see it with a friend who likes to have fun with bad pictures. Then it could be worth it. But do not expect anything exciting.
