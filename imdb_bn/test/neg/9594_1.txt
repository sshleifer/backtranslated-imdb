************** ******** Alert spirira 85 minutes of my life, this "movie" views. Above all, we think that the producers had acted in a movie as incredibly fabulous accent to the atopai doctor - what was it, Roman? And how does someone in Denmark speak to someone other than the bog creature? (Note, director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who is the shopping for velocity animals? Their pants looked like they were purchased in Banana Republic. Very nicely dressed for 1200 years old. This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we do not think we were even potential). We basically go ahead to find a moment / death / fear moment with 75% of the movie. None found. Watch DVD rental only for 2 hours to see the "Behind the Scenes of Mogul Animals" feature who are they? Are they serious? And filmmakers 60 years old. I think it is sacred to them and it is enough between themselves and myself to be kind. <br /> <br /> The best line from the movie, hands down: "It's not bad for a girl who can not go to graduate school ...." My blind grandmother Alzheimer's can have a good movie.
