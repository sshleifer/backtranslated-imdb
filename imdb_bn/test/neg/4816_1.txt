This movie is the worst thing created by humans. Do you think Manas is the worst movie ever? It does not even come close to this junk. I do not even know to start. "Russian" commander and rebel Chiek is the worst "actor" in the movie. They saw Meral Strip as killing the sister. Fool makes face-to-face when he is believed to believe in Kung Fu training. Then there are the Ompa music during the break, completely staged in the scenes of love scenes, place love scenes playing out of love scenes, fake Castro, actually everyone has handbands and / or a band anna, some part of their body, the greatest rape scene ever, and the most ever played the worst film . This film deserves to be better known among bad movie fans. Of course, the worst movie ever made.
