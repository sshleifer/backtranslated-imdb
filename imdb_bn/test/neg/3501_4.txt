Great: The acting was great, especially with Terrence Howard and Thandi Newton. Terrence Howard should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. BAD: I am not visible in the minority (white) and in my life there are some forms of my racism. But despite my life experience and the content of the film, I would definitely not say that this film is the best of the year, in fact FAR from it. From the point of view of the film and from the perspective of the visible minorities, I have had problems in this movie. My problem with this movie is: <br /> <br /> (1) Developing poor character (or nothing at all). Because we saw the character of a character, for example, Matt Dillon considers a racist police and his sick father to be very caring, this does not mean that the character is better developed. Yes, I acknowledge that across a large cast like this movie, each character is very hard to improve, but this does not mean that there should not be any of the characters. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < They should not show this movie in a script writing class because it is good but not to show the student and the future screenplay writer what to do. I have just been hit over again on how bad the head injury is described. I get it <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so terrible, it's ridiculous. During the entry into a van, the possibility of a black car robbery run like a human trafficking and the same black car robber took him to the hospital several hours after he was stabbed by the Asian van, only to know that some assailants were being trafficked inside the van. There is a better side later? Or, about the scene where a former classified white woman descending down the stairs and all its biases and hatred disappeared into thin air? If it was easy, why did not we put every racist in the stairs below the stairs so that their hearts would change? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest mistake about this movie is to see unrealistic racism. Anyone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden instead of your face. I'm not white because I have been refused entry as a supermarket. The owner of the shop said why I was not white? No, he said, the shop has been closed though many people are shopping inside. He shouted racial slurs? No American racism is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably will not stop you taking non-white because you take it, but this does not mean that they will try to run you and will come out and say ethnic slurs. If a Chinese woman finishes me, I will not say "Blake! Blake! Learn some English Concern!". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally reinstated a Mexican woman, "Mexicans are not bad drivers" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I want to give my insurance information, sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans make fun of the poor driver behind their backs and their backs. That is the real racism. It's not hidden and in your mouth. <br /> <br /> However, the crash can not actually say something that could say something different. Interlocking and interweaving stories have been made before the lines, plots, and letters. "Magnolia" is a film that makes it better than a crashed and is still not nominated for the best picture at the Oscars. It was a stall cast - Julian Moore, William H. Messi, Philip Simmur Hoffman (who recently won the Best Actor), Tom Cruise, etc. This is actually my mind that the crossover was nominated for the best picture.
