This movie stinks mainly. The only reason I give it a 3 is because the graphics were semi-charming. It seems to be a bunch of beautiful drawings for the complete negligence of a plot and even the lack of incoherent surface character development. So far the worst anime came out of Japan. I can not believe that they actually put their name in the trash. Selling these things for $ 20 is a hint of what's stopped. Do not bother if you do not meet this. If you have, I regret you.
