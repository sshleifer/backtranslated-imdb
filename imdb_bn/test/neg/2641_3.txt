This "horror" movie lacks any awful or even murky mystery. Not even good at gore. Plot will make a promise if it is done by someone whom they care about / writes, but those who made the film did not do it. Basically, the film fits a bit and starts like this: <br /> <br /> The main character says he is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" hides in front of his yellow raincoat or road <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main character says that he is not crazy and some nets are always on top of it. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you do not, you can enjoy this picture. Otherwise, see something else. The budget is low, low, low, and its shows (Contrary to what Evil Dead, who forgets about his bad budget), and the performance is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of Janet). Generally the movie is annoying, annoying, annoying. I can not think of a scenario that works really well. Actually, I do not like the movie so much, I actually stopped it 10 minutes before the end, I rarely do it ... Hack, I've seen all the way through unknown Manos, Clones, and the Wild West West. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Leave yourself and see the fantasies again.
