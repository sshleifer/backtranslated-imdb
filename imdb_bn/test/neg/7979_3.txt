This is my first "Bollywood" movie and I also see it with many other recent viewers - "Ghost World". After studying some of the Bollywood film industry this week, I can understand why there is a seemingly unrelated music number and romance and comedy in a vague movie. But "something for everyone" does not always add up to a solid product. <br /> <br /> The ultra-Govi musical dance number "John Wechchan Ho" influenced the world in such a way that it was probably not possible. In 1965. It's now on the internet, with scambling for a lot of English translation. Lakshmi shadow takes a nice dance after taking dance, it's all fresh, fresh, new and delightful even when a normal person will be tired! He rules! <br /> <br /> At the beach along with Miss Kitty, there is a fair amount of tones in contrast to light weight fun and awful conspiracies. Yet, I was singing in Hindi a week later. I got a rough translation: <br /> <br /> If you want to live in this life, listen to what you say, throw your grief behind and join the party. I will take advice. <br /> <br /> Those who want to laugh Let your hair down to live and sing and relax the people of this world Did you know? Come to me and I'll explain <br /> <br /> Anyone who can see me, will stop this anxiety, fish will swim here freely <br /> <br /> My second in the picture Favorite number Butler dreams where Mehmood has entered Miss Kissi dance. Electric Tiki-like figures are surprisingly strong as just the complete set of this figure. Online, it will be seen as described as what happens if I threw "Libiberace" !! Way fun <br /> <br /> Gammaan is not a good movie. That's why I gave it 3 rating. It's actually a fun sticker that has nothing to do with the plot of murder with some fun, muscular musical numbers.
