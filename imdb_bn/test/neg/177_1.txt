The image is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, many times you see stand-alone and very edited scenes. One can easily get a cleaner film using an amateur camera and 100 $ video editing software. Under the earth, the road man does not mean soft editing. Undesirable views that do not contain important statements should be removed. It is the same to ensure that the object is in the head / hands / other frames. My 8-year-old boy now knows that <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is a very long way. The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why rest rest. After the interview with James Suckling I press the "Stop" button. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> This film marks the small producers, who are making wine with more identity, or terori. Larger people are accused of producing "internationalization" or "commercialization" wine. The picture is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the movie did not prove this claim. They look at just a few examples, some of the big producers (FrescoBaldi) with fascism, "tie" and what they provide "interview" with people. Well, did all the small producers spend WWII in the resistance? Is it relevant that there is something with Parker's Bulldogs? The movie is very manipulative and intolerable.
