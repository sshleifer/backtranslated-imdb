I'd like to go away all mockumentaries and awesome spoofs. If you are going to investigate loch ness .. it's real for you. Fairly **** The same with scary and scientist ... if you are going to create a movie and it seems scary ... make it terrible .. not funny. When I see a horror movie, I hate it and the characters are fighting for their life (or running or whatever. Their lives are at risk) and they are joking. It never happened ... where all the good directors have gone? I think awful and sci-fi has gone down the tube from really 70's. I was scary for a long time scary ... this "scary movie" for bad birds. This photo is for birds. If you really want to see a good investigation or serious talk here ... do not expect this video.
