There are no big twists in any movies and most of the events you are about to predict. Matt Dillon was once again outstanding, but the rest could not eat as much of them as they could. <br /> <br /> It was exciting at the beginning but at the end gradually and predictable One of those wicks does not matter to a good man. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it personally I found it valuable. The story could have been more interesting and the director could reduce a B-movie by the director.
