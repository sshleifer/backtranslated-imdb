Today you have rented a prestigious criminal Hernan Bank (producer Steven Sigal) by terrorist businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe), from a Las Vegas casino point point to 'A' pointing to a security vehicle with $ 20,000,000 in cash Has the rental 'B' him, easy to think? What did Max forget to say to Harlan that the money was stolen and he has been armed robbery! Frustrating. Local police kept him in prison and kept him in prison for a long time, although Harlan became worse for him, but Harlan had been able to hide the money before he was caught and was standing with the $ 20,000,000 broker and should have been defunct to Harlan. Crooks want it as a government agent. Harlan has been in jail with Ice Cool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Chris) and they were able to escape both of the time, Harlan is trying to take some revenge ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> FauntLeRoy One must say that the direct video video action film in East Europe Steven Seagull is not getting special skills these days and today you are a good case to die. It's a terrible film, that's really as simple as that. The producer Danny Lerner's script, Kevin Moore and Les Walden Segal have a new character that is not in favor of their actress skills, but rather than some public agents / police / soldiers / an army force that they normally play. Actually if you were charity, you can call Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998) as a rip-off, where he also did a really nasty act for such a good effect. Payback does not compare to a great inconsistent firm firm film, by comparing the type action action thriller Today you die. Unfortunately Seagal is terrible here, there is no presence or frustration on her screen and the audience is ever sure that she is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. For example, his character was initially established like modern Robin Hood, as he stole from wealthy drug dealers and received the poor (and a well-earned profit for themselves), which is just ridiculous in his own, but he has been traveling around the Sigal Many people are turning around and conflicting with the morally prerogative of criminals. The story is full of holes, for example, Agent Nelson is approached to manage Harlan and then he is blamed by his aspirant to meet him and it can be found by tapping his phone. In that case why did not use his boss information to catch Hershon? The story is amazing surprise investigator official agent is actually bad guy! Wow, I did not see that I'm coming ... <br /> <br /> Director Fantralooye gradually slowly goes slowly slowly gradually to the speed of affection gradually and gradually, gradually and slowly. There are also severe lack of entertainment standards. The overwhelming battle scene is not great, mostly shot in shadow, it is cut and edited very quickly, or the camera is used behind the signature character, and in this case, it is inconsistent that most stunts work double here. Seagal again shows out of fat and shape and uses long baggy overcoats to hide and use it, it does not. Initially Las Vegas is driving a cool cooler car in the street and I thought that you will die today, okay but this whole sequence has started from one of the top movies which is known as Top (1997). Las Vegas casino robbery, as well as editing scenes from Charlie Shane Action Film No Code of Contact (1998), Gene-Cloud Van Dam Action Film (2001) and Wesley using footage of that movie. Prison-based Action Film Snippet (2002) EndedText (2002) is so fascinating that anyone who predicts today's footage is the main footage. <br /> <br /> The technically correct film, with its own footage considered to be editing together with four different movies, is almost capable and quite consistent. All footage in the United States location must have been taken from the already mentioned movies with the cheapest original photos in Bulgaria. The rap style music that you die today is terrible. The act is poor and suspicious, just copying its path through its line just like normal. <br /> <br /> Today you die, a real bad movie made from other bad action films, Seagull shows old and fat, action scenes are best, and most of the story is fairly random and it does not come together at the very end. If someone does not die, then there is a ghost fan, if there are animals ...
