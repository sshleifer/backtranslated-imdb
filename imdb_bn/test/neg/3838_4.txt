I thought there was a possibility of choke, but I think it might be a very good movie. It was some interesting twists and turns, but some of them were in vain kind. When showing two main characters backgrounds, something that started to go really scary. It was mostly in vain and the film did not help everyone. It was not even Dennis Hopper's best hours. However, the main savings of this film for me was Rahmat, Michael Maden. Her performance was excellent. In this film, he almost looked like Mr. Gold as a wonderful man. All in all, it was watchable. Still, I had left some things to think differently. These things, in my opinion, make the film better.
