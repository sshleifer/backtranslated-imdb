How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flush. Their basic and fundamental ideas and their fundamental influences on Western thought and capitalist society are obsolete except for two short scenes, among which it has been claimed that he is "killing God"; Pure demagoguery to make movies brutal And the rest of the film is making fools for the purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and tall family scenes, of which a sound cries. Anyone who actually could read "the source of the species" clearly knew that Darwin's work did not violate God; On the contrary, there was a revolutionary new way of looking at fear and respect, and things there. A good film about Darwin can be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspirational, even in a religious sense - but it will oppose the soap-opera motives of this light. It is a shake that has been designed to amaze the sympathetic sympathy of human beings and then failed to understand even after being transformed; It quickly uses Darwin's name as a marketing clout, because a person will leave a famous name to create an impression. Set and costume is so good that sorry: The production value, except for writing, was probably high. If you want to cry to lose intelligence in American literature see it.
