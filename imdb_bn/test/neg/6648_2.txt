This is a film that should have been a small series because it tries to get too much information in a space. The whole story is always being bombarded with sub-plots, character identities and meaningless pieces of information that can not go anywhere. An underlying plot where the boy fills the girl, she suspects, but she gets married in some way and patronises her doubts and sees them as real. They may not be, but her husband would not believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend did not want her because she was unfaithful to her husband. It says that more than 1000 sub-plots and characters have no role to play, which makes this plot almost obscure. In the first 15 minutes, you are bound to a lot of things that stop taking care of yourself and the environment. Do not care about the confused and screwed-up cast that drifts into and out of the story like the cattle you feed on the bodies. Each one comes and takes away some interest from the visitors. After half an hour, and completely discouraged, I saw the rest of the pure morbid curiosity and saw six and a half hours. I could not imagine where it was going, but I could not get it going around in the fire and I could not stop it. Production price is fantastic but the result is waste time during the movie; Instead of washing your socks.
