They say this picture is "Euro trash awful". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not awful. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it is "Euro". Trash? Yes yes, it's trash okay. <br /> <br /> You know that you are for a great movie, at the beginning of time, the DVD sends you the screen screen which apologies for your printing quality. Watch again about The screen will not fit for cracks, weird jingles, and movies. Plus there are words - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed film. Then, seeing the lips carefully, I realized, no, the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of sync. <br /> <br /> This schematic is fairly stupid - Dr. An old, vague woman named Banster killed a scientist for his youth. I'm not giving away too much because when you see "old lady" it is quite clear that she is under thick makeup, poorly-made makeup. <br /> <br /> Yes, "old chron" has been miraculously transformed into a beautiful young girl - face-to-face and face-to-face. Hair is a long wig! Junkes! <br /> <br /> When I say the old woman is disrespectful, I mean that she has faces on her face. The film does not try to explain how cornflakes went there. In that case, there is no effort to explain anything related to any of the characters. They are not even better than the level of finger dolls. <br /> <br /> Two policemen, who were victims of our anti-hero sabotage, have almost wandered by being easily disturbed by the simple signals available. The killer scientist was working in the Youth Syraam, the old woman disappeared, and we used to walk a young girl - how does this piece fit together ?! What do these mean ?! A policeman slept and pulled his face with clothes. Another smokes a pipe <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, he has issues with men. She gets into a catfight with a young girl in a nightgown. He is going to Geneva so we can see it in the lake. She drinks a little water, then releases her wet case to reveal a weird beam-curtain bikini. She took her clothes again on a strange ninja costume striptease. <br /> <br /> end? Well, without giving it a few distances, it has only survived a malicious, conclusion which gives little idea as the rest of the picture. When the writer wakes up at 4 o'clock with it and writes, "We need to end our film soon! What will happen next?" <br /> <br /> <br /> half awake, and the director runs it with it. <br /> <br /> What is good for this movie? Some of the music is camp and fun. That is the classic 60s organs music that is so intense that you laugh out loud enough. There are some strange seduction scenes, malicious dialogue, stupid moments. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that very good. I started to manage it to start from scratch without gouging my eyes or sobbing. I appreciate that, appreciate.
