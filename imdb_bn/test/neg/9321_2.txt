I'm not saying that I waited long enough for the release of this movie for a while. After finally having an opportunity to see it last night, I am sorry that I was incredibly frustrated. It's hard to imagine a movie that looks like "Exxist: The Beginning" in the last moment, but "Dominion" just does that. There's no waiting ... It looks like a great movie. <br /> <br /> I'm probably very excited about this film, and it contributed to deterioration. Finally, two versions of the Warner Bros. were released, which was essentially the same movie, each other in another six months. Plus, I'm a huge fan of Stellan Skargard, and it gives a great performance in real fashion, though despite the often humorous content of the film. On the other hand, throwing supporters of this photo is unrealistic. Clara Beller seems to be able to make only one expression - empty blank, and distributes all its lines with the same long voice, when Gabriel Man's father Frances is simply ridiculous. The effects of this film are enough to hide a movie taken seriously with the ridiculous and ridiculous impressive effects. The film came with a much more stereotype than anything else, and a real shillings shot that went in about three seconds and made his eyes and eyes drowsy, but nevertheless neglected to give anything in the panic section. I could go in more detail and probably give away some spoilers, but in reality I was tired of thinking about how bad it was to write the things I want to say about this picture. The most tragic idea about the whole thing is that it is a fundamental idea to try both versions of the film ... which is the story of a priest who has lost his faith and re-acquired it after talking to his past ... had great potential, especially as leading people with Skarsgard. Unfortunately for us, that potential is wasted Go and watch this movie only if you are really interested in the difference from the Harleen version, do not expect to see a good movie or be sorry for your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, the first version will be released and content to be released.
