HANA-BI has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing. Unfortunately, viewers have seen recent scenes during many thoughtful conflicts and there are many questions to worry about surface and irritability. <br /> <br /> For example, why the wheelchair did not sink in the ocean when he got trapped in the sand and the tide came around him? No rescue was seen or indicated. <br /> <br /> It may be true that Japanese police are so inefficient and uneducated in the way of arresting the surgery's surgical skills first? This detective-level Japanese police could not cope with any experience with the suspect. <br /> <br /> Why the right eye of the character does not burn the right eye? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is seen in gambling Did not Being a government employee at a private level, his wife must have full health insurance. <br /> <br /> No one was alone in the middle of the nature park? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Fuji Resort? There is absolutely no source available for these gangsters, even to know the main character and his wife in a country, give the right exact position at the right time! <br /> <br /> And the third question, how can the junior detectives know that some feet of the Japanese coast can find the main character and his wife? The Japanese coastline will be vast. <br /> <br /> Two final questions: An intelligent girl is trying to sleep on the beach - where is she from? He seems to have no transportation or companions with him. And why did he try to fly after removing the remains of his ants in the earth ?! It was weird Pithon-Esk uncertainly <br /> <br /> From a positive side, I like background music. It is dramatic and flowing and has added a lot to this movie. Photography, illustrations and art were happy with the eye. <br /> <br /> One final point, the wife was very happy with the eye. Once upon a time he never came to see a mortal sick person. She looked very healthy. If anything, these people are not depressed and mentally ill and physically ill. Husband behaved with his wife, perhaps a stranger would deal with a respected wife ... love of friendship, but not a close tenderness. <br /> <br /> Surely a mixed movie.
