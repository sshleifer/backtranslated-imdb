It is a moody, retiree, which should have been recorded as an exposition in relation to memory where dominant personality survives only because there is no hope of change in the effect that personality is being influenced. Acting was intense and efficient, but the film did not work, but the film was tirelessly ineffective: a lot of distance shots that offer a lack of focus rather than a larger picture. Poor flow The first 5 minutes may be missed completely. <br /> <br /> I suspect, with the different edits, this film can be compulsory. <br /> <br /> In its current form it is flat, ruthless and urgent frustrating.
