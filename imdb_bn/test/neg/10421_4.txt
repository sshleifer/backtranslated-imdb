What is it about french First, they (apparently) much more than the United States like Jerry Lewis. Secondly, they (thinks) prefer the work of Edgar Allan Bo to do more than anyone else. It has to be "Bowdery effect". <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong ... I'm a foot fan myself. But this trilogy manages to create three low-level stories ... Well, I'm not sure what they made. <br /> <br /> "Toby Damaged" is a good Philinia movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of theme. It's enjoyable to see it first. Terrence Stamps does a good job with an interesting introduction. However, it does not have anything to do with the soul or spirit of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How is Wadim's film produced? It's just awful ... even the amateur film does not up until school value. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to avoid it and save your time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the part that is most trustworthy for pear work. It does not have many styles, although it includes the strangers of Snowball, but I think I've ever seen it in the film. (It seems that boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, which are rolling in the balls.) <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to remove "Metzergenstein", to see William Wilson, and then, if you have a Fellini fan I did not) cook dinner or a snake when you put "Toby Dammit".
