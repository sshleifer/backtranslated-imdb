This movie is a bizarre fantasy story, I'm sure no more than 10 years of appeal is made, but it is very strange for the children. The plot is stupid, and the worst thing I've seen is the worst. <br /> <br /> 25-year-old Cathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who works 9-years-old. He seems to have received the voice of his character by listening to Alvin and Chipmunce. The sound of her high astounding, screechy baby gets the second annoying she started to start. Other performances are all bad, but really Kathy is far from the worst in Ireland. The plot is terrible and like a mixture of Alice in Wonderland and Mad Mac. Wanda Sankunusem (Ireland) received a letter from her father, who had left him a long time, broke a lethal hole in Africa, and when she was going to find her, she was lying on an underground earth within strange Australian-speaking people. This is the greatest movie ever seen ever, with all the terrible lines. <br /> <br /> This film is a boring effect for character development. Cathy Ireland is an inferior who does not do anything or go anywhere. He flew in Africa .... Wow, what development! She drops her glasses and then does not need them. Why not drop a glasses represent them become a silly. It should represent its descendants of blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive I can think is that half-good special effects and camera work and music score is okay. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous family fantasy as a whole which just does not expect anything from them. Movie <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of 1/2. 84 minutes PG for violence.
