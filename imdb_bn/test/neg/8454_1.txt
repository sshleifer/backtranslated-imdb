I caught this at a short run in the Philadelphia Theater. Its local festival (and related to his relationship with Eddie Pollock's serious tragedy in 1994), I really have to work hard in this movie. For the reasons known for himself, the director decided to shoot the whole film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld camera and speed cuts. Such strategies may work for militant scenes, but it is inappropriate for the rest of the content, which makes up most of the film. Going around the sidekayek, sofa, in the discussion with hell, even with the brother, even the first day kisses all the cassette-style, which enables the viewer to enter the play. Martin also lowered his story by packing many things: In addition to the birth of public violence, we got immunity, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental misuse ... Did I miss something? There is no doubt that a good cast (and a well-focused direction) will combine these threads together, because Martin must lead a moral error and show how much he keeps others ... but good intentions are certainly not good film making. Just a wide mess. Martin, I know you're from my city, and I'm with you, I really ... next time you do a good job, just like you did two plus one.
