** Can be awesome * Fearful Just awesome. I like Stephen King's novel, and it's just a terrific adaptation. They last changed. They changed the plot. They changed the character of Alan Pangbarn to a happy mother tongue from a sad husband. If you are a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you're not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was a strange darkness, even for Steve King. Kill yourself in an 11-year-old novel. Children in a Middle School Principal novel are available with pornography. It's not as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my most recent favorite movie. I hate this picture with a vengeance.
