I hope those who made this movie read this comment. The dancer was horrific, the plot was blue and there were 5 stars from this junk for the actor to get so low budget ranger. <br /> <br /> War scenes are so slow where you can see actors waiting for each other. Perform the next step. Camera cut-off and poor lighting can not cover the cheapest effects. The lightning was just plain fool. Arms looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Next movie you decide to invest in some wireless mics, try to decide. Try to spend some time on the script and actually your stunt. <br /> <br /> There is a TV show that night is played and thrown together in a few hours that looks like this. <br /> <br /> Stick to martial arts (if it is not as poor as your performance) then quilting.
