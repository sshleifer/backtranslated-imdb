I saw Rajkumar Rakun in the Asian Film Festival in New York. The audience presented the film congratulated the audience with their delicious taste. "You can live in grief: Fully loaded," he said with a laughing smile, "instead you see here Seijun Suzuki's Princess Raccoon here." The audience appreciated and cheered. Well, I tell you, I've seen Harbie: loaded twice in the queue. Based on Japanese locals, a cursory musical instrument, Princess Rackon, easily grasped the ten bad films I saw. It is so annoying that his badness actually disliked me in the film of the other season, Suzuki, which is the biggest achievement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If the rail is mixed or half of them are lost in shipping, the audience does not know the difference. If you do not believe me, I dare you to steal a print and someone can run random order. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first three scenes in the photo, the song (including the crunch inducing rap number) and the images do not seem to be related in any way. Fierce composite computer animation has penetrated the door, yet another brick of indecision, and adds fast growing, ignorant wall. The authors write to any Japanese local people, remembering a bunch of note cards, dragging them, shuffed them, picked up the cards on the table, and then wrote the script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the picture, some scenes of about twenty-five minutes are seen in the picture. A shaped transfer raccoon princess (man's form) and a regular man is about to fall in love. I am hopeful that this film was something other than a series of depressing scenes, but there was no such luck. The film continues in the same absolutely annoying way. I got out then, but I got stuck in the middle of a narrow row. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I spent every moment and prayed that It will end up spending Moving every big push, surrounded by music, or looking at a remote location, the scene renewed my expectations that ended the credits they were about to roll. It starts running momentarily after passing momentarily. And it will continue and will continue. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, I was sure that I had an abstract pattern about credit presentations. Then, in protest of all the reasons, it is cut in another scene. How can i forget To be detained in a ninja, completely related, and boiled in a soup is not yet fully covered. Completely unrelated subtlety <br /> <br /> I'm not going to get back to 111 minutes, but you can spare yourself pain. Unless you want to enjoy future fun like in your memory or the sensation of the great Sijuyan Suzuki film and the Tokyo Drifter, you can not see Princess Rackon. I would rather spend flip my time.
