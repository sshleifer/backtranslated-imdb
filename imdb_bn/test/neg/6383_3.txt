I know Terry Gilliam is considered to be a good director, but it can be claimed that the film is not good. What was the movie about? What is this a surprise? Fantasy? Comedy? Satyarti? There is no answer from Gilliam's playback. Completely confused and pointlessly hit one another from a historical age. I make fun of some people actually call this movie magician. Is it a film that should be appreciated and unclear about it? In view of 1981, 3 stars for special effects. Roger Ebert is right in his review. The film is flawed and it looks like a gigantic kid's move to awaken Jillian's ramp with money to awaken the historical revival. The film tries to mislead the audience by giving John Bleus and Shan Connery the top billing.
