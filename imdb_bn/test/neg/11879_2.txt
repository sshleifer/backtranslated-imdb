What can I say about this? Produce such a big prestige - but the end? Time was lost, money was lost <br /> <br /> This work is historically seen. Just some examples: <br /> <br /> Augustus is often called 'Gaia' - his first name (Pronomen). But the old Romans did not use this name. The nickname (number genetic and cognizable) or 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus' <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as Quarterly Wife. But this historically incorrect <br /> <br /> * Yalya was shown as an excellent young woman - but she was not one. Census and (possibly?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the reasons for its solitude. <br /> <br /> * She was not at her father's death bed. He was not allowed to leave his exile. And at that time was almost 50 years old! Not as young as he is shown. In August of the same year, Augustus died, he committed suicide, because Tiberius had stopped giving him a pension. <br /> <br /> * Agustus was even more stupid in this movie. But the writer and director believes Augustus' own 'Race guests'. <br /> <br /> What's left? Historically extremely suspicious, bad acting, poorly constructed and equipment - 2 points out of 10 points - one for Peter O'Holl.
