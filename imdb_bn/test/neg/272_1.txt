Like most people, I could not wait to see 11 odds of this ocean, but it is really frustrating, I must say. It stinks because it has no good playplay, it was just cheap. I hope this movie has (or will create) this tsunami-damaged film in Asia, there is at least one good reason for this movie. It's too bad I could not even write a decent comment about it .... I still advise the manufacturers of these things to make "Ocean 13". Ocean 13 will be about the same thief who is trying to steal a screen hidden anywhere in Hollywood. The 13th member is a foreign (possibly Russian) playwright-writer who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this great hidden screenplay, so that they can replace the origin of the stolen. Or they must write at least 13 people a suitable screenplay for a movie which is not only Julia Roberts but also the other star members of the ocean movie. 13 people are the lucky numbers of Andy Garcia's character.
