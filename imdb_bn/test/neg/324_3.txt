In Halloween, three friends make fun of finding an ancient cemetery in the suburbs and wipe a cross from a tomb, where Jack was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is exposed, kills three people and seeks the descendants of Kelly family for revenge. <br /> <br /> The combination of a terrible story about "Cassie" Jackie "horror" I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the achievement, and I can not imagine how the archive allows the use of footage in any of these relativant films, lacking respect for this great actor's name. The bad acting is impressive, the movie is shifted to a comedy instead of the proposed version. This movie looks good to see friends, feed beer, comment and laugh a lot. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-o ?? Demono Hello Halloween" ("Jack-o" Halloween of Demo ")
