It's a kind of lover, gentler Cyborg movie with a loving story. Awww It's not as bad as the word. The action, when it's there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Coates, and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. Is it true that this is a sequel of the Gene Cloud Van Dam film, or the world's quarterly graduates? I'm still confused about that. In both ways, there was really no need for this movie. What was needed there? Angelina Jolie. He can play a medium robot that can explode mid-quotes, but, how it is the way to go and his first film, he still has his presence, which makes him a prize winner.
