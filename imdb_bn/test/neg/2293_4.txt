A Swedish splatter movie? Has the world become insane? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "<br /> <br />" Golden day And this movie seems to have some of its own problems: It has a lot to say, it's basically a good FX, which leads to a bit more exciting for a B-movie. While scripting and acting mostly still quite bad, but does not really matter, it is supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. There is not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No, though. I laugh almost close to my ass. It's really that sunny bad. <br /> <br /> I have not been recommended here except for the good parts listed, unless you are hungry for Sweden B-movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
