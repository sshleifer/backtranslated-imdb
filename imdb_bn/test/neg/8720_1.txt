The total piece of this nut. This is an insult to Frank Herbert's extraordinary book. They have mangled stories and characters. Acting bad mean The only character played right and well played by Duke Leto, William Hart. Unfortunately, he died very early in the beginning of the story and then flew away from it (it does not start with a very tall hill). <br /> <br /> The 1984 film was directed by legendary David Lynch. I was not very impressed with the movie, but considering their time constraints, they tried their best. Curiously, the crappy mini series looks so much better than comparing it. It was at least some of the books in the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the opportunity to do this opportunity correctly, sadly it was not taken.
