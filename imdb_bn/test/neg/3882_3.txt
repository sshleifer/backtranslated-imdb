I was afraid of the film looking at the promotion and went to see it FDFS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Interesting about it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> <br /> The second half is OK But the way things can be handled, it makes fun of the whole Arabs-Jackie angle that is half baked and how can people not recognize them? <br /> <br /> Claymax is pretty funny ... <br /> <br /> Priya is not in her element, she is cropping from this photo and her movie has become bad, music is good, Sainal, Tareq bin stands There are cameras and work behind. I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, without integrity, his work seems very surprising from Gaurindara that he seems too stressed to return and Priya failed to make use of him. But luck is okay but overall repetitive work is interesting in Manoj Joshi places. Sharat Saxena is okay, Shakti Kapoor is a great Jackie Sharf overweight and Arbaaz Khan bad Lara Dutta Mahima shrieks working in her sleep but fails to act
