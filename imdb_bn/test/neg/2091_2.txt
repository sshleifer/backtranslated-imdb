The debris of this train begins with the crossing of Brazil and Alma the Mexican border. Alma suffers from some horrific damnation, which makes her snake in the garden a few minutes and nickelodon jacks warm and simultaneously mimics the teeth and mockery. So apparently in Almaar Los Angeles this uncle has a cure for him. They take shelter on a train to go there and fortunately their friends provide their way. Alma and Bruge's luggage cart are full movies because they can not afford high-class seats. Meanwhile, in the higher class, we can see a bunch of Nandis for any reason. A balding guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom is $ 5 grand and cocaine, three stoners, and some Mexicans are carrying a wad. Mexico sees its roughness with the Bruce and tries to accept its "weed" which apparently enters the snake's snake. They understand that they do not attack with snakes, they enter your body! Extremely rolled and B-movie. Brunjo kept his man by purchasing his heart (Temple of Doom Style) and buying a snake. For some reason, he can not damage the snake or it can not damage the almonds. Although it's going to a drug addict, one of the girls tries to brutalize and instead takes a little step instead of informing her about her invoices. A mystery appears to the guy and he has a gunfight with him. The grand finale Alma becomes a vampire, bites its man, and then becomes a giant unfortunate excuse for a snake-like snake train, trains and nuclear bombs explode from hurricane vapor and disappears. Everyone walk on foot then. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Credit: Seamless from a line of movies from the strange guy "Yes, I hate air!" Credits say that "no scorpion hit the production of this scrapplate. Only small children, but it is great." Actually there was a lot of real snakes used in the film and all of them were rarely. Indeed, if a scene of a Sez snake is not big, it does not attack it, but it only trains and other fake snakes are just heads and it is like a muppet. Snakes do not really attack anything, they just stay there. One comes out from the toilet paper! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Movies, even for the release of a parody edition, rush to reveal the name of the big names even earlier or simultaneously. The effect of this is that many people will confuse one another, and look at the speed instead of 'Biggee' or they would like to see themselves for both reasons. To avoid all costs.
