It was a kind of movie. The alliance was honest, but the film itself gave new meaning to sorrow. Something that has been over again in the plot! However, that's the worst! Acting was C ** P, the scenes were often much dark to get what was happening. Nobody improved any concern for the main character. The film was very slow, and the murder scenes were made silently and in the end the film was not even more attractive. There are some movies that "suck" but there may still be enjoyment due to total humiliation, but there is no such thing! Anyone who created this image thought that they could do something good and they sadly failed. There is no offer for this movie except headache. Avoid it!
