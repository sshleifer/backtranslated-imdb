I like blood and gore. Allian and Predator movies are the types of violence that are not protected in any way. This would really be the answer to the question of how aliens were on earth. That answer is simple. We're stuck. The effect was beautiful. How ever have some real problems with him. <br /> <br /> 1) The acting character of the human character was very horrible, it was almost dry and boring because it was asleep and it really stopped. The flow of the movie and was very annoying. The author can do very well SOOOOOOO The good part is the Allian and Pride performers which I've done very well in most cases. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the predetermined ship was very small, so how was it in the first AVP movie. I <br /> <br /> I opened my head. 3) Paddeders kept their mask while on board. I do not understand why these bad guys and I do not understand. It does not make it like most people in a plot hole. So, I'm telling you, people should be calm. It's a big deal If it can make you feel better, keep in mind that they have become indifferent to the storage. Why it might be a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Plasma caster shot inside the hunter ship. I was part of the predictor that was rather stupid. But then I started to think that it was a small prop. <br /> <br /> 5) Crash site reached almost immediately when the hunter and his son fell a distance of a mile away. They did not give us birth by showing them through wood for at least 30 minutes. So happy about that <br /> <br /> 6) Why only a hunter go? I thought this was odd. But then I thought it was because he thought that he was the only Predlian that he was dealing with him and there was no outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why did the Prader not commit suicide in the ship? When the people were paying attention, he was killed before he was fully active. <br /> <br /> 8) Unlimited blue melting ga. I thought he was rather stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) The hunter hides secret information with hooligans but hijacked the police. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) Black out Good people, aliens and Prade fought it at a power station. <br /> <br /> 11) Predlalian half mask / queen This really ticked me off. I'm an alien fanatic and fanatic. I know that the aliens do not do this !! They do not give birth to humans just like they do in Alien 4 !! All comics, games, books and movies show the behavior of them clearly 12, and 3. The queen needs to keep their eggs, the eggs cover the face, hogger, the infectious host, parasites pop out and kill the host, and if it becomes a human infectious, with predetermined poodle and drone with a runner, drone becomes. Four-legged animal types And then after years of living for years they go to molt in a Preatorian (a mini my queen that does not lay eggs) and I can not go. But alone that scene destroyed the movie for me almost. If the manager is smart, they will go back and make it pregnant and face it infected women. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch this movie, then by any means see it for aliens and predators. . And when it comes to the scene that Pradlin infectes pregnant women ... Close your eyes, so you do not have to see the insults of the alien and Pride universe.
