The film was shot nicely and even if played well, the script was soft. Plodding and nothing we have not seen before. Once in this movie I never felt that these people were in danger. Any targeted measurement and a very standard resolution. I believe this kind of movie has overdone and should give rest. Finally, did not everyone see the "Scandalers list" on the planet?
