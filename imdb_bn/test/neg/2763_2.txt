If this movie is J. Smith's performance is the right show of skill, but I think he made a big mistake in leaving television. See which movie David Curso, who is "cold across the heart"? Along with acting power line, what about Mary-Louise, she has done a lot, much better. Yes, this is a terrible scripts, undisclosed edits, and lacks a complete lack, but skilled actors can overcome similar obstacles. A very big disappointment.
