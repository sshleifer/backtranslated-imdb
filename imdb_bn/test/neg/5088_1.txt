River Queen's sound recorder should be fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording. Mumbling voice was the end result, and painting was the best fair average. The story was possible and I'm sorry for foreign actors who knew they were shooting a photo when they were filming. It is obvious that the film is suffering from El Sasto budget syndrome, and the scene where Timur is provoking inside the house and is too stupid for the rage of war outside. <br /> <br /> I noticed a few shortcuts next to the Maori protocol, but it was probably due to the length of time in the movie, etc. I was not impressed with this movie, there are many beautiful stains near the Huananui River but this film does not give us any cold, stain and clustrophobic images. The movie needs to be even more thoughtful about what is more sunny and better camera angles, less of screen confusion, good sound recording and movie gear on the big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Expressing heartfelt gratitude for a person who can create a feature film, sadly I did not enjoy it.
