It is beyond me that why every two million Danish people every week to see this terrible show. Dialogue is not terrible and realistic. The letters are hollow and straightforward. There is a tough man, a tough woman and a sensitive man. The authors actually said that they modeled the characters after the Greek mythology! Give me a break All letters are certainly brilliant police. When I saw this show, I waited for "District Road Route" and "NYPD Blue". This lucrative show, and a lousy copy of "Rejseholdet". This program is currently experiencing a symptom of Danish television.
