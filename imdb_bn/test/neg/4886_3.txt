From late thirteen to 1920, Stan Laurel was alone in the film. During this period, Lorel was certainly not among the gifted upper parts, and his humor was not as good as Lloyd or Cayton. However, for the second-level short comedy, he has created a decent niche. As far as the quality of the movie goes away, they are diverse. Some, such as DR. Paikl and Mr. PRYDE was horrible, while the average average of most values ​​was below average. <br /> <br /> Fridge Hearts is a weird film. During this time, she had distributed films like Halle Roach and distributed by the lessons, dresses were the first rate and the film looked very beautiful. However, despite this and in support of James Finlay's preferences, they forgot to be included in the film. Which comedy does not seem to work and the film is almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only genuine celeb intercity cards betray the film of its supposed type. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is trying to see all of Laurel and Hardy movies, and then watch movies alone. In addition to DR PYCKLE, its two more tolerant solo shorts - try to see the shower and mud and SAND.
