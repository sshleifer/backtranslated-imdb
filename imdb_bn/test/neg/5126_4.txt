When I saw this movie in the 80's, I liked it. I was fascinated by the whole music, dance ... everything. However, I have recently seen the whole thing in the DVD, and I was totally fickle about how stupid the story was - how it was leakage, inconsistency and neutrality - there was a complete shit and how many dances. I mean, in a realistic world, he would never be able to achieve that ballet genre ... The whole thing was quite annoying. Character development also lacks depth. I think this was more than 80 products: this photo is not held today!
