Here is a perfect average Italian post apocalyptic game / theme theme taken on the killing of the people for the most dangerous game for Ala, Turkey shoots, survivors and the Running Man. <br /> <br /> Of course, the review film here is not nearly as fun as other listed entries, and dragged by the bad word for more work, usually the sequence of fake action, the order of prolonged rape and completely genuinely ruthless like the silly and miraculous things. Scenes <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, for example, when our hero led the villain's infusion. She initially killed a daughter and left her in her zip. In search of dead body, villain's reaction? (Remember that our heroes are brutally killing them all) ?? They agreed to wait the next morning (<br /> !!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I think the film will continue to be fair even if you can postpone your mistrust during stupid scenery. And is always greatly benefited by the presence of an excellent Woody Stroud (even if its screen time is very limited <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Italian B-Movie is a watch worthy for enthusiasts.
