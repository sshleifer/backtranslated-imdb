Director Jeremiah Chechake has come up with a big budget defamation like "The Avengers" and "Diabolic" rimak, has ordered this kind of Die-Rap Concept Reepo - which looks like - a Blair Week budget. <br /> <br /> A Arabian nuclear reactor is overcome by Arab terrorists. But are you ready? - Terrorists are not Arabs; They are really American soldiers in Moscow like Arabs! We find that it really does not intend to blow the reactor to make a statement. We are sure of what the statement is but not sure. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists went to go alone and actually blow the plant because he kind of crazy. So after all there is a threat. But the army goes and all bad people are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is too much killed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The scripts may not introduce letters or even give personal details that may be facing them or include audience audiences. So we've been going through a dimensional letter: Expert-nobody-will listen; -Tigger-happy-sergeant; -Community-politicians; -Dweeby-engineer. Each action movie source that you've ever seen before the story is excluded from the event with one click. But in almost every celebration, when we think that something can be risky, the script becomes leakage and we know that there is nothing to really think about. <br /> <br /> Like a hard mick, inside is a police officer, bad boys unbenownst. The big turn is that the police here ... a woman! Oh and very hurt. But that's not bad, just enough to make her a couple of anxieties. Oh and instead of this Bruce Willis has a magic cell phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When he is not shouting elsewhere in Bruce Greenwood - his jaw made from granite - he tries to mock him on walkie talkie. He even once makes a joke but we fear his face might crack. Finally, it's a serious business. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> People in the White House argue with them; Army sergeant also argued with him; Excellent Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorists. The conversation is absolutely like all movies and lines in the movie, "Stop the broadcast! Turn Off the Broadcast !!!" If you think that the letters actually mention this fascination but you can turn your sofa around. <br/> <br /> <br /> Perhaps the camera-work to compensate for the lack of production quality is 21 in the wrong document. The countryside style is visualized with the visibility of instant and energy, but it is applied here unreasonably and amateurly, it is undoubtedly boring. Even induced. More attempts to write a typo tempo include nonsensical black and white footage, which randomly interacts with the main action. But this, too, is that pretentious and annoying in Blair Witch kinda way. In short, artistic efforts are very amateur appearance. <br /> <br /> Live up to the music scene - it's synthy and cheap words. Sort of like a porn movie but with less tone and a lot more heart beat words. Graphic treatment is very violent worse: Chess graphics in the huge red font screams us "9:28 pm", although Time Clock actually makes any difference. <br /> <br /> Maldon can work as a marketing concept but it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - Fox - Keep this sugar product together and exclude millions of dollars in it. Now that I call a maldown!
