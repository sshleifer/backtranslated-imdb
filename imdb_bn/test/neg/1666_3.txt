This is probably my least favorite episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for quite some time. I can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boat, fresh crab or scallops near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only internal Cape, Mississippi River. License plates from Mississippi seem to be, which can explain why there is so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi 2 are completely different states which do not touch each other. There are many roads in town and outside, and none of them is route 6 or route 666. This complete forgetfulness is very confusing. Also, Casey does not look like someone who wants to be close to Dean, if he is educated. I did not buy them as a couple and did not enjoy long love scenes. Joe was more dein's style.
