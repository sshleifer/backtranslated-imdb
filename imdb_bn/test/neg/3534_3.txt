This is Wace Craven at her worst! This is very bad, if you can call it awful, but you'll never see it, esp from a master of the terrible Way Craven, poor direction, poor performance, poor set, poor atmosphere makes it sometimes the biggest piece of garbage! Bad man is completely helpless, you can not feel sorry for the man! The holes associated with the film, and the awful ridiculous, it's just a little junk! The only good point that I can remember is that it makes Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriken big, but they do not even throw it, it can stop it from being out of control and stop it from a terrible fear. If you do not see it yet, do not bother, you just hate it.
