All right, I just had to stop it ... like a great psycho-gym, I'm sitting entirely with this photo. <br /> <br /> Note that the quarterly portion you see imdb indicates that the rise of the 747 was "borrowed" from the 1977 airport. It does not really make up the surface list ... equally all the exterior shots of the plane flying under the ocean, drowning, and even here are taken from the airport '77 shot shot. Except for Dennis Weaver's diving exception, "Raft" shots are drawn from '77, mostly with internal flood clippers. Olivia Deviland may be floating at any moment, or perhaps "dead" Tom Sullivan may not even think. Another eye-roller: Dennis Wyver is named Stevens in the film, owned by Land Steeves Corporation of 77 (headed by Jimmy Stewart) of the Airport. It has to compensate. <br /> <br /> A genuine Calvale of actors that does not work much or at least does not work, this is the first formula that it's going to be a real stinker. This image has 2 ratings - it is suitable for a "1", but if the film does not offer any other release quality, at least one of them is Julie, Max Cufffield, Nikol Egart and Dennis Weaver in their car. Paid the payment Month!
