This film's only release factor was free on TV and it probably helped the Romanian economy. Nonetheless, Hallmark will have to re-evaluate this section of their empire and keep their movies more baseless about odd love in cancer-infected hemophilics in Mississippi. How stupid this film is, it will give credit to be memorable. It was not. I remember the law to see it, being vampire (some of them some teenage) and some very bad dubbing. Anybody who has worked on this movie's dubbing track has to move to other areas of society ... maybe the food service for the deaf. If you have the chance, check out this movie, because it produces many bad movies that seem to be good for Oscars. Again again, if you actually end up on this movie profile then I imagine that it will be too late ...
