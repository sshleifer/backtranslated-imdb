Film is a total misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. A Jewish court will ever apply divorce among infertile couples. Though the concept exists in Jewish law, it has many numbers for conditions that can actually happen. Childless couples find it hard to deal with their childhood in a community where children are a very important part of life, but they are not portrayed in the "rejected" film by their community. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great Rabbi spent their whole life without their children and never considered divorce. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In reality, it is ideal for the role of secular society as a violent drunken rapist. Both of them exist in their own world and both are frustrating. <br /> <br /> It is astonishing that many people make their opinion about society based on a movie (who himself is against a community). I always thought that it is only Orthodox, because of their narrow psychology and unclear lifestyle, who see all the secular people judging on the basis of violence and immoral behavior in newspapers or in movies.
