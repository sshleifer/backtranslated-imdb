It was terrible, meaningful, and I've seen the worst clich√© and ethnic stereotype for so long. Hayden PK was painful while trying to "Veto" (High, Peach Leg Up and Swiss and some Brides do not let you "down with Homs"). Solange Knolls quite a lot grimaces through the whole movie Most set sequences seem like they were pictured in the cardboard box ... what was the end ??? And poor Rihanna simply made her exploited to see her "acting", which she could not do. <br /> <br /> Simply tell, this movie is not a star worthy. Put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least 4 numbers to bring it: Cheerleader v. Freddy and Jason
