"Mr and Mrs. Smith" is not a very well-known American hitcoat film. But if the "Lifeboat" (unfortunately in this section) is an underlying masterpiece, then all those movies signed by Suspense Master (at the beginning of the 40's) are not really worth seeing at that time. And to tell the truth, it is not really a loss to discover this movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr and Mrs. Smith" is an average and popular sculble comedy, where the touch of the hitcoach is difficult to find. Perhaps you can catch a glimpse of Carole Lumberber for some time (but hidden in an individual package), its shadow (which is not much), at a top where two letters are trapped at the top, a trade fair attraction, and perhaps the mother's character. And that's about it! Even for the fan of Hitako, there is little to connect with. <br /> <br /> and Scrubbol Comedy for Amateur, there is not much more: It's really not too funny to be a funny thing, and for example, away from the excellence of Haq. And if one or two scenes are quite fun, it's not even the most fun of Hitcoak's filmography, which has created a ridiculous situation in almost all of his movies (even "psycho" may be considered too dark humor). So, it's really small to save in this movie, which does not bother anyone (or maybe both hardcore fans of Hitkow and Scruble comedy, who love Carroll Lomarde), it is not one of the well-known American hitcovers.
