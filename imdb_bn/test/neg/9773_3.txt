The name of this movie and the clips I saw in me believe that the film will be in excitement and interesting moments. I was frustrated. Desert rays were interesting but this movie matched with a snell's pace. It started fine with an underground cave and some coming, but then something unlucky people tried to involve us in life. If the corpse is found, or I say, some flesh skeleton on them, why did they start looking for reason? At some times it became somewhat different as some were following them in the desert. Some black black dirt or something that humans would start eating meat. There was a headache on the flesh, after the rest of the people a bag of bones was coming out. The reason for these black buds was quite bad as we find out, ants? Unbelieveable! Then made no sense in the end. I think the principle of this film will be, when you are irritable and should see insects, kill it immediately before your body's smell is gone.
