Seeing the showtimes, I think Robert De Niro and Eddie Marfy have got the idea of ​​producing only two films for a film for co-starring. Still, I can not think of any reason to justify the existence of the film. It's not funny at the spots, it must, but the idea is completely ridiculous that the smiles are a bit silent. <br /> <br /> The thing that I really got was the character of Eddie Murphy. The idea of ​​being a police officer does not seem to wrap my mind as I work hardly in a day. When I was an employee on the New York State Crime Victims board I had to deal with all kinds of police and they were really dedicated and running shoes in some real slogans, but I did not think of anyone who thought that it was just something I was far away from my career Until going to the area. I mean, you really can get work done by Eddie Murphy or anyone else at the Screen version of the real police academy's hard work? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dinero, who is on the trill of a big gun dealer in your basic hard working intelligence. She concealed and part of her backup to Marie. So what makes Shobotting Murphy work for a TV based TV series like COPS to implement it. <br /> <br /> So Denier's bust blows up the sky, but the producer of the show gets some good footage from Murphy and Denier, and a new reality-based television series decides. So this unintentional partner joins and try to continue the work of Dino with almost all the TV cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny guy, I love him in Beverly Hills Cop and Doctor Dulitul movies, but he's Shotime and Robert DeNiro certainly have the best things. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy wanted to work with Deanero and Deñoriro, and certainly got a great look at this picture.
