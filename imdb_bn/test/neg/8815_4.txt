I really "saw." The story was good, and I commend the break speed of shooting the film. However, there were many clinics and components that might seem "cool" but they did not really make sense. <br /> <br /> The first thing I like about this movie was the whole voice of the story, and I thought it was fantastic. The Zig Keller's character was curious and reminded me of Vicario Dario Argento. Danny Glover was an excellent role in his role as an unconscious detective, and was a grateful role as Monica Potter's doctor abducted. The scene of Shavie Smith was unbelievable, and both Wang and Hanal should be praised for using the scene as a demo in support of the movie. The aggressor murderer gives the idea of ​​finding a way to kill himself for the victims, but once the film is gone, the argument begins to move. <br /> <br /> Once they showed that Japan was one. Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hold hostage, it is clear that he is an aggressor and not part of it. The scene where he kept a stethoscope in the heart of Diana's horror, Alison was shouting at her gag and watching it as a freak scene I've ever seen. It was supposed to be cool, but nothing was established. Also, there is no problem in the slaying of the police officer's throat because the aggressor murderers have found the way of the victims to kill themselves. I think this is not a way to show that he does not want to be caught and will go any way necessary to ensure that it can happen, but it does not make any argument for me, especially when he does not show any remorse. Which I did like setup) would have been better if it was actually given to a person. <br /> <br /> I felt Valiant Adam was as good as Adam. It was not really an incomparable role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor. However, I was not very interested in James One's instruction. The story could be original, but the direction was not sure. I think I'm tired of the way, on behalf of the old method of direction of MTV style, but a few scenes associated with the cast killer reminded me a lot of "Se7en", a lot more of it. As the film progresses, it starts to become a series of "Demo releases", which I can do. Instead of being confused, it becomes very confusing. But hey, it works. He is now running "Final Destination 3" so he is on the path to successful careers and I think he will become the leading Hurc Director in the coming years. <br /> <br /> It was really the end for me. As I said, I knew that Jagga was not Zap, and I like to discover Adam Mini Tape Player after killing him. It was a terrific ending, except a fatal error: I felt that they gave it where you did not know who the killer was. How was it done for one reason: Boy, are we cute? Ah, no. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great ', and started refocusing it with an insatiable need and refrained from their winning story. Perhaps if they are not too strong about making films and it depends on the more experienced horror operators to manage, but I think it has become a horrible classic that has been given inadmissible in the last four months. If this and "cabin fireworks" are in the future, I'm very scared.
