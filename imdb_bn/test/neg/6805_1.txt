This film is frustrating to know something about true Diane Arbis or who is valuable to emotional truth. Arbia was a brilliant, talented, unstable, and annoying person, but this film portrays him as a self-involved and is really weird in his taste and trial. Kidman portrayed him as terrible and vague, on the other hand he was a man who beat man by his charisma. The center of the movie, which is perfectly imaginary, is incredible, and Robert Donny is really boring in his tragic illustration, who feels that he is the world's bester than anyone else in the world because of his grief. This competition represents the arbitrator's interest in the film "Freaks", which is really unclear explanation for the inspiration for most of the 20th century photography. This secret to me is why some talents and intellects like to be involved in this way.
