I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I can say, with its reductivist verbiage, he offers lines of reductivist story. A F2A film transformed, plain, intelligent, as described in Belbard, does not abuse me about my suspicion: A man who looks at the European Battlefield (Hodson) test, he falls with a nurse (Jones), and they spend Wants time together What was Hemingway's great contribution to the romantic travel story? Who knows these two lovers are common? They are so totally generic. This movie never comes with disrespect to abandon the front of the boyfriend's courage. There are two seasons in Alps, straight J. The crew out of the catalog. Better scenes are reduced to anywhere, somewhere other than the usual melody. The movie puts piling up on that small, unlikely, unclear description of the epic treatment war. Ms. Barclay, who works in the hospital to sleep, is almost empty, so that a secondary plot line might be confused with the unreadable original story. Complicated, it is not. <br /> <br /> Some awesome places are better than photography to work with camera photography. Director Charles Wieder (or maybe Hoston?) Works for the first hour with an on-location, wide-screen camera ... no second unit police-out. Vidor shows huge, panoramic tableaux, pans over a line of trooping through hundreds of armored mountains; Then Hodson's ambulance was made barrel by his camera's 90 degree swivel. <br /> <br /> Hudson likes to watch He is a better actor than the achievement, but with the incomplete material he can become very mechanical. Mercedes Mccambridge plays a diminutive f rew. Jennifer Jones is puffy and miscast in the helpless female lead. The best of the movie when she closes the screen. Love scenes influence coffee as a commercial.
