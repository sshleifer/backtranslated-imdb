There is no character in this sequo. They are all self-centered, offensive or bi-dimensional. My husband sees that there is nothing, but I will not look at anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom that I think was bad Yes, dear. At least 9 seasons were not found. <br /> <br /> Because of the overweight, comic genius is not created and Kevin James is not the genius of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belusi. There may be talent in Leigh Remine, but if so, then he will ruin the devious wife. Jerry Stiller is believable as a boring old man. Maybe there is a reason for it. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why it can be ridiculed for sitcoms.
