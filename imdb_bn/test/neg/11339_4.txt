Amazon.com stumbled on this picture. I never heard of his release but gave three reviews, and so the reviews have spread as a boyfriend of German film I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> Tell me I was not impressed. Production prices are cheap, the story is derivative, characters are attractive and less than comrades. It's surprisingly small to smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it but I got it relentless and dull. Or maybe I hope the whole Monty and Guest Monty more independent German movies than a gay spin. <br /> <br /> This photo has a bit that does not understand, like a leather beer trying to get into an echo of a sling - similarly he even double look at her? Or is the rebel ex-wife come back in the match, but is her proud gay husband happy? Bangum is not sound! Well, at least it explains the UK title movie, I think ...
