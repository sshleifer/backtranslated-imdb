Kinda is annoying, slowly sticking, annoying, it was not terrible, but was not very good. Although there is a good vague bit when the statue comes to life, this scene props. Nothing much happens, and the movie just feels tragic. I was happy after it was over, and I do not believe anything about this true story ....
