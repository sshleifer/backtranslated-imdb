Othello is going to burn the viewer's eyes on this photo. Bad scripts of Shakespeare's characters and Desi and John made terrible representations of love that made this movie a terrible mess. As far as Othello, directed by Jeffrey Saak, is out of medieval and outrage. <br /> <br /> The movie Othello is a cruel drama for love between John and Desi. Faithful to each other will be tested by the friend of the person. In the film's first scene, it has been clearly shown that love between John and Desamadanoni is an integral part of belief. After a moment, John Ben Jago, John's friend displays the scare of the viewer on the screen and shows just how much liar and hungry the hungry person shows them. <br /> <br /> This film was far more intense than Shakespeare's novels. With that said, it has a small amount of good part. For example, the love shown between John and Desh was very well illustrated and it was seen that the couple was so inseparable; Just as it was explained in the book. Though the love was displayed in them extravagantly, it still did not look shocking that it should have been with Othello Kas and Desi. <br /> <br /> Love, shocking, fraud, this film is based on the three main points of the Shakespeare novel. But the novel really explains how it came together better than the movie. For example, the end of this story ends in a different way than in the film. Many more details were kept in the novel. This picture is so frustrating, believe me, those who read it will also get depressed. At the conclusion, this film is so far, the most horrifying form of the novel ever released by mankind. By avoiding this film, viewers will not be able to save only one hour of their life, but will save their eyes from both the boring nervous words of Ben Zaga.
