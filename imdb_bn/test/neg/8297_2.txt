I was thinking when someone would try to turn the whole maternity wand into a goreporn film. Anyway, I learned a few things about Mexico about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women super hot - Remember that the city of the high desert remembers? Yes, well, it must be the Mexican sister's city. Do not bother even with hookers, keep a few smooth steps on hot Bartender. She will be as hot as prostitution and probably no kids! <br /> <br /> ~ Mexico is half controlled by insane devil- Palo Mayombe cultists worship. Hey, Karba! The other half, as everyone in the US knows, is run by drug ministers. Fortunately, it does not interfere with sex-tourism trade and our very few wages factories. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican police are vain. Do not go to them. Visit the nearest secret bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the back of what happened to your invisible friend. He will help more than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ When you are cruelly tortured by festive bloodthirsty culturalists, really, do not read any part of the psalmist or the Bible. You'll just mess up the mojo.
