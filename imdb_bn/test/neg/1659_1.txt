I always rated movies on this site, but I do not usually write comment. However, in this case, I feel obliged to warn others! This movie is bad! This is probably one of the dozens of movies I've achieved as '1 (terrible)'. I know people say this all the time, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ignore But this movie is shamefully bad. It looks like someone bought a video camera in Sierra and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that every crew member's name appears in the cast list proves this theory is true.) This movie contains less production standards than your average high school sports. It's a little disappointing to see a movie that looks bad on DVD. Somewhat effective at special effects, but still the best amateur. The best thing that can be said about the actor is that at least they do not see the camera, at any time, remember. I can not say for sure if I struggled up making them as I remember their lines or went along. Warm and any effort of humor. This is such a hugely waste during the movie.
