This must be rated with the worst film I have ever seen. It was not just fun. My wife fell asleep. I think if you are a dog who is all crushed eyes but it can do something for you. If you expect some comedy in a comedy movie, but if you can not find an English radio announcer, then the term F is too ridiculous. Strippers of the club keep their underwear so that nudity can not be taken to eliminate the annoyance. Strip clubs made no sense what to do. Missing by a lead character was a great deal with which I developed a sympathy. Mena was very rare in the film, probably there people thought that it was a serious effort to create a film. The bad people were helpless and carried many dangers as dead sheep.
