Harman has created himself in North play with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the story is about this naughty, equal and rich story of two teenage criminals trying to get season tickets to Newcastle <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Smoking and drinking, under-age sex, teenage abortion, school rape, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child violence, child sexual abuse, shop Law, homes, auto theft, violent attacks and armed robbery at all here. None of these things are explored, they serve only to remove the story from an inseparable situation to others. The film is not fiercely observed as trainings, as ruthless as the whole Monty, or as reflected in time as Wonderland (from which it's brutally stolen music in an overly-manipulative way). I suspect that a filmmaker came from Newcastle, and certainly the film's references did not face the social problems. I am aware of all for entertainment, and the need to record Harman's track he needs to balance social messages with smiles and tears. Quite simply, he comes here incredibly short-up here. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent ending, but for a lot more flat, balloon moments have to sit there. Fantastic shots, do not play very well, and eventually fail with three important points: scripts, scripts, scripts.
