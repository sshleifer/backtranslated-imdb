It will be the worst movie I've ever seen! Cast is an international one - Australian-Claimed-British, stage America, and an unknown "European" access to an English name. This motley crew is completely undermined by a plot and script of what plagues the passable attempts played from the crew. There was so much budget for this movie budget and overall production prices were so low that it was not a problem to win a cinematic limbo contest. Over the last 20 years, we have seen scary movies and great stock slash thrillers (although not necessarily "high") which are not made in any budget. Recent examples are poorly created but completely scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the most recent - low budget winner, SAW, involves virtually unknown leads (Gary Elouse is not the only one whom you do not mind before). In Darkhutters, it is astonishing to find a known character actor, Dominic Pinon and Hollywood. To save this image Jeff Fai has bravely fought. Wonderful looking at a lovely leading person (Fahie) once in the wonderful makeup of the bad lines is a shame. I could have rated this movie out of 10 out of 10!
