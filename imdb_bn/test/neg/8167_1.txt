"Ultimately the Underground" is difficult to successfully make a bad film, but the film is commendably successful. <br/> <br /> <br /> I think the director can not decide about runner or coach. It's almost never ending. Finally, who cares? Both characters have a favorite personality. There is nothing in the movie for you to care about anyone. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he is in two scenes and looks like he is in a different way.) I think he once humbly left him coach and told him to train. Then after he kinda asked 'sorta' to move him with him. That's it. Conflict! Think of it! What will he do <br /> <br /> <br /> and what is the image of moving images? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christine's form is so wrong that it is considered as a form of contingency "champion" (with no line in character). - Perhaps they are tenants, you know, a real runner?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were running or walking speed? This is actually ridiculous. I literally walked back fast then they were running bigger race. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What they have fallen on a mystery. Maybe they both became tired? And then they get up, but do not start running again for 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add any tension, because other runners are not close, and at this time you are submerged in the State of Cataractia. <br /> <br /> - I've enjoyed especially how four of his male classmates, highly trained athletes, Charlie-Horse, or pulled tondons, or something unlikely due to the big race drop out. <br /> <br /> But who care? There is no excitement, no resolution, nothing about this movie. With some personality, some female runners are discovered by an old, annoying coach, which is a bit of a past failure which just indicates. They are a lot of training. He is not happy. They have some more training. He won the big race. Woopie <br /> <br /> My story is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this one like the plague.
