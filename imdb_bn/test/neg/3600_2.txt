It's coming from an adult, who came early and hoped for a movie to watch the movie and was surprised by the adult comedies of Emperor New Grove. The character I liked the most was a crank, so when I heard the sound of a signal other than "crank" I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I just saw the new groove of the crank, it did me two days to stop me, so I almost disappeared. I finally saw the next day and unfortunately the second half was like a furry in the first place. <br /> <br /> Being a Disney film, I was expecting some musical scenes, but it was filled with them and they were not funny. The great thing that I got about Emperor New Grove was that it could be appreciated by adults from adults, adults, and adults. Cranky in all the truth New Grove is not for me my girlfriend and we both like first. It is really targeted towards small children, comedy is very child, musical scenes are not very good and the plot itself is very fun. <br /> <br /> Save some money yourself and rent this movie if possible. Definitely not a second viewable. I was extremely disappointed and this film was how to throw at together. They did not really make a character fun in this movie, it's amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Everybody's opinion is different, but I am very happy, I usually enjoy Sigeles (SP) when others make them ungrateful, for most of the reasons I liked the first time, I needed more letters and I did not I could not enjoy the plot. I can not say the same thing for this, I never thought that due to the pure barod me, I would block halfway. <br /> <br /> Buy your own risk.
