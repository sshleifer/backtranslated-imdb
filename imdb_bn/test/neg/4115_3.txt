A future where a working travel agency uses time travel technology to send back rich clients during the search for the age of dinosaurs, breaking the original rule in breaking their main road between their customers in the future. An attempt to resolve the losses, with an inventive time Scout (Edward Barnes) technology inventor (Catherine McCormack) team. <br /> <br /> The compound is quite good and attractive. It may contain some errors, but it can still be made for an interesting movie. Unfortunately, the Sound of Thunder really failed to hook the listener. It suffers from several problems and it goes very seriously, so seeing the film is really hard to be fun. Personally, I think the script was the biggest problem in the film. There was more intriguing holes than expected and the kind of movie interpretation was lazy. I was waiting to see the "butterfly effect" more deeply, but the film was more enjoyable than any other. It's a great way to spend the evening just right with me for 90 minutes from the stupid fun. However, all the fun given in this picture was strangers and hair. There were some scenes that gave me relaxation but I was quite annoyed. <br /> <br /> The acting is not very good, because most of them are more interested than others. The only person given a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He keeps the first half of the film as enjoyable and he feels most fun. Edwards Barnes was quite pale and soft. I do not think that it seems to be a leading man. However, he could make for a decent supporter actor. Kathryn McCormack was not just really annoying and very credible. I have not really seen him in something else but he could have potential. Other actors also give poor performance, although most of them are relatively unknown, so it will not affect their careers much more. <br /> <br /> Most people are complaining about the special effects of looking at message boards. There is no way of sugar and they are terrible. All dinosaurs really look bad. Gibbs-Gijar (Part Monkeys, Part Dino), when a creative idea, becomes a cat after some time and is more likely to encourage smiles rather than fear. Green screen works just look terrible and irrelevant. I was really upset what director Peter Hyams was trying to accomplish here. He failed to provide the mystery, actions and thrills and made this film a long time. Although in most cases, the film is quite harmful and it is far more than the worst movie of 2005. Hopefully they will rebuild this image in the future. There is potential in this project but for now we got the best. In the end, if the curiosity is not good for you, there is no reason to see a word of thunder. Ratings 4/10
