** WARNING ** Harmful Movies ** WARNING ** Earlier on Christmas Eve, some brown suits decided that he would arrange our entertainment by sending this movie as "entertainment" on TV. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with horror, hateful humor, humorous jokes and platoon disasters. Randy Coed Kusin plays a stupendous role as Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain dead person, unable to work even easier. He was fired because he was silent as a brick, but he was sorry for the company he worked for, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But as he was stupid, he was able to overcome his vacation. <br /> <br /> I've seen it as the worst movie, and I still have nightmares on tragedy and nightmares. This movie is even more sad joke. It is so sad that you will see it ... but do not do it. The nightmares I have are worse than any nightmare. Believe me ... I hate this movie so bad because of acting, humor, "joke" and the story. The only good thing was the beautiful scenery. <br /> <br /> It's my opinion, and I'm sure everyone agrees with me ...
