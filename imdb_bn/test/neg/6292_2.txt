An annoying British movie from a Japanese novel about a young boy with a plot to harm a Hitler classmate and his widowed mom's lover. Some good scenes (Sarah Miles invented her son, looked at her and annoyed her in anger, Chris trying to trap Cristofers by trapping her death), but what is beyond the shock? Ugly and uncomfortable, it does not showcase anybody involved in any benefits (especially, Crisoferson, whose hole strokes and the word of the usual jackfruit come out of such psychological harmful places). Without any sense of his own ignorance, director Luis John Carllino may believe in a situation like this. If he is right, it's a lot worse than "sailor". * ****
