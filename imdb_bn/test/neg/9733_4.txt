Basic summary: Ipswich was used as a community of documents, and Selim managed to create a confidentiality agreement by hiding the wings. The first born men have got supernatural powers from these families and they have to come up with the seductive, addictive nature of using this power. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually start giving a doubt to the movie a 5, leaving it there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for very clear audio of sync, nicely +1 for special effects , The dark actually cooled me, +0.5 for beautiful coloring (I like blue blue), -0.5 for stupid soundtracks, +0.5 for the initial sequence - I have a stylish compositing and flash title design. Ny a sucker <br /> <br /> Some key plot threads (spider, dark), 1-annoying, for the +1 idea for decent, -0.5 DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter Rippoff / Pacchach-1 For predictive completion, -1 for unused exposure, the screen on the two words and blood belongs together <br /> <br /> for worse bad acting, although the film is better with the improvement Goes on, but for millions of -1 is the development of character, especially /> <br /> All the other women <br: +1 irrational male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for a sexual scene. This style is generally very bad and is becoming annoying instead of hot, +1 to target its target audience, teenage sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, even though this film is not just part of those generating. Conclusion: This is not a "movie", it is a movie. There really is nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) clear fun. A lot of really interesting actors and actresses. Many boys fighting DBZ and street fighters style. If you like intelligent actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and / or mindlessly plot, this movie is for you. If you like the superbly produced film with Oscar-worthy, multi-level, impressive plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a 4/10 using my rational argument.
