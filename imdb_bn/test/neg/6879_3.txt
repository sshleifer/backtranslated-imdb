In old Slashar films, I see this film as a poor tribute. Because it does not hold a candle of the 80th year 80's golden age, it is certainly where personal taste comes. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply slashers in the "new generation" category "My book, cast usually 18-24 years and potential models. I have been quite tired of this movie personally in horror movies, some of the old movies have some variations There were one or more fat people, and generally dorks. Just plain people looking for, having a couple of obviously good looks, they all It was fine there, but when the whole cast is a bunch of nice racks and boots it becomes stupid, I mean, okay, yes I want to see a hot girl, but it is not a terrible thing that drives some ordinary people by a knife. Reflects by reflecting the people run by the knife ... you expect that you see any random person on the street Well, some movies with a good look are certainly perfectly okay, but they do not have much. "Wrong turn" is an example of good ones. <br /> <br /> The next point is that all of the slashhers Should be killed about me. In this poor movie, you will see that the loud screams / screams of the scream and the music of the crossfire 2-3 frames And that's it. What you see is not too graphical, not for people who have seen some horror for the year. Compared with old school slashers were much more and better death, blood and gore. Do not mention the killers in these movies, you have surpassed one who can see here. <br /> <br /> It's fun and exciting to see the horrors of new minds for real awful fans. That pop-up, my opinion of the killer in this style is not adding anything new and fresh. I have agreed with what I said earlier, CGI is something I hate to see. Personally I preffere the makeup in that sense I am Conservative, (until CGI is really well done). However, the most important thing is to set a good setting for Mood, which gives you "to enter the film", a good background story is a very good thing. It also reveals everything in a movie to the audience and explains that all the ideas in the mood that add too much mood and do not give you much about it. Such an example: Keeping a complete mystery for the killers' background viewers is a great step in many cases. I mean that everything will be explained in detail or detail about the story or the people, so most of its contents will not be left to the viewer ... it is to show a pornographic film and hope for the best. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because they were new, they established films of the era of culture together, so today It's hard to accept these new things. The exception is certainly for those new types of people who might be awesome. I noticed that many people like this horror movie, so there is definitely no "right taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for those who can share my opinions there; Here you have a frame of reference to what this flick expects.
