Awesome! I'm a teenager and I do not think of teen movies but this awesome! Aaron Carter starred as the papastarake JD McQueen, and to his grade up or something, he nerada, worked together with the Zen joherlastanamisera. But the 'average girls' are highly anticipated and most of these movies are not realistic in most of the costumes. Can a bra, tube top and shirt be worn in the girls' abdomen? High School? In my school, we are sending home to do something like that. <br /> <br /> and a part of the film where JD Jen writes, is he sleepy? He must think that I'm stupid! I know texting was not so stressed! 'How is the pressure written? And how Jane lives with JD and how she falls in love with her is very stupid. Conversation Chess and stupid, terrible of acting. The music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is nothing more. <br /> <br /> For Tenny-Boopers who still love Haroon Carter, you'll enjoy it. If you're like me, a casual observer, it is not the movie for you
