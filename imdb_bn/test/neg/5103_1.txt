The film is simply a collection of scenes that have no intrinsic meaning to the person living outside of Russia. These pictures and tricks were a bit revolutionary (I painted in 1928) but the problem of the film is that it does not show any interest to the intellectual or the common man. We are just seeing a sort of picture, by killing a force from a toothless soldier of war. Everything is weird, unstable and quite unnecessary. It could be possible to invent a forum that was interested in viewers, but do not be a manager but be a manager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Students, hallucinogenic medicines, or pre-Tarkoszician filmmakers.
