Must have too many background information out of the movie. In fact, in the film, Girl Lizzy, even depression was not present. She felt like a girl when she finally came out of control when she came to college from drugs and alcoholism. That may be his problem, not mental illness. Sure, his mental problem was because his father was released and he rarely saw him as a child, and his mother remembered there a little. However, the way that Noah and Ruby treated were just money and I did not think of depression. She was very close to Rough, who was in need, but she was like that because of her parents. However, I think this movie does not achieve the release of any theater that the root cause is enough with the plot and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> The last word: In fact, if you are interested in seeing Richie's first nude scene, I would only recommend it. Otherwise, it's not very interesting.
