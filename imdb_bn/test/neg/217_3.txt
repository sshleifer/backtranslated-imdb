I must admit that after watching this movie is disappointed. I was much more than expected from the trailer. The movie was absolutely awesome. It lacked a real story line and was not exactly good at acting. Do not waste your time. The movie is not what the trailer feels to you. I would like to say that I do not usually write anything about IMDB (this is my first issue), but this movie is so frustrating that I only registered to inform people not to waste their time or money. The line of the story is like a hayst and it seems to be good, but what is happening in the film is a little too far to be credible. See other movies instead, people inside probably ???
