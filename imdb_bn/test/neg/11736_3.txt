Normal (A) partner I do not think remakes. There are some fantastic good there, but this one is stinker! Considering it was apparently the scene for the scene, it was a good story and great actor. Van Sant's side of the side often copied cunningly, and added color to it (I think it is not that it is B and W to be classic). It should have been at least a medieval film ... but it was peer-piar ka-ka! I do not understand how it has so badly worsened. If you want to wake up, I would suggest you to bother.
