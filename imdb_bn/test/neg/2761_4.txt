I have read many books in my short lifetime but this far is far !!! I've just finished reading this worthless piece of trash and when I ended it I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me know why! 1. The soldier died. Why the author will die? Like a writer of love, why could not he keep him alive? I deeply appreciate Paty for trying to close the eyes of the FBI agent. <br /> <br /> 2. Ruth was shot. Ruth (Black Housekeeper) has been hijacked and there is no objection! He tried to comfort Patki, and then patri sob parents shot him without any good reason! Ruth and the only bright spot in the book of Anton and Patti. Oh my grandfather! 3. Param. Yes Param. Now you can think of people why Perm will upset you? Well here's why. Patti's mother asks the girl if she wants her daughter. Patty does not say, Mom calls Messi Reese (terrible itching) and asks Paty to allow him. Why would he do it in the green world of God? Why a mother's daughter should ask if she wants any permission, she gives him permission! Mother always says that Patty has a statement when she does not talk at all! She should give "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for Patty Dosage Staff. Thanks Ruth cut off her palm! 4. Discrimination, Racisem, and prejudice. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the term * beep * too much. Yes I know that black was free at the time but basically there was no right but it came! Why teach kids that today's word! It just taught them how to discriminate people. There was not only Krishna discrimination but also in Chinese. The book mentions people as Lili (a Chinese man) "The * beep * is really hateful and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate the city to spit a little girl, wrong for choosing Anton. Year-old girl! It was just a crush.Just like a 12-year-old, one can really love a 22-year-old person, come on! It's not "Lolita" and "Lolita" is a good book. I'm surprised that this movie does not appear to be "dirty" like "lolita." <br /> <br /> 5. Patti is going to be a reformer. The reformers should not have to be thieves and thieves for the murder, 12 years The old man is not innocent! The teacher or whatever he is called paty is ungrateful, a broken bot, unknowingly lost my butt! Patki has to get a community service or something, he did not make any mistake, he is just a friend Has helped. <br /> <br /> 6. phaoyartisema. Parents were biased in their city. Hildren. Pyati, apparently at least in favor of their firstborn daughter, Sharon, and their five-year-old brat favorite daughter. Father said that he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but clearly forgot the other girl. <br /> <br /> 7. Father I hate him Like Patio, he was also Hitler's own father. His father does not push him for a clear reason and ultimately he will make you crazy, as you talk to him in the end, you will think that "Patti will get good treatment in a densile camp". <br /> <br /> Well there you have it. 7 Because I hate this book. Instead of reading this book "Ana Frank's diary" or something else, I warn you that it is very depressing and it will make you really crazy! The only reason for the four stars, because of the art of Anton, Patty, Ruth and grandparents!
