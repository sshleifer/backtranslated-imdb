All right, let's cut it - I can not give anything in 1 out of 10; And yet you will see it! The acting is bad, but nothing as bad as the script, which pales itself before the price of production. Cardboard axis? Yup, we got then. Car floor matte silver paint and use as armor? Here it is! <br /> <br /> The image itself is artistic, but only cheap; The same shot is used repeatedly - especially in the battle of war-fighting; There many thanks (thanks!) Very few conversations, and there are many 'artistic' music in the house from Rama! <br /> <br /> And yet these horrors are compulsory - you just have to see through it so that you can say you've seen it. I did not even get Bennet set, 'Plot', or risible on special effects; This is really the film making 'How It Does not' School. It must be seen - spread the word, the world is going to end up being confused with everything in the world <br /> <br /> The best thing, though they have made a signal.
