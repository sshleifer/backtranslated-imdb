No one hopes that Star Trek films can be high art, but fans expect a movie that is good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film is a complex, stimulating plot that has crashed me - it's the worst of nine (far) movies. Even the well-known characters can not save the film in other movies - with foggy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy in Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say this movie is not worth the rent, and very less valuable, but for those who want to watch all the movies for real fans, the only way to rent this movie is - even wire channels can avoid this movie.
