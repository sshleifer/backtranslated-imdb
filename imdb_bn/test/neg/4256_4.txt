Years of production say it all. The film is a fierce mess of politically correct leftist feminist dictator drill, which is a humorous symbolic variety seen as ridiculous today. Each scene aims to illuminate one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of women in the working community, the role of women vs. men, sex, food, politics, war etc. Each view comments through the interaction of the main actresses, or making the scene a superstitious copper. I do not recall any plot, or the original characters were actually. It is a movie where consumers are ridiculed by the love of the furniture store sales window and the sales agent provides his lecture, or where the stage actor's publisher interview turns into a completely embarrassing striptease act. Course "Offensive aggressive Gentlemen equals a raunchy club audience. Then we can move fast, because we will see war explosions in our peaceful forests, we must see more than one inflammatory feminist public speech which is triggered by the men's trumpet or the rioting of men Our movies will see. Stalin's newspaper and all other common suspects The film is an extraordinary part of Ikandi for any (male) Egmmer Bergman Afs√∏nondo, Bibi Anderson, Harriet Anderson and Gunle Lindblom proudly surrender the critics and just sink a movie about their beauty height. And I'm glad to take care of them that I've never heard of today It's hard to believe that the screen is owned by Bobby Anderson whenever it appears. Cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw, often reveling in an overexposed (?) Dimensionless whitishness, and you will not be tired of watching the actors . Thinking so much about the feminist agenda that the film is stupid, silently advocates that women should not be seen as an object of will only, it is not good to offer 21st century viewers to a parade of stunning beauties. As mentioned, I'm not complaining. I could relaunch it tomorrow.
