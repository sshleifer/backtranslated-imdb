If you're a little macroscopic and want to waste some time you need to try it. I've wasted enough time to look at myself, so I will not explain why it's so awful. Stout !!! Oh, I see I need to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: Every year or some people think that a low budget movie about underground ghost monsters seems funny to start shooting, hoping it will be something like a hit. Cavern is one of those. I did not have high expectations about this but the acting is so bad and the production is so poor that I'm seriously thinking about seeking return. Phewww ... more lines about a vague movie ... oh, I'm done.
