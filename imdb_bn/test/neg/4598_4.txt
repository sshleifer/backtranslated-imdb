About 20 years ago Charles Bukowski was my hero. I took a picture in the dark that was created by intellectual type and seen in various movies. Of course, I could not meet Bokoosaki's intellectual type as a hero. They can usually be found safely at the counter at the hipster video store and record shop. These people rarely spoke and when asked a question, usually screams in a somewhat vague manner. They were vain when they came to identify a specific title, but their shelves were always stocked with the weird and unique title. To be included in the secret hipster club, I believed that I should raise my bourgeoisie and help counter culture. <br /> <br /> At the end of my 80's, my acquaintance with Movie Barfi started. Actor Mickey Rurke and Fay Duneway I was then a fan in Rourke. He is a modern male fantastical anti-hero, a descendant of a brooding intellectual kind. At the time, this appeal to me. The hero of Barfly scoffed at the convention. Tram, in the middle of the 30's, lives in any relationship, does not answer, oh - and the heating of the cake has to be recognized as a talent by a hot female literary snake. Later, I read Post Office and Hollywood, later Biscoski took the film's experience with him. Now, allow me to move fast in the latest movies based on bookosak's book Factotam, which I've read and enjoyed. Bukusky takes the form of Cincinnati in this novel. I am often amazed at the end of Bukowski and Chinaski has started. Twenty years later, the fictional movie Bukowski is still the same. I have seen an hour-long movie and I still can not see face-to-face cracking. Why was Factotam Bukowski my hero here? Chinaski Handsome (played by Matt Dillon). He cleaned the hair clean, not the style, but above. When Dillon Smoke and wrote, she looks calm. Chinaski works from work, ignoring and / or fighting with different bosses. He screws two floozies, among whom he lives with one, walked on, returned with only a slight reaction. Chinski is his own man and we do not see him directly. He is a sterilization, one dimensional, some 30, James Dean's archetype. Factotum viewers lie. It does so without any effect of a man (a writer) without any effect. A poor man, who is suffering for his industry. What could be cooler than that? Now let's have some facts in facta, events have happened. What is missing the audience is that of the existence of Chichasi. Perhaps the point of this movie, and most movies, for 80 minutes, we must escape from the consequences and pain that is filled with and hate the anti-social men and women, which smokes, talks, and cools drink Disclaimers of the profession and family's behavior. My hero movie used to be Bukowski Long ago, that would work. It was easy then. Now, I still have a hero claim. Things are not so easy. Hipster arguments and movie presentations of counter culture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions.
