Bad conversations, slow stories, scenes that pull and utter vain. I can not believe that this money was invested in such a poorly written film. Director and acting can not save this bomb. <br /> <br /> 50% with the movie and you are still waiting for it to wait. They laid the foundation on the initial professor and spent the next 40 minutes to set up something. You see 40 minutes of footage which is absolutely directionless when trying to do any work, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This film is really like showing a bad French movie, where nothing will happen and the characters are just brutal, useless and purposeless or purposeless life. <br /> <br /> <br /> It suggests that anyone is setting you up for the frustration and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.
