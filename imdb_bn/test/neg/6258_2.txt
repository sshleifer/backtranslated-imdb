This movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me that it was a Chess 80 slasher flick, which was based on the cover, but it was not. This is probably one of the worst slasher films I've ever seen. The cover photo does not match any part or scene of the movie; Actually it does not involve a chainsaw. Even the tag line fits the movie. This film is a group of cheerleaders and two helmets who run away on weekends in a lonely cabin of cold wood on holiday. However, when they get extra pepper started to kill by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local Sheriff Division is hunting a dangerous killer. I'll name the problem in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. Acting The boy was cheap and horrible was it bad. It felt unnoticed and it seems to have had very scripts. None of the actors thought that they tried to work with good intentions and so they looked stupid and tired. All characters in the movie were bad acting, so I would not specifically show specific people, but I would say that the stoners did a terrible job, as well as police and cheerleaders, which are not surprising. <br /> <br /> 2. Part This story set a perfect storyline for the good ol 'fashion slash flick, but instead they followed it with a complete stupid back-story about plot-holes, vain and unnecessary scenery and killer's objectives. The killer killed the last victim so quickly, and what happened when he was in the group of girls? Ex-Konk did not fulfill any purpose in the movie that was left free from the plot machine. Random and unnecessary sex and nudity spread even even for a B-movie or my taste even it was too much. As the killer's motive, just say it was stupid and he does not have any idea what he / she is killing young girls. Plus, even when I was about 30 miles away, I saw some expected murder. <br /> <br /> 3 Technical aspects The light was okay, I did not have the bad light that I see in a movie, but there was a point where it looked dark but it looked more like afternoon. Turning off the lights, the room looked dark, then turned off the light. The camera work was average, it does not make any good shots or amazing pans or zooms, it seems like it has got the work to create some mystery with its framing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie senses the character, character development and performance, was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. What I think is a great slashing flick that can be one of the bad movies I've ever seen. The acting was really bad and the wood was not in any sense of the plot, and this film had no emotion. However, the technical aspect of this film has been preserved for me, because if the camera work or light is bad, I will close the DVD player and pop it up for something else. I would recommend this film to those who really enjoy Chess B-movies as well as those who follow the classical classic, because this film must of course. I would recommend this film for those who partly enjoy 80s slasher flicks. But for me, this movie was unfortunate and completely terrible.
