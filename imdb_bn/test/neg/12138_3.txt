U.P. Villa (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> Alert: You can find some speakers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the finest but shallow pieces, one of the best motivation designs and the only purpose of achieving the Oscar nomination for the art-set direction (one for painting and the other for the score are welcome). It's the same original idea of ​​thousands of pieces of production each year: A handsome, intelligent woman is trying to find love in a strange place. He has many problems, but ultimately one man finds the happiness of the weapon that he does not achieve. In this case, our lady is in Florence shortly before World War II. She is an English widow associated with a wealthy but aged man (whom, perhaps, she does not love). One day he meets another person who does not have a good reputation but for whom he loves. Of course, his friend who will help him for good or bad and a third man - here in the lady's room, commits suicide, creates a risky situation for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was always interested in stories, but not excited. The problem is gradually pacing, but the screen does not. Adapted from a novel, it needs some more spicy, exciting, twists and mysteries. Each time you think the story will be warm, it will be cool again. If you think there is a conspiracy involved with the original police chief in Florence, but there is no change in the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, UP is not bad at UP. If it is a little soft, it never gets sad and very feeling. Half half of acting, but surely convinces. Kristin Scott Thomas English Patient (Saaaaaaappy romantic drama horse whisperer and dull / annoying random heart) has made some really bad choices after. Vilaeta UP is undoubtedly better than those pieces and Christine is also good, but she can do more than that. San Pen is always good, even if its character is a big dude. Anne Bancroft is a terrific actress (Graduate, my God!), And here she does not let her character be ridiculous. Now, supporter is quite bad (Jeremy Davis is tewyuew!) <br /> <br /> Instructions are good, but not unhappy. It is very interesting to know that Director Angels and Injections (Christian Steve Thompson), similarly duration plays, but more revered. What matters here is visual. Florence is wonderful, the clothes are superb, visible, music ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the UP romantic drama in VPA, but it certainly could have been better. It is visible and attractive, but do not expect a suspense film - it is not! This movie has failed because it wants to see some mystery, but ... there is not much to say due to the shallow screenplaces. Now, about the Oscar nomination, do not worry - perhaps it will come to them.
