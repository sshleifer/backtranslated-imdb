Hanib must be the most horrific film for a long time. Actually, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, short character development, suspicious purpose, poor dialogue, sub-standard performance. What else can I say? Do not bother if you do not see it. I will not rent the video and if you bring it on TV ... change the channel. The only reason someone can see this movie is that immune violence can live with all the promotions (which is why they have added it). If you want to see some brains in your brain, then move that bit faster. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this movie? Some asked him like this, 'I think what's in Hannibal these days' and we just went for a ride. He is free from the beginning and finally he is free. Of these, Anthony Hopkins and filmmakers have self-propaganda. Julian Moore tried some vicious lethal efforts in Claris, but they gave him a sub-standard script and as far as I was concerned, he was set to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it's just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason to earn so much money was that the unconscious violence that they had associated with it left you with the feeling of horror, which you should feel at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> I This is a big fat raspberry!
