Meanwhile, the film is deeply annoying that it supports the impressive and psychological instruments of a character which is deeply disturbed. If you have seen any promotional material, you might think that it is a harmful movie of a relationship that has reached its end, but it does not mean that none of the bothers the central premises: <br /> <br /> A woman As soon as possible, the most wealthy memory of his relationship threatened to commit suicide before it was reestablished. When it is said that how bad such threats are to be said (at least for the sake of), Tesa (certified heroine) proposes that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Where ??? This character uses tears to keep her ex-boyfriend and surrenders her to sex-based behavior (which she initially denounces as a motive), "It's not sex." <br /> <br /> <br /> Leaders guided by Trendy Gold and Brian Austin-Green, reverse the genders and it can extend the feature to Lifetime with the title "Hostess to Obsession". Sound is not a medical definition of psychological and psychological stability, which would include Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> Exclamationist Thompson is a landmark psychologist and tactical game in T-games, probably because there is no man or woman who is not well-organized, who can see it and can not run their spinal cords.
