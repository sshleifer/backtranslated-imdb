This should be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to see, but is oddly compulsory in the same way. It seems impossible because it's actually a movie that can suck too much. I was thinking "it would be better." It's bad. And bad. <br /> <br /> The world was made by junk, broken into pieces, I never knew. Although the most wonderful of all, I see these reviews really the people who love the movie. Yes, acting was good, but the movie was very very bad. The worst movie ever!
