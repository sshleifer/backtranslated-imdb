I am a lover of bad movies I own "R.O.T.O.R." And I'm working to create my collection in great titles like "Boa vs. Python" and "Troll 2" and "Watches Up Superdok"? But "Storm Trooper" is not bad enough to create it on the list of awesome horror movies. It's just lame The man said that he had a good dialogue with his octed plants, that's OK. Everything stupid about this movie is stupid. When a robot man comes to the car, it seems like he was going to fly, but he would not be able to do anything anyway. "Judge, jury, and executor," "The perfect police ... but they went too far," I mean, come, why are people bothering these movies? R.O.T.O.R. It is a violent horror because it makes sense, but Storm Trupper is simply a waste of cinema because it's not so bad that it's not bad enough to see it. It belongs to the collection of somebody's home movies, something they may be proud of, but all that. It was not there because I was off it ssed on an HBO channel (with only 1 star, why I saw it) Even if you like bad movies do not see this movie. It's shameful.
