Maybe this movie was special on this day. But after five decades it seems unclear, another horror film of the 1950s only. In an attempt to attract rich husbands, the story of this three-story gold sculptor spread to Manhattan Panhaus is spread. <br /> <br /> I do not think the shallow theme. But the foundation of the movie is langal. And execution is even worse. This is a romantic comedy, but I saw a little smile. About the only clever stuff about a very near plot plot about plot points. The overall conversation is flat, and so is the very delivery. And the script structure is disconcerting. The plot keeps jumping behind in three women. It could be mixed in such an author's mostly ensemble role. As a result that is a plot that seems sticky. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But he was old enough to have played the role of Lauren Bacall. And Betty Grable, with her squeaky voice and terrible hairdo, was just plain annoying. <br /> <br /> Color cinematography is common. But there were lots of shots using the rear screen projection, contributing to a date appearance. The visuals were made worse by the 1950s that "glamor" shiny; They're just awful. Visitors must endure a fashion show, it's a plot point that will have to increase how the film director was hit by the tragic joyous rage. <br /> <br /> and there are those orchestras. In opening of the worst movie in the history of the movie, an orchestra in the first part of the film plays some melodious tunes slowly At first, I thought I was playing the role of upcoming attraction. But no, it's actually part of the film. And orchestras, and, and plays over. It's nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever with the story. What did they think? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> I said, but if the film had two other great roles, they would have been better, throwing the orchestra, the comedy boosted the conversation, and wearing that doll, chessy dress.
