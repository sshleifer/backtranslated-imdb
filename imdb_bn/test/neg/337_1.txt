This movie was awful, plain and easy! The animation scene was absolutely terrible graphics. It is very clear to see that this grocery was about my grocery bill budget !! The acting was just bad. I saw good acting in pornographic films. I want my life back in hours and twenty minutes seriously. Actually, I just registered the IMDB so that other people did not breastfeed by seeing this work. Although I'm not mistaken, I love science fai film! It seemed more about the role of a video game: (I'm glad I only spent a dollar to watch it! The line of the story reminds me of the movie pitch black, a prisoner out of the ship has escaped. Oh my goodness .. What will we do? When I was clean, I did not even play this game in the background of my house, here you can do well here.
