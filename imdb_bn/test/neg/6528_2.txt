.... and now I'm up to episode # 7. I really hope this will end now (until the cancellation, everything related to the event - including the actors - somewhere in the middle of the ocean was to be dumped with some toxic waste, never seen again) because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This program is best confusing to be listed under the 'Comedy' genre! It is very hard to believe that Ben Elton could write these bad things, perhaps these things could write a lot of input from other authors. <br /> <br /> Oh no, I can not believe Ararmal Ohhanlen really stopped doing 'my hero' and instead of doing it, his decision-making skills were obviously helpless - perhaps he could easily read Can not understand, and do not understand how poor the script was for 'happy'. Do not get me wrong, 'My hero' is not awesome, but it's ten times more than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me, I make sure that it gets a DVD release better, when many great TV series' is not released!
