About Spoiler Warning? It "can not contain", it contains-spoilers. Be careful the readers! <br /> <br /> Well, first of all I need to know that I'm not spoiling the actor. They're just working with what they offered. The problem was scripts. It was awesome. Nothing was believable about this. Of course, when you have a movie based on a killer hit, then here and there, there is a mistake that puts you in horrible horror, cinema-worthy situations. But these girls have made foolish decisions after just a stupid decision. The only girl ever tried to call the police, the girl joined last, because she had already killed one person and hit another with the car. Talking about hurting him with a car ... why did he steal the truck rather than just like a normal person? Also, who wrote the script to God, does he believe that police will not investigate a door covered with blood? Actually, it was not suspicious. The only mystery I felt was how disturbing women were to the frustration. Well, this rant has gone a long way from me to so bad movies, so I will not be irritated to touch the endless and long end.
