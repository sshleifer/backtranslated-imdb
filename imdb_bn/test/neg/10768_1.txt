Screen authors should be sent to Giloit himself for this mini series. They butchered a very funny story and Richard E. Grant's talent squandered. The only thing to keep from the original book was the author's name. All the characters are completely changed and the story is not the same. I strongly recommend watching another version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this one.
