I've never seen the character of this movie in the worst. The dialogue is trite and clich√© to the extreme distraction point. Characters face does not improve in any way - they only have a detailed description of the page to reach the point of not having to come up with a trusted conversation to support the point. Also, the screenplay of the Chinese characters may be somewhat preferred - I believe that a Chinese father can learn ludicrous English from a book (or it is indicated in a scene) so that he can teach it to his daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Suddenly I said, laugh, the movie is more frustrating than anything.
