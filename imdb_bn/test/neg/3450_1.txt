This was in the worst movie I ever encountered. Cinematography was a long exhausting shot (like a stage player's camera on a tripod) that spreads into "dramatic" corners, which make a little bit of content on the screen. The edit was terrible, the scenes matched with the sculpture of a butcher. Mary Shelley Frankenstein wrote the plots on the historic night-watch scene. Acting was compulsory, because of the characteristic development of the character that killed you deadly, each of them died fatal (as soon as good).
