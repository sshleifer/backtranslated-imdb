Man, this movie sucked. It seems that seven different plots are running once and they are all made less in some sense. Special effects, costumes, and all those elements were beyond horror. The acting particle was bad. Everything seemed so strong, especially the huge eyes and the little baby (as his "nouveau" as it bursts, so the lines from women are so ridiculous that funny). Anyway, this is a good part of the movie, anyway. The death of a woman, where she torn the knife into a tower, power was compressed and witchcraft became my friend in the world's most intense skeleton and I had a smile for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The following line: If you are watching really awesome movies, find this one. If not, run for your life.
