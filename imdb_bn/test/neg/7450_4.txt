'Ernest Saves Christmas' is Comrade Ernest's Christmas Special Film. In this picture, Ernest needs to find the successor of the Santa Claus to continue Christmas. On the way, she kisses a young girl who is a thief and who stole something very important in Santa (I will not tell you this; you only have to see this movie for yourself). Like most Ernest Films, there are many astounding comedians involved. <br /> <br /> This picture is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny, and there are some important lessons not to be afraid to show love and love for friendship and family. This is not the best Christmas movie around, but it's good for you in Christmas's confidence. It is a little sad that the film is a little dated now.
