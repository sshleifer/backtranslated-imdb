"Grand Ecole" mixed sex is not a tricky search but if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I think there is nothing to loot for the filmmakers who want to make this film, but want a high degree of excuse and liberal arts set in the unfinished context of a competition among Paris schools for future CEOs for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings. Who is a main school. Likewise, high-level and lower positions have a phosphor of cultural conflict with the French era, as well as a social conflict involving native French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. The absence of which is a woman-to-female compound, which can easily be arranged more than a little bend in the plot. <br /> <br /> Movies are somewhat higher than normal pornography - but "Grand Ecole", scoff at it, is nothing but pornography with artistic desires. I did not get offended by sex It's just repetitive and, long before, annoying. Where do you really need when o office?
