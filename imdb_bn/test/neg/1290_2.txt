Although the dog was beautiful, the film was not. It was not a proof, or a theme that was a problem. There was great possibilities for both humor and stone in love. Theme is a worthy one. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the adorable dog, the unique foundation, and the theme were covered by poor performance, stilted conversations, and amateur movies. <br /> <br /> Even my little child sat around halfway, even half of them left before passing the route. How many times can that dog run and down the hallway the same? I could not loot it for you, I did not see the end. It was not worth watching just all the way at the end.
