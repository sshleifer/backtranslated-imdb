Very slowly the movie There are better performances from all actors, more than 5 scores. The sun and jo seem to be the ideal husband and wife and until we reach such a point we have shown it where there is a story. One day, Joy invented the sun diary for finding out the stories of his failed college love story. The story of the love of the college is completely incredible, because the sun is a proud senior who always chose the role, pushing his friend, shouting at him to the public and fearing he was in love for him. Yet, he continued to rule over using an irrational language. I certainly could not appreciate the neutral character playing the role, I do not think any relative would have such a quarrel in real life. Jyo decides to bring them together and measure what will happen afterwards. The story is very weak in its characters. The opposite is contrary to the highly arrogant Sun Joe (and there is no reason for the sudden change of character). When he came back to become a very modest, the role was a big manifestation. If she becomes so confident that she does not try to find out her love, she is not afraid of anyone.
