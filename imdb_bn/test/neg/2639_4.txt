The story behind a bad child is going on behind people. I think that Antonio Fergus (hogi beer at "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Shivili did not want to push them on their resume (in fact, Shi'veli gave up this life with the best resume). Sometimes I hope the killers of these movies are only after the fools who decide that we need a new set of new movies each month. (Remember: this comment should not be taken seriously; I think slashers have lost their touch). <br /> <br /> However, this is a movie that you will try best to avoid. It's ninety minutes to two hours I will not go back.
