At first I thought it was bad because I had great expectations for this movie, but after thinking about it it was bad. I was caught in the promotion of the worst star of HC's bad movie. HK's new generation of actresses and actresses are bringing down the industry without mentioning bad script writers. At the moment I still try to figure out how to gross so high. Usually you can not lose a movie with Danny Yen and Ikine (forget Jackie, he's past his peak). But then when I was on the cover, I started drawing it. It's chessy, campie, very gorgeous, I try to laugh at some joke, but the effect is not very short but the joke is very recycled and not funny. I'm sorry I bought the movie. Some people think that it is so good because they become intelligent in the intelligence of the ghosts, because their two pairs are beautiful, and everyone likes them and they do what they are good and fun. And if you like twins, then you are up to date ... <br /> <br /> Sigh ... I miss the good hk cinema when jet and stephen chow movies dominate the box office ... <<br /> <br /> Mainland China is much better than movies, and they are shot for less budget.
