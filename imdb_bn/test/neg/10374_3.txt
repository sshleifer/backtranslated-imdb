The film should be reconsidered: in 70 seconds, gender is known as Greenwich Village and Chelsea in a part of New York City. <br /> <br /> This film does little to talk about sex in the 70's, without focus on public hypersocial environments. And private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that Manhole Bar was the symbol of real sex in the 70's and this type of sex film was even more popular. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, the duration looks like an explosion. And rather than documenting a scene that refers to the film, it's important. But as far as the film is said in the 70's, the title is a little confusing. Technically it is not called the Oscars, but its raw material is appropriate for the subject. <br /> <br /> Overall, a "Ah."
