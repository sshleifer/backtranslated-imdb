They will see this video of terrorists as tyranny, not just the boring final scene in which the fight against psychological problems and is not the source of the comedy apparently for the woman who is beating. Half an hour would satisfy even the Stanchest fundamentalist for spreading the beans instead of sitting for more than one minute of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. I rented it because a friend said that it was ridiculous, only he was talking about Boeharhard's director about commenting instead of film. I guess if you find the arrogant arrogant, you would like this. It is apparently true that he takes the kids and becomes "Bengali", while the main actress comes to the screen when the most shiny examples. <br /> <br /> In fact, C. Stacey was the only good part of this film - his career shines like a diamond in this awesome goat wave. What he has done according to IMDB is apparently a movie, I hope he is involved with the theater or indie staff, since I think his talent and natural beauty can really be the asset for a product.
