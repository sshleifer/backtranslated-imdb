Although Stefan Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with some good full length in his credits, "hometown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite this the role of Billy Bob Tharton, John Lathgo, Kelly Lynch, John Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, this good movie could not save the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You are in Maggie's film but you do not see Jack very well and did not see Maggie for only 30 seconds, such as Bathis Llatego's character closes about a bust. This is a film that is not an inferior comedy. It was not just fun.
