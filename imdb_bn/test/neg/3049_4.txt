I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies just test the glorious screen for young and emerging talent. A first time screenplay, an inexperienced director, some TV actors are looking for their BigScreen breaks and see what they can do. 'When a Newborn Call' is a little better than most recent offers, but is still by the complete book; <br /> <br /> The story is incredible straightforward. <br /> <br /> The slim 87 minutes are running heavy pad with overwhelming friends and a vain cheating boyfriend. Killer Jason or Michael or even the original film killer, even without token motivation, and consequently, is not particularly fearful. Based on professional misconduct, police treat these incredibly inefficient and lazy ways. Simon West brings the same interesting approach to the operation with Laura Croft, but his defense style is no guide to perfect generic, genuine talent or attitude. Performance regular, dark halls replace genuine dawn and fears include tired-cat-cat cats. <br /> <br /> More than average for this type of cinematography and production design. Movies. The room is well-designed, all dark wood and glass reflections, and some moments in which visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lack of drama fundamentals, it is a satisfied 'act as a dark house' thriller, and maintains more interest than most of it.
