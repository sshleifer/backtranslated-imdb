At least if you are a Disney fan (well, their live-action films as well as animated stuff), if you are a child, if you have a heart in the heart that you rarely understand that you are an adult, if you are in a movie Love animals that feature animals, especially when they are making plans, or if you do not claim too much, Air Bu Dr.: The world bird is a little enjoyable. I'm a Disney fanatic I enjoyed this picture enough, and I'd love to see it again. <br /> <br /> But the boy has many problems. The main errors arise from the combination of many letters, many plot threads and not enough time to care for them all. In 82 minutes, we got adult marriages, Terri has been in love and is not trying to be painful for it, teen competition for love and jealousy, love playing spying games, dog love, dog football game, dog puppy, favorite parents Let the kids run their children, domestic workers, and cook in the kitchen and carry out plots. Some will be able to send through education. I'm probably forgetting something, but 10 big plots will have to deal with the problem, with less than 10 minutes to deal with it, and potentially putting them in a coherent whole which is not complicated - it's a kids' film, after all - And that's fun and hearty. Wonderfully, the director Bill Bannman was completely charged for the first time (his previous second unit was experiencing), most of the task was not far. I'm sure that at least three screenliners were not involved and probably did not help to direct the producers. <br /> <br /> The end result is Airbud: World Puppy is very sticky. The event happens with little argument, and worse, often a little explanation. People primarily think and act because they need quick and fast - so that everything can reach anywhere in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to the next, the time may extend more than six months. We both like adults think they are mentally disabling and kids who are intuitively thinking of a dog and jump into some unexpected actions. Some of the thread should be moved simply because the film is difficult to get involved in as soon as you are launching an idea, it already passes by you. <br /> <br /> Also, not one of the threads is mainly a rip off of One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), the subtraction of a crula de Vil character. And another problem is that the way to edit the film has been given to me, I think dogs, Airbus probably could not do much with football balls. Contrary to the first two movies, a dog playing around a sport is an impressive here, and when we see him, it is very quick glimpses; Each time once, these snippets are also supported by computer animation. <br /> <br /> Anyone like me, has a chassis charm for airbuds: world-famous. The scripts and performances are often ridiculous, teeter in hokey and kinda clich√©d. I tend to like that adjustment. It makes the film a bit predictable and subtle. And sometimes, in the end, when the film exceeds the complete abandonment and becomes commercially suited for the United States football football team, Airbod: Universal Pup is so stubborn that you can not help but love it.
