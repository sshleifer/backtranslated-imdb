First off ... I have to say not very well played. Miranda Cosgrove is not the main character but quite candidly such a good actress. Spencer, his brother is a very good actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably knows how to work that alone. On the other hand, trying to work in his heart, but ... sorry, that's not right. Sam does not even get credit, I mean ... ICRILLY ... Beautiful self-centered? Freddy is not bad, I have no comments. I must change the attitude of Curley and his doll Sam, while changing their web, they will shout out all their lines. This is going to have a bad effect because Kelly is a web show and if the child copies it, they may be giving their own information and it is not quite safe. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is some fun part of the show that makes it entertaining. At least this show is not annoying, it's nice plot, quite powerful. Many kids will like it because they do not look for errors. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a bad show but it's not annoying.
