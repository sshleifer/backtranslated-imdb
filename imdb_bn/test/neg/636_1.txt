This is how I have sold many of these scripts produced and distributed far beyond the way. The dialogue was so bad that it was sick. Train and helicopter scenes seem to have been made in the flash card of high school students. Lou Diamond Diamond Philip must be hiding under his seat --- this "movie"? After a private screening was displayed on which he was probably left behind by the door. The only emotions that shone in me were sorry for throwing, they had to "bite the bullet" to get one such. I could not stand to see it all, it was funny that it was funny. Whoever knows it will be sorted by network one as a situation comedy.
