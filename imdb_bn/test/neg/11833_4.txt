Movies in Munnan are often the most attractive of all the pictures to me, an insightful artist who examines the details of the smallest detail in Munda. This type of French movie is often very good and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was in Munni. It was not a lot of a plot. It was a character who lived in the city, very normal people, and the staff was right. But it was not very interesting thing, and it was not too insightful to examine. The film did capture a bit of a mood, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And when I can not remember making the film a special mistake, it was a good fit for each level to fix it. <br /> <br /> There were many letters in this picture. Many of them looked the same, so it was difficult to determine who was and what was their relation with each other. Trying to understand the picture, or I do not even think about viewing complex films more often for details, but it was not a puzzle to solve for me. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The camera captured some excellent postcard-type shots. But it found very interesting interesting information. <br /> <br /> I have seen a few extraordinary films so far at the Seattle International Film Festival, but this is the only one who failed to achieve credit when rolled into applause. Lastly when I finally sensed a great collective sigh of relief. But I think there are some people who like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
