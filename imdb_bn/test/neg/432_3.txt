You'll probably be frustrated by this Seagullle. This is not a classic. AWIL is a classic. But the film can be as good as you can. This is a joke. Special effects are very special, not horror dialogue, non-acting and a ridiculous ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly, tacked with almost one-third of the movie (not to mention fleeting). Dr. There is no way I was supposed to mention the story less lame.there was not supposed to be severely horrific. The movie is still stupid to be funny in a good way. Its rating is currently very generous (4.8 / 10) if you ask me. My rating for an American Werewolf in Paris: 3.5 / 10
