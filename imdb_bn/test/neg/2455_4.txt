Since 1936-1939, Peter Lorre is very successful. Moto made the film. During technically B-movies, they were generally much better than ordinary genres. However, Laura was tired of making this highly repetitive film and trying to get friends out of the series. After the cancellation in 1939, Loren was thrilled, but the plan to achieve his complex and satisfying role was not implemented while moving to Colombia's pictures. Island of Dummed Men is one of these movies and it is quite clear that the studio is not making much effort in the film, as I think the plot was written by the lame. Talented penguins, perhaps ... but still this movie has become very little sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who agrees to the secret agent for the government. He is going to enter an island in the US where something strange is happening. Now they've got a search warrant to do it easily. But, after writing the Penguin film, the agent jumped for the assassination which he did not do and he spent the year in jail. He obviously hopes that he will enter this island, because after the term is concluded many paras are sent. <br /> <br /> There are more serious problems with this idea. First, they served only one year before paroleed - but he was convicted of Murder and refused to disclose who he really was. They will not have anyone parole in a field like this. Secondly, if he is not paroled on the island? He will not be in prison for the whole year! Third, why not just scuba diver or paratrooper or boats do not come to the island? Talk about a fabulous plot! Once on the island, the agent discovered that the bad Peter had set up Lor's own personal prison and worked with his son as a slave's slave. What are the men going to report to their parole officers? This has not been explained, but Lorre was using mine for their diamond and they are abominably treated. Now, I had another question that he was a very rich man when he discovered Lor's huge diamond. So why not just mine mine for the diamond? Why is your own version of Devil Island set up and savagely beat men and kill?! <br /> <br /> Finally, what gets him in the lorry and the slaves of the island are released. Unfortunately, then, I really do not care. Overall, watchable but rather stupid Lor's career was better than just the next year when Warner moved to Brothers. With movies like the Island of Damed Men, I can see why she had a short stay in Colombia.
