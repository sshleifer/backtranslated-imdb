For several weeks I was only looking forward to watching this movie so that after ward I could feel very depressed. In my opinion, 'River Queen' was the only good thing, it was an amazing scene used as background. The story line was everywhere, Sarah was able to understand the character of the parallel, and was there a very close compromise on her face in the world? The story came with nothing but a one! A good actor could also be selected for the boy, I think he would read his line directly in the script while shooting in his scene. Overall real shame can be such a good movie.
