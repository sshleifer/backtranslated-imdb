Opens Maltonown on a scene of the scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system to develop missiles to take the asteroid to collide with Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) has mentioned some of his wrong ideas, but the test seems to be an inadequate success. Then break apart the asteroid, and the biggest piece is pushing the path of direct collision with Earth. Fortunately, the huge rock skips off the ricochets in the outer atmosphere and space of the earth. Unfortunately, there was a great hit to change the orbit of the Earth, and the planet began to spiral near the sun. <br /> <br /> They are all running on their heads, Los Angeles Police Tom (Kaspersky Van Dean) and Mick (Gregg Anderson) is a steak out. They are supposed to collect evidence against the suspected drug vendor, but they quickly see the deal devolves between a shooting match. Then, in a local television reporter interview Tom takes a few minutes, who will be his girlfriend, Curley (Stephanie von Pfaffen). <br /> <br /> In a hospital where Mick is treated for minor injuries, Tom is his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Fri Frosso), who briefly talked to a nurse. He told her that she is concerned about dating her 17-year-old girl Kimberly (Amanda Kru), a person called CJ (Ryan McDonnell). Tom once told Bonnie that there is a criminal record of the CC, he worried himself a bit <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> The temperature is rapidly rising across the globe. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to know what's really going on. Nathan, who is his brother, tells him that he may have a way to survive. Carly Call Tom; He, of course, immediately contact Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively small order, the motley group is on the street. Before they reach their ultimate goal, they can manage their highway through looting bands, deal with a disastrous water shortage, and manage enough high temperatures to kill. <br /> <br />> Caspar Van Diine is a good looking guy, and I actually enjoyed him in the Starships Troopers. For that reason he might be good at the action scene. This can be because he did not talk much in that movie. In the town of Maldon, unfortunately, he only provides enough lines at sufficient dramatic levels to show his full performance. Amanda Cruz is okay, and Ryan McDonnell is not bad. Vincent's neck and Stefani von Pfetten both are reasonably good, but Venus Toro is sadly equivalent to Van Deen. <br /> <br /> The story and the script actually create or break a movie. Here the story is right and in fact there are some real possibilities, the script is just awful. Science part of science fiction starts from asteroids by pushing the Earth into orbit and "gravitational balance" of the Sun's system "to drag the Earth" into its normal orbit. "When the LA temperature hits 120 degrees, the cars start blowing up. <br /> <br /> Do you know what is worse than bad science? Bad continuity. OK, really hot. Why are people in the film just a long swim But not the jacket, but instead of sleeping in the house, why are the bottled water pushing people together? Why is the road completely empty, but freeways are full? It is almost impossible to remember the sets, costumes and production standards were good, especially when it was just telling me that the edits were not there. So basically, you take the idea of ​​a beautiful story and mostly Moderate acting, a scary script, low end special effects, completely illogical plot twists, and bad editing, and what do you have to combine it with? Less than the sum of the composite parts, I mean that I can not recommend Meltunon: the day of the annihilation of someone. <br /> <br /> Political note: It has been mentioned here that the Congress has finally reduced the parrot strings of money Gave the movie rolling. Although the tests here were completely illegal (targeting a single asteroid with a nick and knowing the structure of a big rock, in fact, reaching out illegally and crazy), in fact these situations are very dangerous planets. Unfortunately, we've tracked somewhere near asteroid asteroid that might be alarming in some orbits; And the ability to spot some of us in the conflict course is limited to us. <br /> <br /> Once we discover that we are going to get hit, we can not literally make any arrangement with it. We have nuclear touch space missiles to launch; The spacecraft is completely unable to cross the Earth's orbit, and if so, we could not turn it on enough or launch it fast enough for it. I am not big enough to do anything outside the constitutional order of the government, but I certainly think that the destruction of us from the universe can save the planet, it can be considered as the defense of the country, is not it? Family Convenience: Fairs: Destruction days are rated R for "some violence". I obviously could not find some violence beyond a fairly typical T-rating video game. If your tenants are interested in seeing melody and you can not talk to them, R-Ratings will not prevent you from seeing it. However, young children are not well-off with their older brothers and sisters outside the room. Though the shootings are not very graphic, some of the dead bodies
