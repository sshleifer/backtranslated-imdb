This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is a cone of historical accuracy, in fact the reality is the opposite. Just one example: Morgan faces several ethnic Chinese victims in front of him. At the top of the acting, the script is a bad written lie. I did not see a worse fake beard. <br /> <br /> Hooper has arrived in Australia and after writing, only make films so that he can be a hero. Since the script was made 10 on the fly, it can be interpreted as to how bad it is and how the film is confused. <br /> <br /> This film is much better than a Nike Kelly than the movie.
