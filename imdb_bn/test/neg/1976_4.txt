So, after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy film, which seemed impossible after the final fantasy series was not compatible with the final fantasy, the final fantasy: Advant children have expressed themselves in warm reception and now a dedicated fan base. And the reason for the success of the movie was realized because of it a lot of graphics, order of fast-moving war, and some cool things like hell characters. However, if you are not playing FF7, you probably will not enjoy this movie because it carries the story of the game without the previous explanation and you can still be lost from the plot even if you play the game. Secondly, there is no character development, characters from the game without prior knowledge are restricted to your comments 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans, the film is almost sure to entertain almost nostalgic reasons, and it's nice that all the characters that you grew up love it from the games presented in a beautiful, amazing computer animation. One last complaint, at least according to my opinion, the film tried to break too much in less than two hours and therefore spread in the last half hour or so horrific. If you are playing and enjoy FF7, this is a perfect watch, though nothing is special. If you do not play FF7, then it's best that you can play it before you watch this movie.
