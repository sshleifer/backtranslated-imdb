<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and members of MST3K and MFT3K), I must say I saw my share of them. But geez! Even I saw the worst was even a soundtrack. George Lazenby hangs around Hong Kong, who knows what you are doing, you can guarantee that the background music that you meet today's movie will not be distracted by any. Or that music that fills up the elevators. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you listen closely, you will hear it about half a dozen times through the movie. Of course, time will be completely inappropriate, and it does not last very long, but something that can be classified as "music". Your best bet, though, is to have your kids armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans when you see it. The rhythm and flow from anything in the film will be good. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on Samo Hong as a minor villain in this movie. Are we happy to work with Jackie Chan?
