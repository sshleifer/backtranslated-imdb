========== Large Speaker ================================== This is a Terrible movies with likable characters. So many clichés and cute scenes. It requires a good editor but then can not have any movie left. Save your two hours. The movie was the only decent and unpredictable scene when the younger brother agreed to stop her brother from killing him. The details read "The dark comedy moments". Probably when I got blurred Start right with the terrible character funeral. At the funeral of a young man who committed suicide, the funeralians smile and complain about eating? If father only dug the boy? Okay the funeral? What is the bad guy to tell the neighbor of the next house cheating with the character of Sijurini Weaver? The father does not know that his son can play the piano, even though everyone around him knows that he is a great pianist. The film tries to prevent every dramatic cliché possible in a movie: The father drives the succession of the son to the bathroom, the genuinely family loses an elected boy to suicide, the boy is lost and lonely, he is born with medicine, marital affairs, child relationship, but gets raised Husband's son, turmoil, homosexual tendencies, bullies, potential Minala illness, etc, etc, do not you 2 hours.
