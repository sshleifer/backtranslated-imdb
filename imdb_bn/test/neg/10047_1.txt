This bad exercise of ridicule or comment about human condition has easily achieved a place in the 10 worst films that I have seen. I'm seriously considering purchasing a copy, I can find a dirt cheap behind the unwanted company. It's really that bad. I see it as some anti-worker weapon of some kind. If you are like a person who sees the murder of the train as a murder witness, this movie is a jewel. To be just fair, the character of the character grapher is about 1 line which works almost, but not many. Everything in this film tries to be intuitive, but misses the distance measurement between the pair of earth and distance between the galaxies of distance and distance. I can usually praise a book or movie where the drama is suffering from a somewhat existing existence, but the outrage here is so incredible and prominent, and the film does not even address the meaninglessness presented in a valuable way. If you are familiar with the word "flip" then you can get some pictures of the movie. Oh, and descriptive structures are sick, persuasive and amateur. It has failed both styles and materials. If you really hate anyone, invite them for the double feature of this film and "Terror of the Tiny City", and in the 1930s the chasing of the West Western forces keep them under their control and open the "A Clockwork Orange" style. But perhaps it violates certain provisions in the Geneva Conventions.
