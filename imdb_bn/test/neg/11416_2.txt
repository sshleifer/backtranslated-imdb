"Leave your progress forward" is a phrase that they can never learn. General Hollywood's Siegel View: If the first film was just frustrating, the second was not the third worst hit to hit this year's screen. Even the worst prequels, which have been explained in detail in the facts. If you do not see the first two films, you do not like it. It's about starting the ring or Star Wars clock with the last trilogy movie. So this image is not "stand alone". <br /> <br /> Remember the first movie of the revenge for Lucian? Remember the second about the long lost barbarian brother? Well if you see those two 5-minute moments and paste together, then you get? A 5-minute prequel. But the creator Ether thought that this 5 minutes was an important historical event or just wanted to hire some actors, cast and crew and probably wanted to make some money in the process. "My money is looted, I've made a movie for living and I'm bored. What do I do? I know! I'll make a movie." So anyway you get this 5 minute estimation and you extend it for 90 minutes ?? That's this movie. And you know the main "immortal" character will happen, so there's a little mystery. However, those 5 minutes of all the drama of the movie The only thing my eyebrows grew was the mother in movie alms. Sick The rest was Braveheart Remix. If you want a comedy, then watch this movie at the first Bravert. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to bother a little bit ?? The movie mood kept me up. Who first discovered the "Vampire vs. Verrule" concept in the first place? It got old and quick as I got older than mine. And why does the vampire look like the girls in the Goth, look like the VeroVolce Monocory Beer? Failed to hide bad films behind the camouflage. Is it just not the time that we got some sane slimmer waswolves with a simple gesture? How can their unstable sheep, even the young ones, pour water? And why did the vampires rule the world with all their power? Bla, Bla, Bla ?? What a waste
