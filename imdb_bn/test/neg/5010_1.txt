I tried to watch this, and was extremely disappointed. Do not expect the intelligent and insightful humor Amy's brother David is this drake ... it's the opposite of the pole. But if you disperse, fart and boner in jokes, you will be in seventh heaven. This is the bathroom humor, I guess, who have a lot of vaunts, can only explain why so many thrilling critics have announced this shit as "the best television writer of all time". I guess those who hate such a simple laugh can not see enough time to submit a review, but I'm just sending a warning shot to the viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. Character characters The shock factor is set to 10 and the laughs are set to zero (of course, you may want curiosity, less stupid humor.) <br /> <br /> I've made it in 40 minutes, praying it all the time. The corner will be on the entertainment side, but, it just got worse and worse. And be aware of Amy's always present and hammy overbeat expression - it will set your rolling eyes. Nice to see Kyoma by the famous comedian actors I enjoy, but I can agree to participate only on behalf of Sadri family. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those who love it. . This is my opinion. It was so bad to inspire to write my first review.
