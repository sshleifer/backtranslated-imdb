This is probably the most ridiculous crap I've ever seen. Three unconnected stories about completely silly and random things are sometimes interrupted by annoying relationship between a bus and a fool. Why Christ is so involved in so many people. Highlights: The people of the Green Freeze are in Gene-Paul Sartre, Slob Man's Dinner Guest and his horse-cooking hair products, the third short-term an illogical unreasonable woman, who suspected a man to play criminal for his generic pursuit, Blowers. <br /> <br /> I have to use some more lines apparently, so I can mention more stupid things about the film. The first film involves a person with whom the talking car is almost running and is not adhering to its unreasonable demands due to any objectionable. The only way you see this movie is if you were blind and your personality and other weak faults in the brain. It is kind of funny in a malicious way, but extremely tedious, is forced to chew very long time on such a stained hole.
