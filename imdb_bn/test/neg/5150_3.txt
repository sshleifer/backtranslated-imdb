This movie began to be worth croaking - but it was a proponent of the mother, the opponent's witch and a flawless beauty queen continuously coming second. There were some silly events, and some incredible plot points (she came in second place in every single competition?) Unfortunately, the movie suffers from her TV movie well. Instead of finishing the end of the movie, a fun way to release the killer (semi-rational), the film continues for another twenty minutes, to ensure justice is ensured. Of course, now the murderer has been revealed, he has suddenly passed a full personality shift - his character has been completely rewritten, because the author does not have to keep his identity private. What the cheese completely sinks otherwise might be a spacious amusing movie.
