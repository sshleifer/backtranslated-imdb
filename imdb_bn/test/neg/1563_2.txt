I started seeing this step straight after Bris D. Nice, and the best thing is that many movies can not be worse than Bryce the Nice, so I was really looking for something better that could make me forget this terrible flop. Unfortunately, OSS-117 again disappointed me - I do not know, perhaps it is a problem between translations, but from "Dinner de Cons," I did not see a French comedy which I would call really good. Even when I see the reviews of IMDB, French people are giving OSS-117 high notes ... <br /> <br /> This movie did not really work for me - in some parts as funny bond movies, other jokes are a little bit too predictable Or was it too little.
