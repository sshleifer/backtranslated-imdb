Well, I do not usually add comments to movies, but eventually I saw a movie that was completely full and was excited with the inability that I had to warn people. The Blackwater Valley Exorcist is very rare about this wife of a wife-bearded / pedster / padri and horse-fix family, and to make the whole story shortening the little girl who was cruel by the priest, but caught by her in the hands of mountainous birds. While chasing Mexico's mali, a heroic deity who participated in a time with a brave god, managed to save the day the rebel / pedster / priest, but he could not save him before being able to quarrel in a dictator who surrounded him. . All of these movies are in vain (I can be very descriptive with this section but why waste my power on this movie) sh * t I have ever seen. Any and all persons associated with this film should be disinfected so that they do not pollute the earth with their vain spell.
