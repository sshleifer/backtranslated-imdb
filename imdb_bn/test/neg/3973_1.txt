Part: The clones are a horrible all right. In the late 70's, there was bad fashion. Dick Sargent has a really bad performance from Peter Grave. And then have clone themselves. Their days are mostly running, jumping, cycling, and wrestling with each other. When they do not do this, they will learn about America. The band is not America, Nile Diamond songs, but America is going to be part of a larger society. But some strange drugs have been given to them, their body fluid was extracted (the General Ripper was right!) And they were set in freezer and were waiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they were fried at around 450 degrees or more. Oops, that's not what happened, but it's much more interesting than what's shown. Super Mario Brothers' legendary Mario, made fun of a fun comedy with Dick Sergent as a doctor.
