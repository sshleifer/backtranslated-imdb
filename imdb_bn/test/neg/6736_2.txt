I have found that the "foreign" IMDB has been listed on the "100 below" list, so I did not expect when I participated in the US channel a week ago, but I had hope. "Bell of the Beast" (which was preceded a month ago) was a mess, but it was a spectacular scene and was spread throughout the photography and some pretty cool moments, so I thought that this movie might be somewhat similar. <br /> <br /> Alas, this movie fails to value the basic clock power in almost every way. The screenplay was discontinued as John Laker's novel and the great descendant of Richard Ludlow, but it was not done by anyone with the audiences' responsibilities for the plot and the character. Instead, what we've got is a glam, meaning-stimulating, muddled objectives of the mysterious mare, horses, tangled alliances and back shootings. And shot in the chest. And bomb attacks. And eviscerations. It carries with the directory's style, which depends on Hackneynade's 'Danny Shot / Slow Motion', with a 10-second cable work and a superparty jump cut. 10 years ago when these MTV directors used them for whitescake videos, these films were there, and the directors acted like a punch to them so that they hoped to work in some strange art-house techno thriller cooling process. <br /> <br /> Segal itself is very scared. He spends the entire film talking with a thick, throat, half-glasses and two expressions: It seems like he is sucking in lemon, some see a small smoke or groin under his nose. And she's so glossy (and vain about it) that she does not take the camera's duster to its knee's length. I understand that Gert is hard to control under the age of a male actor (though Danjeel Washington and Paul Newman did not face this problem). But by staying honest with you and growing as an actor, tackle it by carefully hiding with the camera angle and floor length dress selected. <br /> <br /> I can not really say what is happening, and the movie does not give me reason to think about what is happening, and the drama is completely one-dimensional and unexpectedly visible. Do not have a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> Wonderful, most set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if you want to erase the film if you do not close the scene of Sigail, then you have the lighting, color and the care and professionalism of the essay and how beautiful the Eastern European will be. But it can not be edible to make a leaky egg dress as fiberage eggs. And the proceedings are nasty in the heart. <br /> <br /> "Cool" movies (such as "v") and visually appealing but emotionally cool films (such as "Underworld") and Paranoia Conspiracy Thrillers (such as "Born Identity" and his remake with Matt Damon). And then this thing, which it wants to be, can not create its mind, pretends to do all these things, and fails because it does not have any frustration or spirit. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with a real budget, so you can not really keep it in the same category as "Manus", "Killer Shues" or "Hogglin's". But again, I want to see these three films frequently and frequently, "foreigners" frequently and frequently.
