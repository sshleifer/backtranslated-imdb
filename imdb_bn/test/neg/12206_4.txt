Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this film. He operated all the Quet in the last day of the pattern between the West Front, Minute Touch, and others. This medieval, Dicken masterpiece will be dissatisfied, even unwelcome, with so much bad, even often portrayed stories designed for television retelling. <br /> <br /> This movie is available only from two known suppliers (Brentwood) and BCI Eclipse LLC, poor quality of relocation, and does not sustain the task of finding this movie on Scratchy and Mood Soundtrack videos. <br /> <br /> I always believe that if an organization has a film to place a film on the video and it will have to charge public money to people, then the movie should have a original copy and should do a good job for the transfer. Unfortunately, there is no work policy between the two suppliers, and as a result, it is only suitable for the local Dump Store dargah. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly called through flashback, which makes the movie episodic and tokyi. Most of the novels in the novel are lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Trades, and others have been spun off, and the relationship between young David and Streeffarth was not enough, so we are surprised why David quarrels with the man. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David and the young Agnes never developed, and why David and David finally marry are difficult to understand. As Martha left, the mystery of how Dan Petty found her nephew And Trudeau's absence makes David very lonely. <br /> <br /> Some people have been credited with doing a good job to lock this film for a long time. I disagree, this book is the best of a work of hatchet. Anyone who viewed the 1935 George Kikro version would agree. <br /> <br /> The version of performance by versions such as Michael and Rothbone as the moudstones must be worth seeing. And both the classic achievements of the classic masterpiece Theater version (April 2000) and the Hallmark (2000) classic adaptation of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak who are responsible for the film, deserve maximum praise. <br /> <br /> Do not buy my last comment on my David Copperfield 1962, there are so many good versions of the movie. If it is on television then turn on the channel for something else. It's an hour and twenty minutes of your life waste. Sorry folks, but I can not appreciate such an unexpected bad movie.
