I like most of these films. As it is a good throw as the other reviews mention, the plot is quite interesting. Fun to see all <br /> <br /> But the end, I think, is completely botched, it left me stupid. Yes, you expect that people will cross-cross and double-cross each other in such films, but will quadrangle-crossing? Well, if the plot is justified then why? <br /> <br /> But this is the bad part, there is absolutely no need for it. After a certain point it is completely all scheming with no money. (Here comes the speaker). After the airport scene, Enrico and his associates already have money. I did not understand the need for the remaining scams. Do you just need to be fooled to cut Federer's nose? I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> So 10/6 of the pictures 3/4 and for the last 2 out of 10.
