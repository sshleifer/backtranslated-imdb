This is probably the worst movie I ever seen. What is the obvious talent of Michael Imperioli is a weak waste. End of annoying film from the beginning. I can say that this director is no 'auteur'. You never ever get inside the game, the character's head, the wonderful talent with the real Stuey number ever. The coke scene was bad enough to throw your shoes on the set, it was a great scene, not for movies, but not at the stage, the camera was turning around the mirror on the drug on halfway and the drama turned up to the background. Where he won the big championship just laughing out loud ridiculous. It should be shown in film making 101 - what to do to create a picture.
