I hoped to watch this movie with a great entertainment movie with my sister, it was ridiculous, but my expectations were diminished. This movie was notorious for PG-13 films and was out of rebellion, it should be determined that many mature references are rated for this movie. I do not allow 13-year-olds to see it. <br /> <br /> Even if anyone under the age of 17 is not watching this movie, beware of real stupid movies, there is no comedy in the movie, some of the slightly disgusting sexual references with a small touch of podfilia, something that is even fun Should not be. <br /> <br /> I want to know what happened in PG-13 movie, which was actually safe for 13 years old? It should be beyond an insulting movie and re-rated.
