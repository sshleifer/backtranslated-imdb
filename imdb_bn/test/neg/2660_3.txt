Christian could not be more interesting than a good love story featuring Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. Cool, refined English beauty and warm blood American men - maybe what could be more beautiful? Well, this is not the movie. Immediately they destroyed it by cutting out Kristin Scott Thomas as an American congressman. It's like throwing Hub Grant in Babbie Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone Christian Scott Thomas is not exactly the type of woman you would like to spoil by destroying the pictures, shaking the ex-junkies, or the smell of crowded crowds and kisses in the drunken slums. He is better off than a hereditary senator's English-born widow, who was involved in hunting clubs and flowers, but did not realize the other half's life. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford as a regular guy police. Of course he is tough enough for the role. But he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is something hard to swallow. Why did Christine's late husband say a tough but wealthy reform politician with the roots of the blue collar heir to the Senate seat? The first of them was absolutely quiet, but Christian was sincere because of her duty, and she came back to show some raw aspects of her life - which her husband gave her shelter. Her political awakening coincides with a new, more blue collar, boyfriend's jolting emotion - who praises her polish and refinement much more than her floral husband. Now that's a love story! Instead, you get a blank, meaningless "thriller" where the action decreases and nothing happens. Well, when Harrison is almost dead, there's a geto style "drive by", but it's so casual and unknowable, it's really more like comic relief. <br /> <br /> The sky is always gray on this movie, and our refined, lovely Christian looks a little cool. When he was looking for an emotional dream, he also saw the uranium and tea water dream! She looks like a little sleeping most of the time, as if she was actually drunk in bed rather than screwing Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> Saying everything, I say you can not blame him.
