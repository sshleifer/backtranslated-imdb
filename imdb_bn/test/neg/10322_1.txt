The DVD version that we bought was covered by Sandra Bulk, but we discovered that it was an image from another film. Unfortunately, he is very little in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Terrible Sometimes the background is so loud that the dialog is hard to hear. Sometimes the dialog is redone without any background sound, which is isolated. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the words from the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is no extra word. The manager is preferred by the close up on the face, and then it is clear that the film is more dubbed because the words do not match the lip movements. Through most of the film, the words of the voice are spoken in a tiny tin like humans. <br /> <br /> Background music, when music is confusing, is rather confusing than filming. <br /> <br /> The direction is ridiculous. False camera angles and sound effects consider the movie to be fun, especially in times where tensions occur, such as in the middle of a gun battle. Writing is terrible. There are some subpages that do not give any sense and most of the letters come in search of fools because there is no explanation for their motivations. The writer / director attempts to explain some of the relationship between the men living together in Vietnam, but none of them understands. These top killers and former soldiers do not seem to see the shadow of other people or hear other people moving. Actor Panic go quiet and calm down again without any warning. This is just a combination of bad directions and bad writing. <br /> <br /> The price of production is so bad that at first we thought that we were stambed in any student film that has sandra blossoms. If you really like students film films badly, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
