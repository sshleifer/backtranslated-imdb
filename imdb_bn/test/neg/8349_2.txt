This movie as a geologist students portrays Hollywood ignorance. At the place where the dog holds the bone from inside the burning room, it is a foot less than lava, with an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity can again be seen again when saving 4 "stan" subway. His shoes are melting on the subway floor, the rest of the group is standing just a foot away from the lava flowing. And to stop this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most irrational solution, cementing off a lava flow with rails. Earlier, a journalist's voice in the movie was heard that the fighters could not try the cars and cement in the flames. The general idea is that this movie is a huge and overall lack of knowledge.
