Hollywood had a long love relationship with the stories of the Boca Arbian Knight, but these few products stood in favor of the test. The most memorable is John Hall, Maria Montage, which has long turned into a camp. This one is filled with dubbed songs, strangers slang, and slapstick. It is a really enthusiastic crop of Mesopotamian corn, and near today's near-helpless. It was nominated for its fantastic special effects, which are often unknown in this day and age, which originally contained comedy photography. The only outstanding, positive feature that survives the beautiful color and clarity of it. Sadly, among the many films produced in this genre, some of them came up to the original "Baghdad Thieves" by Alexander Korder. There is no other Arab night movie though it is one-sided. This is a damaged.
