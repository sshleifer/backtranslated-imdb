I know a big fan of horror movies, and a lot of information on serial killers. Clearly, the film director refused to discover the movie he made because half of the film was imagined. More than that, the character of ad gene was illustrated in the wrong light. I did not hire the movie to think about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I see Ed Gin and his legendary stories rent it. This movie was terrible, I just gave two reasons out of 10 because Gore was not very bad. Acting = Awesome Actor = Sub Par Movie = Time wasted A big mind is around, but I do not have to leave my search for a good horror movie.
