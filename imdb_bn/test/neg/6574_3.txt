I think Leonard Nimo was successful in managing "Search for Speech" and "Voice Home", William Shatner thought that he could also manage directly. Although he is a capable actor, he is here to see that he is not a good director. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always the most important part of "Star Trek", it seems that he is in the heart of the movie, the two most important characters Captain Speak and Dr. Leonard McCoy, just to support him, And other characters are just for adding comic relief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Grateful, they relieve the world of pain and thus join them to maintain peace. Commander of Siebak and his followers, among them a peace conference between human, Klingon and Romulan diplomats is held. This is to keep away from other ships of Starfleet from "experienced commanders" (in fact, how Starflights play, Cleansons and Romulans should have won them many years before). Saiboke joins the enterprise crew, speaks (who is expressed as a secret brother with Sybok), McKay, and Kirk. Sybok points out that to fill "God" from the enterprise "universe center", those who clearly have a word in every race. However, it turns out that it is only a small organization, when it claims the enterprise and Kirk's claim, "What does God require for a starship?" The entity has been destroyed, but not before Saibok, he lied for many years, dedicated his life and paid tribute to the death of the speaker. Enterprise futon torpedoes, and vaguely destroy Sibak. Well, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some time, rationality must be applied. Why do people just follow Sybok for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single aggressive event? I've certainly led a trauma-free life. After joining with Sibok, why do not Karak rebel and try his crew for rebellion? What was the point of sirbak when you were going to kill a torpedos entity <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot is weak. Another problem is, Sibak, although Lawrence played well in Luckylil, badly illustrated. She should not be working just like a human religious fanatic because she is a psychological vowel. Shatana (who was co-authors and directors) may have at least the advanced dialog fitting for a mental vault. I feel that he is talking like us that any psychic Yes, I suppose that the clones must say "no" and "no" than "no" and "no". And the cardasians should not prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know it's unfortunate that I know it). Please ... Each ST nation uses the unique dialog. Why Sybok Up Exceptions? <br /> <br /> Not only is the thing played. I always have the best actor "Star Trek" known, and this movie is not exceptional. Cudos also went down to Leonard, because the toxic Spock game at his old age was difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The late Duffer Kelly doubled the song "Row, Fertilizer, Fertilizer Your Boat" Singing bad singer I guess Shatna wanted her singer's power to silence her opponents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On top of all, the dreams of all of us are full of mid-old obese pictures of dancing naked girls. <br /> <br /> All of the comedy is good and good until it affects the nature of the "Star Trek" nature. Very much, but when Scotty hits a piece of enterprise and KOS makes a name for himself, then it's a little overboard. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only crew member who has his internal Can refuse Sybok's proposal to relieve pain. God's impostor's betrayal Can even talk even this does not manage? Perhaps these scenes played him as a suspect in the character of Shatner. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the body of God used in "Star Trek" was used more than once before this movie. Be creative, Shatana <br /> <br /> While talking about the uncertainty, I am not completely careful to stop the song "Star Trek: The Next Generation" <br /> <br /> All, quite a bad "Trek" movie. If you are in Trakky see this once because it is called "Star Trek". Otherwise, see "Star Trek II: Khan Rug". That's the best way.
