Like some people I'm not going to tell the story of the movie. I'm sure this story will tell those stories about this story. I'm not going to go wrong with this movie because I am here for ages. The storyline generally, and special effects are below today's standards. It's not a movie that you want to see if serious movie buffs (most of us are here) but small things will disturb the whole movie and destroy the experience. If you have a casual movie audience, they like to get a good time when they see a flash, but this movie is suitable for you, a lot of fun. It will be a good movie to take a partner. Just the movie buff for us <br /> <br /> <br /> 5
