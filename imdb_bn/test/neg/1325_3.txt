I do not know, maybe I was not in the mood of this kind of movie, but it was full of Trude Morodrome. It seemed very disjointed at very long and at least (given, I did not pay full attention ...). For more entertainment in the Stalinager war, see the enemy at Gates. True, some violent people will blame the cause of Hollywood movie and will not show "the great reality of war" like this "wonderful foreign movie", but it is flowing better and it's more fun to watch. Along with this, there are already plenty of "Reti" war movies, and it is only done in amateur. But hey, you might like it, so go ahead; It was not just for me.
