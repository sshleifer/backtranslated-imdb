Anderson fairy tail as a child loves love and recently this odd, bright, author, I saw some strange documentary looking forward to seeing the film made for this TV. Unfortunately the anger and misunderstanding left me was nothing except a disappointment. The first story / script is full of flaws and mere imagination, and in this way Anderson's fairy tales shamefully creates a whole new story, to sell suckers like me. Secondly, the beautiful actress (really ... see the picture of the true Anderson?) Kiran Bru Hans has directed Christian to be portrayed mentally disturbing as an impressive character, though she was actually a very boring character. Although annoying and annoying like Anderson, Bruce is not necessarily charisma needed to create a feeling of compassion. Thirdly. Love story in Andresen and the mythical JETTA (actually, Henry, Edward Colin should be wife) ... why? This man has made such an interesting lifestyle, it should be as good as the foundation of a great movie! <br /> <br /> I can continue to be a long list, but it is safe for you to recommend it to everyone. Instead of spending your time and money on something else.
