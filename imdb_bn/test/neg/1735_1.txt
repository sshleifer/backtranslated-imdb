What really stood up to me about this movie is how low this plot is. So many characters were randomly launched, it was like I imagine Tommy Wiseau's "The Rome" to be conceived again for the Disney Channel set. How did "Soda" combine them, or when Zenine's mother / stepmom / shouted crying woman did the same thing, which was always our wise old couple when telling the same story about random times. <Br> <br /> Aaron Carter's performance must be highlights: I was really looking at the scene I saw. The edit is painfully bad, does not create any sense of the scene. The character of "Jane" is really irritating, about the moon and moping about "J.D. McQueen." The scenes of "Music Awards" are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
