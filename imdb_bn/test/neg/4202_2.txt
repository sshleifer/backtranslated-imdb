This is a very annoying and reluctant action film, and without Chuck Norris it can be intolerable! Plus low budget shows big time! This fight was a bit good, but the story was ridiculous, and there was no dangerous villain in it. The dialogue was ridiculous, I had some problems to finish this film, but Chuck Norris, it was a little overwhelming. I really do not have much to say, since I was only paying half of the attention, because it was so incredibly annoying but it chose a little bit in the end. Directions horrible Don Hewlett, here's a terrible work, lounge photography, a terrible motion, and overall the film looked dull! There is no excuse. Acting was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicked the donkey, and he made the film almost portable (Chalk rules!). George Murdoch, terrible as the main villain, and very uncomfortable. Terry O'Connor, modest here, and chalk were just chemistry. Michael Agnestine, as the chalk's brother is as modest. Overall it is quite easy! * 5 (Chalk saves it from BOMB rating).
