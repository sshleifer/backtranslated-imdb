This month before Netflix saw on the instant and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Tell me, most other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad direction. I liked Russell and Perre, "back in the old days" and was very optimistic for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in film and made dishes and sandwiches, still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused that the last 5 minutes of the film were released. I even rewound it to make sure that something was missing. How does this movie completely end "wrapping"? I suppose that the idea seems to be good, probably the script was provocative, but the budget was so existant that the set was really lacking. And yes, I think all those "bad sets" were an attempt to give viewers a formula. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, believe me that Shatter Island is the same deal, 50 to 60 times more than the budget! (I do not know how much dark world costs, but I hope they will not leave 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So, I used to think that if someone scribbles the script, bit is a good "look" A beautiful visual designer, or better post-colored, just wanted to refer to anyone with philosophy) has got a big budget for it, they can rebuild the Dark World in a passable product. Now it sounds like that's a shutter island. Looks like they've got the right eye, but the scripting may still be closed. Money can not be taken, but it should be Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS is my 2nd star rating for Russell and Shepherd.
