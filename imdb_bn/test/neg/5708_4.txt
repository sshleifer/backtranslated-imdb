A woman related to the industry began an enthusiastic love relationship with a man named John. They make love everywhere and they play sexual games. They did the problem I had. There was no plot in this movie or I did not see it. Hot erotic passion was good thing about this movie but I wanted to do something else. Perhaps he could be a serial killer or he might have a secret. I just needed something and needed all that was in a bunch of love scenes. It was not bad or anything, I just wanted to happen to something more in the movie. Perhaps a colleague was asleep with her. Something! I was in great discomfort that was all that that was. Then Mickey was so hot with Rou. I wonder what happened.
