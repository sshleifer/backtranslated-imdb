My mother and I, rent this movie I mean, we like the kind of scientific-fly flickr, whether they are big Hollywood flip or indie flicks. <br /> <br /> But oh, we made fools !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small town in Texas. Through half, all of the sudden things get all Christians on us. My mother and I believe in God and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was being broadcasted annoyed us. I really want to say, we are Christians, but even we have fun. So do not blame Christians completely, only blame those Christians who want to get fun from this movie. <br /> <br /> You can clearly explain that the directors look at the UFO position, and he believes it all demonic. Now, I could say some words, but I do not I would say, do not see this movie, unless you are promoted. In fact, many times it has been said that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, last time I checked, the only perfect person died on the cross.
