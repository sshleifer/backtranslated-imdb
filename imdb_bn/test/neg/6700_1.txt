Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time it is fine and I can go with my life, but in this case I feel the need to warn others. As an expert in the Iraq war, I told that after the return of a troop, the story, plot, acting and screenplay were pure garbage. The director / writer / anyone who was involved with the returning of the soldier and ran with him and ran with him, was in the same way. Not to mention that I did not see any paper in this film. The "marine" uniform seemed like it was fresh from the shelf of an extra garden shop and it was not the first pattern used from the first pattern. I do not have to go forever, this is a horror movie. There are many better options if you're interested in the back soldiers' story. I recommend going to your local library.
