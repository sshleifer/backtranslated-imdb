A great gangster flick with brilliant performance by the well-known actor with great action scenes? Well, this is not the one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst they might be present is probably. <br /> <br /> First, the plot will expect it from your average gangster biography, nothing new, it does not have any fancy. As it is said, the film looks taller than it was (when I thought that two hours should have ended almost, I was surprised that only 45 minutes have passed) <br /> <br /> Action scene, for example, 80 TV series - See as many as a team. In the 80's (with A-team in ATT) those scenes were much more sophisticated than "El Podrino". People point to air in their air, and it hurts a bit, especially for fun (no one can pass on to somebody else, which looks like they have shot). <br /> <br /> The acting action fits nicely. Everything you do (DOLF Lundgren style) will get the same response, or it's a restraint that you think is a parody (but unfortunately it is not). <br /> <br /> My suggestion is far better than this one, far away from any other gangster movie this one.
