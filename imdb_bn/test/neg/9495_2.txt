I do not know much about Marquis de SÃ¡d, unable to read his books, but I never imagined him as a burning queen. The action of I. Kerry Karelly Streit Gaya, or Will and Grace Jack, could easily fit the role that Nicole Monkuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The film was rather thin and looked more like a parody - or an excuse to show the parishes of Paris that has a good time in the uprising of the parlor with men and women. What? Can they afford a room? Madam (Irina Malisheva) thinks that she feels her patriotic responsibilities to care for the needs of the soldier. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show many breasts - and I mean a lot! Gimli (John Rice-Davis) fans might be interested in playing a different role as Inspector Marais.
