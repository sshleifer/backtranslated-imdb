I really enjoyed the first movie and when it started again, without thinking, or checking, I took a family of friends to see it. I was ashamed that I was so excited about them. <br /> <br /> Disney realizes a real meal like the real movie - it takes some good and goes out ... well, you know. And by having a dark-skinned person as a FBI man, fingerprint results of informational readers were reduced. <br /> <br /> As an isolated movie, I guess it's not too bad if it's a weird choice. Things, but when someone read books or saw the first picture - awesome!
