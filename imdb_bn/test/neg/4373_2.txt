Police Logan Alexander and Debbie Rocon crossed the cross country of five black boys and leaked into the sticks when their van broke. After in a deadly run with a racist, white trash buds with a shotgun (directed by white), survive a blind voodoo priest take shelter home.

He heard since Hey Hough was canceled that he killed stupid characters while vibrating some of the worst one-fishing devices. <br /> <br /> Terrible to be played from "thirteen", dialogue is even worse, FX stink and it looks much cheaper than the first film. Although I enjoyed him in his earlier trombay films, Trent Haga (trying to imitate Jim Carrie here) is terrible and there is no match for Angel Vargas' hyperactivity suggestion (at least some fools laugh). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin for the full moon studio, whose transceiver / pootet master has disappeared completely from the master day as a live-to-live freeway.
