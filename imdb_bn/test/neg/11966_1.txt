Local sports group involve new preoccupation in the cerebral post mortem and guess what? There is a scarecrow to kill people there. Only one bride survives, but due to diabetes, she suffers from diarrhea. Meanwhile, the horrific people started to kill all involved, one after the other. What a terrible secret? Do they need to find it before the scary gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. The sound is ok but the pictures are really corny. The plot / script really sucks and is quite sad and non-ferrous. Acting is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. The cant actually has a lot to say about particular effects because there are not many, but some are OK from the bad (for less budget). There is some nudity and it is probably the only thing that can be seen in the movie (if you have a horny teen, if not, leave the film together). Do not see it on another full waste of time and money. Also hack'n'lash goes for fans.
