As told by others, this is a ridiculous horror movie (not a film!). It's not a funny way to try, it's just painful to try. Do not waste your time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Can see. Also, he is getting fat. <br /> <br /> It is very bad to think that war scenes are unexpected, if you know or care about martial arts or even proper dance forms, and the edits / effects are uncomfortable <Br> <br /> There is no salary, it does not go anywhere, and reach there.
