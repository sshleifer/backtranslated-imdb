Why is this film made? What was this thinking maker?!? The first 8mm film had at least one plot which made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about snap film industry. About this signal ... is kept ... pornography !! Yes, such as the Sniff Film Industry, an art that was massacred to entertain people, was in the same league with the adult film industry, an art where people involved in other people in immoral sexual activities and situations, for eroticism. You should be careful about this idea about how bad the concept of this film is supposed to be. It is not helped by the plot, character, acting, direction, script, reasoning, theme, even even the lack of sound design. This is an extraordinary annoying movie that I have never watched. Literally nothing works. Why involved in a mystery about pornography involving the film the murder of the thriller and betrayal? I do not have much interest in adult movies, but of course I have seen them before. Why would anyone make a movie about his temple and they will make a sequel in a movie of sniff movies? I do not know whether there is an industry involved in making snaf film, but I do not expect. The idea of ​​a snack film alone is horrible and only those who are really sick and bad will be a part of it. I do not think that the adult film industry is moving around killing and torturing. I'm sure many people create pornographic films to make good intent instead of hitting and killing people. It's not okay to hurt other people. Adult film industry is not about human harm. This is to me, to make movies, to isolate and waste of time. What is this picture trying to say? It does not work.
