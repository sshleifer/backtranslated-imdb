Actually it was awful. Of course, the main chick who was helpless surely was sleeping with the director. It was shot in some warehouse owned by most families or friends. Also they decided to not bother coming up with a story. Certainly the ways to cut this cost, but are they smart ways to keep costs down? No they do not. At the very least they could find a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. Those kids may have at least one lesson about the formation of the story. At a very short time, they could fall on three law frameworks, but of course, acting was not a priority. In the 1980s, it was an embarrassment to turn around these jokes around fooly intelligent dresses. To commit suicide in the act of insulting these actors that this film has received a limited distribution rule. Actors actually saw the final results of their hard work, then there was a line of people waiting for jump from Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie 10/10 star but it's only deserved for 1 being released. Film throughout this movie should be shown to students. I saw it is better than the 90% female film and it is a part of this movie.
