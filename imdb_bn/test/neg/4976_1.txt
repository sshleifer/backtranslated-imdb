Unforgiven Clint Eastwoods once paid tribute to the great west. But I thought it was going to be good and I was sorry to raise the bar for future Westerners. Unforgiven, although the plot is easy to fall flat on the letters and emotions and I must say that the Unforgiven Eastwood dates to the worst film. Eastwood feels himself old as a part of acting and direction, which reduces the overall appearance of the film. <br /> <br /> All letters, especially around the edge of the Eastwood character, roam around. Does not seem to be the flow of acting and the characters do not seem to appreciate the contribution. The direction is badly confused by quirky shots. So the overall Unforgiven is not by the best of Eastwoods and by one of the worst western wines.
