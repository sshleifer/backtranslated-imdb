I liked the first 1/3 of this movie and thought it was going to be one of the best films of Truth. I like plots where a pen Paul marries a man from half way across the world - the sight is invisible. Especially when this woman was fraudulent and responsible for the death of the original pen, she could take her place! Then she disappeared by clearing her husband's huge bank account! I was really fuzzy and wanted to see more, <br /> <br /> And then the film got separated and just became stupid! He came from New Caledonia (Pacific Island) and came from an island in the Human Ocean during his trip to the south of France, although he almost immediately glimpsed over him. Hmm ... .... weird 187,000,000 to 1 but he found him. Then, instead of killing him or bringing him back to the police, he pardoned him - even when he acknowledged what he had done. Okay - It's hard to believe, but it's okay ... but then killing him helps to hide him from a secret detective !!!! Anyone stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Denove is very nice playing but the people came - it's just fools Moreover, if he only wanted her as sex objects why would she do it for a woman who is often frustrated and completely selfish and evil. <br /> <br /> This film does not deserve such high rating due to the ridiculous plot! Unless you're a dead-hard trot fan, try another film - even one of Truffauts - just this one.
