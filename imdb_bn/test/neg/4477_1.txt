I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked fun. Someone idea of ​​making a hungry 50s giant film might be worth a few smiles, but instead of this title only bores. First off, there is almost no Froggg in the movie which is the biggest disappointment. I used to travel with 75+ minute hair drama and dialogue so that Frog frozen a bare breasted chick. Why? The lack of any kind of fun plot on that film above. I mean, just saying something is a little funny. I want to see some hot girl searching for Swap's creature, I wanted to drag some catchers into the rescue (animals from the black legoon stuff), I'd like to see some dirty action scenes, Froggg is going to kill a murder, or it's likely to escaping a stupid trap. . Something exciting! Geez, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit through an instinctive and tiring dialog scene in an animal flick? My suggestion to filmmakers: Keep going, your ideas are good, but your execution will be much more motivated. Make some fun with the creatures, humor yourself in action and most importantly ... Put more animals into a living organism !!!
