If you are a Christian or a Jew then you are hoping to watch the scriptures of Biblical (or Torah) free events, you will be frustrated by this movie. People who are not in the bible in general Hollywood fashion have been created to support the characters and "play a big role in the movie". Jethro's role has changed radically, and she is nothing but a disbelieving father in place of a shepherd priest who gave Moses a wonderful suggestion. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead the viewer thinks that Moses had to find some things for himself. There can be no other than the truth. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to put most of the responsibility on Moses to try to understand a common human turn on the things of the Bible and to understand what God wants. Those who know the book of love well, they will not only see incompatibility in movies, but also show changes in events. Most importantly, they will see the complete disappearance of God's dialogue with Moses, which sets out what Moses does after the burning bush. While away from being portrayed in the film, Moses is directed by God in detail and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even hallmarks can not accept God's direct role directly, and Moses has no knowledge of many events besides his spoken words. In compensation, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For example, after the golden calf God hurts people and they must see the symbol of a serpent. Hallmark creates a civil war instead and Israel selects, then kills one another. Musharraf must definitely win. <br /> <br /> This film can have minimum value for the unbelievers, because it can ask their answers, but the believers must stay away. Rendering events and changes make someone who does not know their Bible. Read passengers for yourself, there is no alternative.
