The fourth installment of the series ended the release of the theater. It seems like it's straight in the video movie. It's okay, I guess, but not something special. This is the worst performance in the series at the moment. And there is not much like imagination, like the third movie. Also, "The sentence conducted by Allan Smith" is not a good thing. Semitic is the pseudonyms that they use when they do not want to do with the movie. , It is an acceptable film in the series of Helresia, but not much more than that. It drops the quality from the number three and drops from the first two. Heliester IV for me: Bloody is a 4.5 / 10
