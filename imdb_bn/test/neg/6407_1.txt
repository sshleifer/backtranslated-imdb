The movie starts well, it's a thing going on for it. About 1/3 of the film's films goes to Dhaka. Carr starts an excuse for number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? There is no reason to go to the nut and start writing stuff on your body and on walls. <br /> <br /> Anyone playing his son is acting bad. From the journey, as soon as he heard the sentiments of his forefathers, he skips on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. Completely incredible. I can not see this child again in another movie. <br /> <br /> It's time to watch this movie. Hold the other. Boring piece ... well. Is his number killing him? Give me a break. I will not spoils you for the end, but just say it is equally frustrating. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
