This movie is very bad. Actually, why I gave it 2 instead of 1, because it laughs me. Except some distance, a man's head actually exploded in this picture. It was very sad, I laughed. I believe the scene was not meant to be funny but it's meaningless. Completely meaningless Original Halloween is such a good movie, it is a shame that they go and make such a stinker.
