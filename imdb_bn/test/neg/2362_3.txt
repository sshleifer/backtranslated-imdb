This extremely door-basement blackslowment / kungfu hybrid was published in my country by a suspicious dvd label, which usually talks about the transfer of a pure strap on the disc, so it was not a favorable herald. Other titles such as "The Black Seaks", "The Black Sexte", "The Black Gastapo" and "The Black Godfather" have been released and are judged by their low ratings and negative reviews, none of which is included in the 70th Black Plupletion Hype's elite. No, no. "TNT Jackson" is a beautiful shy film, it lacks a significant plot, but it has a lot of ridiculous war scenes and awesome acting to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman ?? Is it too embarrassing to make some simple money ?? Two regional Kung-Fu films and contemporary Trendy Blacksplatations will attract fans of Flickr to quickly discover two simple aquilites for a simple story. The results came with Syriac H Santiago and Dick Miller "TNT Jackson"; The story of an ass-hooping black babe during Hong Kong trips in search of her missing brother. He quickly discovered that he was killed by a criminal network of drug traffickers and he took an oath to take revenge. Mrs. Jackson easily enters the underground area and encounters loads of macho pimps, helpful secret agents, harmful Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing to make sure; They all want a piece of TNT's destructive body somewhere or somewhere else. I sincerely doubt the movie ideas get more elementary than this, but ?? Unfortunately - all other aspects too sua. The war scene is overlong and as well as pathetically stageaged. Jenny Bell and other poor suckers try hard to harden and assume a tough position, but eventually they jump in the air and jump across the cute room. Cinematography is horrific, soundtrack extremely frustrating (whatever the soul music is?), Some conversations are badly written and the performance performance is inferior. Which is saying, Jeannie Bell is a beautiful woman perfect, but she still can not hold a candle in Tamara Dobson or Palm Grey. "TNT Jackson" is a good and memorable scene, namely the famous hotel room war where the Bell, completely naked, without the parents of children, repeatedly halts and closes the hell from some gangsters. Funny scene ... I still could not find out whether the light switch is full size breast thanks to the breast.
