This show now shows the real colors that the Democrats are in power. It did not lead the world in IQ because anyone who thinks it is an intelligence, has been programmed to think in some way (which is a terrible thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central has been removed and it has gone back once the Democrats have the power for any reason - because now when the Democrats screw up - often like Republicans - Stuart does not take a shot at them. . <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> These up-to-back events speak for themselves. The same humorous work was canceled in the Jay Leno show. Letterman and Canaan's ratings and the following shows them. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. If any of them started accepting real rips in the Democrats in power, they could speed up their ratings because the best humor is always the cost of power. Bush years proved that the ratings of this event and Colbert, Letterman and Leno were higher there. <br /> <br /> Obama has done one thing, proves that these programs are more likely to take chances and rip. The folks in power are able to make progress. Daily Shows and Stuart Sagging, but perhaps they can be lucky and in 2012 Palin was elected the first woman president. Then the junkie ratings of the Palli Palin will be grabbed.
