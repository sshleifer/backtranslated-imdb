A lassie movie that "should sleep" .... should. In this way I will describe a painting period of a picture during the painting period. So in every aspect it becomes a poor, reluctant mess, in a moderate, one of the most forgotten movies I've seen. This is not an achievement as a "very bad-it-good" or "very bad-it's memorable" movie. Lascie seems to be looking at the bad but it has happened quickly, so slowly, while sitting at your sitting, feeling your life, non-actors stop cou cards waiting for their brain behind. <br /> <br /> This is an empty, open shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth the loss of time for you or your kids. Until both of you are heavily medicated. That's what I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will run you crazy! Ahhah, what is this? Beware! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a rough week.
