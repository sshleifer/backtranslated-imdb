Generally, I am criticizing some of the prominent Nindarthathals for not praising a movie, unless it has plastic T * ts, gunfight and traffic. However, in this case the film has actually improved with some additions. At least one hour later I did not become disturbed and did not change the channel. <br /> <br /> I do not think of something spiritual, and of course I will not mind to remember that laziness or to get the hidden meaning, but the whole thing will be some point. I do not think the writers or the directors actually had some broad perspective, but instead deliberately wasolate themselves so self-absorbed in their own terrible perspective. Or perhaps they just got confused themselves. Both ways, I do not care. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Respectfully disagree. Perhaps I could not quite understand any inspired tactics through the movie class, not just in the comments ... <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie was just shit. <br /> <br /> I gave it "1" and gave the file next to "Esther".
