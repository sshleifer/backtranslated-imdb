If you have not heard of Jane Austen, you have seen a pop up version of the original movie or the BBC adaptation of 1995 or even the book, this harmful attempt to show this classic love story can be considered vaguely durable. <br /> <br /> From the early scene, this film must be remembered for its grossly starring, hateful miscasting and the complete lack of classic intelligence of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> Anyone who decides to cast an actor (Exclusive Judy Denche without exception) who never heard of Jane Austen, let him alone, should be punished! Keira was knightly grimesses and grin from every scene, and so was the surprise that no one wants to marry her! Darcy was trying to remember her line throughout the whole and the other Bennett girls were interchangeable in the lack of portrayal as their main character. <br /> <br /> Failure to show this version, both Darcy and Elizabeth care about whether they meet together with the appropriate Creator and Prezudis in the longest hours of my life! Absolutely unrealistic - even a few minutes of Judy Dunk can not save this trash. I can not think of something better to say about this picture which is finally over!
