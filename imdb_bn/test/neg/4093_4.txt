It was an idea to destroy it from its idea. The idea was that hair - take a minor character from a medieval PG-13 film, and create a complete non-seagull when changing the voice of a PG-rated family movie. I was not at least interested in it. Then came the trailer. It is not certain that the film will be irrational and generic, but it has been able to provide the whole film; And I'm not exaggerated - every moment, every plot point, every joke is called in the trailer. It's like the 3-minute Cliff note version of Flickr. So maybe I'm not going to give it a try, but once it hit the DVD, I'm sure, I'll see it free. Maybe Steve Carroll could save it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Jokes were so flat and clear and the director had to tell him to go for a very wide comedy style, like Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrier. But it's not funny. The studio probably attempted cash for the success of the 40-year-old Virgin, a number of Keller's past co-stars, a reference to Flickr in Theater March, and other music closing credits. But even the talented Carroll can not save this. People like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms did not wait for him. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, he just wants to stop that something he has a waste, and his awesome one-liners and feedback just give you people his job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is predictable and lazy. It is clearly predicting your head, such as neglecting the environment of Yanan (using a gas-hugging hawaii, using wood from endangered trees, hating animals ...), and finally it ends up on both beliefs and the environment Campaign <br /> <br /> Why was this film bothered enough, but I do not really understand how it has become the most expensive comedy. Some of the worst and most obvious blue / green screens in the presence and view of those animals who act solely on the real impact are some of the most I've ever seen. Probably cost a fortune to live animals on the set. Who knows But whatever it cost them so much, it was not translated for quality, that's sure. But hey, it was not the worst movie of the year. There are lots of bad duds still like Norbit and Death Proof.
