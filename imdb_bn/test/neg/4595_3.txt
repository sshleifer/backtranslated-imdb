I have seen an out-of-date version of this movie and as a person studying about the life and crime of the speaker, I must say that this film is a flawed but ambitious step in the real story. This film makes the following real flaws while retaining the true horror of speake and murder. 1. Do not have the drug on the crime scene as pictured in the film. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and a pill popper, who rarely took medicines through syringe. 2. The surviving Asian nurses from the genocide of Speaker, not pictured under the stairs of the Sieve and under the steps below the golden procession. It was impossible. In real life he kept hiding under a bed, specking systematically eliminating his 8 victims. 3. This movie describes Speak as soon as possible with violence and cruelty to women. Not true In fact the speaker was quiet and gentle first, he assured women not going to hurt them. This is how he is able to tie each of them. 4. True Richard Speak was not a deep thinker, the picture of this movie tells him. FBI professor Robert Wissler interviewed Spike in the 80's and said that he did not know why he just killed, but why he was not interested in why he could not spread any light on this matter. Spake was known to be below average intelligence and philosopher king who narrates this movie. If the story is not so tragic and horrific, then the voice will be ridiculous. After all, Doug Cole's performance is appealing and cold bloody, but I do not think that real speake was so much ahead of her violence. There is no doubt that when he was under the influence, he was a very violent man, but later he was known because he was a fairly shiny man, who was able to keep the man easily before being beaten up. Beverly Anne Satellou's performance as a living nurse is the best of the film. She is a very good actress. If you are all squeamish, do not see this film. It's very graphic and annoying.
