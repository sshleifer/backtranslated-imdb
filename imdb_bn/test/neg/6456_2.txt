There is something wonderful about a "revenge" film. Everyone wakes up in the morning to say that he is the star of "film", and anyone who interferes in his private program, is somewhat hostile. Revenge plot films have a less self-respect for a person, especially well done. Instead of fighting at this moment, "hero" creates internal anxiety to engage in a single activity of power in an effort to restore balance. Quite naturally, such a vengeance never gets severe relief because life is not a movie; The actions taken after revenge are taken after their own results. A good revenge sweep is ignored by these bitter pills. The last credit roll in movies and all the responsibilities have been resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming with sharks" is notified as a comedy, there is no doubt that manufacturers should decide how to do this work. . It's dark, but it's not a dark comedy ("Man of company" and Todd Salandy's work comes even closer). Parts of this movie are so cruel that they are past with the current "torture-obscene" genre ("s", "hostel"). There are some laughs. "Private Secrets of Savings" is very laughing, but it is not labeled comedy. <br /> <br /> The underlying problem of this image is that it did not get its revenge case. It is apparently misused by a young man by his boss and eventually he takes his wife to "return him" for all tortures. The hero (the true creator "Guy") is "universal" so unclear we do not know literally anything about him ... What does he do with his extra time? Is he a friend / family? Where did he go? What is his interest (through this film, motifs are running, there is no doubt that inspired by the film's own struggle ... "What do you want?", Whose answers we have blurred, the deception to the end)? It is very difficult to take care of such a character, even if it is a good performance (even Tom Hendes becomes a stereo in the wrong roles, such as "Punchline"). Kevin Spacy as the boss, "Body," is supposed to be a giant but he is very charismatic as an actor. The best smile when he misuses his assistant - he was often surprised that the spectators would probably have to endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, suddenly his views get sympathetic to him. Guy was suddenly pictured as a leering giant without logic. At this time the author lost a message; There is no "hero" in this movie, eleven, there is no reason to care for it. <br /> <br /> This story can not be guessed based on your own problematic career in writing this story. I've worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not beyond that. I used to imagine the will-supplement at the same time and thought that I was fair. I thought you were the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, only women - almost four people in this film universe) won by your indifferent, vain spirits, won the sincerity that won, and a boss you abused because she was an average person. The truth of time and tide has revealed that most "monsters" are actually self-based monsters and resentments of a person's personal emotional soul. The film shows, if Guy is so unhappy, he will have to leave. The film does not offer any denouement at all, eventually "surprise". We still do not know anything about the characters, they sure are not sure what we say, and everyone sorcereves get their cake and even eat it. In short, there was no other than the story (Shock!), The film business could be quite barbarous. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies that say tough and satisfied revenge. Style imagination, both feelings-good diversity ("9 -5," "Working Girl", "The Devil Were Pride") and not so much ("The War of the Roses", "Hills Have Eyes"). The role of Emily Blunt from "Flock" and some interesting works of Spacy and Michelle Forbes, it's a frustrating, average, confused, and a little lazy, it's not one of them. - A director who is helpless, one hope, "now it works all" ...
