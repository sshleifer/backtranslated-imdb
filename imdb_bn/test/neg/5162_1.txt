It feels great to hear 3 or more opinions, which refers to 'Football Wives' for women. Women's titles undermine any supposed equality of women in the media or in society, reducing their two-dimensional cartoon character in terms of how women should behave. This is a post modern moronic farce. It may be said, "Footballer WiFi, who lives in the house and knows his place." <br /> <br /> On one hand, it may actually be some parody in the UK's Garter Trash Press presentation. Celebrities and they have the role of maintaining a patriarchal society. So women can reduce stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes, and the owner of the image created for them according to the wishes of Mens No, that would be ridiculous and tricky. I also appreciate it so that I should be praised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just like a cheap Cruella de Ville. He just needs some maniacal, condescending, but at the same time, smiles showing off his true acting range of self-appraising. Oh what he did Right However, it is precisely the extent to which this goal is made. In this case, the 'tricky trick' Jarno, who is sending the upside-down of the Vaudienial ratios, or who feels her 'real'. "Best Actor"? God !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Or do not understand? So humiliating to women and men. They are not volunteer, selfish, football lover materialist jerks, who think that women are nothing but other trophies for the public. It is very insulting. I'm sure M. Laker will stand in his "real" life easily, and so easily done in 'Footballer Wives', turn around their fingers. <br /> <br /> But of course it is true. I mean after all its only a TV program. So let it remain intact. It was horrible and only looking at the disbelief that 'Cell Phone Hits of Prison' were so beautifully remembered. <br /> <br /> How did this happen? It sure is not fine or complex. It only comes from the set of the same mind that FHM can read the magazine, and thinks its "right" to look at soft-pornography, and "many" women who are their "willful" knees and patriotic and racist comments when "their" It is completely rotten.
