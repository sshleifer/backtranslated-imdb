A jerky curse on a train snake (2006, Dar Malachi Brothers) has been given to a woman, which causes him to be a snake inside him. Brunjo, who is taking care of him, is trying to bring him to Los Angeles train. After several train clashes, the collection of the berges separates themselves from the ownership of the snake and goes hunting. Although all of this is happening, normal, everyday passengers are jam-packed, unknown to them, some of the fatal things are on their way, and they do not have any. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'On a plane, I was checking out this. I knew it was going to be a rip-off and the film would look cheaper, but it was bad to see what was available. The whole curse plot was stupid and was not included. Special effects are not terrible but looking for the best. I was not a source about the end. It was hateful and hateful. The acting was absolutely terrible, and looked bad. They just can not work to save their lives. If you want a great smile, see this, otherwise you should really avoid this. <br /> <br /> "We have a runway train. I repeat. We have a runway train." - Conductor (Stephen AF Day)
