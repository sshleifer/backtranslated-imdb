I do not know how expensive this movie was, but the effects were horrible. Half of the film was depicted in front of the movie Canvas (it is sure that the blue box does not look so artificial). When they traveled in a boat, the background canvas was moved in the form of wave movement but the letters were not running. CGI Effects: Horror (I'm not sure, but I feel that the effect was made with paint and made a GIF sequence of them - later manufacturers would hire a professional CGI Creator team). It seems that the creator of SGI has suddenly grabbed the photo strip with his hand. Awesome, sure about that. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was made in 1983. A friend of mine told me the exact date: 2005. I was very shocked by the loss of my jaw, I thought he was having fun. Man, I recommend you avoid this movie, the story will also survive, you will not enjoy it.
