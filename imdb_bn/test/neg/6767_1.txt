RAP, this film is one of the most difficult books I've ever read, based on 'book'. Yet I can not put it down. Raunchy, weird, weak, ugly ... you name it, it was. It was also one of the best novels in any of my novels. <br /> <br /> Okay, for Flickr ... it was helpless. I mean, like Tim McIntire Wasako? Wasako was the worst mud ... 'Wasako' talking ... Like McGuinty like McGuinness like Charles Mason, Tim Conway is cut. <br /> <br /> What is the main character of the book? Little RV He was not present in the film ... the fastest moving book was not the main city dweller. Why does this name credit with RP? This movie did not detect soul, atmosphere, dullness or book plays. <br /> <br /> It's not just frustrating for me, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
