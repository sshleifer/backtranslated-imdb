It is one of the so-called "Hollywood social commentary" movies that it wants both ways And believe me, in this picture, both clipped and stereotypical in both ways. Stop-loss is a 21st Century John Wayne film dealing with some anti-war spirit, but clearly thinks that "If you're a man in today's society, you'll get your work together and go fight with your friends." In many ways the film portrayed the taxi as a great sign on The Dark Side because it portrayed the military equally as insane and controlling, a small frat party / animal home outpatient reproduced homo-boyfriend proofs of Texas Red Neck Worldwide Manhood It was in a scene after one of the scenes of this movie. And then the rebel military deserter Ryan Filip goes to a "road trip" with the best friendfriend, a artificial storyline manipulation to visit the family of dead servicemen, military hospital assaulted soldiers, etc. And finally the problem of fleeing to flee to Canada or Mexico is broach. But male honors and patriotism has finally won, as all newly shrunken and handsome, with the return of his friends to Iraq, the bus goes to sunset and few minutes before the earth, he assures that he will never be able to bear it. Completely complete Metal Jacket Ider Jim's Sands But lastly John Wayne roams again! And a Hollywood blockbuster finally kept both of his listeners on the palm of his hand ???? At least it's like to think. As far as I was concerned, bring me back to a more realistic reality of Elah's garden.
