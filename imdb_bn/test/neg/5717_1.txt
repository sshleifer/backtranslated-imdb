Corny and some really played bad but for a Golan-Globus film on the right. I saw this movie again in 1985 because in most cases I liked the movies of sword and museum (what was I thinking?). Arnold is playing such a high lord that he is trying to make sure that an ancient Talleman will be destroyed before he hits the world. Brigitte Nielsen was the title character, who was then a girl of style and a pretty bad actress. Movie producers prefer to throw the playboy type. Women who can not work in low budget B movie. Brigitte Gold and Arnold did the work of Lord Calderore. There, Sandhal Bergman (who was like the original Canaan film Valerie) plays an evil queen Graden in the obvious camp of his Kanan role. And then the most annoying child actor Prince Turn on the Onscreen (Arnie Ries), who should be strictly sticky and sent to bed. A little boring squat. The song is really bad even if the sword is not very bad. Special effects are cheap and at the final moments of the film, like the explosions of the evil queen fortress, it's like 70's. <br /> <br /> Overall a very low PAR film but B movie movie buffs may be liking it for the camp.
