This is a standard "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect offense is executed and the investigating police officer, who is ignorant of all the sources, immediately knows who is guilty. The perpetrators have to wait around the whole movie to catch the audience. The result is like every episode of "Columbo" or "Kill He Writes". The director himself tells the story of the hackney police officer sees an episode of Mattel! This story has been filled up in 90 minutes, but the director has asked all 120 minutes of cleansing of the book. To leave this one, you're missing something.
