The teacher of history, Mrs. Tingale, appears to have been a student for Lei Anne Watson, who took his heart to achieve writing school scholarships. He gets another low grade from Tingle, which does not help. When one of his classmates stole the papers in the final history of Luke and pops it in his bag, Mrs. Tingle finds it out and finds it. He threatens the three that he will go to his head teacher, but he is not available. So he reported the next morning. Leigh, his friend Joe Lynn and Scott's head that tried to convince him to tell him in his place and head on that night. However, due to the tingle disappointment, it turns to hard work to find oneself. <br /> <br /> I saw it when it first saw it, and after seeing another I'm still not the one. Writer Kevin Williamson was in a row after writing contemporary teen horror movies; 'Scream (1996)', 'I Zon Hot You You Will Girls Grease (1997)', 'Scrum2 (1997)' and 'The Fakulti (1998)' He is competing for the success (Do not forget the TV show 'Dawson's Crick), but this project is the ultimate obstacle. There was a difference compared to this entry, then writing screenplay, he also made his debut in the direction. Although the strange thing is, I get to complete his instruction successfully, but he gets lost and tired of the material. It takes a dark comedy and straight-out thriller to catch the catch without both the game. The script is confused with speedy intelligence, running mess, small extensions, and incognito references to other films, but the problem is that many of the more developed developments that interfere with the flow and the waterfall with the peaceful moral streams. Fractured scripts were more powerful and effective, this is a small size product that you are viewing a stages show due to the most limited set of it. It tries to play mind games with characters, but these moments serve only poor development of the story of fools and stupid stories. The film takes its last cake. Williamson's smooth side is the word, but pedestrian is more on the road so it is not suspense and even its dense surrounding pensing can also be made in real sense. You finally feel it after half the mark, and it shows how minor the story is. Performance is quite tolerable, although it was not for the occasional painting of Mannapolit's skill as Helen Mirren's enthusiast, Mrs. Tingle and a Marisa Kauflan, but we saw the Capi Homes-K-shoes-shoes. Barry Watson is part of his slacker part and has a small role in the Molly Ringwald. The soundtrack packs enough power, but I found it overwrought and shaped its choice in the desired shape. <br /> <br /> to look, but all round the mechanical.
