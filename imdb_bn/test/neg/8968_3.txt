Katherine Hepburn as a mountain woman mixed the prayer with positive thoughts - and is thought to be a witch by the locals. Kate tries hard to convince us that she is a bakshad hit (named "Tricker Hicks!"), But you can see that she does not believe in this strange humorous scene. Robert Young worked continuously to create a French embankment which became the first crashed of the trigger ... but, she got married! No white magic can revive this formula based on a game and R.K.O. Is brought to the screen by. With a hillbilly flourish very broad. It's unreasonable, and just about unwanted. * **** to 1/2
