From CNN and The New York Times, I did not know that I got some importance from this film. (And I did not follow Anan's case illiterate like some others.) This film did a very bad job of explaining how "business" Enron was, it was up-up before it started secret secret loans. Andy firms created by Fastow Later, the role played by Arthur Anderson and Winson and Alkins also proved to be significantly illegal. "Investors" - All its prominent bankers - it can not be done as far as possible in search of what they think they are doing. 24 hours a day cable networks, discovery channels and history channels, documentaries increased. I saw a lot of last year that it was better than this one.
