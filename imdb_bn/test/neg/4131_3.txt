What about hacks? As soon as Kelly (Jennifer) arrives on the island, her moral behavior breaks. He found out this Juan P (manual) and exiled, although he confronted his former silence silently, silently silently, quietly silently but quietly quietly silently, the two boys quietly silenced each other on the island. Kelly is completely lost in every sense and the great Juan Pi can catch fish and make some room. Mr. Handman They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Jane (Jack, husband of husband of Kelly's character) showed that after two days of knowing what his wife is doing this junior, she is a little jealous. Billy Z Stereotype is a rich man and probably not the most perfect man in the world. He disliked Juan Pi (for poking his girlfriend, who could blame him? Hey, frustrated, but he paid a lot of money to rent the boat, and Juan P was a waiter / did not bring him into beer beer. Do not you get bothered? But Billy probably wants to meet the person you want to meet. But the same thing That is, he does not blame Susaben suspects about Scuba Goggles, Kelly and Billy have lost some dear friends, no matter how convenient they were!). However, due to some strange reason Kelly hit the girl with the boy and started hating the delivery to be jealous. All right, Billy is very responsive, sure, but Kelly is not doing much to please her. He spent more time with Juan P. and even wanted to sleep with him even if he liked it (and though Manuel cried out to him, some of his close questions asked him to ask, but Kelly is so forgiving ...). Yes right And then she started to have sex with this Juan P. It should be said that before the events of this island, Kelly and Billy think that there is a relationship, at least, they have close sex in their boats and when they like they talk like a human. Other Now, you can think of this scenario possible. But for the real, is not it? Are you just cheating on Coconut Island after two days after being laughing and working like a drunk? (If the relationship was really bad then I would not disagree, but if the lawsuit does not indicate much to the director). For Christ, Juan P. is not really showing himself a good person. Make some wooden houses in the fishing and somebody's pants, is it a good sign? In any case, Kelly is not trying to befriend her husband (most of the islands will be very easy to give them only by being alone), she does not take care of their relationship (and Kelly does not represent one), she just has sex with Kelly Want to The Kelly character is not only believable (if she hates Billy and other interesting girls, would she be bothered?). Or can he be? Billy Zane is not a very nice person, and Juan P is not really good at all if you really think about it. And the poor Kelly is so confusing, and believes that sexual relations with Juan Peer will solve all problems because her husband is so attracted to the weird and poor Juan P? So ... all of you are reading this ... what are you thinking about this? If you live in the Kelly character, you will consider cheating your husband, one day you will come back to life in real life, and all of a sudden, that is not the horrible person after all. Laughing is just jealous. And if you deliver the letter, what do you say, is he completely wrong in his behavior? And Juan P. Character you really think of him. But to make sure one thing. Manual exist! Ps ... Wondoo thing is so wrong here! What was that c ck ?! Seriously! Someone will tell me?
