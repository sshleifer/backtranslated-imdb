This camera is the most stupid movie ever produced in front of the camera. I could not believe I was enough to rent this piece of junk. I saw some bad movies in my time, but this cake takes .... ice cream ,,, and chips too. Ogg, I still could not get over on these things were bad. Acting was a joke .... The plot was unreasonable ... and the camera should be done by a 3 year old child. I have never seen a movie go up sometimes. I could shoot the whole movie for less than 30 minutes. I think this guy had some extra time ... (It took 3 hours.) And his wallet extra 60 taka, and decided one night ... (Hey .. let's make a stupid film yet.) And they Just that Give me a break I'm going back to the video store to claim money in my shop right now. Anyone else who has seen this trash should also do it.
