Someone would think that this movie is a bad representation, since I say that I hate this movie so I would be very excited. But I think this movie is so stupid and stupid and time-consuming to be serious. First 30, I was wearing a big headache and smile on my face (which was mostly ready to laugh). I was very happy after the end of the film and I had a great expectation that it would be interesting I was very disappointed. Acting is not uncommon, comedy moments are long march and weird Something good about this, because I might laugh in two parts. Above all, it is very annoying and I can not tell you how terrible I think it can be used as a suicide strategy. I mean that I can not think of anyone for even seeing it. So stay away from all of these finite words.
