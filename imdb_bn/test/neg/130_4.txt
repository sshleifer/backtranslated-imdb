From the trailer observer, the movie looked pretty interesting. Film production is quite good - it seems they have a good budget and it does not look like a cheaply made movie. Acting is good (Professor Simon as Joe Marton) OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) from Bad (James Haven as Dame). <br /> <br /> The film's original content and plot weakening. It can be interesting when the movie starts and ends with a badly executed, frustratingly annoying, packing. This film is okay with the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the film, but everything in it is made to look absolutely irritating movie. It seems as if they had made a small movie, then tried to force it to an hour for an hour by stuffing the filer with an element for an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend good hours and see your half-life, this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this highly annoying movie.
