I am disappointed that all "hate it" ratings are six and seven, still above average. To me, it seems like "there is no cloth on the emperor". I understand that this film was produced in very low budget in the early 70's ... However, it has struggled to sit and watch. I saw DVDs have some subtitles, but almost 75% of the lectures are not subtitles. It's hard to understand something. Jamaican Patti was good to hear, but after a short time you struggled to 'get out'. Some of the shots were good, and some performance was not great even if the reality was there. (Jimmy Cliff had a good job) The plot is not bad, but quite predictable. 1:43 In the film, highlights are songs for a scene from Jimmy Cliffe (Ivan), and some shootouts and songs for a war. Perhaps 15 minutes or so. The rest is quite annoying. At the beginning of the film, there is a weird plot with Ivan Character, which seems like an edit mistake, which makes me laugh a bit. One critic says that this movie has been cut so many times, there are few copies of the original 1972 theater version. The ending was interesting, which influenced the media from a very young age, it may also be a general comment on the effect of colonialism on white people in Jamaica. Other major themes are the closing of poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... soundtrack is obvious, the film is much lesser.
