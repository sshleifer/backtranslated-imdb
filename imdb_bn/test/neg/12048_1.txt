Who is responsible for this one terrible mangling of my favorite book? It's just terrible. Terrible acting, terrible scripts The story is not to the old relatives - and what are they thinking? Robin Williams, for Gosh! This really defies the description. Do not see this. Seriously, no. Not even for smile. Especially if you are not a fan of books. It can only be the worst movie adaptation - everything is isolated and scumbled - important characters are limited to understanding the sequence of events, and each potentially interesting location of the book has changed (for example, Vienna - New York), some deeply stimulating. <br /> <br /> For those who did not read the book - it's basically a mythical biography of writing a writer, exploring his writings etc. His mother wrote an autobiography, which protested her as a feminist Declaration (despite her protests). The book is well written, engaging, and long His prose is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie again tells us about Robin Williams that telling us to seize it.
