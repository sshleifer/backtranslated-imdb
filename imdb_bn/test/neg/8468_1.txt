It's totally meaningless. I studied Nazemi and read many manuscripts from the day - "Parallel" classic debate in Naziism uses most of the epiphrofical myths and then compared with the complete generalization of the planet's 1/3 structure. It has been made for an audience of polly-ana mother tongue, those who have lectured lean food, terribly controversial reasoning, illogical decisions, misleading ideas and unknown logic. <br /> <br /> Who has hit this? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; Ki sister? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No Muslims, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer this, and you've unlocked a main door.
