The spinner can have. This movie was the worst movie ever. I could not even see it all that it was bad. This film is actually the whole story which is worse than scarecrow slayer. This terrorist was worse than the tones, at least the terrorist tones were fun. Even the image was not good at all. The shooting was false and the acting was even worse. Make yourself a favor and avoid this one. Then you see it at the rental shop then run another way. There is nothing good about this film. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch the scarecrow or the pumpkin head knight. If you want to see a new Chess movie, see the SquareCro. I rated this movie 0.2 out of 10. This movie is really awesome The Best Movies of All Time
