It's Valentine's Day and we have a wonderful dinner for them to stay, and instead TCM decided to visit this movie. We were among our 40's - love romance, and both "softies" but this movie was just bombing for us (it was nominated for Oscar, it's hard to imagine but I guess that's so). The cinematography was beautiful but in most cases the movie is very awesome. The character of Jennifer Jones created him a lot of references, referring to him as Euration, that we started counting and after a while we used to say that we envy. Add that the "theme song" plays continuously throughout the film and we could not wait for it so that we can see the news in the evening.
