Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park tried to verify the authenticity of the dramatic version of 1999 (in fact it copied some concepts from it), but with the original story it has few things to do. Unfortunately, the result is rather a needy, and produces schizophrenic. And, with other versions of Mansfield Park, there is no Fannie Price character available. Instead of developing a curious child-like, bleached-blonde female who does not fully develop as a really character. In at least 1999 films, they have established the character of "Fannie Price" as a strong rebel, which is very clever for her own. This is a complete identity of "Fannie Price" On Monday, I really want to see the drama of Mansfield Park, which includes the Fannie character's screenplay, as it was written by Jane Zenon. A sweet, kind, sympathetic girl with a mysterious personality and weak constitution. He is kind and painfully honest, but firmly with his conviction, firmly trusted, extremely intelligent, and unusually strong. A bit of a late blaze, it does not eventually begin to transform from the self-acquired young girl to a strange teenager until her eighteen years. And she does not want anything else in life than the real use she loves most. This is a fantastic complex character that I look forward to being portrayed faithfully for a day.
