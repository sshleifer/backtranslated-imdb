I saw the version with balanced American over-dubs, perhaps it got worse, but the film was pretty bad from what I could do. It seems like a low budget. The visuals replaced me with a second-rate TV movie, a reminder white dog for dogmatics, the BBC's 60s seem to be embarrassing to the dress. Mainly, though, I think the characters of the film do not behave like comic characters. As a result, I did not want to try to apologize to the poor face of the film. Without the use of animation, it has become difficult to confuse the feeling of film comics and I do not think that this effort was ultimately valuable.
