Wow, Jazz, I do not know what they call a movie to start commenting on this topic. I do not know whether David Bradley started smoking after the hard trial, in my opinion, after the American Ninja features were quite good movies. After Sybert Kopp I did not see any of the following films of this guy. Lucky I saw everyone look like 5 pounds, and I can safely say the following: If I throw a 5-pound drain on rough reality, crises and the expected death, but wait for 90 minutes between them. O God, how can hex label this "movie" ??? And why do the action / martial arts actors reach their peak when the knee deep falls into the smelliest horse-dung ?? I mean, David Bradley is no Oscar deserver but his first movie was quite amusing. A strong, cool guy with a good martial skill, who provided row lines, but at least a certain amount of entertainment and martial arts fans entertained. But I would like to know what I want to know through the hard work of this man's head. His final 3 films must be really the greatest which I could never sit. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to get 3 DVDs back from me. The crisis was the theorem of sleep apnea, the total reality was rigid but this prospect of death is just stupid. I bet when the director was the mega-stone or he just took the ants of David Bradley Fan, who was sitting through this hip. Circle circles around a doctor (Bradley) that develop some kind of virtual reality play where he just killed one man different people. Sorry, but I can not play this guy badie badie with this hairdressing, glasses and gray level and absolutely not play a physical fight (in fact, with his best asset). The movie is worse than a movie on Saturday afternoon, because the actress is ridiculous, the direction of violent and film fights, well, what can I say ... Actors seem to see that they are training their friends in the gym. We got a mobile phone muscular police who began to show things in the movie about one hour and failed a lot ... a French furnace version of Van Damme, who can talk only to fight, work or save his painful life and Bradley No, supposed hero, bad doctor who is really good for making such expensive garbage stop Play as happy playing. Even I think he might not have a kick in this film, perhaps his heart condition is already playing on him. For a B-Actor, I must admit that I really liked this guy, his style, physical, fighting skills ... but I'm really glad that after this psychology, he stopped playing because I could not really sit in One of the ingredients pee like taking through another ninety minutes. If you are a member of the David Bradley family, avoid all costs, you'll be happy, the term
