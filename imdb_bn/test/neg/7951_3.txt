Have you ever watched a movie, when it ends, what is it on your left that your left? Well, say hello to "skymay, baby, scream" It's not complicated in the story, or it's just that it's in three completely different modes ... 1. A fun 60s drug cinema ... 2. A lot of soap operas ... and 3. A horrific flashlight (about "Scrum"). I'm not surprised, I found it was my best choice Larry Cohen. Well, I think even the best trials and mistakes must be learned. <br /> <br /> HG Playing something like Lewis (with less FX only), this "bad" film has a difference. A beautiful cool jazz score is heard for most of its running time, and there are some memorable scenes ... one of them where the group of kids decides to test with acids and run a long long motorcycle. The camera points to their hallucinatory state only plain raded, but fun. When I tell you, believe me, you do not need to go out of the house!
