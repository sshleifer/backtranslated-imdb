I expressed high optimism for this David Lynch, which I really liked, movies, but everyone played very poorly, but Naomi Watts was the first step that was a failed attempt. Some twin pick characters are recycled in this movie but it was not lazy, it was not interesting (except the Topless Watches scene) and the quicks were executed poorly. <br /> <br /> I probably would give Lein another chance, but the penalties of this movie just do not pan out, especially for our fans who saw the first time the eraserhead went out.
