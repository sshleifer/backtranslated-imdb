Dilland Noyes and Jack A. "The Chilling", directed by Sunrise, is one of the worst junky flickers I've ever seen. Linda Blair ("Exorcist", "Witchchery") Why is this sticker appearing outside of me? The plot is really stupid: frozen firms revitalized after light strikes in the national lab and become cannibalistic zombies. Characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, junkies are awesome and there is no excuse. Remove this cheap piece like a plug. My rating: 10 out 1
