The film, created in 1980, is not a movie that is found in some of its "Drivers Ed Scare Films Vol 5." For one thing, the 1980 edition is in color. This DVD is made in a DVD (1972) of this movie created in Bend W. for the WLTV Television Channel 5 in Sandinti. This image is notorious. However, unlike most other drivers' ED films, it was intended for television broadcasts and viewing through a common broadcast. Thus the level of killing has been reduced. It is still a beautiful extreme exercise to absorb bloody death for the sake of a legitimate education. I live in the Cincinnati area and remember that this item is being shown at Channel 5 every year. If you are looking for a movie that shows the phenomenon of this unique American movie, "The Last Promo" is quite pretty - gentle, hyperbolic, highly-curated, heavy on melodrama. Anyone's guess what it really is affecting the driving of any teenager.
