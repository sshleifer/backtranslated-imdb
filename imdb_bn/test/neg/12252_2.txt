Slim experience (both in life and art) and cash are often set to be an observational piece of cash at a high school campus from the early beginnings of Sofia Coppola. Cast is rather weak and does not benefit from B & Sh shot (it is difficult to say characters separate). Sound editing makes little to help an easy story of little adolescents. <br /> <br /> Remember one or two things. Incomplete editions of high school campus are filmed with a balance of ambitious wide and intimate close shots. Performing-to-music also creates an interest and speed (without music videos dying in Netthal). Coppola definitely tried to change the speed of the film. The dramatic counter is quick and the point is cut and the second job is almost done; We recognize that it has actually been in conformity with the first, which is the point of the narrator's trash trump (which is otherwise weirdly connected character in the first act). <br /> <br /> Despite this note it is a weird brief. 2/10
