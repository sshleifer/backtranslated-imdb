For those who compared this trash with David Lynch, etc ... ... when they say, listen to your caretaker ... use other people's PCs without their permission! <br /> <br /> It's full and the eater pool! There is no industry here. This person is trying to create a name for himself, which is a cluster of rough complex ideas that he is not quite enough to apply a basic idea, instead he goes for easy options. <br /> <br /> Half of the brain can sit in any house and awaken some controversial images to give viewers a shock, but with real imagination, one wants to see a person being able to make filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I shock movie lover. I have seen or are much more than what you can achieve ... and I can strongly advise that those who love this film around the world can clean the trash. <br /> <br /> It's only those people who want to analyze what they are seeing, or for the first time in 17 years the drinkers do not know any better. <br /> <br /> 0/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
