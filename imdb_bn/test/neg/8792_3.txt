It is painfully clear that all the efforts of this movie were directed towards cinematography and gave little attention to something else. The most obvious mistake is the whole woman's cast mistakes. Many of them are very experienced and skilled, but they are all coming out of the place and an amateur director did not help. The story is a very simple story of Gisha, and the characters behave very extravagantly, thus making it very difficult for me to connect with the heroine. The theme of this movie is "Modern Prostitution", but it was still exciting how Tsuchiya Anna's main character spoke like a gang member of a female motorcycle and others all spoke in old Japanese fitness for this setting. This movie has very beautiful vibrant colors, like Zhang Emonor's "Hero", but viewers can easily portray it in a cheaper, expanded set. <br /> <br /> Two sequences with Shiite Ringer insertion songs were really nice though in the middle of the movie. I actually really dislike her before the song, but they fit perfectly in this movie. Though Nina Mia is a complete failure as a film director, she has a great potential to produce PV (Music Video). <br /> <br /> I believe the story has been very easy because the director failed to pay attention to the character's development, and the unreasonable act of an orchestra. If this film was directed by Jedidagak's director with another famous actress in Japan, then it could become an excellent composition.
