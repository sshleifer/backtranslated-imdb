Two Swinging graduates graduate from California, and a movie star and a malignant film that becomes its manager. <br /> <br /> After the 10 year pass, the popularity of the star has decreased, so it will be determined that the television show where women will compete for their affection. <br /> <br /> The picture is violent and funny. Lover is made vie for the boys who make the girls look stupid. Just one girl seems to be the choice of show producer. She really is a amateur up against other women, but she brings healthier and shows as well as ratings. <br /> <br /> By the third view you realize that the manager falls for him. <<br /> We know that Ryan was really going to be a graduate. Finally a little bit clever, you know where it really is going.
