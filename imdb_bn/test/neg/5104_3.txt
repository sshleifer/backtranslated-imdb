As I have been silent about the Russian Revolution, Potamkin and the Ten Days of the Shotak World, I also saw and enjoyed the same movie, I did not particularly enjoy it. It is mostly annoying and the director decides to shoot the film because of the "arts" approach. Though POTEMKIN is better in its editing style, the film used it much less efficiently using the same few strategies - in some places, the editing was very sticky and amateur. Plus, and it was really annoying, the use of zombies at the beginning of the film and the film's delay was really top. What I meant by "jumbo" meant that people were persecuted and oppressed by the Ukrainian peasants, in many scenes, people were standing like Mancuin. And, for a long time they make it irrepressible, when "evil" capitalists and people exploiters walk. Gimme a break! This film is a classic example of style on the subject - and it is only a movie for those who enjoy or enjoy the enjoyment. <br /> <br /> However, this movie's DVD has improved, some, if you leave audio commentary. It's easy to follow the movie and give some interesting insights.
