This 'scolac-buster' should bear a public health alert. If you play it on your DVD machine, there is a serious risk of opening an opening in the space-time sequence and disappears without any exploration - this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie was so successful that it was the real disappointment of the modern Hollywood movie and always commissioned appeals to the minimum common indicators - although I'm really afraid to remember the lowest common words <br/> < br /> <br /> I think Hollywood is making this film and showing some screen testing while showing the screen! I can imagine in the studio executive boardroom meeting ... "Actually we can actually create a movie that can be bad - and can still earn a lot of money !? !? Holy cow, I did not realize that we could make it worse * **************************************************************************************************** **************************************************************************************************** **************************************************** <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!!!
