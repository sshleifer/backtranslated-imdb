Okay, there is no way to sugarcoat this. The plot was ridiculous, authentic was ridiculous, the act was unknown, the effects were ridiculous, and outside scenes were portrayed in Central Park in New York. That said, there was something about this movie that I could not walk to. Perhaps it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was Super Super Wixen or Amjon wenches. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can not sit at the margin and criticize without some critical quality, so here they are <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes that lose consciousness in the characters are frustrating dramatic (you remember that I write dramatic, rather than believing it). <br /> <br /> I can say that some people like B movies and I am one of them. If you are one of them then it's a go. Cheers, Mr. One for this age.
