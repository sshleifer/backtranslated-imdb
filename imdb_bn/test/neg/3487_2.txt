Bad news: I found that the Canadian version of Bali in the cellar published by Maple Pictures was poor quality. Dark and washed, it seems to haphazardly dab from a VHS tape. It moves to even one stage due to some missing frame. Good news: This movie is so bad that DVD quality is very low compared to my viewing quality. This terrible movie fails to build tension and the lack of scares. This is a terrific horror picture. Although the most horrific films have limited dialogue, in the cellar is a GabFest, so a lot will repeat a character that we have heard that we have heard through two other characters. Most likely, all the chats work as a very low budget, filler for unimaginative movies. Unfortunately, the dialog is not a fair enough camp for a watch.
