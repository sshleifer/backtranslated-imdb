This compilation Disney family set up a complete set-up of the movie (Advertising-Death, the horse gets her teenage daughter because she wants "more than anything else on earth"), eventually an excuse for a big climatic horse-film. . All other elements (advertising campaign for stomach pill, as a possible boyfriend for Kurt Russell youngsters, Dean Jones's potential rival in the context of Lloyd Bouchard Dian Baker) is finally hidden around the horse to show the horse. Half of the picture is padding, and worse: it's small and objectionable. The child weeps with the dogs in his skin, and by natural means he gets his way. * ****
