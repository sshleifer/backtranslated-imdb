A small Western T-Rex is shilling at a small western town, which encourages Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Braselle (who plays his role in very neutral fashion). They discover that the crazy scientist (Cobin Bersen) is not aware of official patronage, with the release of an expired underground lab facility, the Dinosaurs army is building and continuing with a long abandoned US research project Operation Jurassic Storm (O!). Long ago, our heroes were trapped inside, the Marines were called, the power went away, and the dinosaurs set them free for fast lunch, they could get their birds and jaws. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This direct-to-video copy of Plagiarism, character contradiction and loose ends, often critically dysfunctional script, Jarsic Park, and Karsurut, is about fairly trash, good production value, passable FX, sometimes smiles and lots Thanks for the stupid steps <br/> <br /> <br /> Someone was stolen from the carnosure in this film, but to watch Roger Croman Productions Anyone who used to be, knows that directors and directors can liberate the clips from their initial film for saving both time and money. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 3
