After watching this movie, I could not help but see it in parallel with another film of 3000. In the mid-1980s, both of them were very bad in contrast to public damage in celluloid. Of course the fake set, both wood acting and stupid monsters are available in the movie. The only difference between the two is that the main villains here (played by Angelica Jagger) is a very thick word. If you see the MST3K version, then avoid it. Joel and Bots just preserved this turkey.
