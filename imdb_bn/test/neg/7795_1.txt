"Marathon" has a very attractive compound, excellent surround sound, and good scenery. Unfortunately, the movie goes away from this direction, flat on its face. In order to try to complete a lot of crossword puzzles for a woman, she spent a huge lot of time, sulking, and did not spend time in the puzzle. I believe this puzzle has more walking to show in the movie than its work. Also, when I understand the point of showing so much visibility, there is only a lot of FAR in it. The movie is incredibly annoying and the focus is on. It is not worth buying, renting, watching television or in an imaginative way. I lost interest so quickly that I was not sure why I was sitting in the first place through the whole movie.
