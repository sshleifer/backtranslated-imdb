This is a novelist (Michael Kain) making a fool of private surveillance by the name of 'Private Charter', an autobiographical autobiography of a scary Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Silliness at times became obnoxious. It is not Cain at its best. Wayne Rooney Top Significant support from Elizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and Happy Nadia Kasini. Not easy to see.
