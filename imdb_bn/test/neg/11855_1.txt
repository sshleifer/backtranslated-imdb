The bracket is not the only reason for a question mark because I have not seen every movie released in 2001. Because this film was only a partner in 2001. The rest is stolen from Roger's other dinosaur films, Karnos aur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession to accept. "Carnousor 2" is probably one of my favorite B-movies. It takes too much credit from James Cameron's "Alliance", it's not even funny. But I like it. I just can not explain why. It just works for me. I like the sets, I like cinematography, I like how they borrow from "alliance". It is very wicked that Cameron was equal to Karamen at one point, with movies such as "Bit Bided the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the carnosaur trilogy in DVD, and I can do that for a part of the part it has the moment. For the third, I can say the most that it took me five years to see it. <br /> <br /> Now we have "rapture", which is not going to run the series. Instead, it produces entire scenes of the Kornosaur Trilogy and a movie around it. And just as Roger's gradation Eri Roberts and Cobin Bresen were able to do it. Now, I'm not saying Roberts or Barnesen is at the height of a profession. But they can be called both reactionary actors at one stage. Not here. Sure, the actors will not even see the reaction while they are filming all the time. Here, however, they are responding to the footage combined from the film that is five to eight years old. There is also a sheriff with the costume "Kornosaur 1." A model was modeled directly after it. It was very sensual for the original guy to return. <br /> <br /> I was very excited when the "Raptor" was announced. I was frustrated when Karamen said he would use old dinosaur models from "Karnassos". Apparently Corman decided after this interview that he would not even have to do it. And to do it, she could not find an FX crew. For this the script was clearly written that this story should be made near pre-existing stock footage. <br /> <br /> Do not compare it to Ed Wood. Ed did a better job than that. At least he used to use the only ballet stock footage in a film. There is a way to include stock footage in a movie, and the "Raptor" takes this new three-dimensional technology to the new bottom. Even if you prefer "carnosor 3: primary species," stay away from "rapper".
