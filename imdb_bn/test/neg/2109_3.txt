The movie begins in Mexico, where a girl is cursed, she spits the snake through the green jell and her friend tries to get rid of these madness to lift the curse. He does nothing but a terrible language that does nothing, so he decides to reach the road to cross the border to reach LAC for his way. Comic Hilarity ensues. This movie has the same snake over! It is a garden snake and Python which will never bite. They all make no sense which sounds rattlesnakes. There are some funny lines on the whole movie, there are some weak effects, but a great finish that leaves you, Hammam left exactly how !!!!! The whole film is about 1, but the end is 10, so it gets an overall 3 by my crazy math. When you do not want anything from blockbuster, grab it for unselfish entertainment!
