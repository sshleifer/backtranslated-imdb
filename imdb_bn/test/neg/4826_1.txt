I do not know how people can see it - just enjoy those who see it and they do not have any feelings and emotions, and people die, people burn them, cars crash, children die and members are murdered every week. . This is the most unreasonable thing on television and I still do not know how I got it on the ratings. He's so depressed. The authors sit and say, 'Then who will we kill next week' or 'whose home we will have a torch in one month?' <br /> <br /> This is the most sad, stupid and stupid thing on TV at the moment, and I do not understand the people's motives for seeing this painful wave anymore.
