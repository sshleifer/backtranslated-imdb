Fox is pretty lame. They canceled the wrong show. It is weird that they will cancel a well-written program like "arrested development" and they will keep this show and "War at home". I think that Fox loved that they broke the intensity with "married children", but now it's ridiculous. "Loop" is a pointless and annoying watch, and their strong joke just flattens. For the strong comedy work you have to keep the jokes coming. "Family Guy" and "Simpsons" work because of the ongoing flow of jokes. Fox should have their heads pulled out of their rectal cavities and their relatives should be allowed to write this medieval trip. I mean, if you are going to invest money for some entertainment, make it entertaining. Also, stop using "not named" actors. Up and comers are great, but you need to anchor a show with a well-known celebrity. Dove, Fox.
