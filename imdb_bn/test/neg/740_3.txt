(This could have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie, I thought it was just right. The song was good and I was willing to forgive the sequence of Bijaro's dream, but the lack of the main character and other characters of those letters were unhappy for me to see the rest of the film. (I know, completely inactive.) At the beginning the music was encouraging and fits I thought of a galeic novel. But, come on! Saxophone music in the early 19th century? It did not fit perfectly. This movie was completely annoying and if you want to watch a good movie or osten answering does not rent Abbey! I give it 30%. 30% = a failed grade!
