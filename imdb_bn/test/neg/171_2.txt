Oh god It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. I want to give it 5, but I can give 2 for my vote. Why? I saw in a theater! Watch this picture on DVD or TV! Shooting really really poor !!!!! It keeps shaking all the time, absolutely neutral framing! <br /> <br /> It's hard to see very interesting pictures in a movie. You got a quick seasick and you will make some big effort not to puke on your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> This is really a shame ', the story is performed in a non-linear way, which is very rare for a documentary (and a very good idea!). <br /> <br /> Look at this house!
