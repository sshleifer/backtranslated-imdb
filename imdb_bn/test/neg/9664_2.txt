I do not think that the plot of this film is really more important, what you see is the full extreme amateurity of the main content. Acting If you selected people at random off the street you'd get. The word is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gastro of the gunfight in your ear, at the same time the dialogue is probably one-fifth of the force. Great set-off white accepts soundtracks in a huge degree by taking the dialog with a great degree. While the movie is released, the theme music seems to be almost a quarter, because there is no music in the big part of the movie. The camera-action can best be described as a garland mess, where the mid-shot shot where the middle angle will be much better, the cameramen will roam around and push the camera up with a loud, absolutely no attention has been given to create a scene, they just do everything It was the most convenient to stand cameraman from any position. If the cameraman gets taller than the actors and ends up looking at everyone's head then be it. Editing is just a job to do; Everything is thrown together in a totally monotonous way, the meaning of the flow or the transformation of words is nothing. I do not know if this video or maybe shot in a commercial camera, I think it was next. <br /> <br /> I made it around three-quarters of the way before I stopped it, I was so fed up with the low quality of production that I could not accept it. It's like a ninth grade audio-visual class project.
