I hope these issues are not a matter. High-Definition camcodes are always getting cheaper (although I'm not going to swear that I'm using here), so it's an open season for all Wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos. <br /> <br /> This stinker is not hidden in Sawatta, and it will be a big diservice in a 'film' calling industry. Photography is a standard you would expect on a zoo outside of a zoo. I could all build a new house with wood acting. That's remarkable about what anyone stands as the worst. They're all equally terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagles <br /> <br /> I was the title. I'm like Frank Hanker, or a hungry for such a thing like Monstard. Frankhamer was very bad, but at least I got a little smile, and the act was just bad, not terrible. I can not comment on psychic as I have not been able to catch a copy of this yet. However, I hope that it has not made any money from it. Otherwise they might be encouraged to try again. Please, friends, scramble camcorder and return to your regular work.
