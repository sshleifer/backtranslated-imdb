Just because of that movie is not the theme. The plot which was one of the lame excuses for something memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw it, knew I did not like it. I hate numerology. As someone starts off about the patterns with numbers I feel the desire to slap them. My own brain is starting hurting out of sympathy. And fully aware that this is just a movie about that, I could not resist the encouragement to see it and probably get a good smile. But it was not funny. Just sort of fool like "this is not entirely scary and yet wonderful cold? I can turn any shit into 23!" I was afraid of the dialog. As soon as the boy started to kiss, I knew that this movie is an annoying thing, whatever. But I never saw a movie that I started. I'm sitting through it. I enjoy pain. <br /> <br /> This picture pretends to mock numericalism in the mask of showing how bad can end obscenity. But it is supposed that the wave it powdered it as soon as it is. I do not see that message. I only see letters stating letters about a stupid number with little plot. <br /> <br /> You will get topped with the usual "surprise" - try to prevent another wrapping for you throws, it does not give any sense and you almost believe it is due to the quality of the color quality - and you get the one ollow piece of the movie made. That's just hate issues I'll be centered around. If it does not try to be serious and shows some ridiculous cinema with actors, then I do not blame it. But I was starting to like a carrier ... even though it is not his fault, he is trying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst I ever seen.
