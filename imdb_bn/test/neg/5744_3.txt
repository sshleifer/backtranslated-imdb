It's some vampires (who can travel outside sunlight), which cause some problems in South America. Commando has been sent along with his team to investigate the Caspar Van Dine. The film is Van Dien and Co. It walks through the jungle and this is a huge black guy who can not work absolutely at all positively. She is reading them all on her line as she first reads the cue card for the first time. Her voice is so low that, well, it's a positive sunny Great way to start the movie! However, they run into some of our vampires, they shoot (they die for about 20 seconds), and of course they are back in life. Van Deeen has given notice that one of them was bound to the tree and his friends shouted to kill them with wood. It is believed that the work of the stunt should be believed - vampires can drag them into dragging their trees, which they can think that they can easily climb, but it seems to them that they wander around the masonry ropes or something. <br /> <br /> Yes ... since, afterwards, in South America there are some people with huge black dancers (not included Van Diane), and they are attacked by more vampires. It is really bad that these folks have never heard a crossover because it seems to be the perfect weapon to kill bloodshed, but instead they use large wooden stains, which they try to outwit vampires with their hands. The big black couple ended up being captured and she eventually became the leader of some big powerful vampires. After Van Diyen ended up fighting him. It does not help all through movies, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, it is rejected for 20 seconds, which will be able to easily stand in one part for a person. They tried to stain only through hand wars through hands. Yes, it's not the brightest strategy. <br /> <br /> There is a hot boy (Remember Veronica from the Lost World TV show? Yes, it's her!) Anybody sort of research missions in the middle of Vampire County, and she just will be the ex wife of Van Dien. Hey, what's strange? It's embarrassing that he does not have much in the movie. Will her and Casper get back together in the end? Van Deeen can not defeat the huge black father? Will the circus actor Vampire laugh you through all the numerous action scenes? Can anyone listen to three studio music by doing something funny? Even Linda Carter has forgotten how to work in her little camio (she is more confident in her sleeping bed commercial ad)? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know, it can score some points on a very good scale, but these questions and more will be answered. About it Here, it's a bunch of caves running around the jungle, I think it's kind of entertaining.
