You can be frustrated if you read the book before watching the movie. The book was fantastic and I was sure to see the film's preview that would be great, but I felt like I was watching a movie where director and cast could not read like these readers. The film is short and they do not really think that these people really love and feel like a single partner. Even if the movie does not go into the same book, the book may at least think of romance more intensively in these two letters. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were suitable for these two characters and they had good chemistry, but they did not develop enough long stories to see how they looked for each other. The book was a true love story and I think this movie can be a lot better.
