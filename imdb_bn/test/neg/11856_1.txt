So bad, it's recreational, especially during the cocktail hours, and believe me, you will need to get a beer, a drink, or this via Turkey. Where do they get financial help for "painful" flicks of such a paint-by-number? The fun of this movie predicts that any characters will be eaten and in any order and wear the so-called "uniform" "military" zakars. Raptors, however, we do not even meet the "Jurassic Park", but a cousin. (Sorry, no spoilers here. You need to find it for yourself) Plot feeling, as easy as it is, just do not expect to go along with the ride. You can make it a game ... Each time you hear a specific word, take another drink ... or even better, everybody gets crunched by the "raptor". With a little luck, do not remember even after watching TV movie for creating this "C-grade"!
