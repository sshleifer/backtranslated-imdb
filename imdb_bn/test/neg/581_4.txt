"Sagitters may have" Sally Low Costels' last film "Dances With May Henry" is a little different than Abbott and Costello's last movie. This movie is not absolutely terrible it's a fun carrier misfire. Dorothy Provin shows this and makes the movie a bit better. You can not blame Low Costello because one of its main studio has released it, which means some people have to "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello has been facing problems of losing his own son a few years ago and unexpected attacks from the IRS. If you keep an eye on the last 3-4 Abbott and Costello movies, you have seen the magic. Now you see that a painful movie "Dance with me with Henry"
