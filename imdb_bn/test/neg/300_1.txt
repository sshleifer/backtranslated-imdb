Jeff was a sick man with a cremation. There is a lot to say about him that has not already been told, yet many of his documentaries and films are probably better than this. It is cruelly cheesy. It's very chessy, a person posting the entire film throughout YouTube added some notes to humor the audience. <br /> <br /> Carl Creoo (who he is?) a serial killer Jeffrey Dahar, who started the murder in 1978, wanted to be friends with a young boy, Dahler, finally he wanted to have sex with a man in 1991 and She wants to eat <br /> <br /> I am not bothered to see the whole picture. It is basically a documentary that shows that he stopped all the invasions of Dahamara before the attack. And since this film was created in 1993, a year ago, Daham was killed in the jail for the murder of Dahir, Dahm was not shown death. But it was probably as sugar as this cheese-festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
