And I'm afraid that I can not imagine why. This is truly a terrible and exceptional boring film. In some ways it was memorable for the first time in science fiction when each set was going back to Hollywood, which was very close. Visually, plaster is made from small and vague sets (snippers seem to be about ten meters away), apparently on a strange cave in a plush cave, "fun", medium artillery shells pour in the open ground several meters away, and finally a horrific script More than a movie can read like a manual .... I can not really say how much it is Soft. Even if the young James Dean was alive, the opportunity to see me was not enough to watch for more than an hour. This one is really one of the cost to avoid.
