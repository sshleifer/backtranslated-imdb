Recently, I have been a lot of Western observers from 1930 to the present. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were some great low budget spaghetti Westerns. This film had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although, this is an amazing thing of this genre and how it worked for me just did not work for the frustrating movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can be easily divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is superb; It's a great opening scene and an interesting story after a banker's hunter (AJ Newborn) bundette that follows a bandwidth, which is running after a big bank operated by a banker. On the movie course, these three letters shift the alliance to try to get the money. From this genre, there are subtle humorous characters in previous films, but the comedy is not interrupting the overall story. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the movie where the comedy goes more and basically the movie is destroyed. The bending point is exactly where the Burmad customers bite the leftist to stop shooting, because he is unexpectedly waiting for four dead bodies in the neighborhood around the other four patrons. At this point, the film makes a fool-stupid fool to the west with a decent spaghetti Western comic underone. <br /> <br /> One of the three awesome shootings (one in the river, one on the market and one at the time of bath) that was not bad enough as the quick succession followed. The war is so fraud that is ridiculous, and since the term is not compatible with the film, it makes it even worse. In the battle scenes of the market, the banker is talking about the roam around the polar lanes like the trumpolin and circus; It's Clowns. Although, the worst part of this war scene is music; It is this light heart, definitely mixed to a square dance or more suitable for a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes actually separate the original story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was frustrating because it was as potentially a decent western, but the curiosity counter only matched it. If you want to see a good Western spoof then see 'Burning Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.
