This image has received 7.0 rating on IMDB, so I was a little surprised at the decision to even try it. What a waste of 100 minutes. Above all, there was not a good decade for the crime of 80s and the theatrical genre. In most of these cases, they were done poorly with foolhardy plot (if they have any), so few people can stand and even if they are good, they are not very good. Hit, although stupid crime pictures are stupid that suffers from everything. It contains poor character development, unlikely plot and not properly written or operated and does not help when you have such errors. Stephen Fryers often tried to imitate the French new wave to produce English-style films and the two did not match. <br /> <br /> The first terrain stamp was for 10 years because he testified against his former partners. Offense He hides Spain, everywhere. He is finally caught, and without being kidnapped by a group first shown in the Spanish goggles, two hits people that are only tackled with him get driven away in some distance. These two Hurt, who are considered to be the tallest, cold, cold killer, and Tim Roth (on his first land) as the beginner of Satan. They do not kill stamps directly, at first they settle the "three amigos", they should not be hired at first, and then they are stamping in Paris, because the friend who testifies against him wants it to face that it is possible that it is possible. Even the stamp was such a dangerous person that he was hired to hire four people, they did not stop him, do not disrespect him, and roam him, as he is a friend. The stamp is not material and is going to be shot happily in Paris, not using more than half a dozen, this "professional" offers to run away from him. Team Roth seems to think that just by raping a school boy, the big criminal diameter creates the idea of ​​linking him to a hard core hit like John Hart, even more unlikely, especially on important tasks like this. But John Hurt himself is not very hard, he spends twenty minutes of film, the Australian collected by Hunter is not completely killed or killed, his only purpose in this film is the beautiful Lura del Sole, his mistress (he says that the 15-year-old , But she looks like 25), and the role of story and acting power advises that she is equal She was given the role only on the basis of the director or producer's concubine. After a lot of controversy, the heart killed Australian, but due to his objection, he took Malala for some reason. He wanted to kill him, but the chariot was not willing to convince him "in a fine way", so he threw him down and grabbed him through the whole film, he was deeply into the human body deeply. <Br /> <br /> You have easy-to-do scenes, such as Hurt and the chariot lock the car from outside, trying to stop people from outside?!? However the movie drags on. Team chariot falls asleep, protects the tower stamp with his gun on his chest, and the stamp only watchers watching the wait. The whole suit of the plot comes to the point where we have seen in the last hour and 20 minutes and go through the window. Let's repeat, not to kill stamps at the full moment (without a complete film) to take him to Paris, so his former partner should talk to him last. And the whole point in him is not going away that he is ready to die, "It's just a moment, we're here, so we are not here ... we are somewhere else ... perhaps and why should we fear it like normal breathing?" But my friends, where the plots twists, Hurt is still in Spain when people kill, and we ask why it is bothered for the day and drive, in the first 15 minutes he Maybe on, and contrary to stamp his philosophy may be too scared to death, so we asked again why he did not run, and there were plenty of opportunities. Roth also dies, but he must not stay in the movie, and Dell Sole, well he has promised to play the role in the film due to romantic (sex), so he is alive again, even he attacked the heart attacking movie 15th time. He killed all others, but not his, he would have to look in the highest screen. The movie was made in the shoes string budget and it shows, but it shows even more when you do not have any story and card board characteristic. And yes Fernando Ray is present and guest goes through the movie as a star, which has an audible line of dialog. Awful, terrifying
