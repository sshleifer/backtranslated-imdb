If you take movies, you will have a good idea about this movie with Mad Max, Bainth Thunderdome and the film Still Do Patrick Soze. The only problem is that the film lacks production standards and it presents the original duplication of the first two. Indeed, the film has a lot of activity, but the audience requests to suspend the faith. No one can shoot guns by holding his hand 50 Kilibars - and do not miss everything to boot, and with the help of automatic weapons you can not shoot a group and do not miss the whole bunch. There is a problem with poor editing, when the school bus is flopper, the cannon was easy to work with. There was enough time to stop the truck, and truck driving lady through it is essential. Easy enough to watch movies if you are only interested in stupid action and violence. But do not expect anything with Thunderdome or some cheap and durable steel don.
