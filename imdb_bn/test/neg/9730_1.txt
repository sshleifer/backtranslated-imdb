When I saw the vote panel that some people took this image out of 10, I realized that the score was not more than 100. It is a real money disaster film of that word. Unable to work poorly written and vulnerable to the so-called actors, but when they are ordered they are frustrated. For the first 60 minutes, the story seems to be moving in one direction, then it changes with very variable special effects and is involved in a power war. Unable to create an intelligent way for the hero with limited power to defeat the arch with super power, the "author" tricks. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called storyline because it was easy to make acceptable denial. The text will not even tell the word "denouncement". Some movies go straight to the DVD. This one should have gone directly to the dustbin.
