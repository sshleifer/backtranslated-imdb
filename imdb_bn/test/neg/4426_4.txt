Yet another looey production was a strange mix of the killing of a young Jackie Chan's genius, to completely destroy the plot, in spite of the characteristics of most spiritual WTF moments, the Kux Fu war, which is a beautiful blend of Voxia, Meldrum, supernatural action, and plain old school. And a lot of sunny bad conversations. <br /> <br /> A gang of ruthless killers assaulted her pregnant girlfriend by attempting to protect Chin China from Killer Biss, who pretended to be a Leo (Jackie Chan). <br /> <br /> At the time of the attack Kauhar relatives are killed, but he is kept in the gang, whose leader is left relatively unharmed by a stain, to be a heartless cad, to face the woman, seems to be a hats for him. Kao then goes in search of China, whose security he gave to his close friend Chu Chuke. <br /> <br /> While searching for his true love, someone has friend of the company's chief of his courier who has a valuable commodity that has been stolen by the temple's leading 'bloody rain' tribe. Finally, after wounded in wartime against the members of ugly clan (a fun scene with most intelligent weapons), and then the square comes back to the health of the killer bee (who shows his love by burning his face!), Finally he learns that he is a cruel character Judge: His friend, Chuuk, the 'moonless rain' clan is no more than a hungry head, Who has planned to marry Chin China. Drawing <br /> <br /> because of the climatic war, someone kicked her face repeatedly before she died with Scarff before the former Paul. <br /> <br /> Even the drunken chancellors will find this fun. With the management of some of the amazing acrobatic powers of the final war, just sit with the showcase. Supporters of common Asian curiosity can excavate the killer bees in the beginning of the movie (the character who claims to withdraw his isolated hands immediately!), Or at the moment three men can float in a window to attack our hero, but in most cases, this film There are very limited appeals.
