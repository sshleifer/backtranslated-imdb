I just saw love's edge (in this way, it was one of the worst titles until this year) and it felt like a joke. The unlikely, skeletal character of Keira Knightley made me more shocking across the cover of the film. <br /> <br /> These four nights saw me so annoying. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. She always looked good / credible and seriously looked into many films. This, for her, was not good enough just for her. <br /> <br /> In addition to the unlucky characters, without the annoying tale, the plot was also emotionally dissatisfied. I felt that I had seen my time in doing something (which I did). I should do the smart thing and turn it off, but I paid tribute to Sylven Murphy and the great movie.
