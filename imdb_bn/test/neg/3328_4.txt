I want to say, I like this picture, I really do, but it was very annoying when it was flying down. It starts showing off promising, even when they get inside the mine, even the strange environment and the mood is great. Problem giant, or lack it. People say this is a stop-motion monster, but it's not a problem (stop-motion can look cool when done properly). The problem is that we are not able to see it enough and we do not see any death. This is meant as a horror film so that the lack of giant and the lack of death are equally inanimate. I liked some scenes, like a girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster coming towards her. There are some other obscure scenes, but they are less than enough to keep your interest in interest, and the film is certainly not worth it. This is a shame, because I can see that it is handled properly, it can be a very dangerous hazard flickr. The sad fact is that such films will never be created again, because filmmakers make their movies extra-polished on this day and depending on the sticky CGI effects.
