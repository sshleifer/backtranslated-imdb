This movie was really bad. This is a quality that many of the indie movies have: a sunny moment full of annoying longs. A deadly left-hand magenta fan will be lured like this movie, but then the person will see what it will be able to see. Someone gave me this film to know Jackson's fondness, and the script of the show was a fan of Viva La Bam before getting thin. To explain why this movie does not work, I just want to say that the Prize has played itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the movies You got this Ryan screaming right guy and the left Magazera roams like a funny naughty creator. Dicamillo's performance is the best weird. It's a ridiculous little obscure Canadian French accent that's mostly its performance (originally fun for 5 minutes and then 'OK you are already claiming to be sufficiently foreign)' <br /> <br /> If they work for parodies But what they succeed in is that they make a movie with an IQ of emptiness. I love toilet humor like the next man, but it's not even fooled by it. Humor collected from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those who know Mogra and the company, have run away from the joke. <br /> <br /> The next time Magnaara was given a knit with money. Hope she does not blow it up on some lousy pet projects
