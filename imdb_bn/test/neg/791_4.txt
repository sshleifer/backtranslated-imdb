The couple having financial problems gets a box distributing their doors. If they press the button they will get millions of dollars but nobody knows they will die. Do they push the button? <br /> <br /> It is a comedy film based on Richard Mattheson's short story, but most of it is a dirty thing. The problem is that there has been a lot of things in it, though writer Richard Richard Kelly does not know what kind of films he is making. A direct-out horror film with these supernatural overtones? Occasionally it seems with moral preference, insults and discussion of the hereafter. Is it a science fiction film? Probably, there are many questions about the Mars project. And do some people with such strange looks think that like some great conspiracies? Are these body graduates attacked or taking on a demonic film? I do not know, maybe And that problem has many questions, most of them are playful, but there are many. Little seems to be interpreted and when we reach the end of the film, it seems to be stopped (even on an open end), to the end. I'm looking forward to creating a movie with themes and points, but the writer Kelly has written with her authors that only director Kelly can not handle it, or that's how each theme or plot thread gets its ten-minute screen time and that next bit off for that minute. Keep the court before the cast. It made me crazy. (I do not know how to create a material that Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who does not know very well or does not know much more) <br /> <br /> This is a title mix that does not work (Finally there are many holes). I was over, and suddenly I realized I had no idea what I saw. I really did not like it, but it's not better because it just misses a way. It's not going to cost you anything where I will take a pass or wait for cable
