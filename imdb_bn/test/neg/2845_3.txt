Lower Jopardi's low rental version of Ashley Judd. Sutherland is very professional to be bad, but what was the thought of Bregget Fonda ?! Penelope Anne Miller's curse is going on (think of it - when was it in another good movie other than the meaning of other populations?) And I'm not saying that is bad, but all his movies fail in any way).
