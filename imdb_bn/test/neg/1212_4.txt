10 years ago when I was 16 years old I liked this movie. After 10 years I was the biggest mistake I ever seen. This is not the worst of the "i-winer-b-pie-pilot" movies, but it has so many errors that you can ignore them. <br /> <br /> The Queen's "One Vision" to the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the patriotic nonsense you can see;) <br /> <br /> [**** ---- -]
