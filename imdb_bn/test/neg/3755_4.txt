The big fat slab 'Uncle Buck', played by John (It's a Non-Lot of) Candy, went to his family's sign-up member for a week and two children (Gaby Hoffman and McClly Kullkin) and a beautiful but snobby teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly ). The Schengenes begin when Buck snacks and then tries to sleep in the bed, the two sizes for the body's blip are very small. Most dusty, but dirty with two or three funny scenes, Baker tries to get a word on the telephone with his accompanying girlfriend (Emmy Madigan) and his very disgusting joke. <br /> <br /> Looks like sweet 600 pounds!
