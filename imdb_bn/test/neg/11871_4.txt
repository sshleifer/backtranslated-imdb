Let's do one thing straight: I like many things of snipes. Unlike his other high-kick contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually work. However, this film is not enough to increase its reputation; It's not right or unknown - but I'm not in a hurry to see it again. Actually, if I do not see it again, it will not bother me - there is only more good movie loads to abuse me! This can be a good movie because of a sadness, some imagination and some subtle changes. Instead, the director has often tried and destroyed his audience often to submit with extreme violence and very little characteristic. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem is the Snipes co-star, Sylvia Colloca. It bothers me that the film's producer Ms. Kelka has been upset about appointing a stunning, beautiful (for my money) and talented actress and then giving her such a cruel one-dimensional character. If he is hired to add only "glamor" to the movie, he is not too good; There is no nudity in the movie and there is no significant sexual scene. Curious, really. What is the violence in this movie that is why producers have taken so much conservative attitude towards gender and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or 1957? These garbage makers (and perhaps actors) have forgotten the meaning of movies that are fantastic. Like most residents of this planet, my real life is very annoying. I want to turn back the terrorists, manage myself like Mr. Snippers and be able to hook up with beautiful young people like Miss Colocas. This image is very good to satisfy any fantasies of them. Which is why I am so bad review!
