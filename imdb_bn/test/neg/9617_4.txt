I will not waste your time describing the plot for this, other critics have already done this quite well. I will give you my opinion about this movie. This movie is basically the Japanese anti-propaganda campaign. Japanese are marked incredibly bad ** ** Those honored to do anything, as well as very serious martial arts skills (Japanese men's groups are kicked by multiple women in more than one event). Japanese fighters almost every (if not every) the movie in competition The kind of mystery goes away. Though the plot is actually quite difficult and perfect for a Kung Fu movie. The problem is not a lot in the fight. Some battles are very good when the fight is over, but other scenes are poorly dancers. One scene Angela Mao took six people to church and kicked all of their asses. The problem is that they show each other in a fight when they talk about attack at the same time. The cheap set I gather in this movie was cheap cheap incredibly cheap. They use the same village set to stay in Korea and they never change in China. Some scenes are filmed in real locations, and they look good. The only real problem with the film as a whole is that it is a slow and uninterrupted plot. Since there are some battle scenes, entertainment should depend on the plot for entertainment and well, I was not entertained. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
