It is the psychiatric couple of Richard Krenna and Jonah Pettat who bought and played in the old palace and invited friends and patients to a small crew to help clean the place. Unknown to them, the palace is a door to a house - the gateway to hell. If you are in the mood of a limited-film film, do not watch again, but if you want something innovative, this little film will not appeal to you. <br /> <br /> Villains: $$$ (The opposite man has cut his hand instead of the scene he saw, though it is visible even though the inventive death scene fans would not like it because each character seems to be electrocuted in some fashion). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (There is nothing to talk about. Mary Lewis Weller has added a better look but her character has been adopted). <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (Neat, but spectacular.) But this is nothing new in the section, but Victor Bue√±o's cast - which seems tragic to the Department Department Santa - seems to attract some viewers. Actor: $$ (Best Performance Karenka and Peteet, along with other actors "only phone" their roles. Animal house) disappears for about twenty minutes and electrocution is just like everyone else in annoying fashion).
