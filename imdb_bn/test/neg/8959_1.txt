I bought this movie to get a contract with a rising troma.com (which is not very good). Star Worms II: The main reason for the attack of plazar pods, I want, the DVD is a double feature with that film. I do not know what happened during Actium Maximus, and when I saw the trailer I was scared. It looked terrible. But hey, what can you say to the trailer? Well, apparently I could say a lot. This movie did not really make any sense to me. The special effect was so horrible that you can not say what God's name is going on. I understand Mark Hasek had very low budget, but let's go. And it is sad, because in interviews he felt like an epic movie like this and meant to be able to see you. But sadly, watching the film is the most annoying hour and 15 minutes of someone's life. It is so painful to sit through it. I can not even explain this plot to you because I did not understand it at all and I am sorry to see this picture twice! Apparently they used some kind of dolls for Star Wars such as "Alien Dinosaur". But this particular effect is awful, I can not put enough pressure. And most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needs them badly. It happens on some future planets where alien dinosaurs fight with each other and run around bad actors in the hooded sweatshirts, and they see they like KKK. And on the blue light of the box some box president I want to know in the interview, Mark Hicks said something about making this television pilot, well, I can see why it did not come from CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this picture. 1. Music is really good, it's an epic score that holds the stick on your head. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's role is always a delight Overall, do not waste your time but see Star Wars II: Anand pod attack!
