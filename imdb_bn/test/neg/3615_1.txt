Now we know where they got the idea of ​​a snake on a plane. Do not give it a quick look, watch this movie. If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then only hold it on cable, or get it as a free pick from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay this rent. If you do not pay this rent, you are a stupid person. The act was horrific, the plot was horrifying, all except the snake serpent was awful. Whether they generated real or CGI, they were pretty good appearance. But that's saying, still this movie will be the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the naked dance scenes were pretty bad that even I quickly passed through that quickly. I did not sit down and did not warn you.
