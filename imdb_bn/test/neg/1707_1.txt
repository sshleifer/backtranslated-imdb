There was a time when Michael Jackson was honored as King of Pop. Then dropped down and dropped down and dropped down. Finally, we're really sorry for this guy. <br /> <br /> Another reason for this 'movie'. I promise a rabid Michael Jackson fan to see it with him. You know the type of fan - someone will tell him - to love yourself everything. Seeing this movie, which he had seen twice before, I realized how far the fan's went. It is probably enough to rate this movie above 1/10, as some people did miraculous work. <br /> <br /> The film has tried to be a parody of other movies and series, especially Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails unnecessarily at any level. Acting does not save the horror story, the film has a high-frequency video tape quality, special effects are outdated (those who do not do this film now: Aluminum foil). If the movie is managed then it will be fun, good, funny Unfortunately, it is not. Pain to see it <br /> <br /> And this trash has Michael Jackson's look. He appeared on the projection screen to provide an important message and was promoted as mobile as Jabba Hot and as serious as 4 years old. Only when I thought, "The poor man is the terrible person to take part in this movie and make himself completely fooled", I finally (finally) reached the last credit and discovered that this film actually shot part of Jackson's part. Neverland Farm In other words: He. Likes <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie, and Jackson's involvement in it, is really annoying. Do not even look for "Hah, an IMDB Button 100 movie" Or be warned.
