Oven (David Krumhaltz) and Clo (Dennis Richards) a young couple living in Manhattan. Oven is a generally successful magazine writer and let's be an aspiring actress. Happy for her, let's get a big role on a sitcom and temporarily move to Hollywood. Losing him, Oven Laalla landed a flight, surprisingly When he reached his set trailer, however, the "house" was shaking, as he did and his hockey co-star was trying a little romantic. Through the authors and actresses. Heat and crazy as crazy, returning to NYC NYC. The sympathetic friends decided to set him on a dark date to bring him out of the dark gaps with Nadin (Milan JovviÄ‡). However, it has happened badly, because both of them are mixed with oil and water, which mostly result in strong personalities and ovens of huge shoulders chips. Yet, for the next few months, surprisingly, Nadine and Owen became friends, who believe in each other and hang up. Can it turn anything more? Well, who's CARE CARE! This movie is so stupid that most people will take its name out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is unfortunate, depressed, and, oh, stupid, too much. Then again, Krumholtz also gives a very offensive and offensive performance as well. Jovovich is not much better but could he look good with the line that has spout? William Beldwin also reached the bottom of his career as a brother in Oven's fable and sexually obsessed role. Richards is a good actor, but when he looks at it, he must cry. All right, the quality of clothing and production is enough. Even then, there is a tricky element, sometimes the characters will say their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear on their heads that they really think. That film does not save from the "bomb" status. Do not be stupid, favorite film and romcom lovers. Rent this giant turkey, buy, or do not borrow. I am the most intelligent person in the world today, to see this thing until the bitter end.
