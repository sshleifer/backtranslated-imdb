I was very surprised to see a good rating for this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie nine years ago and still remember that I felt angry at how to sit in the movie theater and watch this mess. I'm a big fan of John Buurman's work. I really liked her movie. So I went "beyond the Rangoon" with big hopes. But I felt out of all the action scenes like seeing a stupid, inexpensive Chuck Norris jungle movie. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that John Burman was director because the film was so bad. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to portray their struggle.
