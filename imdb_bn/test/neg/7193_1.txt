Well, do not disturb. This film looks so tired, acting so old, and the plot and characters are so stained, that instead of viewing it should be researched. It really is a horrible waste of film; Making stereotypes, cleches, nonsense, and amateur films. I saw this incredible surprise with my mouth wide open. How can such a film be made, and more interestingly, how could anyone find it funny or watchable? Old, tired, drunk ... a junior-high skit, best. Without a study of very ancient movies, there is nothing watchable there. Good movie, just ancient It's not Abbott and Costello or Lorele and Hardy. It's useless The acting is so bad that maybe it's worth looking into it just for laughter. Some pictures are so bad that they are good. However, this one goes around all corners of the corner and again all the way back.
