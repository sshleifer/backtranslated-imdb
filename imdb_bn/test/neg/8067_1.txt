... Ever! (I always wanted to write it :) Many years ago (reminded me of it in 1993) one of my former classmates inspired me to see "the best of all epic." This day stands as the worst movie for me. Acting, story, effect - everything is bad. If you are one of the people who are just appreciated for the trash, you have to pass it. But chances are that you are reading this, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> It's not just about 500 movies that I gave 1/10. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other less expensive Asian Fighter Flick, so I think there is something worse! Awesome ... <br /> <br />: P.
