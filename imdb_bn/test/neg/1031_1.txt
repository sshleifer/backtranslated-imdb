Here's a Rachel Rare Show Rondown: <br /> <br /> 1. The horror theme song begins to start and Rachel goes down on her malicious cargo lift to wear her snapcratch props. 2. He starts running around screaming and / or begins to insult the audience, then sit down yells down to them. 3. A painful monologue. (<br /> There are no further orders) 4. Rachael's own horn (meaning "I lost 500 pounds with the recipe of Racha," Rachael R. saved my life, "Rachel's fashion tips.") 5. A completely vain DIY tip (How to insert words into Casual dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to make lipstick with light.) 6. Releasing terrible recipes on unexpected audiences (the first bite response shots never seen) 7. A celebrity guest with a strange interview followed by some explicitly written questions from visitors. Rachel's Cronis (ie I say to every woman, I have nothing but the lady, and I can not find the time to keep the makeup housewife). What will they do without Rachel? * Gasp * <br /> <br /> This program should be avoided like a plug: 1. Fennes: Rachel Roy has claimed that the entire show has been copied. Many peopl participants of this event have claimed that the entire show is scripted. These same people also mention that there is a very strong dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> His show goes a long way: Where Oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host, has a specific theme for its show, Rachel's crad as the ADHD Soda child is nearby. His show is probably a show of 10, short, worthless segment. On the second hand you will get fashion tips from Kozo, and the next Rachel Manchboy cheese will make a lot of stuffed "Spanish" pepper, and the next stage will be a giant Anandora and later you get the picture <br /> 3. Rachel is a poor host with bad ideas: Along with his great personality, Rachel's hosting ability is the best. His questions for his celebrity guest are poor, and often not relevant to interviews, and his segments offer unexpected and little educational, or fun prices. <br /> <br /> Concluding, do not waste your time with this schlok. It will be canceled in any way.
