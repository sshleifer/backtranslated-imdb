I bought this movie "Clearance Warehouse Sale" for a few dollars a day while looking at one day. The cover looks great (in color), but the movie is B & Wad, (I hope they will not try to stop them with colored covers in B & W films, but this is a common thing to watch!). <Br /> <br /> I was surprised when I saw it. It turned out to be better than expected. I was frustrated that it was a B & W, but the effects are pretty good, of course, worse than "Mars's aggressor", which has suddenly been affected, and John Hogan other than Hogan's heroes are great looking. <Br> <br /> Overall, this film is not very bad for B grade, and of course, a Nostalgia viewpoint is worth two dollars. This is not my favorite science, but it is not my worst. OK.
