After watching the film version of Heart of Darkness, I think that I would have lost 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how nicolous the story was neutral. He dropped many bits of important information, even though cast did not seem to be right in his role, and the whole film seemed quite illogical. The book depicts visible scenes and details that are completely ignored in movies. <br /> <br /> If you think that the director can fit in a book on a page of at least one and a half minutes on 76 pages. The difference completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Cartes's motherhood is stuck on the authenticity of Cartes's death, it completely corrects the book to finish. The sets used in films and the scenery can not be mentioned that were not nearly as beautiful as described. It is heartfelt that the patient is filming other stories with reference to embedded Heart of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you see the film without knowing the title or expect something like the story of Joseph Conrad, you can see it as well. Although I think the camera work was poor and customized but it's a fun story However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story then do not look for it in the film of the disease.
