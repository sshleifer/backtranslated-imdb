And how long will we continue with this erroneous belief that the director is once great, doing the work of breaking the land, all the future works "can not be bad at all, he has created such kind and finally". <Br /> <br /> <br /> Mulholland drive is a point in the case, and is actually unmitigated garbage. Performance is excellent, especially from Watts and Throws, but a good movie that they do not necessarily do. Linch has clearly forgotten that creating a movie simply unnecessarily works only when it is astonishing. When the audience is not expecting the film to be felt, the film should have some material to show the audience interest. Lynch has been successful in the first half of the movie, most of the twists and red deer with murder-mystery, and then ... plop! The story is a quagmire between malicious hallucinations and untouched segues decades. Methins Lynch realized how the film was wasted and threw out gay and graduate scenes for the audience to wake up and stopped male viewers standing and leaving. <br /> <br /> While watching the film in the past, I was surrounded by the Lyncophilus, who had no idea what was happening to me, but in the movie the film was left to comment on the "level and level" of the production of Lynch. Forgive me, but these people are the same Nitish, who is standing in art galleries, standing in a canvas that has been white commentary about "bravery of brave literature." <br /> <br /> Such films have been created because (a) Lynch is trading in its previous work; And (b) because the people themselves firmly believe that the illogical film is the industry, and therefore, must be good. I answered a number of questions from Linocophils how they actually liked the movie and I just responded that it was not a broad "level" answer, when they liked it to "close their kits of kids". <Br /> <br />
