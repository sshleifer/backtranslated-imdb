I'm a big fan of science fiction movies. So, when I saw this photo in EPG, I thought I was in a beautiful evening. What a disappointment! I could not imagine a poor exhibition of "special" influences in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why do you have special effects on a helicopter flying in the desert when you can create a real movie (really) at a very low cost? And those killer "muppets" ... well, I could do better than a few hours in the garage. You can expect to get less budget in a movie, but I do not think there is less budget for any budget. As the "star" of the movie (I'm using today's many quotations ...), Iron Diamond Phillips, the man is not even a remote actor. Maybe he'll have a martial arts movie. All in all, a terrible movie. Maybe I got a bad mood tonight. Then again, probably not. A sincere 1 out of 10
