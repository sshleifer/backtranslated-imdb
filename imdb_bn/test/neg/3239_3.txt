Based on the excellent novel, Watchchurch Dean Quotez, this extremely dangerous motion picture which probably should not be seen by somebody. As "Running Man" I saw a book out of recognition so far. The difference, however, is that the film "The Running Man" was still enjoyable as a sensational action film, with a million hits. This picture ?? No, some distant amusing. Actually, if you love the book, as I do, you'll hate this barbarism more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** SPECTORS INCLUDED ** RITES, I'm basically telling you the story here, almost in totality. Why? Because, dear readers, do not have to suffer hardship through this hatred? It's okay for me, because I'm looking bad. Because I'd complain about sh * tty things. Now, on the nasty: The film surrounds a boy and his mother is fleeing from the government and a mutant-monkey-animal who escapes from a destructive official genetics lab that calls "heroes" with a super-smart golden-stranger "Furface . " Ga ?? I believe, in the novel, this story suddenly went away. I'll find that later. However, the hero that is another son of the dreamy boy Corey Heim Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero wanders around, the coincidence and all, trying to please his dog to help protect this dog from "bad government" and make him genetically super-smart. Monkey-animal, which is called "Oxx" (God helps us), the genetic-stew of an animal created as the ultimate fighter of the future battlefield. Michael Iranside (Total Recollection, Starships Truppers? Always played a BADUS) This movie also does not, and no, I did not understand how I can believe in it, it's a good idea. He plays a government agent hunting dogs and animals with NSOs. Oh yeah, some spoilerama here: He creates a creation from the government, and the same lab, and lo and see that the movie is mostly having a hiatus and spent killing people ?? And all that is supposed to be done by the monkeys that are killed- the soldier. Instead of Rockin's kick-ass, unclear awful movie, we have a rectangular hemorrhage of a Tiny Bubble Horse Flick. The intelligence of the dog is very easily discovered and we believe that we can see the cloud looked far easier than it is. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Change from book to film: <br /> <br /> - The character of the characters goes back to the children. <br /> <br /> - Love of people's books (Nora) love, now his mother ?? And the growth of its depth and character has gone completely. <br /> <br /> - Lam Johnson, black man, now white m. Ironside. The power of this character was based on the tradition of the book. <br /> <br /> - The relations between the authorities of the two authorities were completely ignored, Lame now killed the man who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br /> - The original character of the book is now completely absent, this "hero" has hit heroes - perhaps it can be Irananside, but why is he anybody else? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Months like books, keep the place during the day? <br /> <br /> - Cori Heim's girlfriend has not appeared in more than two articles in the movie. In the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson's character is no longer cooler; Instead, he bullies his way through a total asshole that man. <br /> <br /> - Heroes is part of the Delta Force part of that group, instead, her father, who never met, was part of that group. <br /> <br /> - The secret secret information of the monster is no longer complete. <br /> <br /> - The whole of the Soviet and Mb involved completely out of the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most disgusting changes, and I can remember my hand (and a day later). <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - Finally, after 90 minutes minutes of pain and emotional pain, the film ended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Michael Illusionide? Generally, I like him. <br /> <br /> - Dogs are still quite liked. <br /> <br /> - Waki ​​"full 80" title screen. <br /> <br /> The bed: <br /> <br /> - OK, writing for one is terrible. <br /> <br /> - This aspect is so half a donkey that no one else can look at the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The giant appears to be sad only, that is, when we actually see bloody things. His head was very large, with yellow eyes in shape, which was a part of the book's material, so it can not be seen for more than two seconds. Instead of a weaker, powerful, quick, intelligent killing machine, there are some jackas in our forcibly made monkeys. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no development of the character. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and thunder have also happened badly, because C * is considered to be a horror film for this movie !! Generally violence is done at least! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said Anyone near me and myself near me comes close to dangerous. There are far worse films (the idea that the headache might seem), but so far, only "Alien vs. Proditar" is a big argument for me and more painful frustration. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: Start showing last credit. Actor: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (The novel was really good, it's just awful) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 1/10 Special Effects / Make Up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Chessie: 7/10 Crapacy: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend that no one will see this movie. Some extreme deadly fearsome fans ?? And if you do not read the novel only Instead, I recommend that anyone interested in it will avoid it completely and buy / book / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.residentHazard.com
