'You're in the Navy' Painfully Bad: Probably the worst movie of Gary Cooper made. It's supposed to be based on a real story, but it does not seem to have enough plots to maintain a feature-length script among the events that inspire this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on local television when I was in the house for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. There was a fierce sparkle outside, and I was literally snowbound. If I could get out of the door, I could definitely stop this movie. There are some interesting names for supporting cast, especially Charles Charles (his real name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lambel, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the generally reliable Millard Mitchell is awful. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are so little on the screen, there is no point for you to see them. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played a vague navy officer, who is a new, experimental float turbine: Basically, the whole ship is a giant teakettle. Cooper realized that the appointment is not a respectable one: if it is, then it goes to a good officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor of dramatic roles, but he had no power to joke. She has made a lot of bad comedy, and this is her worst. Jane Gera has always bothered me, and she bored me more than usual here. This ship went down with all hands, and sink without a trace. Did I laugh about this movie? I will say, 'you are in the navy now' is a point out of 10! Tut! Sound!
