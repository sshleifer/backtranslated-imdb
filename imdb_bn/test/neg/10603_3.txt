I really wanted to like this movie, but I just could not. It was possible to be a cool, hip remake of a cool show, but where it grow apart. It was very cold, very cool. After all, all cool lines and scenes were shown in preview trailers, which I have seen many times. And the performance was very upset, so the scenes do not seem to flow together and they find it everywhere. Claire Danes, I failed to break her acting role as an actress, crossing her acting role in high school. Giovanni Ribisi as PT was the only bright spot. Her little stupid, yet smart style was fun and refreshing. Overall though, I only propose viewing previews instead of watching movies and wishing it more.
