<br /> <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Dean Kruger and the powerful budget (3 stars), I saw the worst of a film about a composer and the best compilation version of the worst music. I agree with some imaginary elements to upgrade a biography, that might not otherwise be "charming". This was done with good results at AMADEUS, but here is an error in this B copy. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was an intelligent artist. Here in this picture, but he sees Mike Tyson as much more! I also wonder, despite his deafness, he could hear all the drops of the last scene (could a cochilla implant?). I prefer to listen ninth to a CD with some beautiful maestro. Today most of them run the modern Wagnerian Orchestra. WAY: I gave Amadase 10/10!
