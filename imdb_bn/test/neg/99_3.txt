The four things made me plot such a movie - First of all, it played Karley Pope ("Popular" fame), which is always happy to see. Sequenced, it features the renowned New Zealand actress Ren Owen. Thirdly, it coincides with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly, a friend suggested it to me. However, I was totally disappointed. The whole story is weird and complex with very little resolution. Pope's acting is ok, but the oven is unfortunately used. Other actors and actresses are all okay, but I'm not all of them strangers. This movie is not very good, except for the wonderful REDDAY scattered throughout the movie (and Pope & Owe). So the morality of the story ... do not watch if you really want it.
