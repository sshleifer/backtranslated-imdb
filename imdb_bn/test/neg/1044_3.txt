I saw this movie a while ago and hired a little earlier ... and it looks beautiful. I saw some good things from the full moon video, and it seems it was a shot price ... Unfortunately, this was not good stuff. <br /> <br /> The story is about a sleeping bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovering the bed, and the strange thing starts to happen. Weird things like women are strange sex discovery. And people discover strange penis. And paint the strange sexy pictures of women. And people are weird sex pictures. And they started to dream about dead people having both kinky sex. If you think that a movie will be good with such a strange sex, okay? <br /> <br /> OK. No The problem is that it is not a horror movie, at least a thriller, and it is not just paid. There is little tension, no doubt, and no fear. As well as some annoying dreams and outlook, there really is nothing to worry about this couple. The whole film is essentially moving around two philosophies and their beds. Sure, you'll eventually get a giant battle ... and some bloodshed ... But there's nothing spectacular ... just one murder, and a good fear, and that's it. <br /> <br /> and strange sex? Do not get your hope (or something else for that matter). The peculiar sex is at the top of their ideas, completely clothed, trying to strangle her partner with a knack. Not exactly a good time to get my idea.
