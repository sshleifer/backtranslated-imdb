I recently saw this movie because I am a huge fan of Jodie Foster. I found this movie was made through its 2 Oscar award winning performance, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I am still wondering how he was inspired to create this film. The script is really weak. If Mel Gibson played Hit-Man, then the story itself might be a little reliable. It was impossible to buy the idea of ​​Jodiei with Donis Hooper and his annoying accent. I think Judy looked great across the whole movie, which probably I saw the whole thing. Probably the only reason for Jodi's almost parading film with as much dress as possible. I watched Jodi a TV biography where her movies were originally commented in a growing sequence, and this movie was never mentioned. After seeing this, I can see why now.
