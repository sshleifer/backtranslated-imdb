I was just careful when I rent "all the boys love Mandy Lane", because I immediately read and listen to different opinions? Both positive and negative ?? Short in its short cinematic release and distribution of Videocoria to the shelf. It is believed that it was the most exciting and new horror film of the year, non-stereotypical teen characters and non-invasive plot twists to change. Well, the basic idea may probably be innovative, but inevitably the platley goes back to the same old and annoying slash clinic, and once the point is passed, Nifty stylistic trademarks can not save the film from horrible intercession. The opening sequences really bathe in a moody consonant environment in a terrific and literally meaning, which actually makes it more painful to watch the movie at the "normal" level of Flickr Flick. After the glorious article, the drunken child made his jaw in a disguise, in order to impress the headline beauty, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" received another textbook and silly lady kids. Stone and horny on a lonely ranch before being killed by a non-strangled lethal. The whole impressive set-up of the film has quickly collapsed from a ramakashela on the card: We do not have any testimonials why Mandy behaves like her polite and arrogant (because she's a big kid, probably oh, bu-hu), boys soon No random bimbo will have to settle for sex with and illustrated "divine" not only with Mandy and the final bend ?? Although stupid foolish ?? Just a little stupid. The middle section is rather annoying and even does not offer any genuinely horrific tension (shotgun? Please!) Or authentic rancid sleaze My generous rating is 4 out of 10 fully-costly and 70's painter styles (fading colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images?) And surprisingly surprisingly with the soundtracks. Director Jonathan Levin chose the classic Bobby Winton to choose the song "Silent with a Kiss" to play the trailer and during the last-credit, but initially I was sure that this film will be considered as "Mandy" by Barry Manuelo's Chasey Love song.
