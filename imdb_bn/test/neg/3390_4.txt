Awesome comedy fans will love this one. Others may quickly bother and close off. It's like a friendly movie, the top most violence and the Gore, deliberately stereotyped characters and many dementia. <br /> <br /> It seems to be about $ 100 in a budget. A bunch of friend boys after a big beer keg party. There is a lead that has been frustrated and his Loudmouth amazing friend who scoffs him every 30 times per second. A great monster truck, chasing them for hundreds of miles, highlights the film. Whenever this thing and his girl-masked driver is present, it's a great scene. There is a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat and a lot of giant boys hanging on the red neck bar. Nerd's friend gets off of her YAP, and after another one gets into the mess. Their debate got over my nerves, but the other aspects of the film were made for it. <br /> <br /> Various "psycho pains and tricks to try someone croak" are all fun pags everywhere. Accept the most at your risk: Have eyes, jaws, and jeepers on the mountains, which I recognized. <br /> <br /> If you are in the right mind, then it is a delightful dementia. Sensitive-dust brewskies with your friends can see this more fun; It's a good bet that filmmaker's situation is when they put this thing together.
