Well, they sent it to the TV from midnight to 2.00 - it looks like the right time to watch, and then go to bed ... <br /> <br /> No, it was not really alive, my expectations. I think the concept of Dagaamma is good, because the film gets closer to what is happening in the characters involved, when you cut out all the unnecessary effects and moody music. But again, for this concept, there are some interesting steps needed in the characters. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I know King Lear (Shakespeare version) very well if I knew this game, probably most of my movie was able to predict. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can bring one of the best and worst aspects of the character - and we must see some bad aspects. Oh yes, civilization and culture paint can be very thin and you can find an animal behind this paint. <br /> <br /> If you compare it with it, you see the same thing but opposite: "Italians for Begender" (Italian for the Newcomer) or "Sung Mifun's Sideston" (the last song of the miffun). They can see their life more constructive. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> When I finished the film, I thought to myself: "Hey, so I have not seen it before ..." The film has its own beauty. Cameraman, actors etc are good work quality. But the script may need something more. A plot would probably not hurt.
