Most likely, if any (if not) the worst movie was ever thought, acted in the history of the movie and played it. Who will throw a couple of couples and James Morden in the wonderful world of God? She looked like her mother. God forgive me but I'm honest. And it was the lowest among the many problems surrounding this terrible excuse for a movie. It was a terrific statement against women, but at least if you are blaming women for the world's problems, tell a great story so that the most annoying loop is not a sad excuse for holes and mysteries and thrillers. Everyone will be able to get their money back in the theater to watch it or buy a DVD.
