My original comment was deleted by the IMDB user or staff, in this special title, because of the dislike of this picture, I had to write this feeling since I was looking for a poor excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was clearly created by students, 'It seems so long march and amateur. Of course they have to start from somewhere? The script was inconsistent mess and was so played. What can you expect with low budget and B-class actors? There are some CGI in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old PC. Some might say, it's like an "alloyon" clone, it's only a dracula (in a veneer cloth) that dried another cast, one after the other. The sets are disrespectful, cheap and small (boiler room), although this story takes place in a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It will be delighted to know what the film is thinking about when it is released (Erica Eliinac, Caspar Van Deane, Coolie and Udo Kiar) ... Coolie must be the worst rapper actor ever <br /> < br /> <br /> It was my total waste of time and money, I do not know why I am also bothered to rent this Flickr. Honestly, I just hate this picture. With the Bowler House of the Dead in the UK, Dracula 3000 sometimes shares suspicious respect as the worst movie. (Well, I'm looking worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other film will do well.
