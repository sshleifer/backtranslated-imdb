WOW, I hate to hear feedback, but anyone who has rated this film more than anything, I must have an IQ. That time and space reach beyond reach and connects to the planet "Hooper-a-retard-for-making-the-movie" which indirectly reaches a lesser depth. This movie STANK WOW Fred Ward is cutting the hair of the SSSSTSTUWTUtUtUoutU.U.U.UU.UUPPPPIIDIDIDD! I consider Fred Ford to mailing some money in compensation for the unfortunate hair that actually owns this terrible film. Jodie Foster, certainly did not have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (not being mysteriously) plays the character of the last stereo Joe Pesci movie, complete with the use of constant killings and f word constant. You will not believe in your eyes Dean Stockwell, seeing him in this zombie, I feel bad for him because I really thought that he was drunk or temporarily wasted for the whole time of the film. He agreed with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Shane when John Tristan was drunk himself. I know what you think, great cast! I know, and it was the greatest custom film I've ever seen. Dennis Hooper is straight and star, and equally bad in both cases. How can people direct radar and then this is FAR beyond my excellent imagination. Its unexpectedly bad injury is characterized by horrendous states of character of Man's character, and is only equally baked by the end of the sunny bad. They (Hooper and Foster) are the most unwelcome couple, I believe that I am sometimes in the time of my contact with the movie, and you will be happy to lose them and finally be surprised. Is that exactly what the work is full of perfect conclusion? I do not know, but I know that if I can meet Dennis Hooper, then I would have fun for him to be responsible for this celluloid waste. Come with me Ian
