I think the "bone graduation" after joining this movie has to go. It will feel like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There was horrible even even remote scenes. If you manage to tolerate these fine pieces of film industry till the end, then you are going to die very frustrated or fierce. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd like to read. I was willing to have my money back. What a skunker If you are looking for an awful movie that keeps your interest, see "UT". It can be based on a Kaki plot, but it is full of wonderful scenes that hang you from start to finish.
