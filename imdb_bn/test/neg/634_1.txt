* This reviewer may have a speaker ... or may not be. Warning is the same for all <br /> <br /> Dang it. When I thought that the SCIFI channel used all its ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us it. Actually, the plot itself is not something that we have not seen in Sleek on a Plane, Deep Blue Saga ... This means that any giant / animal / any kind of hatred is hidden in close environments, it threatens a bunch. People In this case, a train is an alien. Wow <br /> <br /> I must say, when I first saw this thing only, then I could not laugh. No SCIFI film was ready for me this; It was so unbelievably unfortunate that I could not believe it! The actor is a bunch of all the stereotypical-character characters. But since they are not so famous (at least say), I did not expect most of them. Except for Diamond Phillips. There are no comments there, but I think the man was frustrated to find a job. The problem was something called 'special effects', even horrific for SCIFI channel values. That model / toy they believed that it was a real train (not to mention the big model / toy helicopter than the train's garden), the space is evidently coming from the place, 'baby' alien (a shock doll, and also 't kidneys'), Regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... when they were static; When they started "moving", it was awful, the explosion (the terrorists slowly slowly and slowly slowly and slowly slows down slowly and slowly!) Just fix a school problem Please!) ... and I will not talk about the end of that day of judgment, until that time I do not know how to laugh or start crying. If I feel right, I used to do both. <br /> <br /> This is an ideal movie, alone or with friends. But be warned; This is so ridiculous in many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension hacks ...
