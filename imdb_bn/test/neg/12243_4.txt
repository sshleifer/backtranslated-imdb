This film is a fool / stupid comedy like an airplane or a naked gun line, but it does not even come close to these two because it's originality and a more intriguing joke, but rather a simple trick of throwing you just simultaneously. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other movies, I have identified Dodgeball and Rocky from the top of my head, so you can have fun with it, trying to find out which movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie gives you occasional smiles, but nothing that can hurt you, is not it funny in the same way. <br /> <br /> I liked the character iPod in some ways though some comedy with it is the comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and mostly a fool / wonder comedy) depends on your mood, so if you think that you will laugh at any joke to see this movie If you are in a serious mood, instead of looking at the plane (forget it), it will definitely let you laugh
