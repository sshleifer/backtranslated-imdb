I saw this picture because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad at so many levels that it's imagination. It is created for a weak, also scripts and acting is just awful. But Hey even has a bad bad movie under his belt of Jonny Depp. The rising Emmy of this movie will be sung and even on those scores, I believe that good songs can be selected. Amy is certainly nice to see and if you are her a die hard fan you will probably see no matter what this title is, just do not expect too much. I hope I could have loved more but it was difficult to see. I recommend cleaning or suspect sunshine.
