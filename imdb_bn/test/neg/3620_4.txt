I'm not lying and say I do not see the show - I do. But it's a lot, and there are a lot of errors. 1) Boarding school perfect. The drama is a minimum. Everyone is so beautiful to each other, you know. Let's give a reality check. It's impossible that any school like PCA is perfect. Free laptop for everyone. Big room Mini Freeze. If there was such a school in real life, almost no one would be virgin there. Two, everybody is so rich, and none of his weirds still steals. 2) Characters are really unrealistic First thing first, they just feel like they talk like that. They will speak like a perfect teenager. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Andrew) is a very wealthy boy "hot" teenage boy. My question is, why is not she so much girl so long? She is now rich and "hot" one day all the girls will be after her, even if she was a flutter. Also, Chase is the most foolish person ever. He claims this shy teenager who is not in love with Joey and responds to everything involved in Joey. She must not meet her with love. <br /> <br /> Come on Nick. I know you can do better than that. Please ..
