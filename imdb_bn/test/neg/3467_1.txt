Many negative reviews here focus on the historic accuracy of this movie. Okay, as much as it was with the actual NFL, your average war movie must be done with actual warfare, or western truth will have to work with "the old Western". So, I think we must pass an artistic license on them. The problem here, the director (Clone) apparently thinks that sculble comedy is made to be a) stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) taking full stupid scenes of stupid and stretching them in a very long way . Scrumal comedy requires a speedy speed, not necessarily frenetic, but moving all the time intensively. Here, drag and drag and drag objects. After watching this movie, how did you appreciate the fantastic Mac Sannet when he made most of his productions with Caststones Police. After 90 years, you think the managers used to study older masters and learned some or two things, perhaps a little better. But no, as someone who saw an automobile pioneer, he built Duessenburg, and after about a century later, combined the concept of a child with a wheelchair and dedicated the idea and "advanced". <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the movies of Clooney, I think he is a gifted actor. But very few actors can manage themselves efficiently; Clint Eastwood took a while to hang it significantly. Clooney is definitely a very steep slope bottom. The film becomes more visible in a short period of time from the frame, but when she is in the picture, she makes herself a center of attention. In the scene of war, his insensitivity is so humiliating that you want to make him a real joke. <br /> <br /> If you create a sculble comedy and throw some romance, you have to build some chemistry in the male. And the female leads. There are all the chemistry of the dumperter joint for sitting in a parking lot of clonies and gelguards. No spark, no radioactivity, even a post-mortem twitch. Zellweger, who has turned into some pretty good movies, will do her botox injection business for oak tannin, providing her extraordinary timber performance. He has done the "hard-wired man in the world" only once, if he tries to call outsthostostone once, he has a little smile on the camera and shines in his eyes. But no, he sticks his jackpot firmly to the very end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is not funny. Stupid things are not the same as the slapstick doing. Like stugas or intellect kitten, very miraculous stupid things can be very lucrative, ridiculous. But otherwise it's annoying and, well, stupid. I think I got a good smile from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it for free for cable, and still wanted my money.
