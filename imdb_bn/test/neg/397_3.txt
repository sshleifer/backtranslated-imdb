This program was shown in slot in the morning in a morning space, a cable-only station. I am surprised that anyone will pay or broadcast for this; It is incredibly amateur. <br /> <br /> The entire program is a small manga or scene scene that takes place in a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of walled circuits boards of the wall. There are very little continuity in the scene, and no plot. A common scene is rolling around some hair joke or special effects and only a minute or so long. The conversation makes a little sense and special effects look like Photoshop filter. Actors are all adults, but I have literally seen high school plays with good writing and set. This event is an embarrassing event. <br /> <br /> Every scene will probably act as an intermediate; Instead of advertising a filler in the show. All scenes made together in the string make the restriction of the limitation extremely limited.
