Every time I think about this picture I feel sick physically. It was a great feeling to read such a great book and discover a film later on. After a few years and imagine my pleasure switching to the sci-fi channel and it's just starting in 5 minutes! Go heading up and then uggg. OK some things have just changed. Everything is changing. Many letters are removed completely adding new garbage ones. The main hero has shrunk for almost 30 years and is de-aged, and ridiculously his girlfriend / wife is now his mother! Even dogs sub-lassie power is reduced. This is really his worst bad movie. I would curiously delete my own tenelles instead of sitting through another horrible sight, and I'm thinking of anyone watching this - please do not. If you have a copy, burn it now, but remember now and this celluloid insult has never happened. How good was your life.
