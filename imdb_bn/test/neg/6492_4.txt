Robert Lansing examines a scientist with the object to pass through the solids, but he goes very far in one night and unknowingly makes himself four-dimensional! The concept of nuclear age is rather charming in a very greasy way. Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful Sci-Fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet the film is lightly overbaked and naive; This is a camp-festty tailor made for late-late TV show. Lancing and Lee Merivida's wood performance is limited to one dimension, although Patti Duke (playing an intelligent brat pre-"Maracell Worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. <br /> <br /> ** ****
