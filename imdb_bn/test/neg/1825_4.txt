I saw it for the sole reason that it was supposed to be the third Reich Reference. This is a beautiful brainy and anticipated slash film that was made to appeal to feminists or some of the others. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to see the female lead breasts attractive for a complete film then tell me something, the last thing you want is not to show anything that is a "tastefully" sex sexual scene with an annoying camera angle. His busty friend did not get out of him, but we saw men's butts and serious hair and boys off their shirts. And in the end you've folded our heroine and scalpel thrusts and villain swings (which can be enough in Hong Kong) and they will easily hit him (ohoo) when his men's love interest stops and waiting is to be rescued. The most interesting part was when he stood up on the chair and "swung" the man and it broke on him. Now he can break as much as he can in a chair, for which enough people can break it! It seems ridiculous, he basically pushed it against him and it fell apart. If you are going to do such a "change of role" garbage (which has already been completed with death), you must at least finish it. <br /> <br /> There was a good bit though. Bad guy gets his slutty friend good, teaching a lesson for being a trump and sleeping around. It's okay, feminist something like that. <br /> <br /> Foolishly is the fool. American slasher flicks are generally not very good, but you are surprised why they are annoyed. It brings everything new version. <br /> <br /> 5/10
