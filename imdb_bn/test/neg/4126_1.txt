This will be one of the worst movies ever seen in my life. I watch any movie at night (shottime, hobo, cinemax, etc.). The "three" AKA "Surviv Islands" keeps a lot of mystery as the paint drying just to keep you more sadly. If you want to feel like you, it is always the best film of all time to feel like an eternity. I must be shouting at least 900 times from stupid twists. If I have 4 hands in my hands, I will drop down 4 organs of this film. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe that the only person who likes this movie comes with a terrible morality.
