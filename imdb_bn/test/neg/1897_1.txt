God, I hate this movie! I saw it in a sneak preview 13 years ago, and I still have bad flashbacks. Without any doubt, I saw any movie. It is badly written, badly operated, and (surprisingly considered cast) played badly. I would rather have a roof over the razor sharp spikes, and then have to peeled off my skin again than to sit through me again. Can you guess I did not enjoy it?
