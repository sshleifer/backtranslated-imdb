In the early 1990s, "Stap-by-step" came as a tedious combination of the ultra-chase "Full House" and the long lazy loopie classic hit "The Brady Baugh". The difference between "step-by-step" and two previous shows is certainly good writing, the best comedic timing among all its actors, and a very impressive situation that was not very popular as sugar-coated. Predecessors. Although, even with the big developments in the show's basic dynamics, it was still not quite spectacular, and even this was not even memorable in the memorable memoirs of long-term family programming! It was a very good time-traveler, you could say, cutesy migraine-education compared to the "flower house", which is contrary to overall popularity "step-by-step" with "step-by-step" over time. The show, now syndication is definitely definitely worth, but definitely do not forget to expect much more than when it is watching the family.
