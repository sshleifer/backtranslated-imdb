I started talking about Japanese cinema, literature and culture. I saw many Japanese films and enjoyed them, but "Portrait of hell" (Kuka Jigoken) makes myself ridiculous. The two characters who keep track of the action - in their special bubble, "evil lord" and "deadly, crazy artist" are falsely or nimble of pure words, and all their actions arise from cartoonist extremists. The film wants to show the horrific scenes of violence and raw emotion, but most of these scenes have gone up and they became really laughing and the overall feeling is a made TV movie that went out of the railroad. If this screen is a rarely read in your hand or comes into your city, leave yourself and pass it.
