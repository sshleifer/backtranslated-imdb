I give this piece 1 out of Hollywood trash 10! Seriously! I mean, I like the comedy as much as the next guy. I just take the ordinary cute comedy and can actually sit back and laugh with it. But there was nothing to smile in this movie or to laugh. <br /> <br /> I like almost all actors of this photo. So I thought many people informed me about it (I do not mind being listened to). I was just mortified at this script stupid! Just ridiculous and even a fun way. The only fun scenes in all the movies or TV shows that were seen in the theater were seen by everyone in the theater. I was very frustrated and I really want to know why other good actors will read this script and still have to sign up! The bad decisions of their part ... <br /> <br /> ******************************************************************* ************ <br /> <br /> - My biggest question in this movie is ....... if the characters come back to this story (Live Tyler). Then how did Paul Rezier go to a therapist? Remember the past !!!?!?! At last moment, he was killed by a dumpster! Can anyone answer me?!?!?!?!? Major gupha in the picture maker ... Nobody noticed it?!?!?!?!?!?
