I tried to watch this movie, but I did not make it in the first 15 minutes. This is a terrible depression, cast considering, but I can not see the conversation that some of the conversations in English and Indian actors are not even close to actors (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering 1/6 of the world population and the only Indian in India's biggest movies, I do not think it was difficult for filmmakers to take part in a wonderful Indian actress. And I do not call it because of some blind patriotism, because it is absolutely and totally stupid for non-Indians to play an Indian / Pakistani role. Now some people are saying that as long as he believes? But my point is that he is not strong enough and never can - not because of his performance skills, but because of his ethnicity. For example, an actor Tom Hendgs may be good, he will never be able to play Australian Abigin! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> English dialogue It completely destroys mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. The same novel has been made in local language (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with the English subtitles, it can be an extraordinary movie. Unfortunately, as things stand, I do not recommend filming students who want to study "Do not do" in movies.
