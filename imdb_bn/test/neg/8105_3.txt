Lugosi poor time Just work another day. A group of volunteers tried to hinder American war effort from inside. First of all it is very difficult to think, because we know these guys have to do something, their method of operation is not very clear. I will not loot it, but the fantastic ending is amazing. There is a series of killings by our hero. A police force does not know what's going on. There is no one incident that all the victims come to come and go to the same house. There are comments like, "A true patriot will do this or that." It is clear that most suspects in the world will not be spying or confusing if it gets blurred and bits them. I was surprised to see Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) in the romantic role. I sometimes realized that the horse has done something other than to sit on. Of course, criminals smugness they think that they are defense from the guest list of the killer. However, Bela sorted out a good guy and rolled in one of the bad guys. The best scene in the movie ends, but I will not loot it. As a curiosity, and a piece of time, it can be fun for some people.
