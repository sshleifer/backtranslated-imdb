You probably will get something like this. I translate movies for the living and my intellectuals seem to be objectionable. This is the first movie of 5 years of work experience. Of course, there is a fool Hollywood movie about drunk teenagers on a shower break, but those movies are not even claimed to work serious in the industry. But when someone tries for greatness and poetry, there is a confusing (and often ridiculous) story, unlike a bunch of scenes, hypocritical dialogue ... then you get the worst kind of movie in a movie which is very accurately "shit" to any other critic. Those who think this film is intelligent or even efficient, I can only say - this is your intelligence and your imagination which you have definitely used to try some of this desperate effort (trying to try things out in our human nature). Another issue: I can bear the political mistake, I am all for the sake of artistic freedom and suspicion, but Slavic's female character was too much. I told one to the director that it was a sunny (even in an unreal art film) to portray half-clearly obscene animals associated with the power of a Slavic woman, who probably spent her entire childhood looking for big and milking cows on a three-foot stall.
