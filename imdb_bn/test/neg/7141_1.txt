Okay, the first one is good: if you've seen the trailer you know about 100% of the movie's "scary / shocking" moment. And yes, this is a good thing because you should only hold the trailer and not go to see the movie. <br /> <br /> I understand why Sarah did not live long in the film of Michelle Gallery? Do not want to attach his name with this production. I wish him best for his "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow 3 different stories in this movie and they will all end (time and money). And even then it's a very bad measure. And Allah forbids the opening of other sevices. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is running "The Rage and Fury". There is no need to visit the house, stop being inside and finish your work. It's not a curse, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, be afraid, come back to America and spread the joy of your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to follow, but you really do not know anyone. Plot line is not thin to anyone and you have a lot of scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... someone milk ?? I watched the Jun-2 on the Fantasia Cinema Festival last summer, but the stories are completely better than this evil. It's not a rebuild, but this time, maybe they should just be doing a remix. <br /> <br /> If you see it, wait for the DVD.
