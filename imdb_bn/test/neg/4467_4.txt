As long as Steve Martin's fan is, he strikes it to see him in a movie with a clip script. The screenplay must have rented a few videos and took a piece here and took a piece there - it must be at least at least fantasy movie - I soon knew what was going on in each scene. Starts. African-American stereotypes and slave references are quite offensive as well. But the worst thing for me was that Martin was seen in a movie without intelligence. He is perhaps one of the most intelligent actors and here he completely sells out a complete dumbed-down script. She will be behind her boycott in such a lame effort.
