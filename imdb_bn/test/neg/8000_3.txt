The first of several "Ninja" films produced by Enter the Enza (1981), Japanese Sensor Show Kosugi, or Actor Canon. But the star of the first "Ninja" star was the legendary Franko Nero. Sadly, even Mr. Niro or Show Kosugi could not make this movie visible. When you make two bad dudes in an action movie and it's not worth seeing or funny, somewhat frustrated. But I have no hesitation. Skip this section and watch the next movies in the series. They are more attractive and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Next Ninja Retaliation. Instead of playing "evil oriental" (I use that word tongue in the cheek mind). He is star! Strange for a Western film. See that one instead <br /> <br /> Die Hard Sho Kosugi fans or canon film buffs are not recommended except to die.
