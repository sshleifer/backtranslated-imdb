The movie was the worst of what I saw, but it was not allowed to leave a clinic that could imagine the Hollywood-so-called-thriller. The play is a loving father and a personal investigator who is specially engaged in: Find out if the suspect "snap" is a real film. <br /> <br /> He is looking for female killers in the film "Snape" as a matter of investigation of deep and deep, ridiculous pornoshops (operated by Mexicans) and sex theaters. "Smart" (she reads a book) aided by a sex worker, she is involved in a killer slavery-film producer and her personal distortion, which is responsible for the film ... ... and what do you expect? They are described as simple evil, interpretation, background, no need of history: they are bad, and he is pure. Boom. Killer killers. The end of the film Is it bad Yes, I'm so scared. Ironically, "machine" (megabyte that megabyte) is even pointing to its ridiculous character: in the last scene, our heroes "machines" close their skin masks (yes, of course he's wearing one) And "machines" on the street like normal 08/15 people think. Then the "machine" says: "I'm not a monster blobble, my parents never used to torture me, I had a very good childhood, I love to do just what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love to kill people. Yes, sure, "Everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the lack of character that makes this movie so annoying, it's also ugly "I have to kill these people" -interest that makes you sick. At one point, our hero is involved with one of the killers and trying to shoot him ... but he can not. So what will she do? She urged the woman's mother to be killed, her son is dead and asks him if she loves her baby so much that she wants to see the killer dead. Mother laughs, yes, she loves her baby, she goes to the killer again and kills him. <br /> <br /> This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ethics in the ridiculous form against pornography, it does not make its characters severe and waste your time with a fool plot. Perhaps the only good thing about this movie is that it does not attempt to disguise the psycho-psychology ... even it will be a lot more plots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not spend time with you. <Br> <br />
