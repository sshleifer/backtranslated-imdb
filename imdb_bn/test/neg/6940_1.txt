I never thought that any movie could disappoint me that I subscribe to the Hello service. Now i know well Jack is usually one of my favorite actors but he can not retrieve this part. He does not try. Jack played his usual witches in character of the type of Eastwick. Unfortunately it is not transferred to the American southwest. He is credible about a cowboy frustration as PV Way Harmon. The performance has no edge and that's why the comedy fails. She is almost silly. The rest of the shield was left. The time of the delivery of the line is apparently something that the top lady was not perfect by 1978 and others were happy to be present there. I recommend to you interested in seeing this movie that you save your precious time to see something like paint drying.
