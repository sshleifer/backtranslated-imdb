This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Cast was nice, but the movie itself was awesome. It was terrible, I had to register to tell just how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie, and I saw that it wanted to break it every minute. It can be great. There was a great premises. If you're going to hide a shielded car, and a homeless person who sees you, you have to do, what you have to do. To decide for the main character to kill a policeman, and killing his friends and colleagues after the homeless man's death, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure his reaction will be his reaction to him, but let's go. <br /> <br /> The main character comes out under the armored truck, no one has seen him. He raised a piece of money and dragged it behind the other guard and nobody saw him. He was able to return to the carriage with a shield, and no one saw him ... this movie was possible, but it appeared. <br /> <br /> You can not give me this movie again! Never see it! Annoying ...
