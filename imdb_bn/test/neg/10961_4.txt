Well, we have a zombie movie here, which is probably not a zombie movie. The whole movie has been set in a prediction zombie-critical condition, but the movie is still very low with this idea. Instead it focuses on a bomb hunter who is trying to retaliate from a group of other vengeful hunters and get back his money. Since the whole world has been destroyed in hell and in cities, even then what is good. And why pay the people for killing zombies in the first place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is most logical And interesting moments, letters or dialogs are not being filled. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible movie yet. It is certainly not as bad as some people try to trust you. It's rather a good looking, or rather movie at least it's a cheap look. Its effects may be used a bit more, but they look pretty good, as have make-up effects. <br /> <br /> Still, I do not expect this movie. Its title may have assumed that the movie was scheduled for wild, wild west, but its title is only confusing, there is no doubt about it. I fell for it, hoping to be a Western and a poor zombie-hurricane combination. <br /> <br /> This movie will mostly see disappointment for fans of Junkie Films. This does not necessarily add anything new, but it does not have any kind of way to it that can be considered good to see. <br /> <br /> Not completely unexpected but away from the suggested one <br /> <br /> 4/10
