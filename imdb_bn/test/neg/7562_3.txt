I have seen the movie many times, and every time I am more disappointed, which is shameful because the movies of EX YU are generally very good. Shame here, that Hollywood tried to make a film about that place and people did not have any idea about it. My character from Balconas (Macedonia) faced this disappointment. Only Bosnian characters are not really understood and are not actually illustrated. To understand the mentality of a person from EX YU, you have to laugh about their background, way of life, their cry, and the film director was not taken as a guide. When we create (XYU) movies, many emotions are created, which make the letters recognizable and preferred, and most often represent the truth (if it is based on true words) "Pratti Village, Superb Flame" "Tito and M "," Underground "," No Man's Land "," Before Rainer "," Black Cat, White Cats "," Oatak No Slugbyen Pottu ", (when Dad leaves business)," Co-Tomo Peva "( Who sings there?) The greatest composition of the Balkan cinematography, and can not be compared with this. Half-baked stories and Hollywood studios are not. Someone from the panel said that the story has no real connection from one end of the city. I'm sorry but not only for American Armchair viewers, but for the rest of the world, and some of them also reside in Balakan and Sarajevo. Injection, half the things are Beatola, Macedonia, where I shoot come from. See my shock when I open open to Bitola Broad St. NG scene in the film, when the bride shoots from sniper. And what was the real footage of the news in the movie? However, very frustrating, as far as the film is away. Some really did not give any advice about how to survive in Sarvevo before shooting the film. The book is one of the things and real life, and this film gives both down.
