As an ancient film fan, I have heard something about the controversial film Kaligula, it is one of the few realistic epics, and one of the most horrific porn movies by others. I would like to see myself in a completely free version, hoping to find some positive things to prosecute many complaints about the film. I saw sitting on my chair in an autumn evening. The early quotation of the New Testament gave me a little astonishing and the first debate was raised between me ... Why is Mark an issue in the film about Pagan Rome, by issuing a sentence from the Gospel? But a young half-naked couple (Kaligula and Drusilla) was quite sensitive to pastoral scenes prelude with a small half-nude running hopelessly. When credited me memorablely that music stimulates me in a positive sense. Nevertheless, very soon my negative feelings were raised, especially in the death of Tiberius. Cruelty was very intense and sex was very much. However, it was not that awesome in the middle. In the second half of the film, I felt that I did not see any historical epic but very annoying porn. In the end, I said to myself, "This is one of those movies which can really hate" ... I am aware that any movie can be controversial, but I never expected that Kaligala would move so far to remove all the tastes of flavors. I hate this picture for many reasons, but especially one. <br /> <br /> Kaligala does not serve an purpose in an ancient epic (which it claims), but Bob Gauquion, the director of the Pentagon and the founder of the Pentagon, aims to blend the film with pornographic films. That, I think, the film may be accused of the most vulnerable matter. The film is an art that should be ruled by taste, by the message of some of the epic glory of the message, when this film kills all the boundaries of good taste. CALIGULA shows the best direction of man in the worst, harmful way. Some scenes are so annoying that I do not think there is a person whose psyche will not be affected by them. Some say that Rome was so cruel under Kiligula's kingdom. Yes it is true. At that time the outbreak of corruption was very different for Roman citizens. Nevertheless, I do not think it is hard to focus on these deviations and emphasize an ancient epic. I believe that it proves to be a bizarre mindset of producers and their peculiar tendencies ... <br /> <br /> Huge History: Gore Vidal's screenplay is notorious for wrong proofs. For example, it is noted with the image of a possible Roman senator, Prasulas (Donato Placido). Nevertheless, the film shows him as a general soldier, on which Caligula applies the worst way to torture and rape. Moreover, Livia is not the wife of Prokulas raped by a saiester in her marriage. What is behind the story of the historical character of incredible obscene and violent stories? Another example of historical travels is the Caesonia figure illustrated by Helen Mirren. Her daughter is presenting her together with Drusilla as CaliGuella's wife. In fact, Kaligula married her sister in Cassonia for a long time after her death. Sexual attraction of his new wife in the temple is a ridiculous scenario with a historic base. I hated the killing machine - a masterpiece of a director who does nothing to do with historical events. <br /> <br /> From technical point of view and technical perspective, the film is not something special. Cinematography can not be extraordinarily fine, and sets together with clothes are nothing but outstanding. Still, the only firm stand of the film is acting, especially Malcolm McDowell as the Kalligula. He made a perfect role playing the main role and illustrating the cruelty of the emperor. McDowell raised the price of the film. If everything bothers you at CALIGULA, but at least appreciate its performance. I am Hessen Mirren, as well as Drusilla as Cassonia and Teresa Anne Sauvai (yet this film is based on Suinenius's words that Caligula loves her sister). Like the old Tiberias, Sir John Gilgood is like Melcha and Peter O'Wowel. O'Toole captures his best piece played in the Grotto sequence and illustrates the extraction of the old emperor's exhaustion. Yes, I admit that I only love about CALIGULA. Therefore, I do not rate the movie 1/10. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the Lamin: The film's historical flaws are associated with poor continuity. Let's analyze at the beginning: Caligra arrives at Capri Groot where she watched the old Tiberias' awful joy. Then, about 15 minutes later, the verb goes to Rome where a black bird violates the badge near the druceila and caligula's bed. And where is the letter in the caption immediately, where is Norva (John Gilgood) going to die ...? <br /> <br /> I told all, I do not want anyone to see Kiliglas. If you want to know the story, I read Robert Grew's fantastic novel, see Claudius and Claudius of The God or Derek Jackby, in a small series of Herbert Wise series. CALIGULA is a sick film which destroys the most serious crime industry. This is mostly an indecent movie which should never be called an epic. <br /> <br /> is a movie that sharpens the transparency of real artistic and beauty people. <br /> <br /> There is a movie that is average entertainment; Yet they have some proposals, <br /> <br /> are movies that display extreme violence; Still, they still show some moral, <br /> <br /> However, there are movies that show their illness and frustration for themselves and this results in damage to the mind of the people; <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the group
