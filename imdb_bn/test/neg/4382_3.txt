I sold this image for $ 1.50 from the local family video, it was probably the first sign that was not good. I saw 2 friends with how bad this picture is, none of them even wanted to finish it. I'm wondering, it can not stop watching. But this film is definitely a syllabus for not making a film. <br /> <br /> This plot looks simple and good: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a series of killer who he has kept behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares start to become reality once more. Serial Hunt, Norris, Roundhouse Kicks ... It sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some of it's pretty good. Flashback scenes where people are intensified by breaking a stairway with a tooth, in a scene where the vane jumps over the steep hills and crushes - and I'm chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. But there are so many mistakes with this movie. <br /> <br /> One: The editor is a body. While making an action or suspense film, you have to keep moving in energy. There is not too much scenes for the rest of the plot in this movie, which is subdued and misleading from the whole story. At least 10 minutes can be spent and the pens will improve and the film will be even better. Two: The word guy is a moron. Obviously someone tried to script most of the film in a film where you can not acquire a lovely word, so most conversations are spoken, killing stereo and not believing with a mouth. Also, the music is very dramatic in some scenes. Three: The welding director is a moron. They throw Drago delivery as a psychiatrist. Billy Dragago was a great cultural actor (from Brisco County, The Hills I Is, and others) and made appropriate serial killers or some kind of villain. His character is so vanilla that Vanilla's skills are wasted. Four: The author is a fool. This picture contains two plots - a serial killer victim and romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I see that woman on the screen, I wanted to close my eyes. And sure, he never painted any other plot, making his story completely futile. <br /> <br /> Will I see it again? may be. But if they do not remaster this film at least a dozen times, you should not. Not recommended.
