I am a huge comedy show fan. Ethnic humor is always a little risky, but great people such as George Lopez, Dave Chappell, Lisa Lampanelli, have completely stopped. <br /> <br /> They do not go to the overboard, the audience is uncomfortable or * coughing cough * Steel JOKES! But I will not harp over that. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor completely unreasonable. Her trick has continually shouted racial humor, it is not funny or clever, but it is insulting. I'm not going to be cold on ethnic humor. But these jokes are the reason for his death sentence, which can bring people back from his comedy. <br /> <br /> Her humor just exceeds the presence of her dignity due to her frustration. I think he is looking at me! And he runs around the stage like a crazy. It just comes off as annoying!
