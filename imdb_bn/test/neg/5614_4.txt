"Cad in In Head" is character of the character of Krrigan, often in a search for himself to find himself and his involvement with some playful characters. This slim and flawed story written by Corrigan, as you make up a make-up, reflects on the feeling and a screenplay that smells like an uninspired low-budget indie Despite the deviations of some and annoying Hendenberg scenes, the film is a big beat, playful elegance that can appeal to people of similar comedians in a small way. Not for everyone, not for most, but for some fun. (D +)
