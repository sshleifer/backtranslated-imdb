This is a polarizing film. People love it or think it is trivial. I, I despise it. This picture comes in the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but it's a wonderful composition, it's very awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both films accept Kaffak's incomplete novel - America for their inspiration and general ideology. America is a real story of a youth journey across the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, which does not change the course of the journey (although the book has about 300 pages and still one quadrant appears to be finished, so we will never know). Kafka is allowed to have unreasonable / spiritual situations and surroundings to concentrate and comment. Oh Lucky Man, following this same template, Malcolm McDowell and Weekend follow the same template to show France with the eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of these movies are illustrated using Brechtian, various techniques and techniques, it is not realistic, it is confabulation etc. But the difference comes when Oh Lucky Man uses a film created to express the illogicality of life and the classroom, using the weekend filmmaker for our death with idealistic spine. Because the Gardard goes further than Anderson's Brechyan principles, we will end up with two main characters which we have no investment. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, yet we could not even notice less about them. Deliberately so. But in this way, Gordard gives us a picture that is completely about his own message, which is supplied through the first half of the film through continuous and enthusiastic symbolism, and through the long lectures directed by the camera in the second half. Unexpected and unnecessary scenery slaying such a really dangerous pig, car crash is far worse than camera violence. <br /> <br /> The end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik droning and while repeatedly kicking you about his opinion so that you get the message. Brecht's problem is that, if you are too close to the audience, you have disconnected from what you are trying to publish. Which always seems to me to be clear to me. <br /> <br /> The parts that are really stuck in the crayon for this photo are, in the beginning and off-screen verbal descriptions of contrasting rhetoric in the middle, which are also seen as metaphorical, even completely destroyed the film's beliefs within themselves. And its letters, none of the first of these exist. This is a capital F. So French, it hurts. <br /> <br /> Look instead of Oh Lucky Man. That's a work of talent. Weekend Protestance is a work. <br /> <br /> The two stars, and only for traffic jam scenes and piano scenes, which only indicate talent, though they actually make the end result more frustrating and unhappy, among them the worst disorder director in the world is a bad Movies, it is well understood that it is a remarkable technical director, who is the world's most intelligent inspiration A film produces. As far as that is far worse.
