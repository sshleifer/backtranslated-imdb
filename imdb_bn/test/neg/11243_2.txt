When this show started, it was fairly interesting: We saw what was the time of catching a crab-boat while fishing in a crab boat. Shortly after, it lost focus on fishing and almost completely concentrated on the drama of fishing life. Episodes' Captain does not like the new greenhorn ', it does not become much more (it often happens),' someone injured or sick ',' Talking to some problem in a jail house and frustrated that he is trapped. A boat ', repeat. I do not know how new seasons may be able to find, because before and after each episode it looks the same as it is. This shot should be removed to another channel and should be named "Krab Boat Drama", or even better, it creates perfect one-time segments in darstest pubs. <br /> <br /> Discovery channels after American Chippers can not learn their text?
