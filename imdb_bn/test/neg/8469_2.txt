I thought this movie was very interesting, it's still a little awake, it's about violence and what is doing there, I still can not become terrorists to stop the terrorists. The United States and other countries have the same reason to use similar violence and war strategies because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans during medieval times, and Christians are prejudiced against the Islamic people. Many bloods and deaths have had a negative impact on religion in the Western world, beyond violence. I do not support their actions, but in the past there has been a slight negative impact on western culture. But still remember that most of the Islamic people are peaceful! People of any kind of people think of patriotism, but the truth is that I start the fight with the right and the need to revisit the war criminals. Again I repeat you can not stop the terrorists like them.
