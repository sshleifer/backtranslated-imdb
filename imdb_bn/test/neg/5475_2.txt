My, mine, me: Peter Cushing and Donald Plusas may have been frustrated to work for their talent in this turkey. In the modern day of Greece, a horrific story about Satan, the land of Minotore (Sky the Devils Man) makes every imaginable stage a mad or at low level. It has a few scares valuable (always a slight error for a "horror" movie, do you think?); Poor performance; Countless scenes where characters strangle freely alone or reduce the chance of having a group's safety; And some rather annoying editing strategies which add anything to the proceedings. I got indecently excited at the handy and Pleasance's expectations and together with Flush and Fiendance 17 years later - but this film is not worth getting excited about remotely; <br /> <br /> Travelers and archaeologists are missing outdoors in the distant region of Greece, and the local cleric Father Roche (Donald Plusas) is suspicious that some sinister afoot. He wrote to his friend, New York Private Eye Milo Kaya (Costas Scorcus), that he was asked to fly from Greece to help him go under the mystery. Meanwhile, there are three more visitors - Beth (Vanha Revil), Ian (Nicos Verelis) and Tom (Robert Biholing), who are all personal friends of Father Roche - traveling around the nearby Greek ruins. Milio eventually came to Greece, but initially suspicious about Father Roche believing that the missing people were hijacked for Satan's sacrifice. Millio and Father Rocho Laurie (Luan Peters), Tom's friend joined Tom. Together, they are the Minowan Satan-worship cleric who invented activities under the leadership of the vicious carpathian exile, Baron Karfax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultists left their victims in a statue of Minatoura. In addition, they can not be killed by natural means, so Father Roche has to use different religious handmade wars against them. <br /> <br /> The land of Minotur was actually much better than this. This plot is so awful and unlikely that it has all the features of an enjoyable enjoyable worship / camp favorite. But handling is just awful. Director Costas Curayanis has no idea how to unify the story together, so the whole thing is growing so that it is being made on a daily basis. There is no idea about how concrete performances can be understood from his cast, so they are sadly left to embarrass themselves in the performance of Pleasance, Cushing or Horror Amateur (Squares, Peters). What is worse is that the narrative makes no sense. Why do parents want help from a private eye on extremist personal beliefs? How can we know that only full moon sacrifices are offered? How can you talk to the statue of the minute aur? Why did one parent among the victims of baptism instructed during the rush, only to throw some scenes before getting the chance to bear it? And - the most annoying - why Father Rocco crucified him to help half of the world to help him and why some holy water to settle bad people? These questions - and more - the land of Minoto will pop into your mind ... but, yes, there is no answer. Frustrating, stupid and frustrating!
