Woa, talk about the horror. Do not waste your time. I first saw comments on other comments. I must admit, I did not see the whole thing. It was very terrible. The worst, the most dialogue ... I could go. But it was really unwatchable what direction it was. Poor actors You can not even say whether they have any talent because they are not talking only flexible lines, but the director did not take any action on them. If you check the directorial movie on this site, you can see why this movie is not available. <br /> <br /> It's good to be made for TV Flickr. <br /> <br /> Oh!
