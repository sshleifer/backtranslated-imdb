Let me start with a terrible tale and a terrible control system. Good animation but not very good graphics. That's why I give this game 4 to 4. If you ask me, then this game definitely needs improvement! Jaw control is not so difficult so I will rebuild it and make this control system even better. If I make it to improve, then I will show those graphics better than film. It's easy to freaking easily when you drive it to someone crazy. When I played this and was killed by a diver, he was one of those sweep knives in the 2 hits. Dolphin will kill you so much that the shark will beg aloft to hell. This game sucks some fat ass. Sorry about all the cussing I'm done now. It just sucks the game's shelf that it sucks so bad in this game. I dare you to play junk and you will be so crazy by dying very easily so do not play it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
