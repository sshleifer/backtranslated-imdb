I think it was like that of Leigh McGuin that it was much worse than the original. The only thing that is different is that he likes all of the creatures and science and that geeky material. All others are the same. He's a guy that he's very nervous to ask. And after he finds out a guy like him and he has no formula. I think people will have to go beyond the same programs. And the other thing is the same as it is always two daughters and a man's throat. Do not people think that these things are old and tired and these ideas are being used over and they are still using these ideas. But I know who I see this show and I know they like them.
