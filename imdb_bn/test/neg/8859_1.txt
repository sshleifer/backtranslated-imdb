This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been seeing it for a few years and then nothing has come from it and I doubt that a film that is so bad will be created. It tries to make fun of various types of movies, for example 'nail' (!) And instead of fun it is just kind. Whatever you do, do not rent or by this garbage and if someone thunds it you .... turn and run in another way !!
