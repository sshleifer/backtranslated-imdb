Although it was set up as a showcase for some kickboxing and a sword, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) may be even more drawn. This can not be a good vampire movie, because it failed to VTT trying any punch. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to use the idea of ​​the 800-year-old Thai vampire, but he would mistakenly remember (and now wiped out) the story about the descendant, "Gremilins" and reminds Gizmo of its grief and it's a good idea. It's not a thing when it comes to a vampire flickr. <br /> Stefani Cho is attractive and works very well as "good" vampire, but when you realize that she is a 800-year-old vampire then she lacks any accent. He added, when he told Connor that he was "a young soul," he would not provide the line with the amount of weight you would expect from the "old" soul. Attractive, but not reliable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most powerful reason to continue this film and you never get it. You get a tease of it, but you do not actually get any kind of development out of character for that plot device. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This one flicks from Hammer with much greater power than one. In the end, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. This is just forgettable
