This started showing but there was no faith in the characters. Especially the relationship between the bakery radio assistant and the waitress did not work for me. The scene between the owner of the unemployed and the assistant was beautiful but the rest were very slow. It was a very worshiping film and it gave me a feeling that I was watching the game instead of a movie. Characters were very 'stereotypical' and storyline was a lot like French at a stage. At that time, I bothered Pyramanian's fellow classmate and did not care about what had happened later, and so I stopped. I could not see it happy. Smile or even smile even once Americans seem to have a strange tendency to classify their movies as 'comedy' when they're funny fun than funny ha I finally learned how to avoid the dark comedy of Americans who are generally awkward to be strange and strange. It seems that when they call a movie as a romantic comedy, they need to be more intelligent. In America, instead of using a film instead of a series, comedy may have different meaning. Why America can create amazing funny comedy, such as Queen's King Will and Grace, but the toilet can not really make funny movies without humor. This film was not total or nothing. But it was just a big jawan nothing ...
