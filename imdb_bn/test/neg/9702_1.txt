I think Bollywood "Bride and Prejudice" was more faithful than enthusiastic than the 2005 Hollywood version. I'm more relaxed in the Bollywood version (Mr. Kholi! Infinite!) If you've read the book or watched the BBC version of 1995 (and liked them), you're going to be a wonderful surprise going to this movie. However, my friend, who did not see, was humiliated by the film. If you are a jane Austen peureist, even a film director who dislikes the historical error will be painful to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Um, script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine that if the actors did not fit very well, then they did not have the right maker, perhaps someone who loves Austen's work wrote it. <br /> <br /> What travels were made? Well, you'll be forced to tolerate such an incredible line, "You do not dare to judge me, Lizzy!" And "Leave me alone once in your life!". Such lines are not only from anything spoken from Jane Austen's spoken pen, but can anyone really say that a decent young woman of the Regency era believes in the word Spellings? Using modern colliquillism, it is a very interesting way to pick a book for the screenplay. The authors have also decided to give the letter lines, that the book is called by a completely different character and for no apparent purpose. Even worse, when they try to travel a bit more with the book's writing, the screenplay has made a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases, and replaced the strange synonyms for its perfectly perfect words. While writing this script, the screen writer sat with the book in one hand and sat with Thesaurus. Stuck in Austen's words; She did better than you! I guess all of this has been done in a "revisionist" spirit and in 1995 the BBC version of the icon to try to distance this film. However, for me, it also debated the true spirit of Austen's most favorite work. <br /> <br /> There was a possibility of casting, though the script once dashed once it was dashed. But keera, gigling is not too much and baring your crooked teeth to equal the grave and vivacious! And I think Mr. McFiden, though I think he's pretty handsome, his script is wrong and it looks like Hitchlif is playing and great Mr. Not Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Bluthin, Kelly Rally, and Mr. Collins. Their explanation was really rather refreshing. <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Some have described his activity as a hobo that suddenly moves around the film set and I must say it is a good description And someone can tell me why they made Wicham after Lecoulas? Although he was in the film in two minutes, I was brave, and without his impressive arrows, I could not enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> On a dress note, I'll kill Miss Bingley's dresses because they were supernatural and fit more with the modern century. (Olive's Regency Gown in the evening? Please, more versus than Austin, sure) and poor cairera, all the budget went to his salary and not his clothes! Oh, and I'm sure they finally got caught in a cell phone who stole a hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they did not catch enough to combine the actress's tresses before filming early on. <br /> <br /> With this short Hollywood version, Osten's eloquence, subtlety and intelligence, being completely opposite.
