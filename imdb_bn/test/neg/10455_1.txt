This movie was terrible beyond, it was a wide on a * movie industry. I know that not every movie can hit or even average for that matter, but the responsible parties responsible for this episode are able to see that it was time to bomb the bombs in their hands. I can not help but imagine that the cast scenes will be united together and console each other to have a dome of huge size. I can hear it now, "You've got"? "No, you?" I understand that this membrane was more than a string of budget but it may be better if taken in consideration. When you wait for a monster / animal look and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I'm crazy at myself for spending 1.07 on this stinker !!!
