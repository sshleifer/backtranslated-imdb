This is a really terrible film. Laum Diamond Phillips simply calls it. The use of small models of trains is ridiculous. The plot is going to continue (Oh, and there's an alien here, oh, and an eco-terrorist is on board; Oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is not in control; Oh, and the train is running one hour ahead of another train, oh, and That train has nuclear waste ...). I mean, come on! Alien monsters are not terrible (although there are a lot of them), and the acting is abysmal. See the person playing the "next president" - do you really think he may be the president? For the sake of righteousness, he plays his entire career in bad guys!
