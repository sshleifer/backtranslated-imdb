The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is a highly frustrating Hollywood remake of the latest of a string that flattens in the face of unusual special effects. <br /> <br /> What a weird, obscure blunder story without any imagination. Why is such a wonderful science fiction classic rewriting completely so? Today's movie viewers have written a hip for HG Wells? The 1960s George Pale edition said more respectable stories, even with the impact of low cost budget, even the beach was watching, and morlocks looked like Smurfs like the stereoids. <br /> <br /> HG Wells should have his grave in the 2002 version: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the time traveler is inspired by the past changes and the desire to stop in a time rebellion is an old science fi clich. It completely refrains from the love relationship with Killer (what happened to Win!) Which makes the 1960s so much respectable. It sets an unfortunate and confusing tone in the beginning that pushes the whole film. If Guy Pierce's character is so bright that he or his friend Einstein could understand the malicious hesitation? Do not see him 800,000 years ago? No less than a Morlock, Doh !! Appearing in the 1960s - What is wrong with time and travel for fun and adventure and curiosity? <br /> <br /> 2. If you have seen the first movie, then only you will realize that you've seen what you are doing with Piercers during the machine. Although George Pala's film is clearly the fourth dimension, 'travel' explains the whole strange concept. <br /> <br /> 3 Director Pierre is going out of geeky showing, an old old stereotype of science. In the 1960s, Rod Taylor was very young (at least in Vienna) but it was driven to be frustrating, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the original themes of the 60th edition - abandoned in rebuilding - this concept is that the continuous fighting will lead to the division of humanity. The moon's brightness is not clear to destroy humanity - and science does not do much for literacy. For the 4 billion years most of the moon's asteroids have been affected, which will allow a nuclear device to look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction requires an artistic license, but it is simply stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. The time destruction machine is stupid. Apparently our time passenger invented this neutron bomb power of things. The machine was blown out to kill the morlocks. The 'cop-out' device was like a former device. Overwhelmingly, Pierre did not come back in the 1800s to tell his story to his great friends, a key part of the Welsh story that goes far and wide during the week's journey with ridicule. <br /> <br /> 6. Marlocus' roaming day is H. Yes. Wells' Wonderfully Wonderful, as night shadow creates their horror illustrations. Lost the chance of a true movie. Also, Wells portrayed Eloque as weak and small. These boys in the movie seem to think they can take the morlock, if they do not have big kids wusses. <br /> <br /> 7. A smart morlock ?? The Style War was a kind of smoke like Evil Evil Emperor, but he was so tall that he asked Pierre to take his machine and go home! Boy, what a dramatic high point! Morlux stole the machine in the book because it is so fascinating, and fighting to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. There is a lot more in Gupta Ball Holagaram in the NY public library. It makes light of the concept of human cancer. The 1960s edition was simply "a riddle of conversations", which made an impressive cruel gesture for mankind. Derailed evolution serious element. <br /> <br /> The amazing effects of this movie can never be created for a tedious climber of scripts. Save a ticket and popcorn cost and rent DVD after it's out (no doubt now), at least you can think of the fastest time in our time as dull parts like our tourist.
