Ah yet another Sigal movie. Less than a few seconds, the shelf of the video store does not come in. Drying is bad? No But it's not saying too much. Pork like a pork. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign, but one last job can be doubled only by his boss. He is being friends by prison and a gangster who helps him to break out and get back to return. <br /> <br /> Segal is not playing agents, police or whatever he played. It actually gets the position of the United States in Las Vegas. Then as usual is a Eastern European region. There is no telegram and no foam here. Don Fontertarian is working just fine. <br /> <br /> But with Stevey most of the activities and battle scenes are definitely double. From other movies, the lack of realism and reasoning is even smallest. Sigal and Treitch are encouraging such a team (strangers) one minute laughs. The rest of the rest for a long time <br /> <br /> Many prominent faces roam around. The sleeping Kevin Tigi is a long way from his emergency. Look at the sleeping mode for Nick Mancus's sleeping. There is no wrapper. Please? At this moment, action scenes and plots are more expected and reused than before. This is an enormous scene which is to exit Seagal or to hang it. She would have gotten a while ago.
