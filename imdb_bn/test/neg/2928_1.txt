Could this "film" be considered as a film? Imagine the situation: Some people put a simple cam in front of a shore and an ocean front and filmmakers walking or jogging. Then, he placed the camera in a beach, buy some ducks in a pet store, open their cage and let them run in front of the camera. Afterwards, he just switches to the surface of the water and birds in an entire dark and pest. Is it just an insult to an exam or audience intelligence? What happens if no unknown director does a film like that? Will we mark his work with 10? I always disappoint the director who believes that they can do everything once they become popular.
