I thought I could see something good ... but I'm tired of watching this movie, I do not know that I hate most: scripts, acting, FX or music. Try the picture of the worst power Rangers episode and still be the kind of. I saw good FX in FPS games (touching the bone sword or its breath which makes humans invisible to green fumes, it gives the talent) and music spaghetti comes to the west. When the women shout at the car, "giant" moves around the car, I still love (even if he looks in the wrong way). So give yourself a break and do not see this thing, at least call someone to see a horror movie with you, believe me that you will end up playing solo for some kicks.
