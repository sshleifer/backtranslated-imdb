Wong Kar-wai's 1994 film Ashes Of Time I'm sitting again ?? More specifically, the term 'redox' was re-edited and republished with title again? I went wrong I was surprised why this movie just did not work. I wonder why the movie failed to score any big points in my book. In particular, what was the film and it made the worst movie of its career directors? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not really difficult. I just say that it is really embarrassing that Kara-Y was so surprised that in the meantime, mediation and cruelty left the hell hole, especially for this year, he had published the Chinking Express, which was his permanent heir and a pretty magnificent film. So ?? What was wrong It would be appropriate to consider the ashes as a experimental film sometime. Our director has inevitably placed his own incompetent style of making movies and puts it in various settings, moods and atmosphere; What results is a crushing film which works everywhere and simply does not work. Therefore, it would be more wiser to call for the deadly Ashes test. Bold, invincible and innovative, but a failure. <br /> <br /> Let me describe in detail. Who was a Hong Kong-born film, Autur M. The Kara-Weyer movie, which has made the mark in the art-house world since its debut in the late 80's, knows that there is a lot of aesthetics that binds everyone into his movies together; Basically and genuinely speaking, they are all colorful, thought-provoking, tragic, vivacious hilarious and meaningful evocations of life, love and losses. The same formula is shifted during the Ashes; However, Hong Kong's regular settings have to be removed and in its position we are establishing ancient China, and among legendary martial art fighters and tribal places. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kosi-Adventure / Historical Copper is usually the story of Kara-Y Love, a great sufferer who has gone in the middle of the desert and is continuing the killing of the contract. However, I have to stop myself there; The description of the character is a vain thing. Why? Because the single character in the ashes is not significant or nothing. What a bland cast, and a waste of talent (while in the case of Asia there are almost always regular K-Y partners). <br /> <br /> not only, but the film is largely endlessly rambling, horrible, almost existential narrative structure. One of the main reasons for Times Ashes's opposition is because it is not a plot, it seems to indicate equality or one. You can of course see the first two, three minutes of the film, maybe even less, even doing what you are doing. Perhaps it is the unreasonable setting of ancient China, which is unfamiliar and inappropriate for CarWay's general film making style. I think, even though it may be unfortunate, Mr. Kar-Wei only stuffed big time here. <br /> <br /> A critics can really appreciate the Ashes of Time, though praised praise is isolated, another director's trademark ?? Wonderful, colorful and delightful aesthetic. What a lovely color is made on the screen, we have painted a magnificent texture, and what exciting landscapes and imagery are taken for us throughout the whole film. We can at least take it as a sign that Wong Kar-Wai is still in the heart, and it is simply extraordinary film and its generally commendable bunny. Although visual scenes are not enough to completely release Car-Waike for this catastrophic initiative, are they enough to make the film suitable? And at least we do not go out of the movie completely and completely in the mood of the Cantons, now we have something that we can think nicely. <br /> <br /> This picture is basically an 'Uxia Art' film, tell the following style, legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kuorwa. However, one thing that separates the Car-Waier from Kurosawa's best, and in all the Japanese director's films, Jewel works together. Time Ashes, nothing seems to work. The effort to create the true deep Voxia film of Kara-Yi, in general, like an intellectual and provocative movie, is a neutral effort. <br /> <br /> Kara-Y has claimed that the periodic ashes made him tired, and he needed time to clean his head. Its hard work is embodied in the film and it is being transferred directly to us because it certainly had a chic effort on her behalf ?? I mean, just a tedious attempt to watch the movie, and now I need time to remove the head of this overwhelming film-running experience.
