Now I'm in a big animation fan - love partner and usually all the stop-motion applications so I had such high expectations. Then I came to IMDB and gave a break- I am really suspicious of films with the discrepancy of the vote in IMDB. Here we got another - a bunch of 10 seconds (anyone sealed) and then some real less ones I suspect the word "visionary" in 10s. <br /> <br /> Of course, this character is not one of them. Despite my misconception, I saw this picture and have side by side as well. Stop motion animation was okay, but the plots were balloon and overall it seemed to be amateur. Treat yourself to the real deal, get some Sankankeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf.
