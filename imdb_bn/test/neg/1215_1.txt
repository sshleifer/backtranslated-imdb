It is surprising that this kind of yappie angst film was actually created in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the act is so unclear, that it is impossible to care for them - especially Brooke Shields. Slow forward through the slow part is almost inevitable in temptation. If you like this style, you'll be better off renting "single" or "body, rest and speed" rental.
