Being a longtime fan of Japanese film, I was more than expected. I can not really bother to write a lot, this movie is so poor. The story could be a little romantic, I could not stand in the way of tragic acting, the mess called pissing, and the standard "Quikki" Japanese story. If you notice how many Japanese movie characters, plots, and twists seem to be very "different", so make this film explicitly mandatory. Seriously, a 12-year-old could tell you how this movie is going on, and this is not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Bit" Teksi: Their part of this movie is not more than a kyomo, and if you are not a barbarous fan then you will not need to suffer from this waste of film. <br /> <br /> 2/10
