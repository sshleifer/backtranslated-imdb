Rigs and Murto have returned, but the first movie magic has been isolated. The story line is just awful! I really mean, South African diplomats smuggling mythical credentials into the US, it's just painful! And the utter utter unreal! Can anyone get African South African accent right? Or can we ever hear words like British or American drunk? The only person who achieved African pronunciation rights was Catch-a-Fire team Robbins When Danny Glover indulges in African pronunciation as a mockery, I like another topic about this movie! I want to say what a slap in the face of Africans. In this film I have enough firmness to make a vomit. I mean, that the character of Mel Gibson is against diplomats, but its P. At Type! Do not waste your time while watching this trash non-researched film. If you want to see a movie that does not completely insult a cultural group, rent Die Hard 2.
