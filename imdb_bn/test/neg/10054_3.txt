The Remagen Bridge is in the picture during the most rebellious war I've ever seen. In addition to the wooden structure, a tank commander attacker, parked in a beautiful tunnel with his tank, stood in the middle of the street and the army did not prepare everyone with their weapons. Continuous suicide behavior sets my "slope switch" so often I'm unlikely to enjoy movies. Apparently the screen writer and the director had never been through real warfare and never bothered to bring an expert. This film is very synthesis of the wonderful facts in saving private secrets. Until I'm 7 years old, I recommend showing something else. <br /> <br /> GB
