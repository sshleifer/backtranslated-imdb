I grabbed this movie a few years ago, and it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. However, although it is supposed to be an action movie, I can not give it even more stars because this laugh is uncertain. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris played truck driver from the street to see his truck, and there was a conflict in the first five minutes that Chuck wanted to take revenge for the rest of the film. Very good thing, 'The sub-par cuz acting by everyone involved starts getting very fast. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I can not really describe how he works, you have to test it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And the custom van Chuck Norris drives suddenly a classic!
