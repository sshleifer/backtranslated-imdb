I liked this movie when I was a teenager. Love it Although it is not big with me, though. Maybe it is because it is full of many letters of old garbage a mododramatic load, macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and letter 'Goddammit'. The strange story is one of the characters from one character, the other part of a plot that does not bring together each other, and it does not help the production of William Belvedin's mono-expression, which burns every film in the fire. Runtime overlong Robert De√±orro and Donald Sotherenland are valuable to visit, but none of them here is at the top of the game, and women especially get little encouragement. The only real impact comes from the impressive fire-fighting sequence and the royal score of Hans Geimmer, which is one of my all-time favorites.
