This picture is my worst movie list ever. The story has been cut off and it is difficult to understand what is going on or understand the cause of character actions. All movies must have an internal argument, and this film does not have any idea - the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> To watch Fai Duneway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quicke are going to terminate their talent in this movie, a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because he plays the victim and dies primarily in the film. On the other hand, Donald Switcherland must definitely be an extraordinary actor because he looks good despite bad directions and bad writing. Her performance is credible and she managed to remain character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie lived, she would laugh! Movie is bad
