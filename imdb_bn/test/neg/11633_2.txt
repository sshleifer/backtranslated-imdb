What a terrific sequel? Because I have given this image two stars instead of zero because it is a film that has violence and cow and creeters, but it is badly designed. And none other than this God-awful signal Boom-Boom-Bomple-Boom !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! Hellohade, who came to you with The Shining Remix, which almost got to Kubera almost rolling in his grave when he discovered that it was actually made. Garrett is also the person who brought you the fly, The Floy's tragic novel, which was an extraordinary movie, but Garrison's film almost destroyed John Gayetz's career. However, if you really want to see the crayfish critters trilogy, do not The mistake I made, the first one or the third or better rent, but do not stop at that level! This movie is so bad that I can not believe it, please avoid this bad word. Shame on you, Mick!
