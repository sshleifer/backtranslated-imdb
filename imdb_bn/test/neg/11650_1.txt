I'm sorry, but it really feels like a modern day Apollo 13 note off. Completely impossible (at least the Armedzon FELT like a comic book! It felt like a bad high school film project), could get the acting that could get, and ... a Space Shuttle landing at LA Freeway? Come on. Seriously Jerry, what do you think? And all the clichés: stalwart manager with pregnant astronaut's wife, nosy reporter who gets to everyone's way, "go fever". And the laws of physics or politics or creating an amusement story is the same thing, but at least it has to be done well! Truth and science are fully confiscated for this. The space shuttle does not contain its fuel tank and even if it does, it can not transfer fuel between them (and can not be DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you want bad acting, bad stories, less realism, and Chess clichés, this one can not be beat!
