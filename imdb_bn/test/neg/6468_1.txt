I am really damaged by anyone who can give this movie 10 (or even more than 2)! It's full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I thought I could see the bad acting worse than the badly played scene at the beginning of the UHF, but this was it. And when you think that it might not be a bad thing, do it! Repeatedly! Could you actually meet this in a theater? It was not worth the TV! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old loved it, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was never nearly.
