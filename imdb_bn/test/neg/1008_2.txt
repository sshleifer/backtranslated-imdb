This film can be a promotional film for the North American Philadelphia Party - or some similar parties ... strong people (Curse) keep themselves above the law (but not outside the law) and free the outstanding citizens by killing a disgraceful crash. The only thing that makes me think that it was not made by KK is that a Jew acted as a good guy ... When trying to think of this as the campaign film for the ultimate rightist group, try to see it again - and what you mean to me I would like to see ... <br /> <br /> This is a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually created music for this movie ... :(
