This is the worst movie in the world. The only reason I gave it a 2 because the first 10 minutes was violently funny "Is it real?" Sort of way. It was too sugar and low budget ... they were not even bothered. There was nudity and violence for the purity of nudity and violence, and the effects were so bad that you would not believe it (think of blood-like ketchup and cabbage for broken head). Do not hire this !!
