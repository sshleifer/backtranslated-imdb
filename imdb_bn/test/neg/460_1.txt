Alien was nice. Many authors try to copy it. They all work a bad (or almost). But the worst place in the dead space is Alien Copier. Due to bad actors, Bad Special Effects, BAD Scenery and Other Bad Things (This film will take about 3 pages to be bad. The film was not too long and it was a very good thing (the only one.) You can not laugh because of the very sunny ... this is a bad thing because in almost every B-series science-fi film you can laugh all the time. But seeing this stupidity, just watch the alien or event horizon ... these are a lot better !!! I can give it 1 out of 5.
