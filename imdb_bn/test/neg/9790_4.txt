This is a weird film. It is aimed at a young audience, but sexual sympathy is met. The whole house is rather notorious, it is not the concept of committing some of the inferior head of three dead children, but at the same time the kids take away from a group of difficult adults taking away from the gang, but still parents are missing the image and lack of authority to keep the kids line There are also. <br /> <br /> Although Cast is good, Meg Foster plays a very young mafia-like leader, as leader of the handsome AJ Dalato leaders. Airkey Egan and Rebecca Hartch have played well for young lovers, although for her talent for a comic actress, leg ally Baker is notoriously destroyed in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is unusual, but I do not think it's enough to work poorly and brutally brutally. All of the scenery rather dull and "special effects" are quite annoying. If not your mood, sit on this one.
