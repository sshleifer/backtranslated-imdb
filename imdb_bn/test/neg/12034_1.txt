I was not very happy to see this. This movie is a debauchery of her work. I agree with other commentators - this movie was a terrible disappointment. I want to give it a zero, but it is obliged to give it a paycheck. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and it reminded me of those days when I was trying to write a little girl, then look back at it and understand how horrible it is. Bad actors, family and friends, and it was enough to make the funds stupid how someone was making it. It's really amazing how strings can be drawn to get some work done. If this movie is able to make it to the general public, it expects a great deal on other indie filmmakers, whose rival is a talented talent! This movie smiles to me, but for all the wrong reasons. It was not important to be a comedy by all accounts. A good game on a horror section of scary movies - this movie just sucks.
