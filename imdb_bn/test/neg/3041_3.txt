It's so overly clich√©d you want to stop it after 45 minutes. Early is very interesting, a fair is going and someone dies. This movie got better, this setting has been set. <br /> <br /> So, depressing runners with Jill Johnson Lover Problems <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Funny house in a lonely lake. The kids are sleeping and cleaning the maid, another empty house next to their son who is in college. All right, <br /> Oh, terrible ones. Which comes to rescue his friend, come to 'love' and whatever comes with a few high school lines whateversoever. Go to the friends page and his car. Then, she drops her key. Uhh ... then the song! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. Of course, it does not start. How do you feel ..? So .. this invisible = De Jil, again alone. Oh. (Most of the movie is with her, so there are not many conversations), so more controversy, she calls the police. Who said that they can not help him, but if they have any problems then call back. <br /> <br /> She suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriend friends are calling. They have been but only once. Supposed to be so scary? Oh, what did I mention? His friend just came to caller id and some vague people came to the voice. She gets all freaked out and shyt. <br /> <br /> Yes, so avoid that. He is watching the light of the son of Madrakchi. So she performed through the woods with music as her companion and goes. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> AH so my boring can I continue !!!!!!!!!
