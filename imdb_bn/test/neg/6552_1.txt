This piece of garbage is located in the old palace basement of some molding where it will never see the light of day again. The only thing terrible about this junk was the entry price. I was only happy when the end credits started, and I was free to vacate the auditorium. What a unmitigated bore; 1 and one and a half hours is a complete waste. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and can burn harmful to write this pride.
