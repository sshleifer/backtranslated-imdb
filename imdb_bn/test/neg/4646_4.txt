Well, I read the first book and wondered: Wow, it would be great to see in a movie, I started looking for a movie that was already made ... I bought the DVD a week ago and bought this movie. It's a terrible mistake. First of all, this baby happy, who is not a book character, then funding was required between a mixture of two books ('River God' 'and' Seventh Scroll '), rather than Nicholas, although the book itself was also wrong in the whole issue of funding Hicks. Taeela thinks lightweight chariot. The whole thing about the grave is also very wrong .. It is supposed to be a channel where there is no vacuum - Suction around it. The grave itself was created in a mood if only an ancient Boa-game Know if the rules pass. Nicholas was English and Copty-Christian in the movie there was nothing in the movie, it was not a Muslim. This list was endless. The film was a bit better, Ryan, Nahud, Teeta, Boris, Mick and Tessa were well-selected, while others were only parodies of book characters, Rashera was the worst, while writing the book, it was not even close to the character of my head. So shameful that such a great reproduction has become so distorted that such a big book ... I am wondering why Wilbur Smith has given her permission for this.
