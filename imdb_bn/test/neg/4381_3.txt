"Hero and the Terrorism" is a fairly dull thriller - a La: no real character, substance, anticipated plot, and ... annoying. For a thriller I have found this movie to work up to its tired climax, because it can drag until the wife of Chuck's wife is born ... and then it will reach the end until it can reach the end - which I Can not remember I already saw this image 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I gave this image 3 out of 10 for the first 10-20 minutes.
