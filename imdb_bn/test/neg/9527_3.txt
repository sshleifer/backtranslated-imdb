The story, as I understand, is based on "real events." They can actually be good or bad, depending on what kind of licenses are taken with the actual events and how they are render. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to rob a maggot. I was not expecting too much - the expectation of the story of high school kids enriched by ocean cruise under a harsh Captain. Something about boot camps or basic training, like drill sergeant, is my responsibility to take you away from your civilian civilian way. Well, this is a way. Children begin as children and end up as an organic group. But it is much more popular than any boot-camp film outside of an intelligent comedy. Who snatched this thing? The air is not high school, but the third grade is filled with slogans. The dialog takes away the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridge generally works better than average but in this case its performance is medium. He did not bring anything extra to the part, although his line was given, but he knows how he can do a lot with them. The rest of the cast is undistinguished and the few of the kids are painfully inadequate. There is a lot of bursts, and enough crying. The best view involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> Immature clich√©s continued very end. Following the disaster, the Coast Guard was fired in the role of the harsh heart court during the hearing. The interrogators did not hit the bridge over the head with a misconception and misconception of the incident. "You drink alcohol, do not you?" (A coupleless harmful drink.) "And you punish them for killing them, even if you do not punish them." (Dolphin business.) The surrounding sinking technical details are scary left. What is a "white school" anyway? And if the bridge claims dangerous, why was not the whole staff wearing caution and life vests? But why go? If "albatross" was a dreddate, it would still be poded and compressed by humorous comic-book scripts.
