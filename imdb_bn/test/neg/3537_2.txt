I really liked Lance Henriquesen's Millennium series, for which I bought this picture. Clearly it was a mistake at some level. Mutant / giant movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Scary scenes seem more fun to me and craters are not always reliable. <br /> <br /> However, this movie makes friends with unstable moods, as it makes the film brighter, ridiculously ridiculous.
