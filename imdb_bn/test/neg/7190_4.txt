OK Everyone is so worried by this picture, I rarely have the courage to add a negative review but I did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie in Russian language first, so I'll miss some conversations, but not much. <br /> <br /> Beautiful things first. There are some lovely moments (eg Elvis impersonator). The actor is well described, also thinks the Russians. Efremova great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us downsides of this movie. First of all. There is no story and the end we already know: Yeltsin won. So no drama or mystery They tried to solve this problem with an emerging relationship among the above mentioned actors, but the story was evaporated. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians painted in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous. I am convinced that some of the spin-doctors of the state helped to help Yelling to win his campaign, but the real interesting questions should be solved: How do those who campaign, come back, how would the opposition be different? <br /> <br /> What we are going to do here is a movie, which is dependent on reality (but strangely that any film is historically relevant or only a very good political thriller Can be continued) without plots or offspring.
