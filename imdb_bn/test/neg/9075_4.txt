I chose this movie because I was looking for friendship with a girl and a triangle between two boys. I am in this situation and lost in it, hopefully the same story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concern is: - Why (a) and how (b) constitutes triangle? - Why (C) and how (D) degenerates the triangle? <br /> <br /> (a) The movie provides a simple answer: "That's good!" <br /> <br /> (b) Here, it is an open triangle: three divided things together. The mine was closed: Everyone knows others but three can not talk together or do not talk about lost: <br /> (c) Films do not explain spellings, but rather like visual and emotional guesses. : The intensity of the last, the sex is coming into the triangle, or more accurately, when for a member, deep feelings are intimidated, and can be divided into the next and the future. I agree with her. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and in my story, the silence proof is nothing good .. And in a tragic and painful way, the tool for this tragic time, always the phone: I spent this awesome designed phone call: Call me: I'm waiting for you "?? And the time comes, the phone is silent ??. A variation is shown when the line is attached but one does not refuse to speak ?? All these scenes were very hard to see for me. <br /> <br /> If the movie helps in a great way, it has got too many errors: <br /> <br /> - I've zapped on the family's problems <br /> - Why the DVD cover shower scene Movie is cut? <br /> <br /> - How did Mickle go to the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Clayet is always watching the salam? He said "no" but has his address; And who's with her in the bar: her girlfriend? How did he know about this address? <br /> <br /> - What has happened to Vincea finally: The final shot is the proof of engagement? with whom ?????
