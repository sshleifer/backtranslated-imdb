Bad, ambient sound Lots of shuffling Loooong pointless view. For example: Lok lobby looks attractive woman. To stay there and to arrange for building supervisors to wait for a package. Nothing says nothing. Slowly stares More shuffling and other irritating ambient words. wait. wait. wait. Guy said nothing. The woman looks scared or at least a little and it just bothered me. The manager comes back with the package. People go to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: The man and his host sitting on bad TV. More ambiguous words and shuffling Wait awaited wait Guy wanders from the bed. If you can stand up for more of this movie then you will see them again TV. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, no dialogue, entertainment, or a good fabulous film, look elsewhere.
