These miniseries / movies were so terrible that I almost broke and turned it off. I am a great fan of the novel, but this movie is mostly facing problems. Expensive, poor, and more emotionally charged scenes are mad. Departures from novels were selected weakly, significant misses have been missed or rewritten. <br /> <br />
