This is a pure caps and probably the worst biblical theme movie ... It's always wrong, I mean, they set up Sodom and Gomorrah before the massive flood. They described Lot as a friend of Noah, although he lived after Noah. To do something bad, after Lot became a pirate during the flood, Noah's ship invaded ??? ??? And what happens with a boss who comes along with a boat which is moved on the water with a bicycle process ??? And alcohol is alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is pictured as alcoholic! The spider, and the constant condemnation one after another, and it continues and ... the filmmaker and all the participants must surely secure the rows in front of hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please stay closed because of this cone You must save yourself three hours of life yourself.
