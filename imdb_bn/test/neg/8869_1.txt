I consider myself a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned on my chair. <br /> <br /> It is so bad that it can not be worse. Once upon a time I did not smile at this sadly impressive joke in this movie. I have seen and enjoyed a few parodies of big movies, but unfortunately, in my nightmares, I think it will be good for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a brief time to enter a coma, <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
