What a cast ... and what a waste it is. Gambhir, Jamie Fox, Thandi Newton, Stewart Townsend, Hall Hall, Melanie Griffith, and Sylvester Stallone will hopefully have some movie for you. The film is a big mess with an impossible story that does not seem to stop wrapping it and turning it into it. Yes, I think they thought they were really getting cleared with it. <br /> <br /> The story is not just dirty and unlikely, it is not entirely original. It uses elements from before and better poker game based movies. But to me it has turned into a lot of unmatched packaging and movies. This story made such an impossible one-hour. The script above is filled with many holes that are stupid poker game errors and things that just do not make a terrible amount of money. Why everyone wants to play against a card player who is known as the best cheater of the game. This film is about and made up to it but it did not make much sense to me. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast, yet it seems that most of the actors were miscast their role. I do not know what about Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor but he always comes out of all the roles he plays. Probably his appearance, I do not know. Basically he was replaced by "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". Thandi Newton is also very good in his 'strong' female role and is not really quite boring. And what did it mean to have Melanie Griffith? Oh, I think I could go to Casting about the film and I could complain about the limited time of the Jamie Fox character but I think you get my point now. <br /> <br /> Dynamo Nimen is not just a true writer / director and he does not manage his own material very well. The scenes are often confused, it tries to pamper everything about many characters and movies, and shallow and predictable Above this, the film sometimes incorporates some bad edits, which does not help to see this film as a great complete form. The movie was also a big box office bomb and it is no surprise that Damian Nimen did not make any film. <br /> <br /> You have a very big mess to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
