Thomas Winterberg's "D Stoste Hilt" is one of the most important elements in the movie: A Good Story Characters are very original and not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Borrowen's neck pain, he played a similar role in the last few years and he repeated in "Feston" - it seems like he is acting = angry and screaming on other people! The film does not make it very sensual and it's not too funny - although it makes a strong effort to "kike" and "strange". If you are going to create road movies then why not add something to the style?!
