Sincerely, I acknowledge that I am going and watching some stupid films based on the propaganda they created or made. This stupid Salman Khan and Govinda feature is one of those stupid movies. Okay, now we all saw 'Hit', starring Will Smith, who is acting as a date doctor to help a stranger find the truth. So why should we see Salman Khan again? There are $ 64,000 question lying. If you are astonished, then Govinda plays strange to the love of his life (incompetent socialite) directed by Katrina Kaif. <br /> <br /> Lara Dutt salwar with EVA Mendes and Saloon real-life love Kaif quite a lot like her role played like you've seen her so far, no stretch No acting needed And for about one and a half hours we have been tortured with the love of other Bollywood movies and characters, but we still treat the past hit movies with low performance performance.
