Buyer beware. Definition of alpha video release which uses a print defies. The film was shot in color but you do not know for the first 25 minutes. The print that is used is almost faded and reduced, which is usually displayed in sepia tones. After 30 minutes, some colors go back to the print but there comes color conclusions from there and go. Remember, even the color of it is pale and washed. It seems that the print has been recorded on television which is not best received. This is added to the travesty line that I can think of the most plodding delivery. Even narrating the voice over narrative is inducing. Each line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor. I want myself to find the words and words quickly. That's why I could not wait to finish this movie. This is one of the worst movies, but I'd like to see half a decent print.
