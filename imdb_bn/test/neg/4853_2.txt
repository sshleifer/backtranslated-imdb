This game comes from a series of games that try to stop the whole sweet-inspired trend - walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzle itself is absolutely awesome, but I feel like acting itself, which is only slightly good. If you are looking for a firm performance from any one character, you will not find it here, but only watch this Christopher Walken really delightful performance to watch this game's purchase price. His performance is so awesome in this game that it seems like he is imitating someone who is being replicated. <br /> <br /> <br /> Buy this game, if you are a Masters, Walken fan or just want to hear F-word.
