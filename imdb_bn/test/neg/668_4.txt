Okay, let's be realistic about this. Not directed to a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged a wrestling match), directed by a former pornographic director (he gave the world the world through the Chelsea Trials), played a wrestler, and hoped for some. Industrial slip on a golden plate. If you do that, you probably have to find something other than watching movies to spend time. <br /> <br /> So what do we expect from a movie? Well, what I'm looking for is here: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly existential, clich√©d storyline. 3) Cain is walking around a screenshade, indicating to his atheists that he ate a potato salad a month ago. 4) Tons of tons and cows. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're hungry for some "bad so funny" entertainment but it can satisfy your hunger because it distributes all the quantities. <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly viewed best for free, but if you do not choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and find it out in a game. Film makers are quite nice enough to introduce each of the annoying offenders by flashing legal laws on their name and screen. It's easy for you to write what you want to beat and see in any order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you and your friends write to you at every moment of stupidity and cruelty. The tile comes to their end and the most who comes. My grand total was 107; Can you beat that? I personally want to know how 35 years later and this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water, and a job lift? <br /> <br /> I know, filmmakers think that if you pay for it, you probably do not think much about what your money is worth to see, and so perhaps it does not think much about the movie, This does not mean that we can not indicate and laugh <br/> <br /> <br /> I also want to see how the city wants to visit this huge hotel (which is a doubtful inspector tax Rka recommendations will be taken to destroy the recommendations will be), and they think that the best way to get it is to clean mops and brooms to give a couple of eight-punks. Oh-oh <br /> <br /> I think you know a lot about what you expect, but I feel you need some precautions. First of all, if you hate the crowd interaction, then if you do not mind the movie then you want to stay away. The audience played like the people they had a real wrestling show. Picture of "Kill him, buy!" And "I hope you die first!" And "Choksalam!" Echoed by the theater, I hope what America offers is not the best. I do not usually appreciate this audience interaction, but for this cheesefest like this I added commentary to the entertainment price. However, I can see how others might bother it. <br /> <br /> Second, and this explanation is not to be given, the film does not move away from Gore. If a big ugly dude rip the eyeballs watching out on their socket right "do not shout fun at the movie!" Because of this you know better and better for saving your poultry. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am surprised by the lack of dialogue in the part of the Ken area. I was not expecting him to be in the acting clinic, but I hope he gets some interesting little cafferes like "Goodnight" (his character's last name "Goodnight") just before killing a hunter. Instead he pronounced four words in the whole picture - "Nooooooo!" And "I see it." But hey, he gave them peace! <br /> <br /> If I was a bad guy in the movie then my cafferess would be like "Sit down your bit!" Or "all bits are off!" <br /> <br /> it will rule and you know it. We need a new genre for a big horror film, such as C do NO Evil, which makes you so much weird smile that you want to make almost their comedic label. Feel free to send me your suggestion. Now we just say, that's so weird!
