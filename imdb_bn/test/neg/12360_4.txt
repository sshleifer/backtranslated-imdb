The opinion of limited scenery was otherwise the mercy of the unintended and annoying movie only saving. The acting was unlimited, which I blame on scripts and plaques. Nicole Eggert did not see parts, parts did not work, and was completely unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching this, I felt that some friends were taking some time and decided to make a movie. It must be produced in the pocket change budget. The plot was the least thin and the acting was questioned with less efficiency, "Why are we doing this?". I could sit through the whole movie but I asked myself why?
