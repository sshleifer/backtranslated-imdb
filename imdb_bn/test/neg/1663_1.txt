Some bratish children express an annoyance with unnecessary chaos that have been successful for the past twenty years and have to overcome the weak fortune that comes with them. Before the "Midnight Skater", the Campbell Brothers movie was fun and "Red Kools" was all right, so why is "Demo summer" so bad? I do not know, then they are better than "Splater Repease Wrestling" The basement level of acting is not worthy of crunching, and when a 'horror' movie speaks like this, it is not a good thing. The story is a great movie. Eche, then why not waste your time? <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
