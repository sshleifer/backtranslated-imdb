I was only presenting a preview screen of this photo. It was not a great piece of documentary film production. Absolutely absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of level level critique of any kind with Miss Faye. Closing and sad, the only release of the film's liberation qualities was to make some types of statements using an effort of the pupils (though a failed). But the closing credits ended the rolling experience. The audience rose and praised. Like the moth fire, 21st-century Americans still remain in fractures. The story of the misleading giant is rather tired.
