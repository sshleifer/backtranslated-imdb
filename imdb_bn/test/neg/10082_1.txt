Anyone who likes previous JP movies can sit through this 1 hour drill? This photo is so stupid thing that it's so bad! I remember when I was going to see Jepike as a child, it was my favorite film and franchise, acting, SFX music, direction! All the fantastic, my opinion JP2 was quite a lot of stupid moments (such as a raptor stick ass sticks girl ...) but without a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience completely. <br /> <br /> But there is no point in the third! It is supposed to be a sequel of career from JP2 and it has included brand new things in the franchise, which was impossible to miss in the previous two movies! For example: 1) "New" Mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell !! Wherever they go, they follow this thing, they can not escape from its presence, and you still see it in a lost world (the same island)? Have you heard it Does anyone accept it? No! It's funny !. The previous 2 films had a star character and could always be T-Rex, so D (urr) director "Joe Johnston" went and did what? Kill it off! As soon as you see the huge T-Rex, all of its glorious glorious glory dies and you will not see it again - a new Dino excuse in the city .. where it comes from !! ?? Not a single explanation! And do not allow me to start the whole satellite-phone-in-daemon-stomach stuff! 2) How do you start to become stupid when you see Sp√°nnaras Raptors, as well as they seem to be very credible with their new "Punk" Herculean! * Paura * Can you see this movie? ... wrong! Now they talk to each other !! And their excuses to talk about this movie and not the first and second ... wait for ... evolution! - Yes, the process is over for millions of years after the second movie ends! They should raised the controversial thumb and make the tools by now !! All right, I'm not going to say anything about the plot because it's getting me nose, so I'll close it: Jurassic Park is a classic, a hungry sucker punch for real fans of the JP series, my favorite franchise watching this monstrosity (no pun intended) After this film like the plague was good and really dead
