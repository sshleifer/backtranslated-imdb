Larry directs the bishop, writes, and this soft-core porn, nothing less bicker movie about nothing to do. In a trash I spent in the theater while calling one of the worst movies of 2008 One of the worst movies I've ever seen is I feel sad for most girls, who probably think that they are making a feature movie, when all the reality they are making a porno. They walk for four days, saying that old men are annoying sex lines - thirty years younger than them - then take off their clothes and wander naked for four days. I can only assume that Larry Bishops was the only way to get laid. You see the shots on the shot after a girl ass directly on it. After the diocese shot up to some random chick and grabbing his most intimate part, as he is shaking his hand. Even this money was even funding to surpass me. Tenantino has more names than him, but since 1994 he has been gradually fading, so I can not say that I was astonished. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, you feel terrible that only terrible (and I mean terrible) movies give you. When you see it in the theater, your pain is felt. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry for being so stupid, not only my time, but my hard work was ten dollars. A moment of release or a moment of movie does not produce any reactions or no tendency to show that they had no idea what these people are doing. If you do not often see nude women, I think this movie will be for you. If you are 11 years old, you probably like it. You can not even smile at it, because it was being made as a result of making every fool. The acting is horror, the writing is horrific, the production is horrific, and the directions are awful. It is not worth the time to look at car crashes. Stay away, stay away too. You will not even read this review. I do not even have to write one.
