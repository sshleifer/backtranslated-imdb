You could see the final results a mile away. All the signs were ... prom, alcohol, quick ride, women's distraction .... use of seatbelt, and later a good commercial for model vehicles that give the passenger back from the windshield. Also, the end is rather a cause of climate change, the Ford Econoline van is in high speed (extremely unlikely) after a strike in the bridge and suffers within a crease across its nose. The damage to the van will make it a bit more credible. And why these films are always performed after / after a prom? It's a case once you live prom, would you be good for life? From anything else, it lacks the lack of police lack of promotion for liquor and does not have tabs in miners, who leave the dance for fun.
