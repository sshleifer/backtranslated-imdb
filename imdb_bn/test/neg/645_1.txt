The first thing that hit me about this movie was terrible. Through the horror of the film, I started to laugh that the whole cast was so monotonous to supply their lines all the lines. Another big problem with this movie is that we do not encourage the actions of any character at any time. The innovative visual effects of Hafdan Hasy are some of the diminishing aspects of the film. However, as interesting as they may be, they are not slightly for the harmful errors mentioned above. Acting in an awesome script with the acting of community theater level is not a great place to look for. I was honestly amazed at how bad this picture was.
