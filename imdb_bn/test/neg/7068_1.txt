This movie has no heart and no soul; It's an effort to hypocritize a ritual movie, out of the other, well, director, chiefly David Linch and Team Burton's leavings. Riffin thinks that if he overloads an impressive visual style and is admitted to the street with roads and rubbish, he is giving a statement. But there is no statement about this - except for the director's sharp roots, "Hey look at me! I am an artist." But not an artist's imagination, it's just a good memory for those that work - like the managers are stuck in - for other managers. This film will be almost acceptable if the film can not sit through radioactivity, annoying sabotage.
