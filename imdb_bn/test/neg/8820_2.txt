After listening to so much praise from other fans, it's always interesting to watch a horror movie. Experience I have been taught that you should not generalize the taste of the fan in any manner. My expectations of this movie were much more than my opinion. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not have to be played with children's bodies, a well-planned plot that travels many times to carry it. The whole idea of ​​the rebuilding band of the dead body intrigued me. However, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. The role of the actor, who was most capable and surprisingly publicist, did not succeed in maintaining continuous characterization. Some of these characters defiling a cemetery, obviously from criticism, back to ambivalence about the whole act of ambivalence. This is one thing for the changing heart of the film; This is one of the dynamic, circular attitudes that loot in every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another incompatible element of this movie is evidence. Is the main playwright of drama dramatic dramatic or is it really associated with dark spiritual power to raise the dead? Even with the previous flaws, I would suggest this movie to other awesome fans, because I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate dark atmosphere and can ignore plot inconsistencies. The scene of the dead from the grave creates a great hunting (even an experienced zombie enthusiast) by seeing the wonderful combination of the word and the excellent combination of the word and even the finest actors chosen for the rebuilding dead game. Current filmmakers have to learn about using proper video and audio techniques in Mood development from CSPWD. <br /> <br /> If you are finished with a Zumbi movie like me, then you have to take the time to look and watch this movie. This is a fun watch.
