I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Sunny before Chan. RH3 However, the first two had a re-hash without a charm or humor. I think I could smile once - and it was during the NGS. The money was very annoying in the film, and its character is not the most annoying way to do anything other than the Bay of Bengal. Chan is always desired, but he takes tired of this picture. I was able to predict everything - who was the villain, who was the woman, (the Spellar Alert) who was a good man, a bad man, etc. I hope to try different films from Taka and Chan. , But no rush hour sequels do. It's very tired. I recommend a rental, but do not buy one.
