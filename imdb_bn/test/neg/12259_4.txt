Being a fan of Jasu Pitt comedyies, I feel like worth the effort to try it. I was very frustrated. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was in TCM, but was included in the Niagara Fruit film; Miss Polly was missing the film.) The talent of actors, who give good performance, <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me as the strongest actor in Shower, but the Split Lite is thin Samarville (Sam Saiyar), who has no talent, he shows it here Person. <br /> <br /> Jasu Pitts (Eli Swar) is great, but not enough. The biggest smile in the film is when he is finished under Sam under the table, Margie (Margery Woodworth) is generally unreasonable. Although he is quite physically attractive, his personality and attitude makes him completely inevitable. Eli, Sam, and Hotel Desk Clark are just fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Eli leave their honeymoon suit in Tom and Margheri's bustling hotel. But then they take back Sam end up Tom and Margie's prison in their room. Most movies try to break them, but Sam, using a rifle, always returns them back. <br /> <br /> The worst part is in the end. Tom, who has finally been good for his escape, went to the minister's post under the hotel. Now the man, since I said, the only person in the whole movie who has put his shoulders on his shoulders, suddenly Marriage should be married to any reason! <br /> <br /> <br /> He was carrying the minister from the house, but Marzi does not want to marry her. She kissed him, and now, after a kiss, he feels obliged to marry her. Finally, Sam has the pain of saying to Tom, "You deceived me", when in fact the only line Tom said to Sam before, "We are not married", Sam replies, "Do you think I believe Will?" <br /> <br /> <br />
