How to get this Film Berlin Film Festival? I understand it got in the panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This picture is displayed: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot 2. Awesome acting 3. Bad Videoography. 4. Sometimes the worst graffiti caught in the video. <br /> <br /> The presence of a clinic for most of its festivals is the old standby: presence. It is true that what happened in this film only makes a graph artist with others and closes it. Then she feels curious about it and they have an annoying old "breaking up" conversation that you can expect to hear from the first crush of your first crush ("You Kiss Me, Dood.") In school. Oh, and anyway, this cry is not a game ... you saw the gay angle in the first ten minutes of the film. As well as it is mostly simply bad tag, badly decorated "secret" police, some skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in this matter, then I recommend searching the web for some underground graph videos taken by real graffiti artists. There's plenty ... and they're a hell of a lot more entertaining than this shit.
