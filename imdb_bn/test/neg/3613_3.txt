I will not vote for this movie as a terrible one, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days that I was going to do something and decided that the stupid section of the video would rent a movie. Besides, I was not asleep before and the movie awakened me ... Let's start the autopsy, okay, the movie is a strange plot, the first is different, an expedition happens, they are isolated on an island because there is no gas in the boat, There is nothing like this, the actor's parts (so far) do not have a strong performance, the main problem is the idea of ​​isolation, the PV of the surveys, and then the other begins to ... After another, then the snake changes that, then lying spooks, a lot of them, and when we believe that the film is going on a better way to flock it, keep it secret, fails, because ten or eleven spooks after we carried away, one view The scene that is unknown, when we saw the drunken lesbian show we saw by snakes that seemed to dance, it was not a terrible adventure, but a comedy driven film Thache, adventure also was canceled. <br /> <br /> The third thing to do in a movie for me, this is a section that drives the movie to conclusively guess it already, or if it is successful, we do not notice it, as we have a good smoke in our eyes .... Snake Island has become a bad conclusion, it is through a book «real» end, with a conflict, persecution and escape sequence, I pay a copy of the dam copy at the moment. Was rbabhasayogya. The other real problem is the concept, the idea is very important, because of this you believe that dinosaurs are coming to life or just want to live a life that wants to live a life, the basic idea of ​​the snakes that people want to take revenge after decades of torture is good, good ... Hmm, there is no glaze in the wall. One thing that you enjoy (if you see it with an open mind) more electricity signage, nude lesbian girls, some amateur camera angle, innocence with grass cutting, black parents do not die first, and all ... if you snakes, black Grandpa and comedy want to see and you go to big budget and «see a snake on a plane» <br /> <br /> <br />
