This is an incident for me that you never understand if you did not take it. So why should I have to know this infinite rage .. <br /> <br /> I have heard a lot (Bruce Lee) .. My father loved him .. My mother loves someone who hates any small harmful enemy! And how he has talked about his experience with "The Big Boss" Urdu "Lung Boxing" and all the great successes of Egyptian films in 1973. Still, I saw a really good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) so I saw myself crying: Where is your movie Bruce? <br /> <br /> I went to the video store ... and it was a mobile phone .. (You know why!) .. And wow .. I have found a lot of Bruce Lee movies .. I have chosen a single name ( Bruce Lee in New Guinea <br /> <br /> I did it with myself and saw it. Oh God, please forgive your servant. I have hurt myself but with no decision ... I will not do it if I I knew harmful evil! ! The legendary level of its mysteriousness !! <br /> <br /> Still, I did not understand how big a big case happened as a wonderful star in Bruce Lee .. ..why would anyone be here or he thinks he's here .. I saw it!) that gifted And that's the genius and of course that's not sexy ??? <br /> <br /> As long as my dad's star saw this and he asked me to stop him from a closing and after a while he examined him .. He told me very firmly, "It is not Bruce Lee!" So I was very confused and asked: Whatever this stupid guy is ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001. After 2 years of the first entrance of the IMDB database .. So I came to know that person immediately .. And I discovered the truth .. He is Bruce Lee .. not my dear friend .. He is Bruce Lee !!! <br /> <br /> Such a big difference !! I just want to know that he loves the bad clone? Or does God forbid .. love his iconic movies .. I saw two of them and did not finish the third! After <br /> I ignored all of our video stores because it's cheap trick (posters that write this Bruce Lee! ??) and I got the original .. One and only Bruce is really such a big big The star and the oh boy, who certainly had immortality ... and less.
