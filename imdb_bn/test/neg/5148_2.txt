***** ago Spoller ***** <br /> <br /> I hope you do not expect much of the TV movie, but it was particularly bad, the plot was a good idea, but it's a bad idea Acting was not particularly good. And the end of the film was just terrible. The main character was completely natural through the film, and then suddenly we came to know that she was a murderer, she became a psychopathic psychopath. It is completely pained. <br /> <br /> This is really the only reason to see this picture, Yasmin Blyth, though we all did not see him before swimming? If you want a movie about the beauty contest world, do not disturb the waste even when you look, then instead of "drop dead gorgeous" look, it's only a great number of good.
