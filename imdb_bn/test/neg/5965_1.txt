This movie is a complete and stupid waste, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And coming from me, that's definitely saying something. In fact, I could have given it negative negative if desired, rather it would have been a terrible rating as a sad star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I think Chupacabra's legend is interesting and I have read in a love for Chess Horror Flix. But I draw this line. <br /> <br /> acting sucked The lead male delivers a sound written in her worst performance, as she sounds irrelevant and feeling the sound. The lead female gives a slightly more brilliant performance, but it does not really take much. <br /> <br /> Chupkabar ... Well, considering the low budget this film was, the animal was tolerant. It is, though, to see someone just like a mask and body suit. The mask can be fairly detailed and cooler than the person but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Not saying on screen, I think they could use at least a good camera. It seems to be shot with a camcorder to scream loudly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , The conversation sucks and just ... I can not describe what it feels about. At least not having trouble with the site <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's not worth its value. If it comes on TV and you do not have anything to do or see, * Find * to do or to do something else. Read a book, listen to music, * something. * Not only do this subject yourself. If you do, you can not say that you have not been warned. And for the Lord and the Lady, do not hire this sucker. If you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents, it is not worth it. Trust me, I know.
