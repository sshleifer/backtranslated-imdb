I did not plan to see the O12 because I did not like him much. I think the O11 is a beautiful but little annoying small bank robbery movie stars with an exciting operation. Anyway I was talking in O12 one night watching and I regretted it a lot. The plot is not only annoying but intelligent. I honestly did not even know about it all. I kept the movie after 3 quarters and got coffee with other girls who do not like it. I can tell you that much more pleasure. But the people who lived to the end also told me that this plot was horrific and vain. My suggestion: do not watch. See Team America (Sunny btw ;-)) and forget about the ocean twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most annoying and stupid peace of the year is on the screen.
