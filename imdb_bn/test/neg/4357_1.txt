KiloZo 2 The first movie exceeds only a small amount. The staffs here that grew up were acting, kilzo makeup and stories. This is a big festival, it does not have supernatural elements for the first time. In this installment, Kilzo kills his victims more naturally, burns them in the fire, and does not shoot with bullets in his mouth. I just do not like this thing, the last was a little half-ass, in fact it was half an ass, they killed Killjoy very cheaply. I would strongly recommend this to those who love horror movies. Sincerely, the first movie was good, but the second is good. 10.
