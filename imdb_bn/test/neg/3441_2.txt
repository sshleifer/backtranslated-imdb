These authors are trying to recreate the characters in their "scrawl" in different professions, but their stereotypical characters seem to be weak and accessible to the ability to refrain from mentioning any charisma or writing. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if writing is not so hateful that only lively is going to be two fascinating teachers who just keep it alive. Humor in this show seems to be trying to target viewers with an IQ. 40 or below. Another reason why this show is failing is that the text of the "Scrub" show is nice and this shot should follow so that the audience goes to the strange location, can not cry or lose hope in the new sitcom. All together It's just my opinion but I think these guys will stop now before they humiliate themselves.
