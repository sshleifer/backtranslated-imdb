I know everyone speaks about this movie and I agree with them. I spent a few years after saying it to other people. I suggest they see it. But after coming to TV we saw the ad. I became a family and said: "I know it's tragic, but I'm thinking of seeing it". My sister turned to me and said: "Yes, I too." And you know what? It was fun. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. It's absolutely a waste of time. But it's a good waste time. You might still feel it fiddling and fair enough, but I thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy. I did not like a few bits, as the fish got hit by someone, but still I think it was good. I sat there and liked all the famous Australian faces: Flacqua, El Maqfest, Gary McDonald, etc. <br /> So, if you want to waste your time, check out this movie. Otherwise, see a play or something.
