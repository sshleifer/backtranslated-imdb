I literally ran to see it, hoping for a film that would make me cry, or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not impressive, but the hair absorption of a strong human character. <Br <br/> <br /> â€¢ Combine a pair of young lesbians and thick ones. <br /> <br /> is a setting which is not loud in most cases, but does not mention the most common acting. <br /> <br /> It was not bad at all, because I saw the worst - and I made the movie more than 10 dollars poorer, but I realized - that a good advertising ad is not like a film.
