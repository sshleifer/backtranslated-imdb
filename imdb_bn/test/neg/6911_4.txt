It seems that there is a completely inexpensive, tired old-fashioned "joke" that says the same old words about middle-class couples. Sort like friends, but with more soft porn and no intelligence. This picture is not an exception - it was in such a situation that I had died from day ja vi. People were parroting, crying about sexual relations and relationships? Check out. Which men and women are cheating versus mangagami that will never double to any other women / men? Check out. PODONA BADDIS !!!! 111? Check out. Are some people / girls that may be the only reason that you see this garbage? Check out. The text seems to be that when there is a doubt, a tired old sex about people creates "jokes", some do not think of anyone to give some statements, so everyone has heard three thousand times before. That will be made in your film. It'll even attract some sitcom to someone in a bad wig!
