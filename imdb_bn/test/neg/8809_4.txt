Hey It's a popcorn movie, something more. I saw it with a bunch of friends (and although it may not be the best way to watch an awesome movie ...) and most conversations and actions were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I wanted to have a real film. <br /> <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of film excitement. It keeps rehearsing in the 'interpretation' scene, which distorts a visual tension. <br /> <br /> and the character relationship 'Twist'? Yes, they suck. They will not say what I say, but they just do not add anything to the film / story. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I want to say two main characters.) <br /> <br />> Eek My recommendation is: If you do not think anything good then check out this movie. The best of mediocre ... maybe even that.
