This movie is called the evil bikes gang, called Chavez, so titles, but the small nuances were a good name for the poor actors' poor looks. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they anxiously carried their bikes up very slowly so that their intended victims could easily avoid them or close their bikes. Their leader was a bad limp, but still he could take the hero and win. For Karen Black, she did not think where she was for most films.
