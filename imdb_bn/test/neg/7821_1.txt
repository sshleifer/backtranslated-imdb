This film is suitable for any desired screen writer, actor or director. Through this movie you will see what is wrong with the movie industry today. I got a lot of trouble for sitting in this movie. Nothing about it is real and in every 90 lines we've been told that the clichad films have been knocked out. Although it has some cheaper laughs, overall it is wrong mistake. I was so bored and the movie was so hopeless and unfortunate that I actually saw how many make-up cakes were made on the face of his tech read, and he kept hiding that huge bag and fork from his constant partnership. Seriously, he was wearing so much foundation, you can literally cut it off and refill its whole bottle. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this brilliant and popular cast will sign in for this piece of junk. And I do not know that I'm sitting with the horrific screams, Ashton Kutcher, you know when he feels angry or something, and he shouts in this annoying way. Ashton's terrible "talk", his face is ten darker than his neck, an impressive uproot, a script that looks like a three-year old job ... <br /> <br /> There is no serious film about my whole life What I saw was that I could not enjoy in any way what was bad. This is the first being a prize given. Buddy Buddy ... I do not think there is a single word in the English dictionary that could possibly describe this trashy movie. Today I was trying to meet again but for ten minutes I had to stop it because I was going to cry from a lot of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Do not get bothered to rent it. Your blockbuster, it's not worth a cent, I actually want to pay attention to this movie, so that they can do something good with their life.
