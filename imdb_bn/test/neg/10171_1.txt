Like much of my opinion above, I was though it was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I sponsored it, rather, and indeed, promoted. Is available <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not on CC, as I'll explain in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie represents less or a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of the discussion is usually two or three men standing next to each other, usually speaking in the middle. In the worst case, another group represents one person. <br /> <br /> Journalists' interviews are very artificial, sometimes even unusual. For example, sometimes the discussions are among journalists (I mean, from a point of interview, 'awards'). Moreover, the people of the interview are always calm, they say everything except natural emotions. That is, they can not say that they are neither mad nor crazy. They almost do not show anything. <br /> <br /> It is very unusual, 'Christian journalists' always believe what they are told by interviewers. <br /> <br /> The following line is: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Information <br /> <br /> - Pro / Con Consumer <br /> < br /> There is no lie. Someone is liar (The next sentence is an incognito, ignore if you still plan to watch the movie) It is only false that it is being said that 'bad' is non-believable. <br /> <br /> This convinces me that the film is a B movie This is similar to 'Plan 9 Out of Space' (over 50), but this movie contains annoying, false set discussions about the Alien and Christian beliefs. Note: I do not intend to insult Christians, who believe in aliens or anyone else. I have a feeling about this movie, not about humans. <br /> <br /> I also want to think that I do not know whether the actor is bad or just given the scary script.
