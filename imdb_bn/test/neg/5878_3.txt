Technically speaking, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it's fun. It's deliberately funny I do not know. Every aspect is terrible, this is also the only movie I know: 1) Acting by a thin actor in a fat baby (very obvious) fatty suit, 2) An impressive 30-actress is acting like a character who is supposed to be in the late 60's. , And 3) Most congratulations for plastic yard Daisies. Do not take this picture seriously, just laugh and see ... a great party movie.
