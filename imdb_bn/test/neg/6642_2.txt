There are many mysteries of life. For example: why anybody at the top of the cow agreed to attend the film? Why is anyone distributing this movie? Why did not anyone pay to see it? I think this question will not be answered, but one thing I'm sure is that this movie is the worst one of all times with this budget. It may already be bad, but the connection to the "tops" of the carrot top makes it worse. Perhaps the only entertainment available from this movie is to burn it, destroy it, or otherwise destroy it in a fun fashion. If you want to rank it against each movie you create it, it will be right between "Problem Child" and "Biodoome". Naph said.
