Here is my first comment on a movie here. I want to tell the bad movies I have seen, with branded, for example, it really works! I promise. Do not even look at it. It's annoying, bad acting, bad script and plot, a big fragment of the whole movie of bad influences! If I could give 0 out of 10 stars, since the lowest is 1, so I have to vote. But I would say the movie is worse than terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not hurt yourself by watching this movie and hoping it will be better because I can tell you earlier, it is not! I hope that a single view will come out that will be valuable to look at. No good scenes came out. <br /> <br /> What a nice piece. <br /> <br /> And like the Coolie vampire? Ha ha ha! LMAO's! YARG!
