I like to like movies, but I did not find anything to like about the box. I was interested in the 'hook' of the plot, but unfortunately it has never gone anywhere and it was impossible to follow. Anyone who understands this movie is probably fixing it so that they think that they are a part, good news for them, there is no emperor cloth. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is that to blame the woman for the real sin and to pollute mankind. I have heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. It is true that this movie is different from many of the theaters currently in theaters, but it is not worth the ticket price.
