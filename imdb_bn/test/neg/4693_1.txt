Firstly, the IFC runs the city and the country, and now it is. The difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip was that city and country were watchable. Not at all. <br /> <br /> I can only sign up for the idea that they can go to another dime in Europe. Belushi is especially irritating. His scenes with Candy (Delaying a Z-grade dom) were tortured. Talking of torture, five minutes of shameless feathers, and I'll crack the prisoners' garment in Gittme! <br /> <br /> The original "crime" (in addition to this green light) character of the Shepherd: A Mousi is going to take Monte Carlo Casino for half a million! If you buy that, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested!
