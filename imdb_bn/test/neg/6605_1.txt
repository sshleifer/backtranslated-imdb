Yes, this is true. That's an awesome piece of movie ... you know. Almost all fans of Poland's Saposcci book feel the same. The fact that Polish cinematography fantasy can not afford to produce movies. For example, when you compare "Wizdom" and "Canaan Barbarian", it's a shame. Hope no one can see this nightmare outside of Poland.
