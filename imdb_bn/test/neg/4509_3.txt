I know a girl is impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But almost everything has changed almost because of this picture. In addition, many changes have made the story unreasonable. Some examples: 1) Before the movie "Paul Reynold" really died in the film, Pirot (the pirot book only receives a letter), telling him that he is afraid of being dead. This is totally stupid because Pireot knew that the dead person was not Renaudal when the Reynolds plan was successful. (Piraat was in the morgue when Mrs. Renawald identified the victim). 2) This movie has been "bundled" with two! The film "Cinderella" has been deleted. Girl Hastings falls in love and Jack Reynold's former girlfriend is a person in the film! Why is God? 3) Hastings finds the victims because they are such a bad golf player. Completely unfunny and stupid. 4) The film hides very quickly (for example, at the very beginning). So you never know you did not know 5) The murderer fired at the end by a person. Perhaps the person ("Cinderella") can stop the murderer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complicated. The movie takes only 90 minutes. Be sure to include all the necessary details, but if you include stupid things that are not in the book and are not nonsense (eg bike race).
