Sorry, but I usually love the French thriller - eg Chabrol - but this was a shiny shambolic mess. Based on Harlan Cohen's book, it has been said that instead of being French film (strong on psychology and character), it is like John Grisham-Esquire roller-coaster ride, which is even more by the number of ferrous plots twists, flashbacks update the previous flashbacks Make, a prospective villain (as soon as his name has been mentioned that you 'hmm, t Not to be the bad guy!) And think that living in the movie mysterious character sets stiriooteda update. Eventually, I thought about the vowel's inequality in the film (the scenes where two characteristic films are being helped by the strange strangers), completely annoying plot, unreasonable phenomena and good luck strokes (such as the password for an email account assumed) and awakening uncontrollably (I thought it was 1 hour The 50 minute running time wrongly seems to be 3 hours 50 Can drag for a minute).
