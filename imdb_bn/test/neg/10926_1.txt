One of the commentators on Lil 'Pimple (Glen Kov's Doublog), when he said that the movie was really bad, but I objected when I commented on an animation. <br /> <br> Animation was not bad due to macromedia flash. It was misguided because it was bad animation. Flash is just a tool. In the right hand, an artist can create animations as a Disney movie full and fluid and in the wrong hands, it may seem as bad as the Internet stuff, where lil 'pumps are produced and must be there <br/> <br /> Cartoon Studios like Network, NicoleDodon, Disney, and Warner Bros. create amazing animations using Flash (i.e., Puffy Ami Umi, Fantastic Foster's home for friends, wiped up, etc.). <<br /> <br /> Lil 'Pump Trip had a poor idea that was made because revolutionary studios bought media tripp and lil' pumps. Roth and company believed that they exploited a Turk like a lil 'pimper and were involved by its producer Emmiel Pel√©. This third quarter's miscarriage of animated film is the reason that there was a practical brain for using Marx Brooks and Peter Gilprepe (they did their best but did not have them on their heads) in a revolution studio studio and the original writers, directors, and at least a semi-capable producer. They did one thing correctly even though they had rented some of the best storyboards, designers and animators of LA, but Lil Pump showed that anyone can buy the best sports car of the floor, but if you are mortal, it will be destroyed to make sure.
