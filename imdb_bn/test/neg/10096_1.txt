The worst movie ever seen. Very bad acting. I can not imagine this movie bad then. There is nothing to see. There is no acting. Hey (actor) should look for another profession. I do not understand how stupid it was to actually make money in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Erie Roberts. It should be difficult ... I can not imagine how his mortgage must be justified by taking a job! <br /> <br /> The female of the movie ... Perhaps they love XXX more. <br /> <br /> As a leading man ... what a lead! She will be a good lead and stay there! Instead of acting I can see him being more successful. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: No rental ... do not buy!
