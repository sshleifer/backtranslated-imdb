Barbara Petton is a luxury studio set up in a cheap studio in Hollywood, back to the jungle, in many places, the owner of a tropical summer tropical sexy young hot chickie feels. Raymond Burr is in the desire to blow jointly with Mrs. Petton as fierce chunky plants foreman to wear her work shirt with the top button. There is another girl, some farmers have enslaved things that the old man had fooled almost but he gave her an old heir, so the mandatory Skaeti made a good spell in the old Vu-Do Hagg and her entry into the Petton Tramp. I saw this only part because it was really awkward, so did not see the star of the show --- which I guess is a gorilla which is a cowboy or whatever ..... Care. I give this half-star out of a possible ten. It's not even the camps, just really bad.
