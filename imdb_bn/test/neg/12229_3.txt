A comedy hired by inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks, a lucky coach, tells the story of Lambough Fields, who led the college muffitts to a rug-tag climb to football championships. In process, this longtime man finds out that he frees himself, preserves his relationship with family and friends, and in fact it does not find any "I" in the "team"! <br /> I decided to watch the unnecessary version for this movie. It was more than thirty minutes and I could have been better than the release of the theater, I heard people hate this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. Well, I was wrong. It's worse as the recent "meet with Spartans" but it's more than thirty minutes of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes two-hour camouflage movie?! It's no longer short because of a stupid movie, it will overkill! Really, I love stupid comedy. Hack, I like "Date Movie," "White Chicks," "Epic Movie," and "Little Man"! I think when it comes to incognito movies, it hits or misses and it's definitely missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say six or seven of the many jokes in this picture, smile to me, even Something that laughs loudly to me. But that's not saying much. After this joke, there were more scenes of torture and cruelty. <br /> <br /> I can not say how people will say that this is not a terrible mistake. In fact, there are many more product placements to meet with Spartans, there are many dancing sequences and there are unreasonable jokes. I would say another thing I liked the song about this movie. They are some very good songs here. Overall, if you like the spoof movie then check it out. If you like funny films leave it.
