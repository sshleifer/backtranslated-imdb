I liked Milos Forman's films because I saw "One Flu Over the Kaku Nest" and "Amadeus" (two major works), but when I saw "hair", I was surprised to see if this was the same mills formulation. This movie is boring and least reluctant to say. Well, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it seems like a bunch of people just dancing (wait a minute ... it's really!). In fact, the only part is the only part of Mills's talent, the last 15 minutes or so, (Spiller !!), since Burger took the place of the wagon as a soldier for the Vietnam War. That's 15 minutes running and well known, but it's embarrassing that we have to endure so much awful stuff before. Well, it's probably a movie that you have to be "subject" to enjoy (subjects marijuana, acids and other drugs to glory). I'm not so, so ...
