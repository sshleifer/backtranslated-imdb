I really do not know why so many people love this movie: perhaps it's funny, okay, but this one of the best novels of all time has been completely destroyed. The author himself said that this movie betrayed the book: The story does not fierce in 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexities, everything is lost in the 80's fashion fantasy / adventure film for kids. Today we have new attention in influences, directors and books: I hope someone (Team Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayo Miyazaki ...) will never run a true Nevdering story. A great dead writer, an excellent book and many literary lovers deserve it.
