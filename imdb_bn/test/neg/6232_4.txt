Many past movies like, you think Hollywood can now learn it, not for a significant disappointment film, it is not to mention that the abducted person was first alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie wants to remind us of basic facts if it ever happens to us. Why can walking long and go through wood without really missing a city guy? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, (Sneakers for one), surprisingly, he agreed to star in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie was visible, could not wait for spring.
