This cheap and garbage film is a NASA test rocket which is sent into space with animals in a cargo. It comes back to an unexpected, crash landing in a forest, unleashing a harmful mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many films of this type, like Knight Frat, fools have been sacrificing features of boogieing down 60's surf music before teens. However, none of the murders is even remotely memorable, because we can not really see anything. What we see is that a group seems to be about 40 years old and it's a pretty impressive cute hairstyle. <br /> <br /> To make an animal feature work, it must be the giant of its viewers properly. In this picture, we only get the shortest glimpses of the giant. It seems to be alike sort of alien to robot monster. But I'm not sure; Photography was so dark that I could not easily waste time. Although, my gut feeling was that I was probably missing too much.
