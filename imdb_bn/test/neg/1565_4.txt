This adaptation has two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. "Now" time, when Glover lives in England and soon takes a psychological shelter of Evil Doctor Bates. <br /> <br /> 2. The "described" time, where the traveler describes his travels. <br /> <br /> The time spread with a very sticky tempo, which makes it more difficult to create suspense suspiciously if the movie is easily canceled, and written text follow. In the book Bates, there is no shelter, and there is very little mention of Mrs shooter. Travel - Plural - is portrayed as one of the movies. There are a number of movies that have come into the shelter of doubtful people, look at some nasty people, if you want them then look at them. The "Time" part of the story has nothing to add to the value of the story, the complete discovery of the movie adapters, and takes valuable time from the real story. While this was going on I was waiting to see the real bit of the original bit. <br /> <br /> For so much disaster. In fact, parts of real stories are completed and CGIIT is well-done for its time. Many small (and some medium sized) parts of the original journey are cut only but do not stop the story. This is the only version of the AFAIK that depicts four travels, and should make the film special. <br /> <br /> Two split parts get almost the same time. I rate 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. Out of the average, I give it a 4/10. If they can only spend the garbage and pay 99% attention on the actual trip, then spent a lot of time to complete the detailed description of the cut tour. <br /> <br /> Why some adapters think that he has given enough gifts to improve the work of the swift, I do not know. My best guess is that in 1996, CGI was so expensive that the movie company felt the need to include a lot of fillers, which did not need to keep the total cost under certain restrictions such as extra sets, GCIs, etc. At the same time creates a minute series that revolves around a certain number of minutes.
