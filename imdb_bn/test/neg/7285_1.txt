I'm sorry to say it but I did not enjoy this movie. It was very annoying. So annoying that I could not see the rest. It is not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate this stupid day because they are not right now. Disney recently released that movie really sucks! I miss old days when making good films like Leon King, Alladin, Pokhantas, Syndrome, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this movie but I could not fix it. I do not think I can recommend anyone on this photo. I would suggest that just mentioned above.
