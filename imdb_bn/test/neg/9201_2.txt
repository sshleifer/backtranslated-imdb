I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, "Ben Johnson?!" - She was a grave movie Star ball, a Cowboy, and by 1976 she was scraping playing a Sheriff stupid for TV disaster film, as Killer Bees of Deadly Swarms Cash that means that everyone is coming to get visibly our time. So there are these bees, and they are flying in their faces and after killing them some people by the reservoir. Finally these foolish people find the fountain and die, and this woman is trapped by jumping into her car. What do we do like the police? Oh, bees when it is cold. So where can we cool? I know - New Orleans Stadium! So they will catch the car and its maiden beekeeper on the streets of New Orleans and on them, "Stop the road or you'll die." And thousands of wildlife, including its broken toilets, are home to the future, so this special bunch of bees becomes narcotic ruins. I do not know how much discomfort there is on this great city ... Well I suck, but this one sucks. Betamax is a good alternative though, most appropriately is seen in a highly fade-to-orange 16mm print!
