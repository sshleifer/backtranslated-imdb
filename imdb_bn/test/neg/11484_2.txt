When I first saw the movie trailer, I really wanted to see it. I thought the director's other work was good at some, but I was obviously disappointed. In this plot, a young girl, who lives with a widowed father and her two sons. They move into a protected community, yet not all think; A sort of twin peaks Do not see or see women, things are a man. At the time of the first train, I thought, "can not be the whole reason?" Well, ended, or down well, and I felt what was really a weaker final job for us. Sound mix and quality are excellent. It was seen in a THX Certified Theater, and by audio, and was only affected by audio. Image body missing.
