Avivard Accident Missmash's SVS Poseidon has a team of hazardous teams, it is expected that it can loot before it gets better. His 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure Tournament" came in the seventh theater of Ivy Allen! Do not keep in mind that nobody is taking care of, why do we produce such a great art, slowly and wrongly filled by actors, just to cut your biggest blow? It can be really sad for Michael Kain, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Carl Malden and Sheryl Jones, not for their lost-sea expressions (some are good for some disappointments). There is a moment when child Jones is tempted to take some treasure for himself and he starts to stuff his pockets horribly, which is an unexpected hunch. All related to the film, especially Allen, who was a career bungler for a thorough recovery from this. * ****
