In attempts to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren led a group of tenants who came down on a tropical island that looks like heaven so much that people who hired his party ... can eat birds' fountains. In fact, the nitrogen gas that comes from the mace on the island is in the air. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie - the location of the island where it was auspicious. Otherwise, the story exceeds nothing to work with the creators. As a result: many violence, many languages, lots of blood, and some women's women are helpless. If you want vain violence (sorry, the story can not even give a point to violence, but it tries it) but it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Be careful that this movie is full violence and blood, and rating driving.
