What's wrong with Disney (BP) last year? Is the good idea to run out of the well? Where's magic? Where are good animators, good songwriter, good director, well ... well, I know, Walt himself and the famous "New Year's man" can not return. But this cheap signals are countless and gradually, but what is one reason to destroy Walt Disney's ideals? However, I did not rent or bought a movie Disney-Siegel. Because I could read more about him (quality absence). But "Atlantis: Milo Return" was broadcast on TV in Germany today and so I see it. It's my doubt about the sequels. It was absolutely annoying. Trying to imitate the famous multiplayer cameras with flavors, primitive color-rotation, simple letters, some failed CGIs, medieval music and a patchwork in a variety of simple stories. It looks absolutely like Disney! I do not like Disney! It looks like "Dragonball", "Belbaid" etc., which is a great, cheaper and easy animation series, which is broadcast on TV for children every day. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after this shit was to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and trick to load "Bumble" in my DVD player, to see Disney again its climax, and again a great image of handmade animation To see. "Bumblebee" is the first (and today's only) movie, which I gave 10 out of 10. But "Atlantis: Milo Return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no soul ... it deserves only 10!
