Perhaps the worst movie I ever saw. The person who shot this movie probably never learned movies or shimmers in the shining light. You can not see anything in this movie. It's a dark way. The part where you can see some of the cameras is directly directed to a light source so that you get big lens flares. So you still can not see. This movie can be a radio game or something. Some parts of the movie are actually compromised to make any kind of impact. Low budget movies can be done so much better then this. And no budget is no excuse for this. An editor should have said something while starting the editor and saw that you can not see anything. Perhaps the manufacturers should spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they can see what they shot. This movie is the only good thing in the dark that you can not see terrible acting. Cover it up to crappy sfx. People in the beginner film school then make this movie well. This look like shot movies with simple cams
