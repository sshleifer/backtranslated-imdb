In my opinion, this movie is not good. I rarely find a good thing to tell about it, but I still want to explain, it's another bad movie before it ends. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it because Costas Mandilar is acting in it, and the last reason I finally saw it. I like the action movie, and I realize that such films are made in step instead of the story. I know they do not give details about the credibility of stories and events, but they do not explain some scenes, because they lack a lack of reality, they seem ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At the outset, the film seems quite committed: a difficult, well-researched expert and its not so difficult, but the smart and funny partner must do a job, which makes them a little different than expected. The story takes place in a cruise ship. A disaster occurs, ships are launched, and there are only a few remaining left. During their struggle to survive, they escaped from a shark, a professional killer and rising water. <br /> <br /> Also, the film is quite violent. The main weapon (most of the passenger along with the disaster has already carried) guns, which are successfully used in many cases. I personally miss a good man for women (or if you like women) for a woman. Family fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said to all, this movie was shot very quickly. Made with the usual action movie tricks, to say a little love, and without any real meaning, this is the result of a bad movie.
