I love movies in Jurassic Park, they are my favorite three films of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game, if there was a game, I'm not the owner of Super Ninonto. <br /> <br /> A game based on the classic movie can be very terrible? And to make it worse, when I was a child I was scared of this game. <br /> <br /> How foolish it was, but again when I left the game I was a child. <br /> <br /> This game is just odd game to play. One minute it's a action game and then it's a shooter. What is wrong with the world as you build your mind while creating a video game? <br /> <br /> The game is very awesome to hear the word. <br /> <br /> Listen to the music very sick. <br /> <br /> The game's controller does not work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park is just a waste of time and money and a classic. Avoid all costs <br /> <br />
