Austria of Elizabeth of Elizabeth (1837-1898) is actually associated with the romance of Romy Scendere and Ernest Marischka (in the 1950s), where beauty, humility, sweetness, but history is always present. It was CC, probably for some people myths; However, a powerful screenplay. In addition to Hubbard's devotion, the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and simplicity influenced many films. Just, they have a spirit. However, even after 50 years, the genre Daniel Veregh's film is made, but it seems to be a painting of the epidemic and his life. It seems like trying something different, expressing some realism as a remedy for confection; Yet, it does not add a lot but rather deprives many whole stories. Let me analyze for more details. <br /> <br /> On September 1898, CC came to the port of Geneva. Along with her court maid, she said to find herself in this tragic life. He is going to visit Maya (Didier's Bages), whom he is going to tell the whole life story. There are flashbacks on the important moments of life in this work, but these moments are presented with chaos and therefore, anyone who is not very knowledgeable in Austrian history can be totally confused or confused. A lot of attention was drawn to Emperor Franz Joseph on the bad marriage of Sissi. Her wedding night scene is a failure. An empress treatment like no one (I mean undressing and paying). Historically, keeping an eye on the misunderstanding of the CC is historically correct, but according to him, his dignity differs from other advisers. Where is his desire for peace? Where is his love of his country? Where is his charity? Sissi seems rather very elegant, modern, generous (from the 21st Century point of view). He is careful for his appearance, which is not the greatest historical fact. Cecil was an internal life that was not shown in the film. "Women will wear trousers", they say a sentence and may be a picture of the CC presented in the film. Sissi hate the monarchy, which is a noticeable criticism of the film towards the Austrian empire. Moreover, he partially participated in the anarchic movement, and as soon as he was surprised, he blamed his husband, Emperor Franz Joseph, for the death of his husband Rudolph. There is no mention in the history that CC was present in Messaging? Sisir's relationship with the father-in-law of the Society has been shown to be better, but Sophie's death scene looks pure and the conversation is just a bit of cliche. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much but another important aspect I find here is the weak performance which is a movie performance. Although Ariel Dumblesel has his moments like a CC, he usually does not play a role. She looks more like a "femme fa story" than a sad emperor. Her gesture as her make-up empress is most erroneously wrong. The owner may be considered to be somewhat better like Zidi Rudolph and generally to increase the performance standards. Still, Stefan Adran did not do any special work as Sophie: You simply will not get the impression to hate cass. Sisii ignores him for the young age when he crowns for his behavior, lifestyle and his beliefs. Partially it appears in the movie but definitely not enough that. But the greatest mistake, it seems like Julian Hans Kapua undersea. Andersi counted on pride, honor, patriotism ... here, he simply feels like a free thought to love his queen. And the screenplay is so weak that this performance is very pale. Taitiana Ivanovo as the right choice Catherine Scrat, she really fits the role with her appearance and her gesture. But, unfortunately, its role will not take much time to screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this movie is some costume and quite authentic position. Geneva port was well presented and the moment of Cinic's death was astonishingly well-known to the film. It does not seem to be really how it was; However, the moment is better than the symbolic perspective ... Empress walks and nothing knows that this is his final moments. In this way he could have felt about him, how this was how a madman destroyed the magnificence of the world. Another good moment was apparently when CC was talking to his son Rudolph with Carrefour. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> sum, this is not a good movie. It is a very significant historical figure, distorting a significant historical time, it tries to cure the sweetness of the sycis triangle but creates nothing creative. Charm has gone, glorified and ignore history! Finding is not very worthless! 3/10
