I'm sorry to rain on everyone's parade. Just a little background about me: I want Asian languages ​​especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Actually I'm in South Korean movie when it's a bride, however, if it's the best, sorry. I just want to know that I am not narrow-worried while praising foreign films and I do not fit stereotype of "fool American". . . Well, not quite. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this piece has been broken into pieces. It's a scary * and * ridiculous movie. Acting hammy - everything has been done badly and begging for the attention of overdone, illiterate spectators. Fierce camera work, emphasizing meaningless close-ups arising from MTV aesthetic. <br /> <br /> This plot is full of holes more than a large part of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects the thriller to be 100% realistic and I'll be happy to close my eyes on small inappropriate descriptions to entertain. But, excuse, what's going on here that * * * can even stand even brief surveillance? An incredibly complex and revenge competition is worse than the worst tabloid story this story can read in a supermarket. (If this word does not want to ruin your "enjoyment", then you will not get details of the plot.) The scene of the war is violent, incredible, cruel fool (the main "hero" dozens of dozen and dozens of people at the same time being trained at the prison while being imprisoned! ) The true "extraordinary" feature of this movie is two: Lilid and offensive sex (brother and sister to sister, well, we've been born from Oedipus, we do not?) And c Traffic violence. Cut parts of the body - hands, teeth, tongue - Bloody blood together (how many thousands of tomatoes die for this film?) There is no formal activity / motivation. <br /> <br /> A festival for S & M, but, even for them, no merit or neutrality festival. Humans, even Mel Gibson's recent and often interactive debate, did not have the same theme. <br /> <br /> This scary, too intelligent, piece of ornamented cow made from the Korean coast is fragmented. I wonder what's going on. I do not think of myself as the ultimate paragon of taste, and often I am ready to admit that the movie I did not enjoy could be better than I could accept. However, I see it as there is no scripts calling this: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming attributes. My 2c? Find something good with your time.
