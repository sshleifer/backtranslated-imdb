How nice! James Purefoy looks just like Thomas Jane like <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a fantasy comedian, the story was very slow and the effect was unclear. <br /> <br /> The problem was not played. James Purefoy makes a good night, and his various side-keys are not bad characters. I even had a pretty good idea to think of this role Patrick Swayze. Flat-chested Piper Perabo also had some nice possibilities. I liked the baby too. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything was happening, and * the way it happened, it was just "Ah". Unwelcome Compared to other recent fantasy comedies, Ela Enchant, which was actually funny, the film has become very small. I'm sorry for this fancy actress who was this yawn-inducing trudgery. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 4
