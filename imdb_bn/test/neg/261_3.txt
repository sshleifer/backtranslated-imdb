When I read the story of Kahin Pyaar Ho Ho, I thought, "Hu?". It was confusing. To be sure, I went to see the film and you know what? This is a remix of "Wedding Singer". Most of the scenes have been transformed into a completely successful form of Indianism, but the rest is from the Hollywood hit of 1998, directly from the elevator. There is no stranger to the rebuilding of Bollywood, but it is so poor that it hurts me to see. I became very annoyed at this and I realized that I am not the only one! A man actually went out of the theater and did not come back! Salman Khan must stop playing the comedy role. She shrieks and whines too much Why can not he take it easily? He does not judge the role played by Adam Sandler originally. She does not have Sandler's ideas of comic timing. Queen is a wonderful actress and my favorite one, but she is not a Drew Barry. The scene does not match Barrymore's version ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulaia") standing in front of the mirror of her new title ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Puglia"). I feel embarrassed to see the scene, though I loved the original. Music is not very bad. This is probably the only saving of one of the most horrific movies! Avoid at all costs!
