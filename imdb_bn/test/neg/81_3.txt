All right, so it's never going to change the world, and it's a box office bombing, but Hankey Tonk Freeway is one of those movies that I've been in love with a child (The BBC showed it in the 1980s and I have a machine Have high quality VHS tape - lucky, that!) And watched continuously. I watched the DVD last night and sadly, blockbuster would not take time. Either I or I've grown out of this kind of broad, dopey ridiculous. Come on, when the laughing laughing at the sledging laughs, he hides the novelty with our 'fun' slogan, what can you say about cast or play? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's aspiring, attractive, unusual and sprawling, but it's not a laugh-out loud fun once. I will describe some children as 'children' overturn, despite 15 certificates, you can safely let your youngsters see it. They do not get drug references, so do not worry about it. When I came to know, I was surprised that I forgot how interesting the title song and songwriting of the track driver of the truck driver, 'Overvidi's Going Fast, Foster' was not mentioned, the patriotic song of Tiklo was not mentioned. The whole cast is complimentary, the photography captures the mood of the crisp and perfectly different positions and pop-culture references - there are lots of money in fashion, cars, gadgets (especially dashboard-mounted drum machines), internally and especially about a real-time capsule feeling. Amount "I'm the Simpson!" It is a little surprised to hear the word loud enough to say, especially now Simpson's legal tangles have had an impact on the achievement of his sport. Graduate, there is no plot to talk about, it is very funny to achieve a lot of ridiculous smile that is not great and ridiculous. I'd leave this one as a beautiful memory.
