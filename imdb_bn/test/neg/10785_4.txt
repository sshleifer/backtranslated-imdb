I can not believe that some pictures of this photo of IMDB website! Have I been issued with the special edition version? Edited by DeWahrst produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be kept in radio service. I am sorry for all UK-centric references but if you are somewhere else and you do not have to cut a tonel or you do not have beer matte collection in any of the lists, this film can cost more than 90 minutes in the lifetime (as long as you do not get a paint for drying) . The plot has more holes than the fishnet stockings and the directions and the edit have surprisingly fused the ham. Isinin doing this film in the world?
