You think, it is not supposed to be, but it's As a watermelon, I saw this movie in the theater (a huge wrestle and a hog hop fan). From the night I think we are the only in the theater, and I really did not like it too much. I have blackened the rest, and for good reason. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Pro wrestling world. Well, these disclaimers are not all high ... and in fact I call these people "professional". And really, without first sight, there is no wrestling to speak. So I think that the film is a little frustrating to the blanket-c-out-of-ordinary part of the public. Looks good, okay? <br /> <br /> <br /> Hubble Hogan played WWF champion rip. (Do not ever say that Hoch Hogan was a typic, movies like The Thunder of Heaven and Paradise have shown how he challenged himself in a profound role that really pushed his talent limit). Basically he is playing himself, but black and blue clothing compared to the hulkter's red and yellow. He has this hand gesture he has. It's like a great devil symbol, people are in rock concerts, but you do not keep your thumb in the air and you can articulate your index finger. My friend claims that this is an "R" try and see for yourself. If it feels like an "a," then the women of Mars need it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He will not get any part of it (and Outside the office, the office will not leave without a camera with a winning gesture), and the film follows Fuller and tries to get back to the rate. When he created his brilliant title of "war of strong man," he did so. Marketing Genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> Response to a number of elephant gestures, rather than a stupid fight scene (all the wrestling as very real and vivid serious), which is nothing but many frequent shot holes, what you want to delete in this movie There are movies. It is desperate, not too much to do with violence, violence and "what smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> is a classic all the time.
