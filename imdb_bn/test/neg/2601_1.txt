This is the most overrated show on television. I believe that people think about it because they want to think, because it has become a part of a "cool" event and your friends will see work or school the next day. Very rarely does it actually reveal something other than a chocolate, and does not give any sense of irony or thought to the audience. Each joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that seems to pull out a "hat". Even with the complete lack of originality of Lemera's spin closing, it became clear (see: American father) I asked the audience about the sincerity of this which is going on in this horrible show on TV. I can reward the family guy no points and God may have mercy on his soul ...
