I love finding out the trailer than the movie. They have done their job and have been interested in unaware observation. Interest has begun. Lake in the scene is a simple premises. Five men woke up in a chemical warehouse, why they did not know why they were there; Let them know how they are alone in hell. Confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and mistrust. Men know that a abductor is on his way to the plan to kill his prisoner. Now men are trying to differentiate between each other, if everybody is a victim and may actually be one of the abductors. Cast includes: Jim Cavijel, Greg Buyer, Joe Patoliano, Breedgate Mannahan, Barry Paper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
