I'm big in acting, writing, and indicator, but not yet famous. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and a good smile, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called Biker Jobs, from Decry, we knew it would be the worst movie ever, and it was! Detroit biker hair scripts are not there! They can say they have, but they are liars! There were only 4 minutes of bothering about two women and sexuality, and you can predict it. And if they're going to improove, it should be at least decent, but it was not, and you can tell two actors to spoil the lines and say something that does not even understand in the sense. <br /> <br /> Here's a start to know how terrible and annoying this film is: A girl shoots a guy, beat him with his face and then pushing him, then raping him. Then we attack those zombies attack and they both turned into Zombies. <br /> <br /> This movie starts! Through the whole movie, lead zombie voices can not be mentioned, being frightening and trying to get very excited, but feel the narrowness of the words like Murlene Monson. <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst movie. Bottom line, folk But if you like movies using a script, a plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 f words in the movie, watch it. <br /> <br /> If it hits video stores then my future films will win Oscars!
