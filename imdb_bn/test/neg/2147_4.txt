I do not know what was first published in the 1970s. Canon for Cordoba is a "Europen Western" it is made in Spain. This means the worst of the so-called #Spirito Leon's real-world masterpieces and John Ford's real American masterpieces, Sam Pacinpahah, Howard Hugh, John Sturgess, and Anthony Mann. Sam Peckipahn's are not all explained in this order as John John Ford best. I think all of them are beautifully arranged by IMDB 100. <br /> <br /> Casting is worse than this strength. The role of Georgie Peppered Sergeant, suitable for Ruff Vallon's "Mafia Capo" and Geovana Ralei "Piaja Venezia" in Rome for a "Putanana" in the sixties.
