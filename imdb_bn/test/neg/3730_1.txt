While watching and enjoying thousands of movies, Minnesota is the worst one to feel (** a major list of films with a list) which I have ever seen. Times someone This movie completely fails on each level. It has been badly photographed and edited. Actress played blurry, where actors appear to be disturbed by their minds. Pecache collection, perhaps? And worst of all, slippage scripts seem to have been written just under some unpleasant substances found in sewers. I do not even know how anyone has found a writer / director to fund this project, only to let him draw any star. I really wish that I saw this piece of garbage that could get back to time. If possible, I could give this grade a grading grade. Still good, a negative number.
