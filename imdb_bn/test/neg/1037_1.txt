Unless you see 2-hour valuable mountain footage which contains violent characters, many of the hits and the 70's Gore (not mostly in it), I would suggest to avoid this movie. It's overlong long winds, and it's rather a boring amateur amateur feel. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, a superb italian landscape in a fashion fashion. <br /> <br /> I am delighted and am a plot to entertain when I gradually got the 1970 movie, a huge fan. In this case, it does not work for me. The plot is combined with radioactive and stylish letters, supported by the sunny angry people and your ideal Italian widow dressed in black. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the country of Italy and are not familiar, the view itself can be valuable to watch movies as spectacular and rather exciting. But this movie is not ordinary, there are so many Italian horror flicks much better than it. Not much more than a yawn festival. 5/10
