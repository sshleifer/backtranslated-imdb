I got this movie from the library, and I had many actors in it (John Clays, Ian Holmes, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I found and saw it. I was expected to have a big role in Cleese after the first billing, I had about five minutes of screen time, I was surprised, the other I liked. This movie is surprisingly vain, the characters are dancers, the plot is not existent, and the last one I saw the worst is the last one. There was some fun part, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you "what?" Want to avoid? And "Hu?", Many. And you do not want to waste your time. Ignore those who say this very funny movie ... it's not. Just stay away from all costs ... please.
