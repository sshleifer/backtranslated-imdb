Lord David Seyil wrote an interesting book in the Victorian Novelists in the early 1930s, where he saw the works of Dickens, Thakur, Eliot, Trollpop, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bront, and Emily Bront. He selected these writers as popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period and explained to his people the ability to read their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them). Some of his comments are quite relevant today, but like critics, the idea of ​​lifetime of critics can also be summed up. <br /> <br /> Seychel George Elliott (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poems). But for most modern readers, they usually get acquainted with his short book, Sils Maranar, which still remains in some high school curriculum. Other books, Felix Hall the Radicals, Daniel Derroda, Middlemark, The Mills The Floss, Adam Baid, Romola, are still in the print scenes (Penguins, for example, mostly printing them) but most of them are unread. In today's interest, he has his last novel, Derada, where he discusses Jews in English society, and discusses an elementary, pre-heartzed type of zenism. Romola is the only effort in its historical novels (about a religious pure Republic of Savararla in Florence in the 1490s). His greatest novel is the Middle Marches, which was related to the provincial English society of Lord Gray's great reform Bill in 1832. I had to read the middaymarch at the college for literary courses. This is certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Wolf is known as the largest book in English language). But it's suffering from an error (like Eliot's novels) - she can not write living, exciting prose. Dickens are sometimes very excited but may become pompas and prolics, and Lord Cecil's words can become very common in the training of trollopp, and Charlotte Brent may fail to explain some good relationships and Mrs. Giusel can behave well. With female characters, Emily Bront (and her single novel Emily Bront) is interested in the reader. Most of the novels of Eliat are like trying to read the words out of the marble block with a stone reading! <br /> <br /> I have met almost fifty pages of flashes till date. I have seen that none of the other critics have finished the novel. But I have to read a summary of what it is about. Tullivers (Maggie and his brother Tom) are central figures - they own title matches. Though close to the beginning of the story, Maggie loves the neighbor's son, whose parents are involved in legal problems with Mr. Tiliver Sir. A long view of this relationship is seen by Tom and the tragedy related to the story divided into siblings, concluding their death (Maggie runs back calls to rescue Tom during a heavy flood, and they die together). This has certainly succeeded with Victorian readers, but it is very depressing and depressing to the modern audience. The movie has finally changed - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies with her boyfriend, and Tom (James Mason) mentions her death at the conclusion of her record book. In the conclusion, the story is completely rewritten without double death of flood. It really does not help matters. Although Fitzgerald and Mason work well with their portions, they really can not drag the film through their work. The end result is a fairly minor film, Fortunately the lead's carrier does not hurt. Another thing to remember is that the boyfriend starred Frank Lawton, who grew up against David Copperfield two years ago against WCfield, Leon Barremore and Maureen and Sullivan. But then, Loton did not have a big film career - he always wanted to be in the film, some good, some intermediaries.
