I'm like the left margarine, so I was weird. <br /> <br /> Some people with a good camera and lovely people are watching a home production with elses friends and family, not just good movies. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing is impossible. But I'm sitting halfway. And why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture gives a perfect example of what not to do, it's a movie student's dream to avoid at every stage of the process. Order it across the whole joint photo school kikikulam! <br /> <br /> so left them! Now I know Jacques is real - because you do not want to win Oscar, Dude :)
