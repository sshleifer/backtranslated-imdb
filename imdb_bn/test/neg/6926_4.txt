I was looking forward to this, so being a big fan of this book. However, when it comes out, it seems like it was one of the amount of time and time I spent in the movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> There is no way to lie to Miss Minchin to deliberately punish other girls; In the book, he made a point of falsification, "not just wicked, but obscene." <br /> <br /> I have a lot of Disneyfide for me; Sir's father returned from the dead and pushed them all to the Indian sunset. Although the book is happy (and critics may seem equally impossible), it does not let you think, "Oh Pau-Leigh." <br /> <br /> About the true facts about this book: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father was a soldier 2. Sarah and her father ("Are you learning with my heart?" / "No. I know you in my heart. You are in my heart.") 3. Sarai's friendship with unemployed, and her 'accept' Lottie (Although this last one could not be improved as soon as possible) 4. Various luxury items change its room. That part is brilliantly done. 5. Basic Fundamentals - A Rich Girl Suddenly Running in Poverty - There, But About All That <br /> <br /> People can tell more about this adaptation to young visitors. Probably. I can say that I have two cousins ​​- 7 and 12 years old - when big fans of this film did not read the book, they were so big. <br /> <br /> If you want a 'feel-good' family film, then distribute this. If you are looking for a movie that actually tells the story of a Little Princess (actually, if you read the book) do not waste time with it. It's a lot of shame; With such a cast, it could be great if they were stuck in at least basic stories. <br /> <br /> Do I read the book and read the book a little more? most probably. But if anyone tries to adapt a book - especially a classic - in a film, but at least one thing should be done. More than once a favorite.
