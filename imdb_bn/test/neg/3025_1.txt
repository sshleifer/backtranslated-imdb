Good Lord. <br /> <br /> I would say from the bat, I saw this movie 20 minutes. As a hardcore ErasideHead fan, "Do not you see a black and white movie with little to-Dial dialogue?" Defense does not apply. I can not easily see strange black and white movies with little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Whenever this movie is made you give harmful goths without any talent and the camera does not say anything. And budget, and as soon as possible on the screen give him many meaningless offensive imagery. It was clear from the beginning that this film should be 5 minutes long (assuming that it should always exist). Shots run in minutes for a few seconds, because the director has "I-Just-Love-the-Sound-Off-My-One-Voice" syndrome and refuses to spend another shot until the entire part of the footage. Seen At this moment, she started masturbating the body of "God" (the opening scene of the film), I knew it was a matter of time only until it closed the tape. Driving around a separate body of at least 10 minutes, with a rope, with a rope, and a gang of secret people, I knew it was time to leave. Seldom I give up a movie. I sit through the fineness of Blair Witch 2: Shadow Book, though with joy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Tetsuo: The Iron Man, allow me to allow you to decorate a watch and enjoyable piece of black and white curiosity.
