This image has to be moved with Ed Wood movies. A terrible script and bad, bad acting. <br /> <br /> Plate glass is a machine gun fight in front of the window; Minutes before someone gets hurt and nobody caps - a window never breaks. You think the big U-Haul truck can be blurred after a fire fight - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> CIA agent and public contractor = Chess = Top confidential information on a stand-up cocktail <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone is shallow and basically unlikely. <br /> <br /> A Hawaii 747 flew from Los Angeles and twenty minutes later in the Pacific ... "... 100 feet in water ..." When the stewardess announces five passengers, for a short time they only leave the air for two hours; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
