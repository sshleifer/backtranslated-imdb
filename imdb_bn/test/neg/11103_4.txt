I just saw this movie because Sophie Marsoau. However, its acting ability is not enough to salve it in this movie. Almost all cast their character good, exceptions for Sophie and Frederick. The right pieces were in the right place if the plot could give rise to a better movie. I've seen a lot of good French movies but I do not like it.
