When I was a little girl, I used to enjoy the Swan princess, it was releasing the same fairy tale of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, the princess and her prince, who protects the day, is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hope. But I think that what they wanted to see for Hannan princes and, unfortunately, this is a common cartoon seagull which is even more frustrating than entertaining. The only character I was still passionate about was Queen, she was very funny in this movie and was the best part. But with the change of voice, they were noticeable and very annoying to me, I did not mean to be picky, it was too weird for me. The story was first adapted from the Swan princess, only in the movie that Volley followed Rothbert's footprints. <br /> <br /> They are going to celebrate their one-year anniversary of the Odate and Derek, but Derek has been very safe preoccupied with the fight for his kingdom. His mother's birthday is also coming, so he has forgotten that the town has a new Klein, Clavius, who hopes to leave Rothbert's power and the Queen who was abducted on her birthday and beyond. But to help Dieke fight with her and save her mother, the update will have to return to her soul. <br /> <br /> <br /> Clear fun for them. These sequels are frustrating because it is usually for kids, which the audience aims at them, but it is more enjoyable if the audience is curious and enjoying the story. Now there are a few smiles and giggles here, but this was not the first swan princess as my opinion was tricky. I'll recommend it for the kids, but if you are looking for a funny cartoon movie, I'd recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
