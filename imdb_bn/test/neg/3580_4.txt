'Chord is the only movie I have seen where I can almost say that nothing will happen only. I felt that I saw delivery of a medieval couple, with children, walking, eating, smoking, conversation (by the excuse I swear) through most movies. And I do not believe that I'm missing points. I think this movie was well-conducted, played well (though the husband's performance was rather woody), and the increasingly growing persistence of the audience certainly kept the audience around every corner. But when the dust gets dry, clean your left zero (a boat load of only broken boats). I do not want to drive, gun violence, beat etc. In fact, I'm sick of violence. But to my good, let's get a little deeper into all these characters (let's know each of these corrupt officials a little better - just do not show their surveillance shot as street lip). Why are so teenagers? Everyone said that they were at junior height. I believe even our human race may say something other than this fu_ _, sh__, etc. The story and storyline of 'Krrmus' was quite interesting, but the execution was done flat and easy to empty 4/4
