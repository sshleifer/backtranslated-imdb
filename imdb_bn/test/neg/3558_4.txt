A scene initiated in the early 1930s was an interest to viewers in the early 21st century; Unfortunately, in addition to the unexpected English charm of "London is related to me" it is not something to recommend. All the problems lie deeply stuck with stories. The main conspiracy expressed concern about the activities of Richard Attenborough, how he struggled to save him from the law of the society, and how he bandbed with society. Or something else. The main thing here is that Attenborough's character brings everything on its own and, fairly, is convicted of almost every charge brought against him, so why is the film (and all the characters) so sympathetic to him? When he is not actually in fact, he is considered a victim of the situation; And for more, he does not feel too much regret for his actions, but he is thinking of being away with something he does not want to do. Elster Sim gets a lot of time on a plot that has nothing to do with the original plot line and is surprised at what you are doing (though the SIM is always pretty). The main plot has a continual effect against the subpot but you have a problem with the non-rectangular structure. And, after making a wide speed and careful build up, the plot is completely dissatisfied and completely separated from the complete 20 minutes, which does not even show us if the character of Attenberg gets better from the previous proceeding. The film does not end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The film's acting, direction and general feeling can all be appreciated, but unfortunately the pieces and structures of piece jerks continue. The last point of the quarter: Alex Guinnes, "The Ladicellers", a superb film on Alster Sim's performance in this film, based on its performance, both characters with almost the same similar scenes on the right.
