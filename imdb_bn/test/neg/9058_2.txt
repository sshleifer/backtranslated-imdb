Armand and Dangerous is not one of John McDonald's magnificent. This movie is very weak and not too much comedy about an external police who has finished working for a small security system managed by the crowd. I enjoyed some moments of candy watching in the pilot suite, but it does not seem like a lot of things. Surgery and hazardous yet a dangerous frustrating mist brought by our equally stupid employee COMMANDO director. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 5 out 1
