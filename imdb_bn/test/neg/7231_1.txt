Michigan Bar is preparing for the exam and seeing this one after being ill. I wanted something that was stupid and I just sat and said, "What did they think?" I was not disappointed with this commitment, but I would have seen it in a serious mood, I would be bored. The company that created this thing first divided the CGI footage from the first octopus, and added a small footage to a fake octopus, which shows a special effect used in "Bride Mana" as the best composition footage. Since there is an octopus fangs? The plot is the NYPD diver investigating some murder / disappearance in the Hudson River before the fourth week of July. He and his companion (who will be transferred soon, or soon will be delivered by the octopus of figs) will be investigated unexpectedly (always believing that the great octopus will kill people) and occasionally a woman mayor from the office of the needy. Certainly someone believes that it is bigger than the octopus, and the mayor attacks the girl in the office. Surprisingly, not all hell breaks break and only a few policemen and some civilians die. <br /> <br /> really hair. Do not bother with it.
