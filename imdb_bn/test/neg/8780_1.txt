This movie remembers the bad news because of the producer's court order using the name of client Moore "Lone Ranger" or the black black mask in private appearance. Without any consideration of the quality of the film, it was the height and height of the arrogant and stupid in the part of the producer and their attorneys. And I suspect that this film was well-learned after the tank, which was widely regarded as a bit of a work for Jars, responsible for the court order against Moore. <br /> <br /> It has been a recent custom, while reviving a legendary movie or TV project to invite original stars or stars for the presentation of the story, and so on. Show some respect, you are stupid! And even if they anticipate their noses, what happened, at least the proposal was made. It is noteworthy that film producers, studio executives, and entertainment attorneys are not too stupid and arrogant to teach for example.
