The worst movie I ever seen I did not even see it all ahead of Bururt's Bit and forward it too fast !!! That's the only reason to watch! I have to accept the ownership of a copy because I needed a big bart fan and it was necessary for my collection when I came out of this movie, I would not care that my local shop had only two copies and I was renting a nightmare . All the fans of various stars always beat me there, when I am sitting and imagining my disappointment in this movie !! There is no quality quality about this movie !!! Absolutely never like what about this movie !!! This movie has become a running joke among the worst of me and companion bert !! Rob Loay is the worst hour and half of my life
