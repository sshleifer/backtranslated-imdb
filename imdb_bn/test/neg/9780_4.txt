This is another alien imitation and it's not very good at. Move out of the South African desert, throw it in the same material, a group of people trapped in an unhealthy landscape, they have been hunted by an alien creature and you have a very common film trying to appeal to a classic film a classic film. The missiles and scientists take a group to find some absent colleagues and find their bones in the desert desert. Their cars collapsed and they headed towards civilization and headed towards civilization. The African position is quite enough but that's basically all these films are going for it. There is an unsuccessful attempt to create excitement, but I found it does not really work and it makes the film rather annoying. The animal did not appear much and it did not really feel the feeling of horror when it happened. A scene where someone bursts meat from her, but basically it is in front of her. In conclusion I think this image is exciting to see paint dry. I can give this picture 4/10 and it is only an interesting place that is not enough to save this movie from the total snooze festival.
