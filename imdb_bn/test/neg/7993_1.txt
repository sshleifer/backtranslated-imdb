I stumbled across the movie late on TV. My brother and I could not stop smiling how horrible God in this movie. Whenever White Ninja or Black Ninja uses a pan, kick, or weapon, the nasty sound effects are pleasurable. This movie is on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can see this movie once because of Shearer Croppin. I'm not sure if the director was intentionally so painful because he knew that the idiots like me would buy it.
