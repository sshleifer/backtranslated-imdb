Bigfoot Capture is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. I like Sassackach and Bigfoot movies but it's one of the worst waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I saw this movie last night, and I could complete the look. I realized that these strange crazy people wanted to capture Bigfoot, but this movie was the only thing to make sense. Although there were some interesting parts of it. This very impressive and intelligent disco club has been running with a very bad disco dance for a long time. Movie I think the director is trying to fill the time. Bigfoot was the worst thing. A man in a case looked like a pink faux puff, Bigfoot. It was ridiculous. If you want to watch a very bad bigfoot movie, then I recommend you buy this movie. Personally, I lost my time and my money during this time!
