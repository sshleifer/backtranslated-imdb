I really like Catherine Pitta-Jones, I was once again surprised, why a good movie rebuild? This version mostly lacks Martha's tension and passion. It was a clean rod off. Maxim was more confident in Phoerite than being a wounded child, recovering with love. I could not believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owns this role. Unfortunately Jita-Jones should have got another person to gain her own ownership (she has her own other role that she does herself). Sergio Castellitto was a weak but joyful Italian as well. Aaron Eckhart felt ruthless than. This version was beautiful but delighted. <br /> <br /> Love between Mario and Martha was probably expected but satisfactory. The doctor added an interesting bit color that does not seem important. Lastly he liked it when he said that he would come back but the movie ended before it was over. I have mostly Martha at home. Every now and then I revisit it.
