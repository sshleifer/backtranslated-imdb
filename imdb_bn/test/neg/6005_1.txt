OK. The first one said, I just wanted to verify that this image is below average rating or OK -1. But 5,9 These killers are sick of any kind of proceeding. -, -. The people here told me what I wrote here ... which ultimately made me an account to give my 2 cents true to this "good of travel". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Consider this movie as the same sentence as Seven? The only thing they found common is that they show different crime scenes. Yes, that's it. And "Best Thriller 1999!" ? Have you even watched another movie form that year? Or is there any other movie in your life? 1999 is not a year which is remembered by the resurrection ... 8mm with real movies, close eyes, Ellington Road, what is the double hazard? (They were actually more "thriller" than this.) Revival is not even worthy of being dedicated in the second second of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can not be serious. I saw that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by her a friend. A great movie with "Christopher Lambert"! ... which I have not seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, first look at the covers: OK, nothing special. In the second hint, you do not have to be careful about the supernatural power that they just mirrored Lambert's head, his nose torn it and nk, then created a top-down negative pattern in it, which could get a picture of the killers on cover pictures. Even you may think that some of their beginner can eat a gallon of marsemlessly, which is just unclear (booooh! -.-) .. whatever the face. It turns around and the plot starts .. "It's raining in Chicago ... Blabber Blabber". Come, snippet words that are a six-year-old may be more exciting. Now, these amazingly exciting movies come from. Exciting presentation.- You want to start seeing it absolutely. Because it can not be bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. That estimate of mine is proven wrong. With "proven error" means I've been cruelly executed by a deadly mix of the worst fiction known to mankind (each actor, but the top is "I Can Make 1 Liners!" Police Chief Prudomys Wife __ea is a better detective than Prudhomme when he is a The incident still recombines various incidents of indication of inconsistencies !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme himself) inhumane Law is a feeling squadron, featuring logic error in 1 minute saiklasa light-years distant from the perspective of a thinking man's decisions, which is an insult to me and to the end, but at least one camera-Man, which was clearly a haiparabhentilim kangaru. Oh well, and if you do not completely close your brain (see this is not in the premises) then you will know who and what is the highest and what is after. 30 minutes, because you know any scene after the first. That is thrilling. Thrilling because this movie thinks you can tell in the future. <br /> <br /> The following line: This is the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I've seen many horrific films which were bad at least in some way or bad copy of another movie. However, the resurrection is a good example of how successful every aspect is. It was so bad that after being frustrated with its low quality at EV-E-RE-HHNNG, I laugh more often than any recent comedy, because I'm the crew We were impressed to publish such extraordinary-film stripts expressing greatness. The best thing for Lambert was in the Highlander: after one year, the endgame, thus, can be forgiven him. ; ^ And <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I recommend watching this movie for everyone. Finally, we found it very fun to see: ^ D. I guarantee you, you have seen the resurrection completely (be brave, you can do it!), You will worship the level of acting on a given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Or just go once more to the mountain mountain mountains ... what I'm going to do.
