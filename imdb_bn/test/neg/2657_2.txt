Why are such "romantic" movies that really do not go anywhere, always with Crappie jazz (and perhaps last)? It's not tricky and it looks like a bloody TV-movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and strange, but it seems to be just a crawling, Mumbai Police. Everything from Congress's women's house was good to walk, when she behaved like a bother - looked very impressive in Thomas, never bothered to talk. <br /> <br /> And why do they always become British? Actors pronounce ugly - they are famous because they are famous, and everyone knows they are British because they are famous!
