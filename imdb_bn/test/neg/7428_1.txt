I got this thing from sci-fi shelf because when I was young I saw the first of the series. I was the second rental and it was a decent "B" Sci-Fi. This one was objectionable right. "Special" effect on the car may be something like my 4 year old cousin. Two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally crashed when I came to the screen. The plot became so sick that it made me sick. I do not know what someone was thinking when I agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they did a better job of releasing it in 2 movies. This series movie is going from decent to terrible to terrible. I hope no terrorist group will be able to access this movie because it creates a great torture machine.
