Oh boy, oh boy! This movie is something for lovers of "real" synthetic industry. It really does not have any sense at all. This is totally annoying, especially because of "anti-climax". All people are weird, and behave more than unrealistic. Sometimes it seems like sitting in a theater, because in the dialogue, the actors face each other instead of the camera (and therefore the audience). As I said earlier, if you are in more casual movies then you have been shown in cancer - go for it. If you're not, leave this movie alone, because you'll be frustrated and eventually know that you've lost your time - just like I did. Two thumbs down ...: - (((
