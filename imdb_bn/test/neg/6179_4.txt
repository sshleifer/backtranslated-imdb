So, as far as I collect, how this episode is trying to give a statement about the real life villains, very bad people, and it is very scary as usual. The "unusual" figure related to Villen, Daniele is completely symbolic. He is really a normal man. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I do not buy it. Donnie is not simply scarier than unusual. She is not that awesome too A man who feels confused and weird, likes dead girls and hair, and has just become a new murderer, he is significantly less annoying than the most famous real-life serial killers (for example: he is very water-loving) Ed Gen Edition). As a result, Scully's horror (not unlike any normal personal hygiene routine) is seen entirely outside the character except in addition to killing or injuring anyone. He sees hundreds of bad and least flinches in almost all other episodes. <br /> <br /> So, comic book says to sing ... "The worst part of all times!"
