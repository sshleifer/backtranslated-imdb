Chronicia de Ozununo combines the worst mistakes in Mexican movies, nowadays it is a rare achievement. It's disrespectful: it wants us to have deep faith that it is deep, just because of some scenes, the other is pseudoscopic, but another play with the tradition of laugh-crying eyes Eisenstein-Infant-Kaifen, the version It's broken and it's all too serious. <br /> <br /> It has a weak script: the main story is rarely developed, so it has three small, unreasonable stories, it's stuck. They are good for ending the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. A true feat, remember that most known Mexican actors are cast. <br /> <br /> The unwanted fool language is an abuse. The role of the character of Paloma, which symbolizes the child's dream of independence, uses it altogether. <br /> <br /> This is Homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palmo is the greatest, and most punished, one-quarterly presentation I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is very annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sounds: "Para Party La Madre, Nada Como Non Mal Pelikula"
