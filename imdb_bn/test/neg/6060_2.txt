I think this movie might be some level of value, and sitting through the whole thing. I said it is leaving a bad taste in my face and saying. <br /> <br /> The movie is okay, I think Herak's primary character is true of mythological stories. As both children and a young adult he is not superb but strong bright bulbs. But later he turned everyone into a charity speaker anyway. is not it? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI Satyr look okay, but the rest of the critters are just terrible, especially heart, looking for the most phoniest looking animal in the movie. And how is Lley Soobsky skin sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone needs to cry it - Hercules's twelve labor. Because the producers probably did not want to cover them all; Maybe they thought that this garbage observer could make the primary screw-head count higher than that. Instead of Harakulis's double laborer, we got five laboratories of Hercules. Yes, five workers! WTF?!? Finally he did not finish, so actually 4 1/2 workers! Just terrible I'll take Hercules: This legendary journey to the forehead on any day of the week.
