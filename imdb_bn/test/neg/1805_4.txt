In a sense, this movie does not even compare compared to the novel. However, if you were not good to imagine reading how the Congo looked and how good it was to see what natives were. I will not recommend reading movies instead of reading books. I rarely recommend this film, based on this literary work, without any other film alone. This movie; And many others, this book is not full. An important part of the missing movie is the idea that Africa's lack of Africa is creating a preliminary genocide. Also in the film, Marlowe and his companions did not stop and received notes and wood. Likewise, Cartz beat Marlowe at the end of African-owned story, which had a major impact on the story, but the book was not in the book. In the novel, Cartage died on the ship, but he died in the film. Mother language reactions are different from the interpretation of Marto's last words. If you want to imagine the novel more clearly then this movie is only effective.
