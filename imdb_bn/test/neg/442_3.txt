I was a fan of America's Voorheil in the London film, and so after 16 years the successor can be queued with the French language and local reinstateurs, supporters, and minor characters. Tonight I saw the "Edited for Fox Network" version which was a hybrid of several hyperactive Seagels enthusiasts. Screenliters and directors pay tribute to the idea of ​​the main plot: Tourists woke the wolf, the full moon goes out, the boy fills the boy, the boy becomes the beast, the boy emanates after the help from the ghost victim. For me, this "formula" had a strange effect on teenage horror, the interest of the school teacher-boyfriend's TV comedy "ed", who is one of the innocents of Veruel's, who are less or completely disrespectful. The script lines they handed him. I saw another horror-flick that this film is "growing" (a title of a purple war title in the head), but I think its part of the plotline is definitely how Villain Survival (they are stupid) is a great addition to the "good" A Paris subway train, a la Speed ​​has a final conflict. The 1997 studio product is a weird hybrid because of the most technological effects shown to be dangerous, but in fact, my fears of real horror have completely diminished. Variant legend and a strange rewrite of "movies-myths" !!! My suggestion to consider in the video store - instead of a classic "Line Top" thriller go: PsyCHO of Alfred Hitchcock!
