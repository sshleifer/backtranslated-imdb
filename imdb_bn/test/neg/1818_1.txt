This series continues to frustrate and annoyed. How are they going to pull this for another year? Every episode asks for a lot more questions, while giving very little answers. To quote another popular website, I believe that this event has thrown sharks now! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Are they able to keep the showers in the air? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The back still did not walk with a knife? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br!
