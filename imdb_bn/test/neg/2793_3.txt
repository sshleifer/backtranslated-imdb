All right, I'm sorry for Castro and Crooke for this review, but this film is still the worst seen ... First off, acting was okay. It may be better (especially in some parts), but it's "OK". Then, there were the cheapest video cameras (which they used to). The violence was quite good. If it is fast packed it will be great, but they (* sigh *) ... were not awesome. Scares were good writing (scripts), but not good. For example ... (here's a spinner!) Loft, a girl is half way and half in the dark, at the bottom of the burn house, then she gets. The giant yanks down to her and then you ripped out to hear someones guts. Scares might be better if music is not ripped to a cheap horror CD. The effects of blood were very good, but the blood was like "bill bills". K.B. It pulled off, because it was like the old Kung Fu movies, but when the crew can not tell the difference between red and pink ... it is sad. Filmmaking was good in film, but scracro clothing was going to see the 25 rupees in Halloween store. Do not fool the cover fool, dress up! My overall grade is a 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, you are easily satisfied or have a hole in your pocket for 3 rupees, go to Blockbuster and check the horrors of failure.
