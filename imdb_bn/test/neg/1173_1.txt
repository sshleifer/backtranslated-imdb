I did a review for this director's fictional entertainment about BT. I saw this movie and it was terrible. Save your money and time. This movie was terrible and this director is untalented. I do not understand how funding this movie. They are awesome I decided to confirm that I have tested the writer, director and producer, and if this directive is popped up then I will not waste my money. There is nothing worse than renting a film on Friday night, making popcorn, and then you realize that you are cheated by the creative industry in front of the movie box. stay away. So guess I should put some things up to the line? I've always checked IMDb to review, but I think I'll never do it. This is ridiculous. I have amended my reviews more often. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
