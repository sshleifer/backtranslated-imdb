Final Draft - A screenwriter (James van der Vivek) has locked himself in his apartment and encouraged psychologists to write horror scripts. Not a terrible court, but the execution is horrific. It seems like a first-year direction and writing work, and perhaps. The director cut everything out to hell. It is meant to be unnecessary. Is it boring? The small parts of the film that are so small are inappropriate. The hypothesis is hypothetical, and it does not follow the proposed ideas (orange bags). It seems that they had ended the time and put together for the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This image is not the jaw, "O my God, it is so bad that it is good". It's boring bad and after long bothers you. James van der Baker is not a terrible actor, and limits the ship to the water. But he is very normal for the kind of psychology he is trying to offer. He is simply a retractable person who one day sees man and performs a few hallucinations, then he decides to work gently with distraction. Reasons to follow. Maybe there is some water.
