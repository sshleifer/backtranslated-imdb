Routine SF stories have a makings here of somewhere decent. It is wasted by a variety of reasons. First, the actors are just awful. Even the appropriate actors are awful The dialogue is wooded and stilted. Plot predictably plods along. The actor seems less like a finished movie than it is running through a walk. Very frustrating.
