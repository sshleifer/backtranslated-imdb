At that time my boss and our office showed it in a Halloween party. He co-wrote and acted in Chris Huntley. He knows it's bad, we know it bad and we all agree that the monster shows mechanical incidents like a cell. Maybe it was a mistake from a gynocological test. <br /> <br /> It was a very low budget and the actor had all friends so here's what you have "O gang, let's do a show" <br /> <br /> <br /> No one was hurt and This was the first attempt. Nothing wrong with that It has made us all smile well and it's a great movie to watch and have fun with friends. :-)
