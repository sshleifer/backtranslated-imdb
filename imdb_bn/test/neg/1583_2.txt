Okay, what was this story again? I am afraid that I can never read the book again, this was the most confusing movie that I have tried to look for a long time. I'm a little confused about the number of flashbacks with nurse, patient and no thumbs people. The film did not really explain what they are looking for in the desert until they find out; Even on earth, they all wanted to know each other. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie "Pride and Prejudice" recently with Colin Firth, I try to do a research on her film career. "What a girl wants" other than his movie, and bluntly watching, I was not that much of the game where he was playing well. I'm not clearly saying that he was not good. He was one of the best actors in modern day movies, but he has many choices for the content and quality of films he has played. <br /> <br /> Another English director, author, writer, and crew are very close to their point of view, where the audience is not getting the perfect example? Literally. The whole film was shown as a dramatic actor Raffeph Fiennes, who was passionate for a long time. Truly nothing is explained and everyone seems to need a psychologist to evaluate from the beginning! <br /> <br /> <br /> The character of Christine Scott Thomas completely describes the story of the boy standing in front of the male audience and enjoys heading other men than her husband. Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not have to be a morbid person in her place and she is considered a secret agent? I guess; And Ralph Fiennes is walking like Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!), Who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is throwing four winds (pun intended) as the conspiracy wanders on. <br /> <br /> Another misleading element that leaves visitors with an unnecessary taste associated with the mental stability of the nurses (Juliet Binoche) and its purpose and associated with Neo Andrews. But how are the viewers still in the world? The first two letters of the world (Thomas and Phayenas) are the first time to have sex. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no build up Just a slap, left, thank you! <br /> <br /> And is not romantic that Phoenix ended a betrayer helping the Germans with a map in the desert? (Circus) <br /> <br /> To describe this movie, I just have to say, "How do you affect your mammogram with your gynecologist and cheat your sweet, loving husband?" <br /> <br /> The final unbelievable part of this plot is to understand how to choose Ralph Fienens on Colin Firth. Firth had very little chance to show his acting talent ?? Actually, when watching the movie, I think it might be its first course. The scene where he was waiting for his wife all night, was probably two second clips that could be seen in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said She is very bad, Miss! It could save an additional twenty minutes of more detailed pictures. The Ariel Desert scene was quite clean, though.
