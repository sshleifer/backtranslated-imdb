I understand that my summary line is not very religious. <br /> <br /> This picture was written and directed by Scott Kahn and played Geovani Ribbisi, Don Chadle and scored herself 88 minutes long. <br /> <br /> This puppy has a dog in a movie, she is intelligent. <br /> <br /> The photo was opened in the United States Theater at the end of April 2007, for a week and earning $ 914. It went quickly, in August 2006, in DVD. <br /> <br /> We could take only 40 minutes before closing the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is the type of movie that played the lower half of the double bill. You watched the main movie and have been portrayed that it looks like you've gone out before closing it. <br /> <br /> 3 actresses and young women of this movie have done well and have qualified. More than <br /> Rating: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDB 4 (in 10_)
