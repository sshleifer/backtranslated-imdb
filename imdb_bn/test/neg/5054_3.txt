This unreasonable movie was "goody-to-shoe", the teen-girl really wanted to be Validicorian, but the teacher's name was found in her tie with Mrs Tingle. Katie Holles enjoys "the biggest conflict in her teenage life" while playing this "goody-to-shoe", when her classmate helps the youngster experiment with the final test sample as well as Mrs Tingle's test. When Mrs. Tingle comes along, Hollus holds her best friend with classmate and her final exam samples. Here's a plan to cheat three exams, Mrs Tingle has once again got the chance to destroy Holcz and encourage everyone to complain that there is no chance of Holce in his class. And the classmate, who has apparently watched Holmes, is surprised why he will never give him a day (he is stupid)? Suddenly, Hollis and his friends went to Tigla in the middle of the night and believed that Holes planned to cheat. The classmate pointed out a bow and arrows in Mrs Tingle when it suddenly got fired, Holus threatened to fix things for him. Mrs. Tingle fought again but eventually Holus and her friend were eliminated as prisoners. <br /> <br /> During Mrs Tingl's captivity under Holles, they do everything to keep her tied and blackmail her with her own bed. False pictures of Mrs. Tingle were presented in bed with unconscious coaches. When the children were eating their own food while sitting in Mrs Tingl's house and doing their own personal work, I cried myself. At one stage, Holes received Mrs. Tingle's grade book and deliberately changed her grade, making her reduce the grade of challenge for Valedictorian. At the beginning of the film, the end of the game ended with the efforts of a child to bring at least comedy, which resolved on pure rebellion, crystals and irrationality. <br /> <br /> It is the most impossible and will be evil naughty. Charter Holmes will never play in his entire life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle be free to dig out the grave for Homes. She was impressive, selfish and conniving. Despite his extraordinary interest to his classmate, he was asleep with classmates ... and he did not like him. By trying to destroy Mrs. Tingle's grade book by the people of her best friend, trying to destroy her classmates, you think that she will be able to finally get her qualification, right? Unfortunately, he has got everything his heart's desire, which is shown to be wicked, captivating, selfish and intelligent you can get whatever you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was estimated to be the character you did not like. Once upon a time, they do not believe that he was the woman who needed to teach this lesson. He was like all other tough teachers, who gave legitimate reasons for his dissatisfaction over the next generation. Personally, I felt that his opinion about young people was verified every time by the action of homer and his friend. I was optimistic that he could call the police and make Holles mimic. They lock her in bed, eat her food like a pig, drink alcohol, drink her own personal belongings, and we believe she can not take a bat in each of them. Head? And the classmate must be one of the most disliked characters in the history of the film. Forget the fool, he needs a new word that is not available in the Webster dictionary. He brought the main problem of life to Holme, then he entered Mrs. Tingle's house, unbeknownst to Homes, and Mrs. Tingle gave an arrow and arrow in the corner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seeing this strange, playful, unintentional film silent, and the wrong thing could get him or her world.
