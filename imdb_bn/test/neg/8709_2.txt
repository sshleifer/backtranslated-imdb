I had high hopes for this movie, and even gave up a night watching the stargate for this movie. I had a rushed feel about it and the original biblical moment and many of the events were missing. I could have been a little distraught and humiliated in the 1956 edition, because I have seen such a person for the last 20 years. I doubt this will be the annual classic reign, as one of the one to do this. If you have not seen the 19546 version, you may like it, but I doubt it seriously and ask you to avoid it and to rent or buy a classic one. There are some nifty special effects in it, but I do not see what I see while saying a movie like ten commands. I was very interested to see how I told the story, and the author did not do such a good job.
