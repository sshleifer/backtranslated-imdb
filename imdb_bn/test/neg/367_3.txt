I'm very frustrated. After waiting for 3 years to repeat / DVD of the original masterpiece series "DarkPlace" I could not wait for this series. The first episode ended and I'm sorry. Everything that's great about darkplace has been removed here, quite a lot. The worst part: the canned smile. It takes away its original point and renders it almost unwantedly. (There was a joke about the eyes of the respected guratha ... I can hardly remember the rest ...) It is like a neutral quality, "recognize me, tell you". Hope this improves as I go into this series, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. Go back to "DarkPlace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the greatest compassionate man of all time and I know God ..."
