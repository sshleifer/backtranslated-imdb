* The spoilers ahead, but do not matter, I hope you will not see this one <br /> <br /> If you plan to see it, you have to be strongly advised. Because I was the worst of 1Â½ hours of this experience. <br /> <br /> First, the full impression of this great movie "Battle Royale". It is stupid to show a haircut American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Cameras". <br /> <br /> This plot is perfectly expected. A competitor is pregnant and another nurse, while some consider some logical thinking and start to understand what should happen among them. <br /> <br /> This concept has been mentioned earlier and there is a lack of violence required to create the film. Enjoyable I mean, the Prego people have backed backs, no blood, no traces of back injury. <br /> <br /> I can go on forever without any good about it, so take your money <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, almost scrum 3 makes a masterpiece ..
