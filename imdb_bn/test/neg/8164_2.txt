I love movies, all generators, and big dollar glasses from small indie projects. But this section of Junk is 25 years old and even in the 1950's, it is facing its fake allowance, even with almost the attitude, through which we judge films. <br /> <br /> Throughout this film, I was reminded that there were a number of "Student Films", where I had the opportunity to try, where effort required creativity to fill the gap where funds are required. <br /> <br /> I told all, you have a lot of good use for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> 2/10
