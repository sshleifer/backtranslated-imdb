Plots Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Criminals are controlled by core trackers, and Android killers sent by the United States Computerized Judicial System to prosecute offenders Secret Service agent Eric Phillips, his boss, Senator Robert Deli (who established the USSJS), a group of anti machine activists, prevented the attack by the Union for Human Rights. Deli tried to launch Philips on his personal circle, but after running testimony of a UHR agent in the cold blood of the de-assassination of the AI, he ran the SS agent. Dilly sends the core tracker afterwards. Philips joins the UHR Group and helps expose a conspiracy involved in the deal. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" Richard Pepin's director, most of Cyber ​​Tracker's co-founders of the first major entertainment company , A Powerhouse of Action Films in the 1990s Other Pepin Films include "Hologom Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" and "Dark Bread". Peppin films usually start with a main action sequence which will last approximately 10 minutes before allowing to enter the plot. Does the script of this movie contain some intriguing holes? It is not clear if the hero is really trying to stop the conspiracy. As acting, Don "Dragon" Don Wilson could be difficult but could not work for beans, with little charisma. His co-stars are very good. The movie's best-paid scene is a visual scene, something fascinating artillery fire, a huge athletics and not one, but in three moments where an airplane flies in the air, flips and hits the ground, explodes. The visual effect on cheap side borders and musical score is low-key and fork.
