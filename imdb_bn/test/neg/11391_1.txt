This is a terrific remake of French movie ma vn n ros (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/) The only scene that I can imagine is that anybody (senias?! Bets?! Butler?! They're thinking of what!) Agreed to join Maclain's original, impressed with the right way and a credit for a friend - or talent! - for his name) to translate the theme for American audiences - both of them are stupid, stupid, stupid. Then he listed other friends to sign up, and they did it as a friend - definitely not on the fitness of all-but-kitchen-scripts, this background. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of French cinematic fan, but mother VN Rose is a delicate, thoughtful and worrisome treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I'd see it wider exposure in English-speaking audiences - and if it means to recreate an American, be so. But Poo-lease! Little respect for topics and audience intelligence - and a better way for actors, who can not determine whether Tennessee is working for Williams or Jerry Lewis!
