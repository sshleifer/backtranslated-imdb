This event was all up-to-date and a lot of hype was a lot up there. Now it's easy to explain why it did not meet the expectations: First, this show imagines the world in a ragat and failed to create a realistic world of pre-teenagers as a way to imagine kids. Secondly, the characters of the show are stereo-typos (Angelica: white color girl opposing white color: Normal family color girl ...) or annoying (Tommy, Chuckie) and boring (heart). Finally, there is not one ounce of innovation or an original plot line. Collectively, it is a bad idea for a cereal series to waste time all-grown up and in a show like crazy. This is annoying, lack of imagination and it seems that even 10 to 13 years of age the producers do not even know. To be correct, Angelica and Suzy should not compare to Brazil's size, but who is better to work for someone?
