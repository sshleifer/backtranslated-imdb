Everyone has already commented on the obvious truth that the first few comments were definitely from people who had film partnerships, or there were friends / family of those who were part of the film, and all right - if I had made a movie, all my It will be complimentary to family and friends there. All honesty, this movie has some good things alongside bad things. Unfortunately, bad things are a lot better. Well: The overall plot was silently interesting. Music was fairly good. Several songs (when you can listen to them) were actually quite cool. My only music theme was: # 1) With some sort of calm protection in the first suspense scene (it was really moving away from the mystery), # 2) When the main characters of the song went to the outdoor party, the song was playing on a friend's house and # 3) the songs were very good It was, especially when heavy heavy metal was playing in the background, then Danny Trazzo hanged a guy (sounds like a beautiful song, but it did When Danny Trejo froggy feet across syata was received). Now for the bad stuff: The script was violent. I mean, horrible. I've seen smooth dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Writing authors a part-time writer and full-time movie buff: When you write a dialogue, ask yourself, "Is that really what people would say?" Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to perform slam, but with that type of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent. The brutally intriguing plot was frustrated by the serious dialogue. I know it was low budget, but the money does not cost money - if you have a good script, even semi-capable actors can pull it. None of this movie seems to have been there, but hopefully the director will get a second shot to make a better film.
