***** Spieler or two, it does not matter ****** <br /> <br /> There are two topics about this movie. Firstly it is titled "Bruno" and "The Dress Code" and if you have seen this movie you will get ridicule in it. <br /> <br /> It is a complete solution to the wall. Cross-drasher campaign in grade school is not something that was not needed to cry about a movie, and a subject that I think most people will be interested in. Sheryl McLeane led to Bruno's wishes to walk on issues related to sex. Wearing religion in clothes, which could possibly lead to the spread of pungent insect-cancer - what was he thinking? Yes, there are some humor and it is not directly objectionable, but at the beginning the trend of uncomfortable feeling is increasing. It does not do much without the repeated repetition of the liberist that no matter what "different" people (or otherwise should be excluded) should be accepted? <br /> <br /> Which is beautiful ---- But to live in society, everyone has to give something to go along. Bruno just does not want to wear clothes, she wants to show the look like a tiny gladdis knight on the night, and its final costume makes him a cabbage patch similar to Cowgirl doll. Yet all the other kids' dresses and behaviors, well, like regular kids. So what gives? If it comes down, then we can all declare ourselves as special or different and we can behave as we felt, and the result may be total disorder. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Only he took him as "Bruno" is a stupid movie, and a complete waste of time.
