Well, hero and terrorism in my opinion is a little less than the average. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and has taken some butt in this movie, but it is slowly and in my opinion, for most farewells, I think Steve James does a good job. Like my friend Ra'anan, instead of following Monokoth's girlfriend, Saikopith chose to go to the theater at the end of the film. Until, the killer killed only women. Oh, well, I guess as it was not possible to think about. Definitly you can pass in a film.
