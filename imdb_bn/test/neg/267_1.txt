What can I say about twelve ocean? Who would think that it will ever come? A giant mess that can not lose half and retrace itself. I was really surprised at how bad this really was. Really! I did not see it in the end because this picture is simply impossible. I'm a huge fan first but for a sequel it's a long excuse. <br /> <br /> If they were going to return the money, what a surprise? The film is just boring and so drag me that I will never be able to sit like that. It's really bad. Just stay away from this movie, as far away, repeat, having. It is worthless
