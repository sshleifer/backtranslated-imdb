Hammm, Shaw Brothers are not the original patches. War is average and looks very clunky. The story line will be expected from Kung Fu film of 70, confusing and boom. Stupid voices for men, dubbed in posh English accents for men. I turned off soon and I love martial arts flicks. Compare the original movie, this is better than the average movie, do not make a fool, I bought the movie Brother Brothers for the wrong picture I wanted. I just started to comment, I'm only working in foreign and martial arts, at the beginning of my film collection, I personally own modern martial arts. Hope you do not waste time visiting this one, it's only for hard fans of Kung Fu 70's.
