Actually I love Lucie ... Humorous talent Yes ... I have ever ... he was ridiculous like a mam ... as was the film adaptation of Yeh Bohnhoud's Divine Secrets. Both just missed the whole point. Roslind Russell was, always and only to be the first. Perhaps as a young starlet, the ball can draw such a role, where his intrinsic beauty and young man could take him ... but he tried to look after an elderly star that he was still effective in the field. Because Russell's version was a lot of supporters (because you can not improve on the core), Russell had a presence, he exploited every scene, but Lucille could also be the model of the mam's wallpaper. He has all the attention of the role commands.
