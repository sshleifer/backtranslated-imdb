Well, dude, where my car might be at least an innovation, which is one of the few Hollywood movies that seems to be less than a day writing, casting, shooting and editing. I can not honestly believe that it was created (or I allowed my friends to sit with me on the whole thing). Humor is very stupid and supposed to be "stupid", and the involved actors do not think that they will be able to draw such kind of funny stuff that the script actually provides it. At the peak stage, in contrast to most stupid slopstick comedies, this movie actually has a lot of plots - each scene represents a new Moroccan and unwanted sub-plot. Of course, they were going for a fool, but it did not work on any level ... I only enjoyed one aspect of this movie: Abortion from the old Nicholodian show "Salute your shorts" has a very small role. This role will make him the next Richard Cure, but you will only see ...
