The first 20 minutes was a little fun because I did not think that the picture looked bad before {acting, script, impact (!), Etc.) ... the rest of the time started dragging forever. Each cliche used in the dialog no effect. These people do not like making horror films or how to make them or any other movie. There is no adult language, there is little nudity, and no open wounds, except for open blood, etc. are not dried. It has been rated PG in today's decade and PG-13 in today's decade. I'm not sure how it got a longer rating or if it really is. I saw the American International Liberation War Title Hospital. In the last 12 months I have seen 100 horror films and this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here's how bad it is: Here's a scene where someone comes through the door. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be, but what's on the screen is that some children's green carrion screenings (I'm not exaggerated), super-produced on the film, half-moving inside the door, then there's something I can do about nursery Sherri. I could not believe I had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.
