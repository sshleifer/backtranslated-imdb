In the geologic situation, at one time, director Harry Ralston gave us the most post-apocalyptic glimpse of the world's dead, on the streets, in shops, and throughout the entire landscape, in the middle of the forgotten wilderness. The only survivor, trying to revive his sanity, took food from the city in his bungalow in this desert. Alone alone, he expects more, but almost none, he has left with white underwear, and passion for a local Indian tribe ?? Until a camera is discovered, it opens a new door and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Allan, a man in the book, has gone to Earth after an unknown catastrophe. He thought alone, did he start his way to life ?? Until, Jeremy Ryan appeared (as if he was in a dream), out of the jungle, final, and dissatisfied to live the final man ... well ... like allan. However, they try to become co-existent, failed, drunk and before they make the final antistopheus, they play in Redneck Raffaele (new expatriate? Dan Montgomery Jr.). The war torn, the confusion set, a couple becomes a third wheel, and physically disabled versus the war between the witless joke. Even the world did not give it up, it has become a reality that even the darkness of human nature will be raised. <br /> <br /> Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a middle story based on one of the biggest films. Quiet Earth "(which I will look next to) is weird which he never gives to any credit. With a stretched story, I guess that he repeats it a decent job. He is trying to try his own search again from another film director's tactics. He opens up an interesting picture, but direct Sure, the final day has arrived, but this short few surviving "why" or "good" can still be a short answer as "good" or better. A fantastic start is to strengthen us into a ridiculous film The lead was a joke like "Shawon of the Dead", but instead we felt that we were watching the "created-tv" program. Because of that hearing, I paid tribute to Ralston because he worked hard to produce this film and his passion almost sells this film, but you can tell from his interaction with Caste that he is his overall final product. Was wrong, he had fixed that and the other that he was ashamed to faint. Although it makes it suitable for the production of independent films, it sometimes feels cheaper and it is next to Ralston. <br /> <br /> I must admit, David Oranat's screenplay of Alan has blocked me. He played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. He was both fun to watch and hear, and thus he became sympathetic to the audience. He was an important player in keeping the film together, alas, I can not say the same for everyone else. This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and was it clear ?? I mean ?? Really really obvious. There was a scene where I thought that the cue card would come out and read lines for it, probably giving us more realistic performance, but was not a disappointment. Then there was Jerry Ryan. He pulled his character at the end of the film, which was the result of the end of the whole industry, to me. She finally goes from bizarre cranky insane girlfriend to weird strangely. Confused? Again, she eventually fell into character, which gave her only a glimpse of what she could possibly do as a mature woman. Even the commentary was like progress, the contribution that he had contributed to is smiling, gigolole, or "oh, look at that color" moment. Although her beauty can sell tickets, a knowledge can only be considered as knowledge. This is his first film, so can I be too harsh? <br /> <br /> Overall, this image felt like it lost something. Even though the concept was strong ?? Human beings still exist with the only chillies of the rest of the world. Jealousy can not be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps it is eaten by genes?) And we do not want to be as a nation which we always get. Ralston is not a wonderful director, his tactics are faulty and pre-practical, but he knows to make low budget comedy. I think the "funny" we think is different, so I did not find myself smiling at most often finding "violent". His actor provided the acting level for this film, which was less than the average. His film was loose, which meant that the elements were not quite explained or tackled (ie living with the wings?!?), Which would damage the intensity of the film as a whole. It was a comedy, but it was much darker and much more fun. Those Roger Everi were a huge part of the film to think about them, as we learned from their commentary, so he was there for money ?? The bank was originally meant for "The Last Man". Do not get your hope for any classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Do not expect more from Ralston ?? And how do I end it <br /> <br /> Grade: ** ***** Outside
