When you see less budget horror movies as much as I see, you can tell who was involved in making the film, as each filmmaker adds his own smell to the cheese. Case with Jack-like When I saw this real horror movie, I was with a strange feeling that Fred O'Neill was involved in Ray, perhaps not as a director, in some fashion and as I did the research, I saw that I was right. Just Fred and another hammer could write some of these sad, and this movie just reeked Fred O'Neill again. You do not like Fred Aulen Roy (and God only knows why anyone will avoid this movie). If you're going to rent Ray Picture, rent Hollywood Chuckers Hawker, it's Alan Ray's dark cheese, the only bright burning star in the universe.
