I must say that I was excited about this image before it was produced by Adam Sandler's "Happy Madison" and I usually attracted such stupid humor. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting moments at the beginning of the film, but there is no content in this film that makes a good film. I understand that many filmstets may not be realistic yet still funny, but this movie was unreal and not funny. Acting was terrible, cinematography was very poor, the plot did not understand at all. I can not work for these three dedicated women and even poor writers. Overall, I was very disgusted with this film and I did not recommend to allocate 5 taka for rent.
