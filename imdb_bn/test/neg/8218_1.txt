The movie starts with a lot of voice-over, a bad sign. Then it slides downhill with stupid and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and Indians. However, when it encounters each other in a new Alpine Medo, the mountain men's square dance reaches new and impressive low. Meanwhile, happy-lucky Indians sit around them. It is a good view than the coworkers dance in "Burning Saddles". There is a minor error compared to this; "Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
