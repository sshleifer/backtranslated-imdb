Some of the better changes (special effects are more broad), for some bad (Scott Grimes, a favorite child of origin, has become a painful teenager), but usually this signals are similar to the main - which is not much to say. PG-13 rating is doubtful; Although the film is not terrible, there are some brief but quite explicit songs and some outside nudity. (* 1/2)
